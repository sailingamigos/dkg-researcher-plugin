In the past, most work in computational linguistics tended to focus on purely symbolic methods. Recently, more and more work is shifting toward hybrid methods that combine new empirical corpus-based methods, including the use of probabilistic and information-theoretic techniques, with traditional symbolic methods. This work is made possible by the recent availability of linguistic databases that add rich linguistic annotation to corpora of natural language text. Already, these methods have led to a dramatic improvement in the performance of a variety of NLP systems with similar improvement likely in the coming years. This paper focuses on these trends, surveying in particular three areas of recent progress: part-of-speech tagging, stochastic parsing, and lexical semantics.",

            "abstract": "In the past few years, the computational linguistics research community has begun to wrestle with the problem of how to evaluate its progress in developing natural language processing systems. With the exception of natural language interfaces, there are few working systems in existence, and they tend to focus on very different tasks using equally different techniques. There has been little agreement in the field about training sets and test sets, or about clearly defined subsets of problems that constitute standards for different levels of performance. Even those groups that have attempted a measure of self-evaluation have often been reduced to discussing a system's performance in isolation---comparing its current performance to its previous performance rather than to another system. As this technology begins to move slowly into the marketplace, the lack of useful evaluation techniques is becoming more and more painfully obvious. In order to make progress in the difficult area of natural language evaluation, a Workshop on the Evaluation of Natural Language Processing Systems was held on December 7-9, 1988 at the Wayne Hotel in Wayne, Pennsylvania. The workshop was organized by Martha Palmer (Unisys), assisted by a program committee consisting of Beth Sundheim (NOSC), Ed Hovy (ISI), Tim Finin (Unisys), Lynn Bates (BBN), and Mitch Marcus (Pennsylvania). Approximately 50 people participated, drawn from universities, industry, and government. The workshop received the generous support of the Rome Air Defense Center, the Association of Computational Linguistics, the American Association of Artificial Intelligence, and Unisys Defense Systems. The workshop was organized along two basic premises. First, it should be possible to discuss system evaluation in general without having to state whether the purpose of the system is \"question-answering\" or \"text processing.\" Evaluating a system requires the definition of an application task in terms of input/output pairs that are equally applicable to question-answering, text processing, or generation. Second, there are two basic types of evaluation, black-box evaluation, which measures system performance on a given task in terms of well-defined input/output pairs, and glassbox evaluation, which examines the internal workings of the system. For example, glass-box performance evaluation for a system that is supposed to perform semantic and pragmatic analysis should include the examination of predicate-argument relations, referents, and temporal and causal relations. Since there are many different stages of development that a natural language system passes through before it is in a state where black-box evaluation is even possible (see Figure 1), glass-box evaluation plays an especially important role in guiding the development at early stages. With these premises in mind, the workshop was structured around the following three sessions: (i) defining the notions of \"black-box evaluat ion\" and \"glass-box evaluation\" and exploring their utility; (ii) defining criteria for \"black-box evaluation\"; and (iii) defining criteria for \"glass-box evaluation.\" It was hoped that the workshop would shed light on the following questions.",

            "abstract": "In 2005, the Human Language Technology Conference (HLT) and the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) were held together as a joint conference for the first time. The conference was co-sponsored by the organization traditionally behind HLT, the Human Language Technology Advisory Board, and the organization traditionally behind EMNLP, SIGDAT: The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Special Interest Group on linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to natural-language processing. The joint conference was held in Vancouver, B.C., Canada on October 6--8, co-located with the 2005 Document Understanding Conference (DUC) and the 9th International Workshop on Parsing Technologies (IWPT).In the HLT tradition, the conference especially encouraged submissions involving synergistic combinations of language technologies from the sometimes disjoint areas of natural-language processing, speech processing, and information retrieval. To encourage such cross-fertilization, each of the major chair positions were filled by three people, one from each of these research areas.",

One promising methodology for such studies is monitoring eye movements as speakers and listeners perform natural tasks. Three lines of research that adopt this approach are reviewed: (i) spoken word recognition in continuous speech, (ii) reference resolution in real-world contexts, and (iii) real-time language processing in interactive conversation. In each domain, results emerge that provide insights which would otherwise be difficult to obtain. These results extend and, in some cases, challenge standard assumptions about language processing.",

            "abstract": "With the growing popularity of statistical approaches to natural language processing, it is natural to consider how connectionist techniques for learning and using soft constraints might be applicable to this area. However, nagging questions about the representational and computational adequacy of connectionist networks for processing language make the fruitfulness of this endeavor uncertain. This book addresses both these issues. It contains background and overview sections by the editors, plus 13 chapters covering a broad spectrum of recent work involving connectionist models and natural language processing. Each chapter can be read on its own, or the book can be read in its entirety. A casual familiarity with connectionist networks is adequate for understanding most of the book. The book begins with an introductory chapter that includes some background about connectionist natural language processing and an overview of the other chapters. Many references are given to earlier work, and the discussion provides a good context for the more recent work presented in the book. The remaining chapters are organized into four sections: semantics, syntax, representational adequacy, and computational psycholinguistics. Each section has its own introduction, plus chapters written by researchers in the area. The section on connectionist approaches to semantics includes four chapters that range from lexical semantic representations to \"story comprehension.\" In Chapter 2, Dyer, Flowers, and Wang propose a connectionist architecture for learning representations for symbols by training on the relationships between the symbols. They apply this method to encoding semantic networks using one symbol per semantic node. In Chapter 3, Sutcliffe argues for representing word meanings using an unstructured set of semantically interpretable features with associated \"centrality\" values. This representation is uniform across words and provides a simple measure of the distance between two concepts. Wermter and Lehnert address the issue of disambiguating PP attachment in noun phrases using semantic information. They train one set of networks to produce plausibility values for individual attachments and use a constraint satisfaction network to combine these preferences with structural constraints to determine the best set of attachments. St. John and McClelland apply connectionist learning techniques and a constraint satisfaction network to a variety of tasks involving semantic preferences. They demonstrate the usefulness of these techniques for some problems, but their claim that no additional mechanisms are needed for sentence and story comprehension is not substantiated. The section on syntax contains two chapters that use hand-structured networks to implement symbolic grammars of the familiar kind. In Chapter 6, Rager addresses parsing and correcting extragrammatical input. Individual constraints are represented in constraint satisfaction (winner-take-all) subnetworks, and in the event of an in-",

The growing need to integrate large divergent bodies of knowledge in natural language processing applications, or the belief that massively parallel systems are the only ones capable of handling the complexities and subtleties of natural language, are just two examples of the reasons for this increasing interest. This volume offers 13 contributions by scientists from the fields of computer, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics. The chapters provide an extensive introduction to the field, as well as articles that deal with both coarse-grained (symbolic) and fine-grained (connectionist) approaches. Along another axis, theoretical and methodological, as well as empirical and implementational issues are treated, and both language analysis and language generation are covered.",

Natural language, whether spoken, written, or typed, is the most natural means of communication between humans, and the mode of expression of choice for most of the documents they produce. As computers play a larger role in the preparation, acquisition, transmission, monitoring, storage, analysis, and transformation of information, endowing them with the ability to understand and generate information expressed in natural languages becomes more and more necessary. Some tasks currently performed by humans cannot be automated without endowing computers with natural language processing capabilities, and these provide two major challenges to NLP systems:1. Reading and writing text, applied to tasks such as message routing, abstracting, monitoring, summarizing, and entering information in databases, with applications, in such areas as intelligence, logistics, office automation, and libraries. Computers should be able to assimilate and compose extended communications.2. Translation, of documents or spoken language, with applications, in such areas as in science, diplomacy, multinational commerce, and intelligence. Computers should be able to understand input in more than one language, provide output in more than one language, and translate between languages.",

The system processes short English narratives and is able to acquire, from a single narrative, a new schema for a stereotypical set of actions. During the understanding process, the system attempts to construct explanations for characters' actions in terms of the goals their actions were meant to achieve. When the system observes that a character has achieved an interesting goal in a novel way, it generalizes the set of actions they used to achieve this goal into a new schema. The generalization process is a knowledge-based analysis of the causal structure of the narrative which removes unnecessary details while maintaining the validity of the causal explanation. The resulting generalized set of actions is then stored as a new schema and used by the system to correctly process narratives which were previously beyond its capabilities.",

A number of information extraction systems for the biomedical domain have been reported, but none of them have become widely used in practical applications. Most proposals to date make rather simplistic assumptions about the syntactic aspect of natural language. There is an urgent need for a system that has broad coverage and performs well in real-text applications.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present a general biomedical domain-oriented NLP engine called MedScan that efficiently processes sentences from MEDLINE abstracts and produces a set of regularized logical structures representing the meaning of each sentence. The engine utilizes a specially developed context-free grammar and lexicon. Preliminary evaluation of the system's performance, accuracy, and coverage exhibited encouraging results. Further approaches for increasing the coverage and reducing parsing ambiguity of the engine, as well as its application for information extraction are discussed.",

In this paper, we describe the development of an NLP toolkit for processing the language, the challenges faced and the decisions made during development. The current version of the toolkit consists of a tokeniser/sentence segmentiser, a morphological analyser, a linguistic rule-based tagger, and a finite-state parser. The development of our toolkit is a step towards building a Basic Language Resource Toolkit (BLARK) for the Icelandic language.",

            "abstract": "The strong connection between knowledge representation and reasoning and natural language is the main theme of this book. The book is divided into two parts. Part I, consisting of five original or updated papers, considers the connection from the viewpoint of knowledge for language. The six original or updated papers in Part II describe using language to gather or enrich knowledge. Most of the papers discuss significant software systems that are capable of dealing with a variety of corpora. A brief overview of the eleven papers will give some indication of the coverage of the book. The following five papers constitute Part I of the book. Lucja M. Iwafiska, in \"Natural language is a powerful knowledge representation system: The UNO system,\" argues for her conjecture that natural language is a powerful representational language which is particularly suitable for representing and using knowledge in notwell-formalized domains. David A. McAllester and Robert Givan, in \"Natural language syntax and first order logic,\" present a polynomial-time (incomplete) inference procedure for first-order logic given in a nonstandard syntactic representation that takes advantage of properties found in natural language syntax. David D. McDonald, in \"Issues in the representation of real texts: The design of KRISP,\" discusses the need for fundamental changes in our representational languages in order to deal with the analysis and synthesis of real texts in real time. Lenhart K. Schubert and Chung Hee Hwang, in \"Episodic logic meets Little Red Riding Hood-A comprehensive natural representation for language understanding,\" describe their logic for representing discourse content and linguistic and world knowledge that readily captures the meaning of the text and enables appropriate inferences to be made. Stuart C. Shapiro, in \"SNePS: A logic for natural language understanding and commonsense reasoning,\" describes a number of features that are incorporated in the latest version of SNePS. Although the papers in this part vary somewhat in what they espouse, the primary theme is the value of appropriate representation. It is this aspect which is the important contribution of this section of the book. Although the value of representation is obvious in McAllester and Givan's paper, the theme of their paper is somewhat different from that of the other four, which describe working natural language understanding or processing systems. Shapiro's paper is a terse list of some features found in SNePS 2.4, giving some motivation and a few examples. The remaining three (significantly longer) papers carefully motivate their respective positions and show the applicability of their representational languages with numerous examples.",

The system extracts, structures, and encodes clinical information from textual patient reports. It was integrated with the Clinical Information System (CIS), which was developed at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) to help improve patient care. MEDLEE is currently used on a daily basis to routinely process radiological reports of patients at CPMC. In order to describe how the natural language system was made compatible with the existing CIS, this paper will also discuss engineering issues which involve performance, robustness, and accessibility of the data from the end users' viewpoint. Also described are the three evaluations that have been performed on the system. The first evaluation was useful primarily for further refinement of the system. The two other evaluations involved an actual clinical application which consisted of retrieving reports that were associated with specified diseases. Automated queries were written by a medical expert based on the structured output forms generated as a result of text processing. The retrievals obtained by the automated system were compared to the retrievals obtained by independent medical experts who read the reports manually to determine whether they were associated with the specified diseases. MEDLEE was shown to perform comparably to the experts. The technique used to perform the last two evaluations was found to be a realistic evaluation technique for a natural language processor.",

The authors describe recent attempts at improving the integration between the speech recognition and natural language components. They used the generation capability of the natural language component to produce a word-pair language model to constrain the recognizer's search space, thus improving the coverage of the overall system. They also implemented a strategy in which the recognizer generates the top N word strings and passes them along to the natural language component for filtering.

            "abstract": "Statistical methods for automatically extracting information about associations between words or documents from large collections of text have the potential to have considerable impact in a number of areas, such as information retrieval and natural-language-based user interfaces. However, even huge bodies of text yield highly unreliable estimates of the probability of relatively common events, and, in fact, perfectly reasonable events may not occur in the training data at all. This is known as the sparse data problem. Traditional approaches to the sparse data problem use crude approximations. We propose a different solution: if we are able to organize the data into classes of similar events, then, if information about an event is lacking, we can estimate its behavior from information about similar events. This thesis presents two such similarity-based approaches, where, in general, we measure similarity by the Kullback-Leibler divergence, an information-theoretic quantity. \nOur first approach is to build soft, hierarchical clusters: soft, because each event belongs to each cluster with some probability; hierarchical, because cluster centroids are iteratively split to model finer distinctions. Our clustering method, which uses the technique of deterministic annealing, represents (to our knowledge) the first application of soft clustering to problems in natural language processing. We use this method to cluster words drawn from 44 million words of Associated Press Newswire and 10 million words from Grolier's encyclopedia, and find that language models built from the clusters have substantial predictive power. Our algorithm also extends with no modification to other domains, such as document clustering. \nOur second approach is a nearest-neighbor approach: instead of calculating a centroid for each class, we in essence build a cluster around each word. We compare several such nearest-neighbor approaches on a word sense disambiguation task and find that as a whole, their performance is far superior to that of standard methods. In another set of experiments, we show that using estimation techniques based on the nearest-neighbor model enables us to achieve perplexity reductions of more than 20 percent over standard techniques in the prediction of low-frequency events, and statistically significant speech recognition error-rate reduction.",

Various structures were tested with the aim of separating the features of interlanguage which may be attributed to first language interference from those which may be explained as being universal to second language acquisition. Among these structures were use of resumptive pronouns in the relative clause, deletion of relativizers, stranding of prepositions, deletion of prepositions, and piedpiping structures. In line with the work of Gass and Ard (1980) and Hyltenstam (1981), the present paper examines the explanatory value of the accessibility hierarchy of Keenan and Comrie (1977) as applied to the ease or difficulty of the acquisition of relativization of various syntactic types, and expands this study by including data from the acquisition of relative clause types not examined in previous works. Also tested were structures involving different strategies for the parsing and recognition of relative clauses, in order to determine which are employed most frequently and most successfully by second language learners, and structures with correct and incorrect deletion of prepositions, in order to see whether the loss of information involved would be a constraining factor.",

In operation, the tail end of the wire of the first reel is joined to the beginning of the wire on the second reel, permitting continuous unwinding. When one reel is empty, the wire must pass from one hollow housing to the second hollow housing. The apparatus is constructed from two cooperating halves, which may be hinged or capable of other relative motion, to permit passage of the wire when desired but which close fully during the unwinding process to prevent discontinuities in the interior surface which would tend to damage the moving wire.",

For thesaurus extraction, it achieved similar overall results to a corpus of newspaper text. With many more words available on the web, better results can be obtained by collecting much larger web corpora.",

Les patrons normaux d\u2019utilisation des verbes sont degages par une methode que nous appelons Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA, analyse des patrons basee sur les corpus). A chaque patron se trouve associe un sens (une \u2018implication principale\u2019). Les patrons sont ensuite utilises comme des etalons par rapport auxquels on peut\u00a0mesurer le sens probable de n\u2019importe quelle phrase.Nous abordons aussi le statut des usages anormaux ou inhabituels (les \u2018exploitations\u2019). Nous reconnaissons aussi trois types d\u2019alternance\u00a0: les alternances syntaxiques liees a la diathese, les alternances de type semantique et les alternances lexicales.",

I-R, using counts of major omissions only, was 93.9% for the training set and 92.5% for the test set.",

The task is motivated by a discussion of current trends in the field of NLP and Language Engineering. We describe a system called GATE (a General Architecture for Text Engineering) that provides a software infrastructure on top of which heterogeneous NLP processing modules may be evaluated and refined individually, or may be combined into larger application systems. GATE aims to support both researchers and developers working on component technologies (e.g. parsing, tagging, morphological analysis) and those working on developing end-user applications (e.g. information extraction, text summarisation, document generation, machine translation, and second language learning). GATE promotes reuse of component technology, permits specialisation and collaboration in large-scale projects, and allows for the comparison and evaluation of alternative technologies. The first release of GATE is now available.",

Here, chopp-ing off the occasion-al affix-es, of which there are not too many, is sufficient to isolate the stem, perhaps modulo a few (morpho)graphemic rules to handle phenomena like the consonant doubling we just saw in chopping. This relative ease with which one can identify the core meaning component of a word explains the success of rather simple stemming algorithms for English or the way in which most part-of-speech (POS) taggers get away with just examining bounded initial and final substrings of unknown words for guessing their parts of speech. In contrast, this book outlines a computational approach to morphology that explicitly includes languages from the Semitic family, in particular Arabic and Syriac, where the linearity hypothesis\u2014every word can be built via string concatenation of its component morphemes\u2014seems to break down (we will take up the validity of that assumption below). Example 1 illustrates the problem at hand with Syriac verb forms of the root {q1t.2l3} \u2018notion of killing\u2019 (from Kiraz [1996]).",

This article explores the growing relations between these two entities and, in particular, investigates whether what is found in traditional dictionaries can be of service to those concerned with getting computers to process and understand natural human languages. Patrick Suppes used to say he would be interested in machine translation only when programs could process a whole book. In fact, they already could and did when he said that 25 years ago, but his remark was in the right spirit. Although machine translation, by methods now considered superficial by most who work in artificial intelligence (AI), processed large volumes of text by the mid-1960s, AI researchers who aimed for something deeper\u2014for a modeling of what most people would call \" understanding \" a text\u2014 wrote programs that processed only a few sentences (a fact often disguised in their theses, papers, and books.) In a moment of great honesty five years ago, a group of AI researchers of natural language processing (NLP) admitted in public (in answer to a question by Bran Boguraev) how many words there really were in the vocabularies of their systems [23]. Of the answers, the average was 36, a figure often taken to be a misprint when it appears, though it was all too true. Remedies for this situation, which had little to do with science or engineering as normally understood, have been to move to a larger scale and The Role of Lexicons in Natural Language Processing Researchers have studied lexical phenomena for years. Here, the vital role of lexicons, a key component of NLP systems, is traced through a variety of projects.",

            "abstract": "The use of automated systems and electronic databases to enhance the quality, reduce the cost, and improve the management of health care has become common. Recent examples include using these systems to prevent adverse drug events [1, 2] and to encourage efficient treatment [3]. To function properly, automated systems require accurate, complete data. Although laboratory results are routinely available in electronic form, the most important clinical informationsymptoms, signs, and assessmentsremains largely inaccessible to automated systems. Investigators have attempted to use data from nonclinical sources to fill in the gaps, but such data have been found to be unreliable [4]. Much clinical data is locked up in departmental word-processor files, clinical databases, and research databases in the form of narrative reports such as discharge summaries, radiology reports, pathology reports, admission histories, and reports of physical examinations. Untold volumes of data are deleted every day after word-processor files are printed for the paper chart and for the mailing of reports. Exploiting this information is not trivial, however. Sentences that are easy for a person to understand are difficult for a computer to sort out. Problems include the many ways in which the same concept can be expressed (for example, heart failure, congestive heart failure, CHF, and so forth); ambiguities in interpreting grammatical constructs (possible worsening infiltrate may refer to a definite infiltrate that may be worsening or to an uncertain infiltrate that, if present, is worsening); and negation (lung fields are unremarkable implies a lack of infiltrate). To be accurate, automated systems require coded data: The concepts must come from a well-defined, finite vocabulary, and the relations among the concepts must be expressed in an unambiguous, formal structure. How do we unlock the contents of narrative reports? Human coders can be trained to read and manually structure reports [5]. Few institutions have been willing to invest in the personnel necessary for manual coding (other than for billing purposes), and the human coders can introduce an additional delay in obtaining coded data. The producers of reports (for example, radiologists for radiology reports) can be trained to directly create coded reports. Unfortunately, because manual coding systems do not match the speed and simplicity of dictating narrative reports, this approach has not attained widespread use. It also does not address the large number of reports already available in institutions. Natural language processing offers an automated solution [6-11]. The processor converts narrative reports that are available in electronic formeither through word processors or electronic scanningto coded descriptions that are appropriate for automated systems. The promise of efficient, accurate extraction of coded clinical data from narrative reports is certainly enticing. The question is whether natural language processors are up to the taskjust how efficient and accurate are they, and how easy is it to use their coded output? Methods We evaluated a general-purpose processor [12] that is intended to cover various clinical reports. To be used in a particular domain (for example, radiology) and subdomain (chest radiograph), the processor must have initial programming under the supervision of an appropriate expert (radiologist). This programming process involves enumerating the vocabulary of the domain (for example, patchy infiltrate) and formulating the grammar rules that are specific to the domain. The natural language processor works as follows. The narrative report is fed into a preprocessor, which uses its vocabulary to recognize words and phrases in the report (for example, lungs, CHF), map them to standard terms (lung, congestive heart failure), and classify them into semantic categories (bodylocation, finding). The parser then matches sequences of semantic categories in the report to structures defined in the grammar. For example, if the original report read, infiltrate in lung, then the phrase might match this structure: finding, in, bodylocation. Far more complex semantic structures are also supported through the grammar. This structure is then mapped to the processor's result: a set of findings, each of which is associated with its own descriptive modifiers, such as certainty, status, location, quantity, degree, and change. For example, the following is an excerpt from a narrative report: Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion with new left pleural effusion, question mild congestive changes. From this report, the natural language processor generated the following three coded findings: Pulmonary vascular congestion certainty: high degree: low Pleural effusion region: left status: new Congestive changes certainty: moderate degree: low The processor attempts to encode all clinical information available in reports, including the clinical indication, description, and impression. These findings are stored in a clinical database, where they can be exploited for automated decision-support and clinical research. At Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, New York, the processor has been trained to handle chest radiograph and mammogram reports. In normal operation, the radiologist dictates a report, which is then transcribed by a clerk with a word processor. The word-processor files are printed for the paper chart, stored in the clinical database in their narrative form for on-line review by clinicians, and transmitted to the natural language processor for coding. The coded data produced by the processor are exploited for automated decision-support by the use of a computer program called a clinical event monitor [13]. The event monitor generates alerts, reminders, and interpretations that are based on the Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Modules [14]. The event monitor follows all clinical events (for example, admissions and laboratory results) in the medical center that can be tracked by computer. Whenever a clinically important situation is detected, the event monitor sends a message to the health care provider. For example, the storage of a low serum potassium level prompts the monitor to check whether the patient is receiving digoxin; if so, the monitor warns the health care provider that the hypokalemia may potentiate cardiac arrhythmias. Our study was designed and conducted by an evaluation team that was separate from the development team responsible for the natural language processor. At the time of the evaluation, members of the evaluation team had no knowledge of the operation of the processor or of its strengths and weaknesses. They knew that the processor accepted chest radiograph reports and produced some coded result. Two hundred admission chest radiograph reports were randomly selected from among those of all adult patients discharged from the inpatient service of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center during a particular week. An admission chest radiograph was defined as the first chest radiograph obtained during the hospital stay, even if it was not obtained on the first day. Chest radiographs were chosen because they display a broad range of disease, vocabulary, and grammatical variation. To better assess true performance, no corrections were made to reports, despite misspellings and even the inclusion of other types of reports in the same electronic files as the chest radiograph reports. Study subjects (humans and automated methods) detected the presence or absence of six clinical conditions (Table 1). To ensure that the conditions were reasonable candidates for automated decision-support, they were selected from an independent published list of automated protocols that exploited chest radiographs [15]. An internist on the evaluation team selected the six conditions, thus ensuring that the conditions were common enough to be reasonably expected to appear several times in a set of 200 reports and that overlap would be minimized. Table 1. Conditions The 200 reports were processed by the natural language processor, and the resulting coded data were fed into the clinical event monitor. For each clinical condition, the monitor had a rule expressed as a Medical Logic Module [14] to detect the condition on the basis of the processor's coded output. The Medical Logic Modules concluded true (present) or false (absent). For example, the Medical Logic Module that detected pneumothorax was the simplest and used the following logic: if finding is in (pneumothorax; hydropneumothorax) and certainty-modifier is not in (no; rule out; cannot evaluate) and status-modifier is not in (resolved) then conclude true; endif; The Medical Logic Module looks for reports with appropriate findings but eliminates reports that are actually stating that the finding is absent, unknown, or resolved. The Medical Logic Modules were written by a member of the evaluation team who was given access to the six condition definitions (Table 1), a sample of the natural language processor's output based on an independent set of chest radiographs, and a complete list of all vocabulary terms that the processor could generate in its output. No changes were made to the natural language processor, its grammar, or its vocabulary for the entire duration of the study (including the design phase). Once written, Medical Logic Modules were also held constant. Human participants were recruited as follows. Six board-certified radiologists and six board-certified internists were selected as experts. All 12 physicians actively practice medicine in their respective fields at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Six professional lay persons without experience in the practice of medicine were selected as additional controls. Each human participant analyzed 100 reports; the time required to analyze all 200 reports (about 4 hours) would have been a disincentive to participate in the study and might have led participants",

The range of roles for thesauruses within NLP is briefly presented and the WASPS thesaurus is introduced. Thesaurus evaluation is now becoming urgent. A range of evaluation strategies, all embedded within NLP tasks, is proposed.",

For example, thanks to scaling, GPT-3 was able to achieve strong results on in-context learning tasks. However, training these large dense models requires significant amounts of computing resources. In this paper, we propose and develop a family of language models named GLaM (Generalist Language Model), which uses a sparsely activated mixture-of-experts architecture to scale the model capacity while also incurring substantially less training cost compared to dense variants. The largest GLaM has 1.2 trillion parameters, which is approximately 7x larger than GPT-3. It consumes only 1/3 of the energy used to train GPT-3 and requires half of the computation flops for inference, while still achieving better overall zero-shot and one-shot performance across 29 NLP tasks.",

Natural language processing technology can be used to automatically generate such questions but techniques used have not fully leveraged semantic information contained in the learning materials or the full context in which the question generation task occurs. We introduce a sophisticated template-based approach that incorporates semantic role labels into a system that automatically generates natural language questions to support online learning. While we have not yet incorporated the full learning context into our approach, our preliminary evaluation and evaluation methodology indicate our approach is a promising one for supporting learning.",

In addition to a survey of n-gram statistics found in the literature, a collection of n-gram statistics obtained by other researchers is reviewed and compared.",

A direct appeal to formal specification has not solved these problems, partly because of the restrictiveness and back of habitability of formal languages. An alternative approach, described in the paper, is to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to aid the development of formal descriptions from requirements expressed in controlled natural language. While many problems in NLP remain unsolved, we show that suitable extensions to existing tools provide a useful platform for detecting and resolving ambiguities. Our system is demonstrated through a case-study on a simple requirements specification.",

Given these limitations, Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like Sentiment Analysis (SA), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Question Answering (QA), have proven to be very challenging to tackle. Recently, with the surge of transformers based models, language-specific BERT based models have proven to be very efficient at language understanding, provided they are pre-trained on a very large corpus. Such models were able to set new standards and achieve state-of-the-art results for most NLP tasks. In this paper, we pre-trained BERT specifically for the Arabic language in the pursuit of achieving the same success that BERT did for the English language. The performance of AraBERT is compared to multilingual BERT from Google and other state-of-the-art approaches. The results showed that the newly developed AraBERT achieved state-of-the-art performance on most tested Arabic NLP tasks. The pretrained araBERT models are publicly available on https://github.com/aub-mind/araBERT hoping to encourage research and applications for Arabic NLP.",

However, our experience with TACITUS; especially in the MUC-3 evaluation, has shown that principled techniques for syntactic and pragmatic analysis can be bolstered with methods for achieving robustness. We describe three techniques for making syntactic analysis more robust-an agenda-based scheduling parser, a recovery technique for failed parses, and a new technique called terminal substring parsing. For pragmatics processing, we describe how the method of abductive inference is inherently robust, in that an interpretation is always possible, so that in the absence of the required world knowledge, performance degrades gracefully. Each of these techniques have been evaluated and the results of the evaluations are presented.",

Although requirement analysis has been traditionally reserved to the experience of professionals, there is no reason not to use various automatic techniques to the same end. In this paper we present Circe, a Web-based environment for aiding in natural language requirements gathering, elicitation, selection, and validation and the tools it integrates. These tools have been used in several experiments both in academic and in industrial environments. Among other features, Circe can extract abstractions from natural language texts, build various models of the system described by the requirements, check the validity of such models, and produce functional metric reports. The environment can be easily extended to enhance its natural language recognition power or to add new models and views on them.",

Finite-state techniques are less powerful, but offer the advantage of being very fast, and good at representing language locally. This dissertation constitutes empirical research into the construction and use of a finite-state approximation of a wide-coverage parser to increase parsing performance. The finite-state approximation is in the form of a hidden Markov model, inferred from parser-annotated data. This model is used in a part-of-speech tagger, which is applied in various ways and using several different models to reduce ambiguity in parsing, by setting it up as a filter that removes unlikely options in the first stage of parsing.",

This example-driven book walks you through the annotation cycle, from selecting an annotation task and creating the annotation specification to designing the guidelines, creating a \"gold standard\" corpus, and then beginning the actual data creation with the annotation process. Systems exist for analyzing existing corpora, but making a new corpus can be extremely complex. To help you build a foundation for your own machine learning goals, this easy-to-use guide includes case studies that demonstrate four different annotation tasks in detail. You'll also learn how to use a lightweight software package for annotating texts and adjudicating the annotations. This book is a perfect companion to O'Reilly's Natural Language Processing with Python, which describes how to use existing corpora with the Natural Language Toolkit.",

Despite their success, most available models have either been trained on English data or on the concatenation of data in multiple languages. This makes practical use of such models \u2013in all languages except English\u2013 very limited. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of training monolingual Transformer-based language models for other languages, taking French as an example and evaluating our language models on part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition and natural language inference tasks. We show that the use of web crawled data is preferable to the use of Wikipedia data. More surprisingly, we show that a relatively small web crawled dataset (4GB) leads to results that are as good as those obtained using larger datasets (130+GB). Our best performing model CamemBERT reaches or improves the state of the art in all four downstream tasks.",

Instead of developing more powerful models, most of the research effort has gone into finding better ways of estimating the GMM parameters so that error rates are decreased or the margin between different classes is increased. The same observation holds for natural language processing (NLP) in which maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models and conditional random fields (CRFs) have been popular for the last decade. Both of these approaches use shallow models whose success largely depends on the use of carefully handcrafted features.",

Despite the incredible effectiveness of language processing models trained on text alone, today's best systems still make mistakes that arise from a failure to relate language to the physical world it describes and to the social interactions it facilitates. \nNatural Language Processing is a diverse field, and progress throughout its development has come from new representational theories, modeling techniques, data collection paradigms, and tasks. We posit that the present success of representation learning approaches trained on large text corpora can be deeply enriched from the parallel tradition of research on the contextual and social nature of language. \nIn this article, we consider work on the contextual foundations of language: grounding, embodiment, and social interaction. We describe a brief history and possible progression of how contextual information can factor into our representations, with an eye towards how this integration can move the field forward and where it is currently being pioneered. We believe this framing will serve as a roadmap for truly contextual language understanding.",
