            "abstract": "Information-hiding in natural language text has mainly consisted of carrying out approximately meaning-preserving modifications on the given cover text until it encodes the intended mark. A major technique for doing so has been synonym-substitution. In these previous schemes, synonym substitutions were done until the text \"confessed\", i.e., carried the intended mark message. We propose here a better way to use synonym substitution, one that is no longer entirely guided by the mark-insertion process: It is also guided by a resilience requirement, subject to a maximum allowed distortion constraint. Previous schemes for information hiding in natural language text did not use numeric quantification of the distortions introduced by transformations, they mainly used heuristic measures of quality based on conformity to a language model (and not in reference to the original cover text). When there are many alternatives to carry out a substitution on a word, we prioritize these alternatives according to a quantitative resilience criterion and use them in that order. In a nutshell, we favor the more ambiguous alternatives. In fact not only do we attempt to achieve the maximum ambiguity, but we want to simultaneously be as close as possible to the above-mentioned distortion limit, as that prevents the adversary from doing further transformations without exceeding the damage threshold; that is, we continue to modify the document even after the text has \"confessed\" to the mark, for the dual purpose of maximizing ambiguity while deliberately getting as close as possible to the distortion limit. The quantification we use makes possible an application of the existing information-theoretic framework, to the natural language domain, which has unique challenges not present in the image or audio domains. The resilience stems from both (i) the fact that the adversary does not know where the changes were made, and (ii) the fact that automated disambiguation is a major difficulty faced by any natural language processing system (what is bad news for the natural language processing area, is good news for our scheme's resilience). In addition to the above mentioned design and analysis, another contribution of this paper is the description of the implementation of the scheme and of the experimental data obtained.",

            "abstract": "Preface Through many centuries physics has been one of the most fruitful sources of inspiration for mathematics. As a consequence, mathematics has become an economic language providing a few basic principles which allow to explain a large variety of physical phenomena. Many of them are described in terms of partial diierential equations (PDEs). In recent years, however, mathematics also has been stimulated by other novel elds such as image processing. Goals like image segmentation, multiscale image representation, or image restoration cause a lot of challenging mathematical questions. Nevertheless, these problems frequently have been tackled with a pool of heuristical recipes. Since the treatment of digital images requires very much computing power, these methods had to be fairly simple. With the tremendous advances in computer technology in the last decade, it has become possible to apply more sophisticated techniques such as PDE-based methods which have been inspired by physical processes. Among these techniques, parabolic PDEs have found a lot of attention for smoothing and restoration purposes, see e.g. 113]. To restore images these equations frequently arise from gradient descent methods applied to variational problems. Image smoothing by parabolic PDEs is closely related to the scale-space concept where one embeds the original image into a family of subsequently simpler , more global representations of it. This idea plays a fundamental role for extracting semantically important information. The pioneering work of Alvarez, Guichard, Lions and Morel 11] has demonstrated that all scale-spaces fulllling a few fairly natural axioms are governed by parabolic PDEs with the original image as initial condition. Within this framework, two classes can be justiied in a rigorous way as scale-spaces: the linear diiusion equation with constant dif-fusivity and nonlinear so-called morphological PDEs. All these methods satisfy a monotony axiom as smoothing requirement which states that, if one image is brighter than another, then this order is preserved during the entire scale-space evolution. An interesting class of parabolic equations which pursue both scale-space and restoration intentions is given by nonlinear diiusion lters. Methods of this type have been proposed for the rst time by Perona and Malik in 1987 190]. In v vi PREFACE order to smooth the image and to simultaneously enhance semantically important features such as edges, they apply a diiusion process whose diiusivity is steered by local image properties. These lters are diicult to analyse mathematically , as they may act locally like a backward diiusion process. \u2026",

            "abstract": "Computational semantics is the study of how to represent meaning in a way that computers can use. For the authors of this textbook, this study includes the representation of the meaning of natural language in logic formalisms, the recognition of certain relations that hold within this formalization (such as synonymy, consistency, and implication), and the computational implementation of all this. I think that, while there probably are not many courses devoted to computational semantics, this book could profitably be incorporated into more traditional computational linguistics courses, especially when two courses are offered serially. The material here could be spread out and integrated into parts of a more standard pair of these courses, and it would result in a substantial widening of the knowledge that students come away with from these courses. The introduction of this book traces the history of computational semantics, with a goal of justifying the enterprise in the face of the modern emphasis on statistical natural language processing. Besides this introduction, the book contains six substantial chapters and four short appendices. There is also a very extensive suite of material online at a Web site maintained by the authors. Chapter 1 is an introduction to first-order logic, but with a twist that underscores the particular outlook taken in this book. There is a very short introduction to the notion of a model of a set of quantifier-free sentences, followed by an equally short discussion of the interpretation of quantifiers in a model. With respect to quantifier-free sentences, students are referred to the three-page Appendix B on propositional logic, where truth-tables are covered. The innovations start with the introduction of three \u201cinference tasks\u201d: querying, consistency checking, and informativity checking. These correspond to the logical concepts of satisfiability (of a given formula in a given model), consistency (whether there is a model that satisfies a given formula), and validity (whether a formula is true in all models, or, equivalently, whether a given argument is valid). Although the notions of querying, etc., are thus merely renamings of standard logical notions, it seems to me that the renaming is particularly apposite in the setting of a textbook for non-logicians, especially since much is to be done computationally with these notions in the enterprise of computational semantics. Much of the remainder of chapter 1 consists of a gentle introduction to Prolog and using it to check formulas for well-formedness and to build model checkers with the goal of implementing the querying task.",

            "abstract": "A new natural language system, TINA, has been developed for applications involving spoken language tasks. TINA integrates key ideas from context free grammars, Augmented Transition Networks (ATN's), and the unification concept. TINA provides a seamless interface between syntactic and semantic analysis, and also produces a highly constraining probabilistic language model to improve recognition performance. An initial set of context-free rewrite rules provided by hand is first converted to a network structure. Probability assignments on all arcs in the network are obtained automatically from a set of example sentences. The parser uses a stack decoding search strategy, with a top-down control flow, and includes a feature-passing mechanism to deal with long-distance movement, agreement, and semantic constraints. TINA provides an automatic sentence generation capability that has been effective for identifying overgeneralization problems as well as in producing a word-pair language model for a recognizer. The parser is currently integrated with MIT's SUMMIT recognizer for use in two application domains, with the parser screening recognizer outputs either at the sentential level or to filter partial theories during the active search process.",

The formalization assumes that text can be sequenced into elementary units; that discourse relations hold between textual units of various sizes; that some textual units are more important to the writer's purpose than others; and that trees are a good approximation of the abstract structure of text. The formalization also introduces a linguistically motivated compositionality criterion, which is shown to hold for the text structures that are valid. \nThe thesis proposes, analyzes theoretically, and compares empirically four algorithms for determining the valid text structures of a sequence of units among which some rhetorical relations hold. Two algorithms apply model-theoretic techniques; the other two apply proof-theoretic techniques. \nThe formalization and the algorithms mentioned so far correspond to the theoretical facet of the thesis. An exploratory corpus analysis of cue phrases provides the means for applying the formalization to unrestricted natural language texts. A set of empirically motivated algorithms were designed in order to determine the elementary textual units of a text, to hypothesize rhetorical relations that hold among these units, and eventually, to derive the discourse structure of that text. The process that finds the discourse structure of unrestricted natural language texts is called rhetorical parsing. \nThe thesis explores two possible applications of the text theory that it proposes. The first application concerns a discourse-based summarization system, which is shown to significantly outperform both a baseline algorithm and a commercial system. An empirical psycholinguistic experiment not only provides an objective evaluation of the summarization system, but also confirms the adequacy of using the text theory proposed here in order to determine the most important units in a text. The second application concerns a set of text planning algorithms that can be used by natural language generation systems in order to construct text plans in the cases in which the high-level communicative goal is to map an entire knowledge pool into text.",

The holy grail has been the development of a natural language query interface. We present NaLIX, a generic interactive natural language query interface to an XML database. Our system can accept an arbitrary English language sentence as query input, which can include aggregation, nesting, and value joins, among other things. This query is translated, potentially after reformulation, into an XQuery expression that can be evaluated against an XML database. The translation is done through mapping grammatical proximity of natural language parsed tokens to proximity of corresponding elements in the result XML. In this demonstration, we show that NaLIX, while far from being able to pass the Turing test, is perfectly usable in practice, and able to handle even quite complex queries in a variety of application domains. In addition, we also demonstrate how carefully designed features in NaLIX facilitate the interactive query process and improve the usability of the interface.",

Sandra Carberry addresses the problem of creating computational strategies that can improve user-computer communication by assimilating ongoing dialogue and reasoning on the acquired knowledge. \nPlan Recognition in Natural Language Dialogue critically examines plan recognition - the inference of an agent's goals and how he or she intends to achieve them. It describes significant models of plan inference and presents in detail the author's own model, which infers new goals from user utterances and integrates them into the system's model of the user's plan, incrementally expanding and adding detail to its beliefs about what the information seeker wants to do. Carberry then outlines computational strategies for interpreting two kinds of problematic utterances: utterances that violate the pragmatic rules of the system's world model and intersentential elliptical fragments. She also suggests directions for future research. \nSandra Carberry is Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. Plan Recognition in Natural Language Dialogue is included in the ACL-MIT Press Series in Natural Language Processing edited by Aravind Joshi.",

The task is very complex, and not many language processors are used routinely within clinical information systems. Those systems that are operational, have been implemented in narrow domains for particular applications. For a system to be truly useful, it should be designed so that it could be widely used within the clinical environment. This paper examines architectural requirements we have identified as being necessary for portability and describes the architecture of the system we developed. Our system was designed so that it could be used in different domains to serve a variety of applications. It has been integrated with the clinical information system at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center where it routinely encodes clinical information from radiological reports of patients.",

However, specifying the requirements in natural language has one major drawback, namely the inherent imprecision, i.e., ambiguity, incompleteness, and inaccuracy, of natural language. Since the requirements document forms the basis of the whole development process, such defects can have severe consequences for the whole project. Therefore, it is important to deal with these defects in a requirements specification right from the start. We present an approach for reducing the problem of imprecision in natural language requirements specifications with the use of natural language patterns, which allow formulating requirements sentences in a less ambiguous, more complete, and more accurate way. To ensure the applicability of our approach we based our patterns on a metamodel for requirements statements for embedded systems. With this metamodel, we ensure that all forms of requirements statements are described with the patterns. We validated the effectiveness of the patterns by using them to rewrite a substantial, previously written, requirements specification to eliminate its imprecisions.",

            "abstract": "This dissertation presents the results of research on a planning formalism for a theory of natural language generation that incorporates generation of utterances that satisfy multiple goals. Previous research in the area of computer generation of natural language utterances has concentrated on one of two aspects of language production: (1) the process of producing surface syntactic forms from an underlying representation, and (2) the planning of illocutionary acts to satisfy the speaker's goals. This work concentrates on the interaction between these two aspects of language generation and considers the overall problem to be one of refining the specification of an illocutionary act into a surface syntactic form, emphasizing the problems of achieving multiple goals in a single utterance. \nPlanning utterances requires an ability to do detailed reasoning about what the hearer knows and wants. A formalism, based on a possible worlds semantics of an intensional logic of knowledge and action, was developed for representing the effects of illocutionary acts and the speaker's beliefs about the hearer's knowledge of the world. Techniques are described that enable a planning system to use the representation effectively. \nThe language planning theory and knowledge representation are embodied in a computer system called KAMP (Knowledge And Modalities Planner) which plans both physical and linguistic actions, given a high level description of the speaker's goal. \nThe research has application to the design of gracefully interacting computer systems, multiple-agent planning systems, and planning to acquire knowledge.",

This process consists of two major activities, \"design\" and \"elaborate\". Through the design activity, the structure of software modules based on an object oriented model is interactively extracted from the informal English description. Each word such as nouns and verbs in the natural-language sentences is associated with a software concept, e.g. class, attribute, and method. Especially we concentrate on types of verb patterns occurring in the sentences to increase applicability to dynamic systems. The elaborate activity is one to refine and rewrite the informal specification more precisely based on the derived mod- ule design document. We can complete the formal specification through the elaborate - design activity cycle. Each document created in our process is called product. The integration man- agement of the various kinds of the products are supported by a hypertext system. Furthermore we discuss the whole of soft- ware development process in which the design process and the elaborate one are embedded.",

Although such query languages use natural-language-like terms, the formal definitions of those spatial relations rarely reflect the same meaning people would apply when they communicate among each other. To bridge the gap between computational models for spatial relations and people's use of spatial terms in their natural languages, a model for the geometry of spatial relations was calibrated for a set of 59 English-language spatial predicates. The model distinguishes topological and metric properties. The calibration from sketches that were drawn by 34 human subjects identifies ten groups of spatial terms with similar properties and provides a mapping from spatial terms onto significant geometric parameters and their values. The calibration's results reemphasize the importance of topological over metric properties in the selection of English-language spatial terms. The model provides a basis for high-level spatial query languages that exploit natural-language terms and serves as a model for processing such queries.",

To bridge this conceptual gap we propose controlled natural language as a declarative and application-specific specification language. Controlled natural language is a subset of natural language that can be accurately and efficiently processed by a computer, but is expressive enough to allow natural usage by non-specialists. Specifications in controlled natural language are automatically translated into Prolog clauses, hence become formal and executable. The translation uses a definite clause grammar (DCG) enhanced by feature structures. Inter-text references of the specification, e.g. anaphora, are resolved with the help of discourse representation theory (DRT). The generated Prolog clauses are added to a knowledge base. We have implemented a prototypical specification system that successfully processes the specification of a simple automated teller machine.",

Part I of this paper discusses a method of analyzing metaphors based on the existence of a small number of generalized metaphor mappings. Each generalized metaphor contains a recognition network, a basic mapping, additional transfer mappings, and an implicit intention component. It is argued that this method reduces metaphor interpretation from a reconstruction to a recognition task. Steps towards automating certain aspects of language learning are also discussed. Part II analyzes analogical mappings underlying metaphors and implications for inference and memory organization. Regularities have been observed indicating that certain types of conceptual relations are much more apt to remain invariant in analogical mappings than other relations, resulting in an induced invariance hierarchy. The central thesis is that human inference processes are governed by the same analogical mappings manifest as metaphors in language. (Author)",

A majority of the grammarian's efforts are devoted to the disambiguation process, first hypothesizing rules which dictate constituent categories and relationships among words in ambiguous sentences, and then seeking exceptions and corrections to these rules. \nIn this work, I propose an automatic method for acquiring a statistical parser from a set of parsed sentences which takes advantage of some initial linguistic input, but avoids the pitfalls of the iterative and seemingly endless grammar development process. Based on distributionally-derived and linguistically-based features of language, this parser acquires a set of statistical decision trees which assign a probability distribution on the space of parse trees given the input sentence. These decision trees take advantage of significant amount of contextual information, potentially including all of the lexical information in the sentence, to produce highly accurate statistical models of the disambiguation process. By basing the disambiguation criteria selection on entropy reduction rather than human intuition, this parser development method is able to consider more sentences than a human grammarian can when making individual disambiguation rules. \nIn experiments between a parser, acquired using this statistical framework, and a grammarian's rule-based parser, developed over a ten-year period, both using the same training material and test sentences, the decision tree parser significantly outperformed the grammar-based parser on the accuracy measure which the grammarian was trying to maximize, achieving an accuracy of 78% compared to the grammar-based parser's 69%.",

            "abstract": "Current Research in Natural Language Generation is derived from the Second European Natural Language Generation Workshop, which was held in Edinburgh in April 1989. The papers included in this volume were selected from revised versions of some of the papers presented at the workshop. The book provides a snapshot of the current research in NLG, with particular emphasis on the work conducted by the European research community. It is aimed at an audience already familiar with NLG. Even though the different papers provide introductory technical material where necessary, in general, this material alone seemed insufficient to enable the uninitiated to understand completely the different arguments. However, adequate references are provided. The book is divided into four main sections: text planning (four papers), linguistic realization (two papers), building descriptions (three papers), and connectionist approaches (two papers). The first section contains contributions by Hovy, Scott and de Souza, Cawsey, and McKeown et al. The first paper, entitled \"Unresolved issues in paragraph planning,\" by Hovy, is a position paper that raises seven unresolved problems in discourse planning, mainly from the perspective of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1988). These problems are divided into two groups: problems concerning the theory and representation of coherence relations, and algorithmic problems. The importance of this paper is that it focuses the discussion on NLG on crucial issues to which researchers have to address themselves. The second paper, \"Getting the message across in RST-based generation,\" by Scott and de Souza, addresses the problem of generating text that achieves a communicative goal effectively. To this end, the authors look upon style in terms of a reader's ease of processing a text, rather than in terms of aesthetics. The main contribution of the paper is that it presents explicit heuristics grounded in psycholinguistic evidence to control the realization of RST discourse relations. I found Section 3.2, \"Making the text sensitive to the communicative setting,\" where the authors link the generation of textual markers to context sensitivity, somewhat problematic. In addition, since the heuristics presented in the paper were not implemented, some analysis of how they interact would have been useful. The third paper, \"Generating explanatory discourse,\" by Cawsey, discusses an interactive content and discourse planner whose output is tailored to the changing capabilities of the user, and which can also handle interruptions and remedial discourse. The paper offers a novel approach that addresses specific criteria in discourse planning. Its contributions include: the use of an approach similar to Litman's (1985) to separate content and discourse planning; the hierarchical decomposition of schemata; and the use of an agenda for content planning. This paper provides a clear exposition",

It identifies words quite successfully and seems to have some sensitivity to morphs but it performs poorly with structures larger than words. From the language samples, the program extracts most of the sequential redundancy and some of the redundancy due to the unequal frequencies of elements. This accords with the principle of economical coding in cognition (Attneave, 1954; Oldfield, 1954). The process seems also to model certain aspects of how children's vocabularies grow and the increasing lengths of the words which children acquire. It may have a bearing on the explanation of infantile amnesia and the word transformation effect.",

A survey of the models that have been developed over the last decade and a half is presented to demonstrate that ALife techniques have a lot to offer an explanatory theory of language. It is argued that this is because much of the structure of language is determined by the interaction of three complex adaptive systems: learning, culture, and biological evolution. Computational simulation, informed by theoretical linguistics, is an appropriate response to the challenge of explaining real linguistic data in terms of the processes that underpin human language.",

Both what is said and how it is interpreted depend on a shared understanding of this narrowing of attention to a small highlighted portion of what is known. Focusing is an active process. As a dialogue progresses, the participants continually shift their focus and thus form an evolving context against which utterances are produced and understood. A speaker provides a hearer with clues of what to look at and how to look at it what to focus on, how to focus on it, and how wide or narrow the focusing should be. As a result, one of the effects of understanding an utterance is that the listener becomes focused on certain entities (both objects and relationships) from a particular perspective. Focusing clues may be linguistic or they may come from knowledge about the relationships between entities in the domain. Linguistic clues may be either explicit, deriving directly from certain words, or implicit, deriving from sentential structure and from rhetorical relationships between sentences. This paper examines the relationship between focusing and definite descriptions in dialogue and its implications for natural language processing systems. It describes focusing mechanisms based on domain- structure clues which have been included in a computer system and, from this perspective, indicates future research problems entailed in modeling the focusing process more generally.",

People appear to interact according to established patterns which span several turns in a dialogue and which recur frequently. These patterns appear to be organized around the goals which the dialogue serves for each participant. Many things which are said later in a dialogue can only be interpreted as pursuit of these goals, established by earlier dialogue. These patterns have been represented by a set of knowledge structures called Dialogue-Games, capturing shared, conventional knowledge that people have about communication and how it can be used to achieve goals. A Dialogue-Game has Parameters, which represent those elements that vary across instances of a particular pattern\u2014the particular dialogue participants and the content topic. The states of the world which must be in effect for a particular Dialogue-Game to be employed successfully are represented by Specifications of these Parameters. Finally, the expected sequence of intermediate states that occur during instances of a particular conventional pattern are represented by the Components of the corresponding Dialogue-Game. Representations for several Dialogue-Games are presented here, based on our analyses of different kinds of naturally occurring dialogue. A process model is discussed, showing Dialogue-Game identification, pursuit, and termination as part of the comprehension of dialogue utterances. This Dialogue-Game model captures some of the important functional aspects of language, especially indirect uses to achieve implicit communication.",

This paper presents a method to reduce this demand using active learning, which selects what samples to annotate, instead of annotating blindly the whole training corpus.Sample selection for annotation is based upon \"representativeness\" and \"usefulness\". A model-based distance is proposed to measure the difference of two sentences and their most likely parse trees. Based on this distance, the active learning process analyzes the sample distribution by clustering and calculates the density of each sample to quantify its representativeness. Further more, a sentence is deemed as useful if the existing model is highly uncertain about its parses, where uncertainty is measured by various entropy-based scores.Experiments are carried out in the shallow semantic parser of an air travel dialog system. Our result shows that for about the same parsing accuracy, we only need to annotate a third of the samples as compared to the usual random selection method.",

To compensate for the effect of supply voltage fluctuations on an electromagnetic detector, the output amplifier has a D. C. reference voltage varying with the mains supply. As shown the sensing head comprises a primary 2 and opposed secondaries 3, 4 (for detecting a conductor 9). The output is applied through an amplifier 14 to a common emitter trigger comprising transistors 17, 18 to operate a switching circuit 23. The switching circuit and transistors are energized from constant voltage supplies, but the emitter \"reference\" bias is derived from the current through a resistor 28 in series with a Zener diode 29 and hence varies with the A.

Using positron emission tomography, we report cerebral blood flow activity in profoundly deaf signers processing specific aspects of sign language in key brain sites widely assumed to be unimodal speech or sound processing areas: the left inferior frontal cortex when signers produced meaningful signs, and the planum temporale bilaterally when they viewed signs or meaningless parts of signs (sign-phonetic and syllabic units). Contrary to prevailing wisdom, the planum temporale may not be exclusively dedicated to processing speech sounds, but may be specialized for processing more abstract properties essential to language that can engage multiple modalities. We hypothesize that the neural tissue involved in language processing may not be prespecified exclusively by sensory modality (such as sound) but may entail polymodal neural tissue that has evolved unique sensitivity to aspects of the patterning of natural language. Such neural specialization for aspects of language patterning appears to be neurally unmodifiable in so far as languages with radically different sensory modalities such as speech and sign are processed at similar brain sites, while, at the same time, the neural pathways for expressing and perceiving natural language appear to be neurally highly modifiable.",

The structure and process of the full literature review is introduced and criteria for inclusion in the two domains are specified. The resulting data set gave 16 prevalence estimates generated from 21 publications and 12 natural history studies generated from 18 publications. Results are summarized for six subdivisions of primary speech and language delays: (1) speech and/or language, (2) language only, (3) speech only, (4) expression with comprehension, (5) expression only and (6) comprehension only. Combination of the data suggests that both concurrent and predictive case definition can be problematic. Prediction improves if language is taken independently of speech and if expressive and receptive language are taken together. The results are discussed in terms of the need to develop a model of prevalence based on risk of subsequent difficulties.",

More specifically, given a query image, we retrieve existing human-composed phrases used to describe visually similar images, then selectively combine those phrases to generate a novel description for the query image. We cast the generation process as constraint optimization problems, collectively incorporating multiple interconnected aspects of language composition for content planning, surface realization and discourse structure. Evaluation by human annotators indicates that our final system generates more semantically correct and linguistically appealing descriptions than two nontrivial baselines.",

It had become obvious that one of the major shortcomings in contrastive studies as well as in the usual kind of error analysis is that they lack thorough investigation of factors which determine the kind of approach a learner may take to acquire a second language. This again implies that it is more fruitful to study the process of learning itself instead of merely analysing its outputs. It is by now widely accepted that the learner takes an active part in the learning process and does not merely get trapped in structural gaps which linguists may find when comparing the source language (the learner's L1) and the target language (L2).",

In Study 1, greater LSM in transcripts of 40 speed dates predicted increased likelihood of mutual romantic interest (odds ratio = 3.05). Overall, 33.3% of pairs with LSM above the median mutually desired future contact, compared with 9.1% of pairs with LSM at or below the median. In Study 2, LSM in 86 couples\u2019 instant messages positively predicted relationship stability at a 3-month follow-up (odds ratio = 1.95). Specifically, 76.7% of couples with LSM greater than the median were still dating at the follow-up, compared with 53.5% of couples with LSM at or below the median. LSM appears to reflect implicit interpersonal processes central to romantic relationships.",

            "abstract": "Understanding speech in our native tongue seems natural and effortless; listening to speech in a nonnative language is a different experience. In this book, Anne Cutler argues that listening to speech is a process of native listening because so much of it is exquisitely tailored to the requirements of the native language. Her cross-linguistic study (drawing on experimental work in languages that range from English and Dutch to Chinese and Japanese) documents what is universal and what is language specific in the way we listen to spoken language. Cutler describes the formidable range of mental tasks we carry out, all at once, with astonishing speed and accuracy, when we listen. These include evaluating probabilities arising from the structure of the native vocabulary, tracking information to locate the boundaries between words, paying attention to the way the words are pronounced, and assessing not only the sounds of speech but prosodic information that spans sequences of sounds. She describes infant speech perception, the consequences of language-specific specialization for listening to other languages, the flexibility and adaptability of listening (to our native languages), and how language-specificity and universality fit together in our language processing system. Drawing on her four decades of work as a psycholinguist, Cutler documents the recent growth in our knowledge about how spoken-word recognition works and the role of language structure in this process. Her book is a significant contribution to a vibrant and rapidly developing field.",

This publication may be downloaded and copied without charge for all reasonable, non-commercial educational purposes, provided no alterations in the text are made. I have had a great deal of help and feedback from many people in writing this book. Among the many scholars and friends I am indebted to are also would like to express my thanks to those scholars whose work has stimulated my own thinking in the early stages of the research reported on here: John Upshur, Leonard Newmark, and S. Pit Corder all recognized the reality of language \"acquisition\" in the adult long before I did. I would also like the thank Introduction This book is concerned with what has been called the \"Monitor Theory\" of adult second language acquisition. Monitor Theory hypothesizes that adults have two independent systems for developing ability in second languages, subconscious language acquisition and conscious language learning, and that these systems are interrelated in a definite way: subconscious acquisition appears to be far more important. The introduction is devoted to a brief statement of the theory and its implications for different aspects of second language acquisitions theory and practice. We define acquisition and learning, and present the Monitor Model for adult second language performance. Following this, brief summaries of research results in various areas of second language acquisition serve as both an overview of Monitor Theory research over the last few years and as introduction to the essays that follow. Language acquisition is very similar to the process children use in acquiring first and second languages. It requires meaningful interaction in the target language-natural communication-in which speakers are concerned not with the form of their utterances but with the messages they are conveying and understanding. Error correction and explicit teaching of rules are not relevant to language acquisition but caretakers and native speakers can modify their utterances addressed to acquirers to help them understand, and these modifications are thought to help the acquisition process (Snow and Ferguson, 1977). It has been hypothesized that there is a fairly stable order of acquisition of structures in language acquisition, that is, one can see clear 1 similarities across acquirers as to which structures tend to be acquired early and which tend to be acquired late (Brown, 1973; Dulay and Burt, 1975). Acquirers need not have a conscious awareness of the \"rules\" they possess, and may self-correct only on the basis of \u2026",

The Sixth Edition of Designing the User Interface provides a comprehensive, authoritative, and up-to-date introduction to the dynamic field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX) design. This classic book has defined and charted the astonishing evolution of user interfaces for three decades. Students and professionals learn practical principles and guidelines needed to develop high quality interface designs that users can understand, predict, and control. The book covers theoretical foundations and design processes such as expert reviews and usability testing. By presenting current research andinnovations in human-computer interaction, the authors strive toinspire students, guide designers, and provoke researchers to seek solutions that improve the experiences of novice and expert users, while achieving universal usability. The authors also provide balanced presentations on controversial topics such as augmented and virtual reality, voice and natural language interfaces, and information visualization. Updates include current HCI design methods, new design examples, and totally revamped coverage of social media, search and voice interaction. Major revisions were made toEVERY chapter, changing almost every figure (170 new color figures) and substantially updating the references.",

In this work, we propose a structure-aware neural architecture which decomposes the semantic parsing process into two stages. Given an input utterance, we first generate a rough sketch of its meaning, where low-level information (such as variable names and arguments) is glossed over. Then, we fill in missing details by taking into account the natural language input and the sketch itself. Experimental results on four datasets characteristic of different domains and meaning representations show that our approach consistently improves performance, achieving competitive results despite the use of relatively simple decoders.",

One such example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes that combine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature, light, or seismic sensors with networking and computation capabilities. Applications range from environmental control, warehouse inventory, and health care to military environments. Existing sensor networks assume that the sensors are preprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where the data is aggregated and stored for offline querying and analysis. This approach has two major drawbacks. First, the user cannot change the behavior of the system on the fly. Second, conservation of battery power is a major design factor, but a central system cannot make use of in-network programming, which trades costly communication for cheap local computation.In this paper, we introduce the Cougar approach to tasking sensor networks through declarative queries. Given a user query, a query optimizer generates an efficient query plan for in-network query processing, which can vastly reduce resource usage and thus extend the lifetime of a sensor network. In addition, since queries are asked in a declarative language, the user is shielded from the physical characteristics of the network. We give a short overview of sensor networks, propose a natural architecture for a data management system for sensor networks, and describe open research problems in this area.",

            "abstract": "A novel view of the syntax and semantics of quantifier scope that argues for a \"combinatory\" theory of natural language syntax. In Taking Scope, Mark Steedman considers the syntax and semantics of quantifier scope in interaction with negation, polarity, coordination, and pronominal binding, among other constructions. The semantics is \"surface compositional,\" in that there is a direct correspondence between syntactic types and operations of composition and types and compositions at the level of logical form. In that sense, the semantics is in the \"natural logic\" tradition of Aristotle, Leibniz, Frege, Russell, and others who sought to define a psychologically real logic directly reflecting natural language grammar. The book reunites the generative-transformational tradition initiated by Chomsky-which views the formal syntactic component as entirely autonomous--with the older, strongly lexicalist, construction-based tradition, which has sought to define a more lingistically transparent theory of meaning representation. Steedman offers a logical formalism that relates directly to the surface form of language and to the process of inference and proof that it must support. Such a natural logic, although formal by definition, should be allowed to grow organically from attested language phenomena rather than be axiomatized a priori in terms of any standard logic. Steedman also considers the application of natural semantic interpretations to practical natural language processing tasks, emphasizing throughout the elimination of traditional quantifiers from semantic formalism in favor of devices such as Skolem terms and structure-sharing among representations in processing.",

            "abstract": "Processing language requires the retrieval of concepts from memory in response to an ongoing stream of information. This retrieval is facilitated if one can infer the gist of a sentence, conversation, or document and use that gist to predict related concepts and disambiguate words. This article analyzes the abstract computational problem underlying the extraction and use of gist, formulating this problem as a rational statistical inference. This leads to a novel approach to semantic representation in which word meanings are represented in terms of a set of probabilistic topics. The topic model performs well in predicting word association and the effects of semantic association and ambiguity on a variety of language-processing and memory tasks. It also provides a foundation for developing more richly structured statistical models of language, as the generative process assumed in the topic model can easily be extended to incorporate other kinds of semantic and syntactic structure. Many aspects of perception and cognition can be understood by considering the computational problem that is addressed by a particular human capacity to closely approximate optimal statistical inferences. Cognitive capacities such as memory and categorization can be seen as systems for efficiently making predictions about the properties of an organism's environment (e.g., Anderson, 1990). Solving problems of inference and prediction requires sensitivity to the statistics of the environment. Surprisingly subtle aspects of human vision can be explained in terms of the statistics of natural scenes (Geisler, Perry, Super, & Gallo-gly, 2001; Simoncelli & Olshausen, 2001), and human memory seems to be tuned to the probabilities with which particular events occur in the world (Anderson & Schooler, 1991). Sensitivity to relevant world statistics also seems to guide important classes of cognitive judgments, such as inductive inferences about the properties of categories (Kemp, Perfors, & Tenenbaum, 2004), predictions about the durations or magnitudes of events (Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2006), and inferences about hidden common causes from patterns of coincidence (Griffiths & Tenenbaum, in press). In this article, we examine how the statistics of one very important aspect of the environment\u2014natural language\u2014 influence human memory. Our approach is motivated by an analysis of some of the computational problems addressed by semantic memory, in the spirit of Marr (1982) and Anderson (1990). Under many accounts of language processing, understanding sentences requires retrieving a variety of concepts from memory in response to an ongoing stream of information. One way to do this is to use \u2026",

But dictionary entries evolved for the convenience of human readers, not for machines. WordNet1 provides a more effective combination of traditional lexicographic information and modern computing. WordNet is an online lexical database designed for use under program control. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into sets of synonyms, each representing a lexicalized concept. Semantic relations link the synonym sets [4].",

            "abstract": "The approach described in this paper represents a substantive departure from the conventional quantitative techniques of system analysis. It has three main distinguishing features: 1) use of so-called ``linguistic'' variables in place of or in addition to numerical variables; 2) characterization of simple relations between variables by fuzzy conditional statements; and 3) characterization of complex relations by fuzzy algorithms. A linguistic variable is defined as a variable whose values are sentences in a natural or artificial language. Thus, if tall, not tall, very tall, very very tall, etc. are values of height, then height is a linguistic variable. Fuzzy conditional statements are expressions of the form IF A THEN B, where A and B have fuzzy meaning, e.g., IF x is small THEN y is large, where small and large are viewed as labels of fuzzy sets. A fuzzy algorithm is an ordered sequence of instructions which may contain fuzzy assignment and conditional statements, e.g., x = very small, IF x is small THEN Y is large. The execution of such instructions is governed by the compositional rule of inference and the rule of the preponderant alternative. By relying on the use of linguistic variables and fuzzy algorithms, the approach provides an approximate and yet effective means of describing the behavior of systems which are too complex or too ill-defined to admit of precise mathematical analysis.",

Our model makes use of a generalization of the commonly used Dirichlet distributions called Pitman-Yor processes which produce power-law distributions more closely resembling those in natural languages. We show that an approximation to the hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model recovers the exact formulation of interpolated Kneser-Ney, one of the best smoothing methods for n-gram language models. Experiments verify that our model gives cross entropy results superior to interpolated Kneser-Ney and comparable to modified Kneser-Ney.",

            "abstract": "In today's world, there is no shortage of information. However, for a specific information need, only a small subset of all of the available information will be useful. The field of information retrieval (IR) is the study of methods to provide users with that small subset of information relevant to their needs and to do so in a timely fashion. Information sources can take many forms, but this thesis will focus on text based information systems and investigate problems germane to the retrieval of written natural language documents. \n \nCentral to these problems is the notion of \"topic.\" In other words, what are documents about? However, topics depend on the semantics of documents and retrieval systems are not endowed with knowledge of the semantics of natural language. The approach taken in this thesis will be to make use of probabilistic language models to investigate text based information retrieval and related problems. \n \nOne such problem is the prediction of topic shifts in text, the topic segmentation problem. It will be shown that probabilistic methods can be used to predict topic changes in the context of the task of new event detection. Two complementary sets of features are studied individually and then combined into a single language model. The language modeling approach allows this problem to be approached in a principled way without complex semantic modeling. \n \nNext, the problem of document retrieval in response to a user query will be investigated. Models of document indexing and document retrieval have been extensively studied over the past three decades. The integration of these two classes of models has been the goal of several researchers but it is a very difficult problem. Much of the reason for this is that the indexing component requires inferences as to the semantics of documents. Instead, an approach to retrieval based on probabilistic language modeling will be presented. Models are estimated for each document individually. The approach to modeling is non-parametric and integrates the entire retrieval process into a single model. One advantage of this approach is that collection statistics, which are used heuristically for the assignment of concept probabilities in other probabilistic models, are used directly in the estimation of language model probabilities in this approach. The language modeling approach has been implemented and tested empirically and performs very well on standard test collections and query sets. \n \nIn order to improve retrieval effectiveness, IR systems use additional techniques such as relevance feedback, unsupervised query expansion and structured queries. These and other techniques are discussed in terms of the language modeling approach and empirical results are given for several of the techniques developed. These results provide further proof of concept for the use of language models for retrieval tasks.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Constraints appear in many areas of human endeavour starting from puzzles like crosswords (the words can only overlap at the same letter) and recently popular Sudoku (no number appears twice in a row) through everyday problems such as planning a meeting (the meeting room must accommodate all participants) till solving hard optimization problems for example in manufacturing scheduling (a job must finish before another job). Though all these problems look like being from completely different worlds, they all share a similar base \u2013 the task is to find values of decision variables, such as the start time of the job or the position of the number at a board, respecting given constraints. This problem is called a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Constraint processing emerged from AI research in 1970s (Montanary, 1974) when problems such as scene labelling were studied (Waltz, 1975). The goal of scene labelling was to recognize a type of line (and then a type of object) in the 2D picture of a 3D scene. The possible types were convex, concave, and occlud-ing lines and the combination of types was restricted at junctions of lines to be physically feasible. This scene labelling problem is probably the first problem formalised as a CSP and some techniques developed for solving this problem, namely arc consistency, are still in the core of constraint processing. Systematic use of constraints in programming systems has started in 1980s when researchers identified a similarity between unification in logic programming and constraint satisfaction (Gallaire, 1985) (Jaffar & Lassez, 1987). Constraint Logic Programming was born. Today Constraint Programming is a separate subject independent of the underlying programming language, though constraint logic programming still plays a prominent role thanks to natural integration of constraints into a logic programming framework. This article presents mainstream techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems. These techniques stay behind the existing constraint solvers and their understanding is important to exploit fully the available technology.",

Given a corpus of strings (such as text, transcribed speech, chromosome or protein sequence data, sheet music, etc.), our unsupervised algorithm recursively distills from it hierarchically structured patterns. The adios (automatic distillation of structure) algorithm relies on a statistical method for pattern extraction and on structured generalization, two processes that have been implicated in language acquisition. It has been evaluated on artificial context-free grammars with thousands of rules, on natural languages as diverse as English and Chinese, and on protein data correlating sequence with function. This unsupervised algorithm is capable of learning complex syntax, generating grammatical novel sentences, and proving useful in other fields that call for structure discovery from raw data, such as bioinformatics.",

This paper draws out the implications of this viewpoint for understanding the problem of language acquisition, which is cast in a new, and much more tractable, form. In essence, the child faces a problem of induction, where the objective is to coordinate with others (C-induction), rather than to model the structure of the natural world (N-induction). We argue that, of the two, C-induction is dramatically easier. More broadly, we argue that understanding the acquisition of any cultural form, whether linguistic or otherwise, during development, requires considering the corresponding question of how that cultural form arose through processes of cultural evolution. This perspective helps resolve the \"logical\" problem of language acquisition and has far-reaching implications for evolutionary psychology.",

Most interactions mentioned in the free text of biomedical publications are not yet contained in structured databases. Results: We developed RelEx, an approach for relation extraction from free text. It is based on natural language preprocessing producing dependency parse trees and applying a small number of simple rules to these trees. We applied RelEx on a comprehensive set of one million MEDLINE abstracts dealing with gene and protein relations and extracted ~150000 relations with an estimated perfomance of both 80% precision and 80% recall. Availability: The used natural language preprocessing tools are free for use for academic research. Test sets and relation term lists are available from our website (http://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/publications/RelEx/). Contact: katrin.fundel@bio.ifi.lmu.de",

            "abstract": "This paper explores a variety of different versions of the thesis that natural language is involved in human thinking. It distinguishes amongst strong and weak forms of this thesis, dismissing some as implausibly strong and others as uninterestingly weak. Strong forms dismissed include the view that language is conceptually necessary for thought (endorsed by many philosophers) and the view that language is de facto the medium of all human conceptual thinking (endorsed by many philosophers and social scientists). Weak forms include the view that language is necessary for the acquisition of many human concepts and the view that language can serve to scaffold human thought processes. The paper also discusses the thesis that language may be the medium of conscious propositional thinking, but argues that this cannot be its most fundamental cognitive role. The idea is then proposed that natural language is the medium for non-domain-specific thinking, serving to integrate the outputs of a variety of domain-specific conceptual faculties (or central-cognitive \u201cquasi-modules\u201d). Recent experimental evidence in support of this idea is reviewed and the implications of the idea are discussed, especially for our conception of the architecture of human cognition. Finally, some further kinds of evidence which might serve to corroborate or refute the hypothesis are mentioned. The overall goal of the paper is to review a wide variety of accounts of the cognitive function of natural language, integrating a number of different kinds of evidence and theoretical consideration in order to propose and elaborate the most plausible candidate.",

We set out a formal framework for analyzing cultural transmission, which allows us to investigate how innate learning biases are related to universal properties of language. We show that cultural transmission can magnify weak biases into strong linguistic universals, undermining one of the arguments for strong innate constraints on language learning. As a consequence, the strength of innate biases can be shielded from natural selection, allowing these genes to drift. Furthermore, even when there is no natural selection, cultural transmission can produce apparent adaptations. Cultural transmission thus provides an alternative to traditional nativist and adaptationist explanations for the properties of human languages.",

            "abstract": "Grammaticalization, the process of converting regular lexical items and structures into conventionally interpreted grammatical morphemes, has traditionally been perceived as a syntactic or morphological process. Presenting a wealth of evidence from African languages, the authors argue that the development of grammatical categories is in fact strongly influenced by pragmatic and cognitive forces, factors that are located outside the confines of language structure. They discuss previous models and relate grammaticalization studies to alternative approaches such as localism and natural grammar theory. This volume challenges theories which describe language as a static system, as well as those which assume that linguistic categorization is based on discrete morpheme types, word classes, or sentence constituents. In contrast, the book's central argument is that both language structure and language use are dynamic phenomena and that linguistic behavior is essentially a creative activity. That creativity manifests itself, for example, in conceptual transfer leading to the encoding of more abstract concepts and of grammatical categories. Another key element of this theory is captured in the term \"grammaticalization chain,\" which refers to a specific kind of linguistic category which cuts across morpheme types and word classes and has both a synchronic and diachronic dimension.",

This paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives. A central notion in the ontology is that of an elementary event-complex called a \"nucleus.\" A nucleus can be thought of as an association of a goal event, or \"culmination,\" with a \"preparatory process\" by which it is accomplished, and a \"consequent state,\" which ensues. Natural-language categories like aspects, futurates, adverbials, and when-clauses are argued to change the temporal/aspectual category of propositions under the control of such a nucleic knowledge representation structure. The same concept of a nucleus plays a central role in a theory of temporal reference, and of the semantics of tense, which we follow McCawley, Partee, and Isard in regarding as an anaphoric category. We claim that any manageable formalism for natural-language temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language.",

Three questions are asked as to (1) the structural properties of the BV, (2) the status of these properties and (3) why some structural properties of \u2018fully fledged\u2019 languages are more complex. First, we characterize the BV in four respects: its lexical repertoire, the principles according to which utterances are structured, and temporality and spatiality expressed. The organizational principles proposed are small in number, and interact. We analyse this interaction, describing how the BV is put to use in various complex verbal tasks, in order to establish both what its communicative potentialities are, and also those discourse contexts where the constraints come into conflict and where the variety breaks down. This latter phenomenon provides a partial answer to the third question,concerning the relative complexity of \u2018fully fledged\u2019 languages\u2013they have devices to deal with such cases. As for the second question, it is argued firstly that the empirically established continuity of the adult acquisition process precludes any assignment of the BV to a mode of linguistic expression (e.g., \u2018protolanguage\u2019) distinct from that of \u2018fully fledged\u2019 languages and, moreover, that the organizational constraints of the BV belong to the core attributes of the human language capacity, whereas a number of complexifications not attested in the BV are less central properties of this capacity. Finally, it is shown that the notion of feature strength, as used in recent versions of Generative Grammar, allows a straightforward characterization of the BV as a special case of an I-language, in the sense of this theory. Under this perspective, the acquisition of an Ilanguage beyond the BV can essentially be described as a change in feature strength.",

In statistical language modeling, large amounts of text are used to automatically determine the model's parameters. Language modeling is useful in automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and any other application that processes natural language with incomplete knowledge. In this thesis, I view language as an information source which emits a stream of symbols from a finite alphabet (the vocabulary). The goal of language modeling is then to identify and exploit sources of information in the language stream, so as to minimize its perceived entropy. Most existing statistical language models exploit the immediate past only. To extract information from further back in the document's history, I use trigger pairs as the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from many sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, I apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the NE solution. Language modeling, Adaptive language modeling, Statistical language modeling, Maximum entropy, Speech recognition.",

            "abstract": "In \"From Communication to Curriculum,\" Douglas Barnes argues that the kind of personal and conversational interaction that exists between teacher and pupil is a crucial aspect of the learning process. Using transcribed conversations from the classroom, he analyzes the different styles of discourse in use, showing the importance of relatively unstructured conversations in the work of schooling. Barnes rejects the view that some children fail in school because they have difficulty with language, emphasizing instead the inhibiting effects of rigid and formalized methods of teaching which are often in opposition to the natural patterns of inquiry which children develop outside school.",

            "abstract": "I would like to discuss an approach to the mind that considers language and similar phenomena to be elements of the natural world, to be studied by ordinary methods of empirical inquiry. I will be using the terms \"mind\" and \"mental\" here with no metaphysical import. Thus I understand \"mental\" to be on a par with \"chemical\", \"optical\", or \"electrical\". Certain phenomena, events, processes and states are informally called \"chemical\" etc., but no metaphysical divide is suggested thereby. The terms are used to select certain aspects of the world as a focus of inquiry. We do not seek to determine the true criterion of the chemical, or the mark of the electrical, or the boundaries of the optical. I will use \"mental\" the same way, with something like ordinary coverage, but no deeper implications. By \"mind\" I just mean the mental aspects of the world, with no more interest in sharpening the boundaries or finding a criterion than in other cases. I'll use the terms \"linguistic\" and \"language\" in much the same way. We focus attention on aspects of the world that fall under this informal rubric, and try to understand them better. In the course of doing so we may-and apparently do-develop a concept that more or less resembles the informal notion of \"language\", and. postulate that such objects are among the things in the world, alongside of complex molecules, electrical fields, the human visual system, and so on. A naturalistic approach to linguistic and mental aspects of the world seeks to construct intelligible explanatory theories, taking as \"real\" what we are led to posit in this quest, and hoping for eventual unification with the \"core\" natural sciences: unification, not necessarily reduction. Largescale reduction is rare in the history of the sciences. Commonly the more \"fundamental\" science has had to undergo radical revision for unification to proceed. The case of chemistry and physics is a recent example;",

This process can come about as a result of deliberate manipulation, or it can be the natural outcome of some internal learning strategy. It can vary quantitatively and qualitatively, not necessarily involv ing conscious analysis of rules. Externally induced salience may not neces sarily be registered by the learner and even when it is registered, it may not affect the learning mechanisms per se. Certain inferences are made about the interpretation of learner performance and ways of measuring it.",

The previous and the updated materials cover both theory and applications, and analyze its future directions. The goal of this tutorial survey is to introduce the emerging area of deep learning or hierarchical learning to the APSIPA community. Deep learning refers to a class of machine learning techniques, developed largely since 2006, where many stages of non-linear information processing in hierarchical architectures are exploited for pattern classification and for feature learning. In the more recent literature, it is also connected to representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level concepts are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level concepts help to define higher-level ones. In this tutorial survey, a brief history of deep learning research is discussed first. Then, a classificatory scheme is developed to analyze and summarize major work reported in the recent deep learning literature. Using this scheme, I provide a taxonomy-oriented survey on the existing deep architectures and algorithms in the literature, and categorize them into three classes: generative, discriminative, and hybrid. Three representative deep architectures \u2013 deep autoencoders, deep stacking networks with their generalization to the temporal domain (recurrent networks), and deep neural networks (pretrained with deep belief networks) \u2013 one in each of the three classes, are presented in more detail. Next, selected applications of deep learning are reviewed in broad areas of signal and information processing including audio/speech, image/vision, multimodality, language modeling, natural language processing, and information retrieval. Finally, future directions of deep learning are discussed and analyzed.",

            "abstract": "In this book Mark Steedman argues that the surface syntax of natural languages maps spoken and written forms directly to a compositional semantic representation that includes predicate-argument structure, quantification and information structure without constructing any intervening structural representation. His purpose is to construct a principle theory of natural grammar that is directly compatible with both expalantory linguistic accounts of a number of problematic syntactic phenomena and a straightforward computational account of the way sentences are mapped onto represenations of meaning. The radical nature of Steedman's proposal stems from his claim that much of the apparent complexity of syntax, prosody and processing follows from the lexical specification of the grammar and from the involvement of a small number of universal rule-types for combining predicates and arguments. These syntactic operations are related to the combinators of Combinatory Logic, engendering a much freer definition of derivational constituency than is traditionally assumed. This property allows Combinatory Categorical Grammar to capture elegantly the structure and interpretation of coordination and intonation contour in English as well as some well-known interactions between word order, coordination and relativization across a number of other languages. It also allows more direct compatibility with incremental semantic interpretation during parsing. The book covers topics in formal linguistics, intonational phonology, computational linguistics and experimental psycholinguistics, presenting them as an integrated theory of the language faculty in a form accessible to readers from any of those fields.",

But it could apply to almost any area of psycholinguistics, especially child language acquisition. Here, the age-old content vs. process controversy still chugs along. Do children innately contain linguistic information ? Or are they simply able to process it by means of superior cognitive skills ? This book is the latest offering from the process supporters, an approach pioneered by Dan Slobin (1973). Slobin, as is now well known, proposed that children use a set of ' operating principles' for processing language, such as 'Pay attention to the ends of words'; 'Pay attention to the order of words'. As time went by, and new crosslinguistic data were incorporated, the operating principles proliferated (Slobin, 1985). They conflicted with one another to the extent that they became meaningless, as there were no clear guides as to how the principles related to one another. MacWhinney & Bates's Competition Model, which the 13 papers in this book expound and illustrate, is the natural successor to Slobin's operating principles as indeed Slobin notes in his preface.",

            "abstract": "Introduction A number of years ago, the distinguished psychologist Charles Osgood became interested in the problem of language production (1971). He held the view that the study of production processes was the natural arena for exploring fundamental relations between cognitive structure and language forms. From his perspective, the focus of interest was the intention of speakers to achieve particular semantic and pragmatic consequence; those intentions drove, more or less directly, syntactic and lexical selection, and hence were the proper domain of study for the analysis of real-time sentence planning activities. He began his inquiry by asking what variation in language form was associated with changes of perspective and presupposition in a simple descriptive task. So, for example, he asked what perceptual and cognitive conditions would demonstrably trigger a shift from active to passive voice, what would trigger the use of a definite article, or the contrastive use of a modifier. And he was able to effect such changes by systematic alteration of the conditions in his scene description task. In this case, as in many others, Osgood was ahead of his time. Description, of language-particular processes was not then well developed, nor were there accessible characterizations of the conceptual-level semantic structures that interact with language structures to yield connected discourse. The experimental results he attained were, thus, not readily connected to formal linguistic and logical systems, and the theory of language-particular processes was only nascent. These problems are not solved at present, but the outlines of solutions have begun to emerge, and there are prospects for the serious pursuit of the goals Osgood avowed.",

Impairments in joint attention are among the earliest signs of the disorder and joint attention skills relate to outcome, both in the 'natural course' of autism and through being targeted in early intervention programmes. In the current study, concurrent and longitudinal associations between joint attention and other social communication abilities measured in a sample of infants with autism and related pervasive developmental disorders at age 20 months, and language and symptom severity at age 42 months, were examined. Extending the findings from previous studies, joint attention ability was positively associated with language gains and (lower) social and communication symptoms, and imitation ability was also positively associated with later language. Some specificity in the association between different aspects of joint attention behaviours and outcome was found: declarative, triadic gaze switching predicted language and symptom severity but imperative, dyadic eye contact behaviours did not. Further, although joint attention was associated with later social and language symptoms it was unrelated to repetitive and stereotyped symptoms, suggesting the latter may have a separate developmental trajectory. Possible deficits in psychological and neurological processes that might underlie the impaired development of joint attention in autism are discussed.",

The study showed that in many respects the development of comprehension of syntax and of morphological features follows the order in the mother tongue studies. Children of older ages learned much faster than younger children for the sample in the range of four through nine.",

It is focused on the question of maintaining a maximum diversity of languages by seeking to identify those ecological factors that sustain linguistic diversity. Linguistic diversity in turn is seen as a precondition for maintaining cultural and biological diversity. The ultimate aim of ecological language planning is to bring about an ecological balance which no longer requires management. Ecological language planning differs from most conventional approaches to language planning both in its aims (diversity rather than standardisation) and the means required (community involvement rather than specialist management). This article contains a number of new ideas for language planners as well as suggestions as to how to transform them into practice.",

As described in [GJW86], the process of centering attention on entities in the discourse gives rise to the intersentential transitional states of continuing, retaining and shifting. We propose an extension to these states which handles some additional cases of multiple ambiguous pronouns. The algorithm has been implemented in an HPSG natural language system which serves as the interface to a database query application.",

Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.",

This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms to certain denumerable\u2010state, hidden Markov processes. This algorithm permits automatic training of the stochastic analog of an arbitrary context free grammar. In particular, in contrast to many grammatical inference methods, the new algorithm allows the grammar to have an arbitrary degree of ambiguity. Since natural language is often syntactically ambiguous, it is necessary for the grammatical inference algorithm to allow for this ambiguity. Furthermore, allowing ambiguity in the grammar allows errors in the recognition process to be explicitly modeled in the grammar rather than added as an extra component.",

In classical theories of language, metaphor was seen as a matter of language not thought. Metaphorical expressions were assumed to be mutually exclusive with the realm of ordinary everyday language: everyday language had no metaphor, and metaphor used mechanisms outside the realm of everyday conventional language. The classical theory was taken so much for granted over the centuries that many people didn't realize that it was just a theory. The theory was not merely taken to be true, but came to be taken as definitional. The word \u201cmetaphorq was defined as a novel or poetic linguistic expression where one or more words for a concept are used outside of its normal conventional meaning to express a \u201csimilarq concept. But such issues are not matters for definitions; they are empirical questions. As a cognitive scientist and a linguist, one asks: What are the generalizations governing the linguistic expressions referred to classically as \u201cpoetic metaphors?q When this question is answered rigorously, the classical theory turns out to be false. The generalizations governing poetic metaphorical expressions are not in language, but in thought: They are general mappings across conceptual domains. Moreover, these general principles which take the form of conceptual mappings, apply not just to novel poetic expressions, but to much of ordinary everyday language. In short, the locus of metaphor is not in language at all, but in the way we conceptualize one mental domain in terms of another. The general theory of metaphor is given by characterizing such cross-domain mappings. And in the process, everyday abstract concepts like time, states, change, causation, and purpose also turn out to be metaphorical. The result is that metaphor (that is, cross-domain mapping) is absolutely central to ordinary natural language semantics, and that the study of literary metaphor is an extension of the study of everyday metaphor. Everyday metaphor is characterized by a huge system of thousands of cross-domain mappings, and this system is made use of in novel metaphor.",

Ernst Cassirer 1 ABSTRACT I begin by outlining some of the positions that have been taken by those who have reflected upon the nature of language. In his early work Wittgenstein asserts that language becomes meaningful when we tacitly adhere to the rules of logic. In his later work he claims that lan- guages become meaningful when they are situated within forms of life. Polanyi describes language as a toolbox for deploying our tacit awareness. A meaning is generated when a point of view attends from a subsidiary to a focal awareness. Languages re-present these meanings. Although all languages rely upon rules, what it is to be a meaning is not reduc- ible to rules. Nor is there a universal grammar. Because it renders abstract reflection possi- ble, language renders minds possible. A mind is not the product of an innate language of thought; it is a consequence of indwelling within a natural language. Indwelling within languages enables us to access new realities. Languages however do not supply us with the boundaries of the world. Not only do we know more than we can say, we can also say more than we know. The ultimate context of our linguistic meanings is not our social practices; it is our embodied awareness of the world. A representationalist account is in accordance with the view that minds are Turing machines. But the symbols processed by a Turing ma- chine derive their meaning from the agents that use them to achieve their purposes. Only if the processing of symbolic representations is related to the tacit context within which they become meaningful, does a semantic engine becomes possible.",

In this work we investigate how statistical machine translation techniques can be used to bridge the gap between natural language route instructions and a map of an environment built by a robot. Our approach uses training data to learn to translate from natural language instructions to an automatically-labeled map. The complexity of the translation process is controlled by taking advantage of physical constraints imposed by the map. As a result, our technique can efficiently handle uncertainty in both map labeling and parsing. Our experiments demonstrate the promising capabilities achieved by our approach.",

            "abstract": "Research in automatic analysis of sign language has largely focused on recognizing the lexical (or citation) form of sign gestures as they appear in continuous signing, and developing algorithms that scale well to large vocabularies. However, successful recognition of lexical signs is not sufficient for a full understanding of sign language communication. Nonmanual signals and grammatical processes which result in systematic variations in sign appearance are integral aspects of this communication but have received comparatively little attention in the literature. In this survey, we examine data acquisition, feature extraction and classification methods employed for the analysis of sign language gestures. These are discussed with respect to issues such as modeling transitions between signs in continuous signing, modeling inflectional processes, signer independence, and adaptation. We further examine works that attempt to analyze nonmanual signals and discuss issues related to integrating these with (hand) sign gestures. We also discuss the overall progress toward a true test of sign recognition systems--dealing with natural signing by native signers. We suggest some future directions for this research and also point to contributions it can make to other fields of research. Web-based supplemental materials (appendicies) which contain several illustrative examples and videos of signing can be found at www.computer.org/publications/dlib.",
