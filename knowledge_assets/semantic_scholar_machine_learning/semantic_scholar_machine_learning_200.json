Despite this interest and the volume and velocity of work that has been produced recently, the fundamental science of fairness in machine learning is still in a nascent state. In March 2018, we convened a group of experts as part of a CCC visioning workshop to assess the state of the field, and distill the most promising research directions going forward. This report summarizes the findings of that workshop. Along the way, it surveys recent theoretical work in the field and points towards promising directions for research.",

However, since it is knowledge- and labor-intensive to pursue good learning performance, human experts are heavily involved in every aspect of machine learning. In order to make machine learning techniques easier to apply and reduce the demand for experienced human experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a hot topic with both industrial and academic interest. In this paper, we provide an up to date survey on AutoML. First, we introduce and define the AutoML problem, with inspiration from both realms of automation and machine learning. Then, we propose a general AutoML framework that not only covers most existing approaches to date but also can guide the design for new methods. Subsequently, we categorize and review the existing works from two aspects, i.e., the problem setup and the employed techniques. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of AutoML approaches and explain the reasons underneath their successful applications. We hope this survey can serve as not only an insightful guideline for AutoML beginners but also an inspiration for future research.",

Integration of machine learning with clinical decision support tools, such as computerized alerts or diagnostic support, may offer physicians and others who provide health care targeted and timely information that can improve clinical decisions. Machine learning algorithms, however, may also be subject to biases. The biases include those related to missing data and patients not identified by algorithms, sample size and underestimation, and misclassification and measurement error. There is concern that biases and deficiencies in the data used by machine learning algorithms may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in health care. This Special Communication outlines the potential biases that may be introduced into machine learning\u2013based clinical decision support tools that use electronic health record data and proposes potential solutions to the problems of overreliance on automation, algorithms based on biased data, and algorithms that do not provide information that is clinically meaningful. Existing health care disparities should not be amplified by thoughtless or excessive reliance on machines.",

            "abstract": "Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. So far it was unclear how much risk adversarial perturbations carry for the safety of real-world machine learning applications because most methods used to generate such perturbations rely either on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in most real-world scenarios. In many such cases one currently needs to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com. The Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in general open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems. An implementation of the attack is available as part of Foolbox at this https URL .",

            "abstract": "Data collection is a major bottleneck in machine learning and an active research topic in multiple communities. There are largely two reasons data collection has recently become a critical issue. First, as machine learning is becoming more widely-used, we are seeing new applications that do not necessarily have enough labeled data. Second, unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning techniques automatically generate features, which saves feature engineering costs, but in return may require larger amounts of labeled data. Interestingly, recent research in data collection comes not only from the machine learning, natural language, and computer vision communities, but also from the data management community due to the importance of handling large amounts of data. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive study of data collection from a data management point of view. Data collection largely consists of data acquisition, data labeling, and improvement of existing data or models. We provide a research landscape of these operations, provide guidelines on which technique to use when, and identify interesting research challenges. The integration of machine learning and data management for data collection is part of a larger trend of Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration and opens many opportunities for new research.",

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.",

But these models usually operate as black boxes: While they are good at predicting, they are often not interpretable. Many inherently interpretable models have been suggested, which come at the cost of losing predictive power. Another option is to apply interpretability methods to a black box model after model training. Given the velocity of research on new machine learning models, it is preferable to have model-agnostic tools which can be applied to a random forest as well as to a neural network. Tools for model-agnostic interpretability methods should improve the adoption of machine learning.",

Deep learning can also be known as new trend of machine learning. This paper gives a light on basic architecture of Deep learning. A comparative study of machine learning and deep learning is also given in the paper and allows researcher to have a broad view on these techniques so that they can understand which one will be preferable solution for a particular problem.",

Jean et al. combined nighttime maps with high-resolution daytime satellite images (see the Perspective by Blumenstock). With a bit of machine-learning wizardry, the combined images can be converted into accurate estimates of household consumption and assets, both of which are hard to measure in poorer countries. Furthermore, the night- and day-time data are publicly available and nonproprietary. Science, this issue p. 790; see also p. 753 Satellites collect data that can be used to measure income and wealth. Reliable data on economic livelihoods remain scarce in the developing world, hampering efforts to study these outcomes and to design policies that improve them. Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African countries\u2014Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda\u2014we show how a convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can explain up to 75% of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.",

Amid a growing focus on \"Big Data,\" it offers epidemiologists new tools to tackle problems for which classical methods are not well-suited. In order to critically evaluate the value of integrating machine learning algorithms and existing methods, however, it is essential to address language and technical barriers between the two fields that can make it difficult for epidemiologists to read and assess machine learning studies. Here, we provide an overview of the concepts and terminology used in machine learning literature, which encompasses a diverse set of tools with goals ranging from prediction, to classification, to clustering. We provide a brief introduction to five common machine learning algorithms and four ensemble-based approaches. We then summarize epidemiological applications of machine learning techniques in the published literature. We recommend approaches to incorporate machine learning in epidemiological research and discuss opportunities and challenges for integrating machine learning and existing epidemiological research methods.",

            "abstract": "Survival analysis is a subfield of statistics where the goal is to analyze and model data where the outcome is the time until an event of interest occurs. One of the main challenges in this context is the presence of instances whose event outcomes become unobservable after a certain time point or when some instances do not experience any event during the monitoring period. This so-called censoring can be handled most effectively using survival analysis techniques. Traditionally, statistical approaches have been widely developed in the literature to overcome the issue of censoring. In addition, many machine learning algorithms have been adapted to deal with such censored data and tackle other challenging problems that arise in real-world data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of the statistical methods typically used and the machine learning techniques developed for survival analysis, along with a detailed taxonomy of the existing methods. We also discuss several topics that are closely related to survival analysis and describe several successful applications in a variety of real-world application domains. We hope that this article will give readers a more comprehensive understanding of recent advances in survival analysis and offer some guidelines for applying these approaches to solve new problems arising in applications involving censored data.",

A growing body of prior work demonstrates that models produced by these algorithms may leak specific private information in the training data to an attacker, either through the models' structure or their observable behavior. However, the underlying cause of this privacy risk is not well understood beyond a handful of anecdotal accounts that suggest overfitting and influence might play a role. This paper examines the effect that overfitting and influence have on the ability of an attacker to learn information about the training data from machine learning models, either through training set membership inference or attribute inference attacks. Using both formal and empirical analyses, we illustrate a clear relationship between these factors and the privacy risk that arises in several popular machine learning algorithms. We find that overfitting is sufficient to allow an attacker to perform membership inference and, when the target attribute meets certain conditions about its influence, attribute inference attacks. Interestingly, our formal analysis also shows that overfitting is not necessary for these attacks and begins to shed light on what other factors may be in play. Finally, we explore the connection between membership inference and attribute inference, showing that there are deep connections between the two that lead to effective new attacks.",

            "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) broadly refers to analytical algorithms that iteratively learn from data, allowing computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look. These include a family of operations encompassing several terms like machine learning, cognitive learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning-based methods that can be used to integrate and interpret complex biomedical and healthcare data in scenarios where traditional statistical methods may not be able to perform. In this review article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential data sources exist; evaluate the need for machine learning; and examine the potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide clinical care; use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely phenotype complex disease; and the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence. A critical understanding of the strength and limitations of various methods and tasks amenable to machine learning is vital. By leveraging the growing corpus of big data in medicine, we detail pathways by which machine learning may facilitate optimal development of patient-specific models for improving diagnoses, intervention and outcome in cardiovascular medicine.",

In this paper, we provide a review of how such statistical models can be \u201ctrained\u201d on large knowledge graphs, and then used to predict new facts about the world (which is equivalent to predicting new edges in the graph). In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive data sets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google's knowledge vault project as an example of such combination.",

Regardless of successful applications of machine learning algorithms in many scenarios, e.g., facial recognition, malware detection, automatic driving, and intrusion detection, these algorithms and corresponding training data are vulnerable to a variety of security threats, inducing a significant performance decrease. Hence, it is vital to call for further attention regarding security threats and corresponding defensive techniques of machine learning, which motivates a comprehensive survey in this paper. Until now, researchers from academia and industry have found out many security threats against a variety of learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), principle component analysis, clustering, and prevailing deep neural networks. Thus, we revisit existing security threats and give a systematic survey on them from two aspects, the training phase and the testing/inferring phase. After that, we categorize current defensive techniques of machine learning into four groups: security assessment mechanisms, countermeasures in the training phase, those in the testing or inferring phase, data security, and privacy. Finally, we provide five notable trends in the research on security threats and defensive techniques of machine learning, which are worth doing in-depth studies in future.",

Alongside widespread use in image recognition, language processing, and data mining, machine learning techniques have received increasing attention in medical applications, ranging from automated imaging analysis to disease forecasting. This review examines the parallel progress made in epilepsy, highlighting applications in automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG), video, and kinetic data, automated imaging analysis and pre\u2010surgical planning, prediction of medication response, and prediction of medical and surgical outcomes using a wide variety of data sources. A brief overview of commonly used machine learning approaches, as well as challenges in further application of machine learning techniques in epilepsy, is also presented. With increasing computational capabilities, availability of effective machine learning algorithms, and accumulation of larger datasets, clinicians and researchers will increasingly benefit from familiarity with these techniques and the significant progress already made in their application in epilepsy.",

This virtual world has generated vast amount of data which is accelerating the adoption of machine learning solutions & practices. Machine Learning enables computers to imitate and adapt human-like behaviour. Using machine learning, each interaction, each action performed, becomes something the system can learn and use as experience for the next time. This work is an overview of this data analytics method which enables computers to learn and do what comes naturally to humans, i.e. learn from experience. It includes the preliminaries of machine learning, the definition, nomenclature and applications\u2019 describing it\u2019s what, how and why. The technology roadmap of machine learning is discussed to understand and verify its potential as a market & industry practice. The primary intent of this work is to give insight into why machine learning is the future.",

Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology\u2019s near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.",

PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was designed from first principles to support an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.",

The package allows models to be written using Julia\u2019s simple mathematical syntax, and applies automatic differentiation (AD) to seamlessly calculate derivatives and train the model. Meanwhile, it makes heavy use of Julia\u2019s language and compiler features to carry out code analysis and make optimisations. For example, Julia\u2019s GPU compilation support (Besard, Foket, and De Sutter 2017) can be used to JIT-compile custom GPU kernels for model layers (Innes and others 2017a).",

Such systems cannot reason about interventions and retrospection and, therefore, cannot serve as the basis for strong AI. To achieve human level intelligence, learning machines need the guidance of a model of reality, similar to the ones used in causal inference. To demonstrate the essential role of such models, I will present a summary of seven tasks which are beyond reach of current machine learning systems and which have been accomplished using the tools of causal inference.",

            "abstract": "Machine-Learning tasks are becoming pervasive in a broad range of domains, and in a broad range of systems (from embedded systems to data centers). At the same time, a small set of machine-learning algorithms (especially Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks, i.e., CNNs and DNNs) are proving to be state-of-the-art across many applications. As architectures evolve towards heterogeneous multi-cores composed of a mix of cores and accelerators, a machine-learning accelerator can achieve the rare combination of efficiency (due to the small number of target algorithms) and broad application scope. Until now, most machine-learning accelerator designs have focused on efficiently implementing the computational part of the algorithms. However, recent state-of-the-art CNNs and DNNs are characterized by their large size. In this study, we design an accelerator for large-scale CNNs and DNNs, with a special emphasis on the impact of memory on accelerator design, performance and energy. We show that it is possible to design an accelerator with a high throughput, capable of performing 452 GOP/s (key NN operations such as synaptic weight multiplications and neurons outputs additions) in a small footprint of 3.02 mm2 and 485 mW; compared to a 128-bit 2GHz SIMD processor, the accelerator is 117.87x faster, and it can reduce the total energy by 21.08x. The accelerator characteristics are obtained after layout at 65 nm. Such a high throughput in a small footprint can open up the usage of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in a broad set of systems and for a broad set of applications.",

Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets, e.g., multivariate analysis of activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically used in decoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, while unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g., resting state functional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering different functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to perform some key analysis steps. Scikit-learn contains a very large set of statistical learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, and its application to neuroimaging data provides a versatile tool to study the brain.",

Biologists are asking for more efficient methods to meet the identification demand. Smart mobile devices, digital cameras as well as the mass digitisation of natural history collections led to an explosion of openly available image data depicting living organisms. This rapid increase in biological image data in combination with modern machine learning methods, such as deep learning, offers tremendous opportunities for automated species identification. In this paper, we focus on deep learning neural networks as a technology that enabled breakthroughs in automated species identification in the last 2 years. In order to stimulate more work in this direction, we provide a brief overview of machine learning frameworks applicable to the species identification problem. We review selected deep learning approaches for image based species identification and introduce publicly available applications. Eventually, this article aims to provide insights into the current state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art in automated identification and to serve as a starting point for researchers willing to apply novel machine learning techniques in their biological studies. While modern machine learning approaches only slowly pave their way into the field of species identification, we argue that we are going to see a proliferation of these techniques being applied to the problem in the future. Artificial intelligence systems will provide alternative tools for taxonomic identification in the near future.",

We illustrate this theory through numerical experiments. We also argue that the theory applies to certain other machine learning methods for time series prediction.",

            "abstract": "Even todays most advanced machine learning models are easily fooled by almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. Foolbox is a new Python package to generate such adversarial perturbations and to quantify and compare the robustness of machine learning models. It is build around the idea that the most comparable robustness measure is the minimum perturbation needed to craft an adversarial example. To this end, Foolbox provides reference implementations of most published adversarial attack methods alongside some new ones, all of which perform internal hyperparameter tuning to find the minimum adversarial perturbation. Additionally, Foolbox interfaces with most popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Theano and MXNet and allows different adversarial criteria such as targeted misclassification and top-k misclassification as well as different distance measures. The code is licensed under the MIT license and is openly available at https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox. The most up-to-date documentation can be found at http://foolbox.readthedocs.io. In 2013, Szegedy et al. demonstrated that minimal perturbations, often almost imperceptible to humans, can have devastating effects on machine predictions. These so-called adversarial perturbations thus demonstrate a striking difference between human and machine perception. As a result, adversarial perturbations have been subject to many Equal contribution Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, T\u00fcbingen, Germany International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems, T\u00fcbingen, Germany Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, T\u00fcbingen, Germany Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany.

Reliable Machine Learning in the Wild Workshop, 34 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Sydney, Australia, 2017. studies concerning the generation of such perturbations and strategies to protect machine learning models such as deep neural networks against them. A practical definition of the robustness R of a model, first used by Szegedy et al. (2013), is the average size of the minimum adversarial perturbation \u03c1(x) across many samples x, R = \u3008\u03c1(x)\u3009 x where (1) \u03c1(x) = min \u03b4 d(x,x+ \u03b4) s.t. x+ \u03b4 is adversarial (2) and d(\u00b7) is some distance measure. Unfortunately, finding the global minimum adversarial perturbation is close to impossible in any practical setting, and we thus employ heuristic attacks to find a suitable approximation. Such heuristics, however, can fail, in which case we could easily be mislead to believe that a model is robust (Brendel & Bethge, 2017). Our best strategy is thus to employ as many attacks as possible, and to use the minimal perturbation found across all attacks as an approximation to the true global minimum. At the moment, however, such a strategy is severely obstructed by two problems: first, the code for most known attack methods is either not available at all, or only available for one particular deep learning framework. Second, implementations of the same attack often differ in many details and are thus not directly comparable. Foolbox improves upon the existing Python package cleverhans by Papernot et al. (2016b) in three important aspects: 1. It interfaces with most popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Theano, Lasagne and MXNet and provides a straight forward way to add support for other frameworks, 2. it provides reference implementations for more than 15 adversarial attacks with a simple and consistent API, and 3. it supports many different criteria for adversarial examples, including custom ones. This technical report is structured as follows: In section 1 we provide an overview over Foolbox and demonstrate Foolbox: A Python toolbox to benchmark the robustness of machine learning models how to benchmark a model and report the result. In section 2 we describe the adversarial attack methods that are implemented in Foolbox and explain the internal hyperparameter tuning.",

Examples include AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam. We show that for simple overparameterized problems, adaptive methods often find drastically different solutions than gradient descent (GD) or stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We construct an illustrative binary classification problem where the data is linearly separable, GD and SGD achieve zero test error, and AdaGrad, Adam, and RMSProp attain test errors arbitrarily close to half. We additionally study the empirical generalization capability of adaptive methods on several state-of-the-art deep learning models. We observe that the solutions found by adaptive methods generalize worse (often significantly worse) than SGD, even when these solutions have better training performance. These results suggest that practitioners should reconsider the use of adaptive methods to train neural networks.",

In this article, we survey this work. We contrast programming languages against natural languages and discuss how these similarities and differences drive the design of probabilistic models. We present a taxonomy based on the underlying design principles of each model and use it to navigate the literature. Then, we review how researchers have adapted these models to application areas and discuss cross-cutting and application-specific challenges and opportunities.",

            "abstract": "Many companies are deploying services, either for consumers or industry, which are largely based on machine-learning algorithms for sophisticated processing of large amounts of data. The state-of-the-art and most popular such machine-learning algorithms are Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNNs and DNNs), which are known to be both computationally and memory intensive. A number of neural network accelerators have been recently proposed which can offer high computational capacity/area ratio, but which remain hampered by memory accesses. However, unlike the memory wall faced by processors on general-purpose workloads, the CNNs and DNNs memory footprint, while large, is not beyond the capability of the on chip storage of a multi-chip system. This property, combined with the CNN/DNN algorithmic characteristics, can lead to high internal bandwidth and low external communications, which can in turn enable high-degree parallelism at a reasonable area cost. In this article, we introduce a custom multi-chip machine-learning architecture along those lines. We show that, on a subset of the largest known neural network layers, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 450.65x over a GPU, and reduce the energy by 150.31x on average for a 64-chip system. We implement the node down to the place and route at 28nm, containing a combination of custom storage and computational units, with industry-grade interconnects.",

Traditional machine learning algorithms have been applied in many application areas. Researchers have put many efforts to improve the accuracy of that machinelearning algorithms. Another dimension was given thought which leads to deep learning concept. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. So far few applications of deep learning have been explored. This is definitely going to cater to solving issues in several new application domains, sub-domains using deep learning. A review of these past and future application domains, sub-domains, and applications of machine learning and deep learning are illustrated in this paper.",

Different from the vanilla SGD and other modern stochastic methods such as SVRG, S2GD, SAG and SAGA, SARAH admits a simple recursive framework for updating stochastic gradient estimates; when comparing to SAG/SAGA, SARAH does not require a storage of past gradients. The linear convergence rate of SARAH is proven under strong convexity assumption. We also prove a linear convergence rate (in the strongly convex case) for an inner loop of SARAH, the property that SVRG does not possess. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.",

The challenge is that of assisting the radio in intelligent adaptive learning and decision making, so that the diverse requirements of next-generation wireless networks can be satisfied. Machine learning is one of the most promising artificial intelligence tools, conceived to support smart radio terminals. Future smart 5G mobile terminals are expected to autonomously access the most meritorious spectral bands with the aid of sophisticated spectral efficiency learning and inference, in order to control the transmission power, while relying on energy efficiency learning/inference and simultaneously adjusting the transmission protocols with the aid of quality of service learning/inference. Hence we briefly review the rudimentary concepts of machine learning and propose their employment in the compelling applications of 5G networks, including cognitive radios, massive MIMOs, femto/small cells, heterogeneous networks, smart grid, energy harvesting, device-todevice communications, and so on. Our goal is to assist the readers in refining the motivation, problem formulation, and methodology of powerful machine learning algorithms in the context of future networks in order to tap into hitherto unexplored applications and services.",

Here, we use this approach to test the hypothesis that the inefficiency of the cryptocurrency market can be exploited to generate abnormal profits. We analyse daily data for 1,681 cryptocurrencies for the period between Nov. 2015 and Apr. 2018. We show that simple trading strategies assisted by state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms outperform standard benchmarks. Our results show that nontrivial, but ultimately simple, algorithmic mechanisms can help anticipate the short-term evolution of the cryptocurrency market.",

The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability ; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning ; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PACBayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and nonexpert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.",

            "abstract": "Propelled partly by the Materials Genome Initiative, and partly by the algorithmic developments and the resounding successes of data-driven efforts in other domains, informatics strategies are beginning to take shape within materials science. These approaches lead to surrogate machine learning models that enable rapid predictions based purely on past data rather than by direct experimentation or by computations/simulations in which fundamental equations are explicitly solved. Data-centric informatics methods are becoming useful to determine material properties that are hard to measure or compute using traditional methods--due to the cost, time or effort involved--but for which reliable data either already exists or can be generated for at least a subset of the critical cases. Predictions are typically interpolative, involving fingerprinting a material numerically first, and then following a mapping (established via a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property of interest. Fingerprints may be of many types and scales, as dictated by the application domain and needs. Predictions may also be extrapolative--extending into new materials spaces--provided prediction uncertainties are properly taken into account. This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the recent successful data-driven \"materials informatics\" strategies undertaken in the last decade, and identifies some challenges the community is facing and those that should be overcome in the near future.",

            "abstract": "There are several aspects that might influence the performance achieved by existing learning systems. It has been reported that one of these aspects is related to class imbalance in which examples in training data belonging to one class heavily outnumber the examples in the other class. In this situation, which is found in real world data describing an infrequent but important event, the learning system may have difficulties to learn the concept related to the minority class. In this work we perform a broad experimental evaluation involving ten methods, three of them proposed by the authors, to deal with the class imbalance problem in thirteen UCI data sets. Our experiments provide evidence that class imbalance does not systematically hinder the performance of learning systems. In fact, the problem seems to be related to learning with too few minority class examples in the presence of other complicating factors, such as class overlapping. Two of our proposed methods deal with these conditions directly, allying a known over-sampling method with data cleaning methods in order to produce better-defined class clusters. Our comparative experiments show that, in general, over-sampling methods provide more accurate results than under-sampling methods considering the area under the ROC curve (AUC). This result seems to contradict results previously published in the literature. Two of our proposed methods, Smote + Tomek and Smote + ENN, presented very good results for data sets with a small number of positive examples. Moreover, Random over-sampling, a very simple over-sampling method, is very competitive to more complex over-sampling methods. Since the over-sampling methods provided very good performance results, we also measured the syntactic complexity of the decision trees induced from over-sampled data. Our results show that these trees are usually more complex then the ones induced from original data. Random over-sampling usually produced the smallest increase in the mean number of induced rules and Smote + ENN the smallest increase in the mean number of conditions per rule, when compared among the investigated over-sampling methods.",

            "abstract": "Background Current approaches to predict cardiovascular risk fail to identify many people who would benefit from preventive treatment, while others receive unnecessary intervention. Machine-learning offers opportunity to improve accuracy by exploiting complex interactions between risk factors. We assessed whether machine-learning can improve cardiovascular risk prediction. Methods Prospective cohort study using routine clinical data of 378,256 patients from UK family practices, free from cardiovascular disease at outset. Four machine-learning algorithms (random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting machines, neural networks) were compared to an established algorithm (American College of Cardiology guidelines) to predict first cardiovascular event over 10-years. Predictive accuracy was assessed by area under the \u2018receiver operating curve\u2019 (AUC); and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) to predict 7.5% cardiovascular risk (threshold for initiating statins). Findings 24,970 incident cardiovascular events (6.6%) occurred. Compared to the established risk prediction algorithm (AUC 0.728, 95% CI 0.723\u20130.735), machine-learning algorithms improved prediction: random forest +1.7% (AUC 0.745, 95% CI 0.739\u20130.750), logistic regression +3.2% (AUC 0.760, 95% CI 0.755\u20130.766), gradient boosting +3.3% (AUC 0.761, 95% CI 0.755\u20130.766), neural networks +3.6% (AUC 0.764, 95% CI 0.759\u20130.769). The highest achieving (neural networks) algorithm predicted 4,998/7,404 cases (sensitivity 67.5%, PPV 18.4%) and 53,458/75,585 non-cases (specificity 70.7%, NPV 95.7%), correctly predicting 355 (+7.6%) more patients who developed cardiovascular disease compared to the established algorithm. Conclusions Machine-learning significantly improves accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction, increasing the number of patients identified who could benefit from preventive treatment, while avoiding unnecessary treatment of others.",

            "abstract": "The Big Data revolution promises to transform how we live, work, and think by enabling process optimization, empowering insight discovery and improving decision making. The realization of this grand potential relies on the ability to extract value from such massive data through data analytics; machine learning is at its core because of its ability to learn from data and provide data driven insights, decisions, and predictions. However, traditional machine learning approaches were developed in a different era, and thus are based upon multiple assumptions, such as the data set fitting entirely into memory, what unfortunately no longer holds true in this new context. These broken assumptions, together with the Big Data characteristics, are creating obstacles for the traditional techniques. Consequently, this paper compiles, summarizes, and organizes machine learning challenges with Big Data. In contrast to other research that discusses challenges, this work highlights the cause\u2013effect relationship by organizing challenges according to Big Data Vs or dimensions that instigated the issue: volume, velocity, variety, or veracity. Moreover, emerging machine learning approaches and techniques are discussed in terms of how they are capable of handling the various challenges with the ultimate objective of helping practitioners select appropriate solutions for their use cases. Finally, a matrix relating the challenges and approaches is presented. Through this process, this paper provides a perspective on the domain, identifies research gaps and opportunities, and provides a strong foundation and encouragement for further research in the field of machine learning with Big Data.",

We are now at the beginning of an even larger and more rapid transformation due to recent advances in machine learning (ML), which is capable of accelerating the pace of automation itself. However, although it is clear that ML is a \u201cgeneral purpose technology,\u201d like the steam engine and electricity, which spawns a plethora of additional innovations and capabilities (2), there is no widely shared agreement on the tasks where ML systems excel, and thus little agreement on the specific expected impacts on the workforce and on the economy more broadly. We discuss what we see to be key implications for the workforce, drawing on our rubric of what the current generation of ML systems can and cannot do [see the supplementary materials (SM)]. Although parts of many jobs may be \u201csuitable for ML\u201d (SML), other tasks within these same jobs do not fit the criteria for ML well; hence, effects on employment are more complex than the simple replacement and substitution story emphasized by some. Although economic effects of ML are relatively limited today, and we are not facing the imminent \u201cend of work\u201d as is sometimes proclaimed, the implications for the economy and the workforce going forward are profound.",

In recent years, significant attempts are made for the enhancement of computer aided diagnosis applications because errors in medical diagnostic systems can result in seriously misleading medical treatments. Machine learning is important in Computer Aided Diagnosis. After using an easy equation, objects such as organs may not be indicated accurately. So, pattern recognition fundamentally involves learning from examples. In the field of bio-medical, pattern recognition and machine learning promise the improved accuracy of perception and diagnosis of disease. They also promote the objectivity of decision-making process. For the analysis of high-dimensional and multimodal bio-medical data, machine learning offers a worthy approach for making classy and automatic algorithms. This survey paper provides the comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms for diagnosis of different diseases such as heart disease, diabetes disease, liver disease, dengue disease and hepatitis disease. It brings attention towards the suite of machine learning algorithms and tools that are used for the analysis of diseases and decision-making process accordingly.",

The respective underlying fields of research -- quantum information (QI) versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) -- have their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our \"big data\" world. Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.",

            "abstract": "A vast majority of machine learning algorithms train their models and perform inference by solving optimization problems. In order to capture the learning and prediction problems accurately, structural constraints such as sparsity or low rank are frequently imposed or else the objective itself is designed to be a non-convex function. This is especially true of algorithms that operate in high-dimensional spaces or that train non-linear models such as tensor models and deep networks.  The freedom to express the learning problem as a non-convex optimization problem gives immense modeling power to the algorithm designer, but often such problems are NP-hard to solve.  A popular workaround to this has been to relax non-convex problems to convex ones and use traditional methods to solve the (convex) relaxed optimization problems. However this approach may be lossy and nevertheless presents significant challenges for large scale optimization.  On the other hand, direct approaches to non-convex optimization have met with resounding success in several domains and remain the methods of choice for the practitioner, as they frequently outperform relaxation-based techniques - popular heuristics include projected gradient descent and alternating minimization. However, these are often poorly understood in terms of their convergence and other properties.  This monograph presents a selection of recent advances that bridge a long-standing gap in our understanding of these heuristics. We hope that an insight into the inner workings of these methods will allow the reader to appreciate the unique marriage of task structure and generative models that allow these heuristic techniques to (provably) succeed. The monograph will lead the reader through several widely used non-convex optimization techniques, as well as applications thereof. The goal of this monograph is to both, introduce the rich literature in this area, as well as equip the reader with the tools and techniques needed to analyze these simple procedures for non-convex problems.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning is a technique for recognizing patterns that can be applied to medical images. Although it is a powerful tool that can help in rendering medical diagnoses, it can be misapplied. Machine learning typically begins with the machine learning algorithm system computing the image features that are believed to be of importance in making the prediction or diagnosis of interest. The machine learning algorithm system then identifies the best combination of these image features for classifying the image or computing some metric for the given image region. There are several methods that can be used, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are open-source versions of most of these machine learning methods that make them easy to try and apply to images. Several metrics for measuring the performance of an algorithm exist; however, one must be aware of the possible associated pitfalls that can result in misleading metrics. More recently, deep learning has started to be used; this method has the benefit that it does not require image feature identification and calculation as a first step; rather, features are identified as part of the learning process. Machine learning has been used in medical imaging and will have a greater influence in the future. Those working in medical imaging must be aware of how machine learning works. \u00a9RSNA, 2017.",

Determining the stability of molecules and condensed phases is the cornerstone of atomistic modeling, underpinning our understanding of chemical and materials properties and transformations. We show that a machine-learning model, based on a local description of chemical environments and Bayesian statistical learning, provides a unified framework to predict atomic-scale properties. It captures the quantum mechanical effects governing the complex surface reconstructions of silicon, predicts the stability of different classes of molecules with chemical accuracy, and distinguishes active and inactive protein ligands with more than 99% reliability. The universality and the systematic nature of our framework provide new insight into the potential energy surface of materials and molecules.",

Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety of users and models.

Using conservation of energy\u2014a fundamental property of closed classical and quantum mechanical systems\u2014we develop an efficient gradient-domain machine learning (GDML) approach to construct accurate molecular force fields using a restricted number of samples from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories. The GDML implementation is able to reproduce global potential energy surfaces of intermediate-sized molecules with an accuracy of 0.3 kcal mol\u22121 for energies and 1 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u030a\u22121 for atomic forces using only 1000 conformational geometries for training. We demonstrate this accuracy for AIMD trajectories of molecules, including benzene, toluene, naphthalene, ethanol, uracil, and aspirin. The challenge of constructing conservative force fields is accomplished in our work by learning in a Hilbert space of vector-valued functions that obey the law of energy conservation. The GDML approach enables quantitative molecular dynamics simulations for molecules at a fraction of cost of explicit AIMD calculations, thereby allowing the construction of efficient force fields with the accuracy and transferability of high-level ab initio methods.",

In order to keep up with state-of-the-art experiments and the ever growing complexity of the investigated problems, there is a constantly increasing need for simulations of more realistic, i.e., larger, model systems with improved accuracy. In many cases, the availability of sufficiently efficient interatomic potentials providing reliable energies and forces has become a serious bottleneck for performing these simulations. To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials. Since the early days of computer simulations simplified potentials have been derived using physical approximations whenever the direct application of electronic structure methods has been too demanding. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) now offer an alternative approach for the representation of potential-energy surfaces by fitting large data sets from electronic structure calculations. In this perspective, the central ideas underlying these ML potentials, solved problems and remaining challenges are reviewed along with a discussion of their current applicability and limitations.",

Using trusted SGX-processors for this task yields high performance, but requires a careful selection, adaptation, and implementation of machine-learning algorithms to provably prevent the exploitation of any side channels induced by data-dependent access patterns. \n \nWe propose data-oblivious machine learning algorithms for support vector machines, matrix factorization, neural networks, decision trees, and k-means clustering. We show that our efficient implementation based on Intel Skylake processors scales up to large, realistic datasets, with overheads several orders of magnitude lower than with previous approaches based on advanced cryptographic multi-party computation schemes.",

In this paper, we introduce OpenML, a place for machine learning researchers to share and organize data in fine detail, so that they can work more effectively, be more visible, and collaborate with others to tackle harder problems. We discuss how OpenML relates to other examples of networked science and what benefits it brings for machine learning research, individual scientists, as well as students and practitioners.",

Should fairness consist of ensuring everyone has an equal probability of obtaining some benefit, or should we aim instead to minimise the harms to the least advantaged? Can the relevant ideal be determined by reference to some alternative state of affairs in which a particular social pattern of discrimination does not exist? Various definitions proposed in recent literature make different assumptions about what terms like discrimination and fairness mean and how they can be defined in mathematical terms. Questions of discrimination, egalitarianism and justice are of significant interest to moral and political philosophers, who have expended significant efforts in formalising and defending these central concepts. It is therefore unsurprising that attempts to formalise `fairness' in machine learning contain echoes of these old philosophical debates. This paper draws on existing work in moral and political philosophy in order to elucidate emerging debates about fair machine learning.",
