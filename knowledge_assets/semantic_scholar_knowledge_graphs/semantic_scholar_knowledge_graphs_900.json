            "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of compression of 3D point cloud sequences that are characterized by moving 3D positions and color attributes. As temporally successive point cloud frames share some similarities, motion estimation is key to effective compression of these sequences. It, however, remains a challenging problem as the point cloud frames have varying numbers of points without explicit correspondence information. We represent the time-varying geometry of these sequences with a set of graphs, and consider 3D positions and color attributes of the point clouds as signals on the vertices of the graphs. We then cast motion estimation as a feature-matching problem between successive graphs. The motion is estimated on a sparse set of representative vertices using new spectral graph wavelet descriptors. A dense motion field is eventually interpolated by solving a graph-based regularization problem. The estimated motion is finally used for removing the temporal redundancy in the predictive coding of the 3D positions and the color characteristics of the point cloud sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to accurately estimate the motion between consecutive frames. Moreover, motion estimation is shown to bring a significant improvement in terms of the overall compression performance of the sequence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that exploits both the spatial correlation inside each frame (through the graph) and the temporal correlation between the frames (through the motion estimation) to compress the color and the geometry of 3D point cloud sequences in an efficient way.",

            "abstract": "Users increasingly rely on the trustworthiness of the information exposed on Online Social Networks (OSNs). In addition, OSN providers base their business models on the marketability of this information. However, OSNs suffer from abuse in the form of the creation of fake accounts, which do not correspond to real humans. Fakes can introduce spam, manipulate online rating, or exploit knowledge extracted from the network. OSN operators currently expend significant resources to detect, manually verify, and shut down fake accounts. Tuenti, the largest OSN in Spain, dedicates 14 full-time employees in that task alone, incurring a significant monetary cost. Such a task has yet to be successfully automated because of the difficulty in reliably capturing the diverse behavior of fake and real OSN profiles. \n \nWe introduce a new tool in the hands of OSN operators, which we call SybilRank. It relies on social graph properties to rank users according to their perceived likelihood of being fake (Sybils). SybilRank is computationally efficient and can scale to graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes, as demonstrated by our Hadoop prototype. We deployed SybilRank in Tuenti's operation center. We found that \u223c90% of the 200K accounts that SybilRank designated as most likely to be fake, actually warranted suspension. On the other hand, with Tuenti's current user-report-based approach only \u223c5% of the inspected accounts are indeed fake.",

            "abstract": "Meta-learning has received a tremendous recent attention as a possible approach for mimicking human intelligence, i.e., acquiring new knowledge and skills with little or even no demonstration. Most of the existing meta-learning methods are proposed to tackle few-shot learning problems such as image and text, in rather Euclidean domain. However, there are very few works applying meta-learning to non-Euclidean domains, and the recently proposed graph neural networks (GNNs) models do not perform effectively on graph few-shot learning problems. Towards this, we propose a novel graph meta-learning framework -- Meta-GNN -- to tackle the few-shot node classification problem in graph meta-learning settings. It obtains the prior knowledge of classifiers by training on many similar few-shot learning tasks and then classifies the nodes from new classes with only few labeled samples. Additionally, Meta-GNN is a general model that can be straightforwardly incorporated into any existing state-of-the-art GNN. Our experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach not only improves the node classification performance by a large margin on few-shot learning problems in meta-learning paradigm, but also learns a more general and flexible model for task adaption.",

Our framework goes beyond current recognition systems that lack the capability to reason beyond stack of convolutions. The framework consists of two core modules: a local module that uses spatial memory [4] to store previous beliefs with parallel updates; and a global graph-reasoning module. Our graph module has three components: a) a knowledge graph where we represent classes as nodes and build edges to encode different types of semantic relationships between them; b) a region graph of the current image where regions in the image are nodes and spatial relationships between these regions are edges; c) an assignment graph that assigns regions to classes. Both the local module and the global module roll-out iteratively and cross-feed predictions to each other to refine estimates. The final predictions are made by combining the best of both modules with an attention mechanism. We show strong performance over plain ConvNets, e.g. achieving an 8.4% absolute improvement on ADE [55] measured by per-class average precision. Analysis also shows that the framework is resilient to missing regions for reasoning.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph reasoning, which aims at predicting the missing facts through reasoning with the observed facts, is critical to many applications. Such a problem has been widely explored by traditional logic rule-based approaches and recent knowledge graph embedding methods. A principled logic rule-based approach is the Markov Logic Network (MLN), which is able to leverage domain knowledge with first-order logic and meanwhile handle their uncertainty. However, the inference of MLNs is usually very difficult due to the complicated graph structures. Different from MLNs, knowledge graph embedding methods (e.g. TransE, DistMult) learn effective entity and relation embeddings for reasoning, which are much more effective and efficient. However, they are unable to leverage domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose the probabilistic Logic Neural Network (pLogicNet), which combines the advantages of both methods. A pLogicNet defines the joint distribution of all possible triplets by using a Markov logic network with first-order logic, which can be efficiently optimized with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, a knowledge graph embedding model is used for inferring the missing triplets, while in the M-step, the weights of logic rules are updated based on both the observed and predicted triplets. Experiments on multiple knowledge graphs prove the effectiveness of pLogicNet over many competitive baselines.",

We focus on subgraphs that are signatures of web phenomena such as tightly-focused topic communities, webrings, taxonomy trees, keiretsus, etc. For instance, the signature of a webring is a central page with bidirectional links to a number of other pages. We develop novel algorithms for such enumeration problems. A key technical contribution is the development of a model for the evolution of the web graph, based on experimental observations derived from a snapshot of the web. We argue that our algorithms run efficiently in this model, and use the model to explain some statistical phenomena on the web that emerged during our experiments. Finally, we describe the design and implementation of Campfire, a knowledge base of over one hundred thousand web communities.",

Also included is a quantum interactive protocol for a complete problem for the complexity class of problems having \"honest verifier\" quantum statistical zero-knowledge proofs, which therefore establishes that honest verifier and general quantum statistical zero-knowledge are equal: QSZK = QSZKHV. Previously no non-trivial proof systems were known to be zero-knowledge against quantum attacks, except in restricted settings such as the honest-verifier and common reference string models. This paper therefore establishes for the first time that true zero-knowledge is indeed possible in the presence of quantum information and computation.",

We propose to incorporate prior knowledge of cluster membership for document cluster analysis and develop a novel semi-supervised document clustering model. The method models a set of documents with weighted graph in which each document is represented as a vertex, and each edge connecting a pair of vertices is weighted with the similarity value of the two corresponding documents. The prior knowledge indicates pairs of documents that known to belong to the same cluster. Then, the prior knowledge is transformed into a set of constraints. The document clustering task is accomplished by finding the best cuts of the graph under the constraints. We apply the model to the Normalized Cut method to demonstrate the idea and concept. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed document clustering model reveals remarkable performance improvements with very limited training samples, and hence is a very effective semi-supervised classification tool.",

This work exploits intrinsic properties underlying supervised and unsupervised feature selection algorithms, and proposes a unified framework for feature selection based on spectral graph theory. The proposed framework is able to generate families of algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection. And we show that existing powerful algorithms such as ReliefF (supervised) and Laplacian Score (unsupervised) are special cases of the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to unify supervised and unsupervised feature selection, and enable their joint study under a general framework. Experiments demonstrated the efficacy of the novel algorithms derived from the framework.",

Existing implementations focus primarily on graph partitioning as a preprocessing step to balance computation across compute nodes. In this paper, we examine the runtime characteristics of a Pregel system. We show that graph partitioning alone is insufficient for minimizing end-to-end computation. Especially where data is very large or the runtime behavior of the algorithm is unknown, an adaptive approach is needed. To this end, we introduce Mizan, a Pregel system that achieves efficient load balancing to better adapt to changes in computing needs. Unlike known implementations of Pregel, Mizan does not assume any a priori knowledge of the structure of the graph or behavior of the algorithm. Instead, it monitors the runtime characteristics of the system. Mizan then performs efficient fine-grained vertex migration to balance computation and communication. We have fully implemented Mizan; using extensive evaluation we show that---especially for highly-dynamic workloads---Mizan provides up to 84% improvement over techniques leveraging static graph pre-partitioning.",

Existing approaches either do not customize based on patient health history, or ignore existing knowledge on drug-drug interactions (DDI) that might lead to adverse outcomes. To fill this gap, we propose the Graph Augmented Memory Networks (GAMENet), which integrates the drug-drug interactions knowledge graph by a memory module implemented as a graph convolutional networks, and models longitudinal patient records as the query. It is trained end-to-end to provide safe and personalized recommendation of medication combination. We demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of GAMENet by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods on real EHR data. GAMENet outperformed all baselines in all effectiveness measures, and also achieved 3.60% DDI rate reduction from existing EHR data.",

The network capacity (wired) and degrees of freedom (DoF) (wireless) are found to be bounded above by the capacity of an index coding problem for which the antidote graph is the complement of the given interference graph. The problems are shown to be equivalent under linear solutions. An interference alignment perspective is then used to translate the existing index coding solutions into the wired network capacity and wireless network DoF solutions, as well as to find new and unified solutions to different classes of all three problems.",

Terms from four hospital systems (laboratory, electrocardiography, medical records coding, and pharmacy) were added as nodes in the network. Additional knowledge about terms, added as semantic links, was used to assist in integration, harmonization, and automated classification of disparate terminologies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe MED contains 32,767 terms and is in active clinical use. Automated classification was successfully applied to terms for laboratory specimens, laboratory tests, and medications. One benefit of the approach has been the automated inclusion of medications into multiple pharmacologic and allergenic classes that were not present in the pharmacy system. Another benefit has been the reduction of maintenance efforts by 90%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe MED is a hybrid of terminology and knowledge. It provides domain coverage, synonymy, consistency of views, explicit relationships, and multiple classification while preventing redundancy, ambiguity (homonymy) and misclassification.",

Here we studied the ability of human subjects to search locations, to find shortcuts and novel paths, to estimate distances between remembered places, and to draw sketch maps of the explored environment; these competences are related to goal-independent memory of space, or cognitive maps. Information on spatial relations was restricted to two types: a visual motion sequence generated by simulated movements in a virtual maze and the subject's own movement decisions defining the path through the maze. Visual information was local (i.e., no global landmarks or compass information was provided). Other position and movement information (vestibular or proprioceptive) was excluded. The amount of visual information provided was varied over four experimental conditions. The results indicate that human subjects are able to learn a virtual maze from sequences of local views and movements. The information acquired is local, consisting of recognized positions and movement decisions associated to them. Although simple associations of this type can be shown to be present in some subjects, more complete configurational knowledge is acquired as well. The results are discussed in a view-based framework of navigation and the representation of spatial knowledge by means of a view graph.",

            "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied to various applications, including image classification, text generation, audio recognition, and graph data analysis. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Though there are several works about adversarial attack and defense strategies on domains such as images and natural language processing, it is still difficult to directly transfer the learned knowledge to graph data due to its representation structure. Given the importance of graph analysis, an increasing number of studies over the past few years have attempted to analyze the robustness of machine learning models on graph data. Nevertheless, existing research considering adversarial behaviors on graph data often focuses on specific types of attacks with certain assumptions. In addition, each work proposes its own mathematical formulation, which makes the comparison among different methods difficult. Therefore, this review is intended to provide an overall landscape of more than 100 papers on adversarial attack and defense strategies for graph data, and establish a unified formulation encompassing most graph adversarial learning models. Moreover, we also compare different graph attacks and defenses along with their contributions and limitations, as well as summarize the evaluation metrics, datasets and future trends. We hope this survey can help fill the gap in the literature and facilitate further development of this promising new field1.",

            "abstract": "T here are pervasive strategies for school work that may be broadly characterized as knowledge reproduction strategies. They have limited potential for advancing knowledge, and often are not even very effective for purposes of memorization and organization of knowledge. Their most conspicuous failure, however, is in the development of understanding. Knowledge building strategies are, by contrast, focused centrally on the development of understanding. These strategies, however, are comparatively rare among school children [6]. Worse yet, they seem destined to remain so because school discourse effectively excludes them. Educational computing, unfortunately, tends to support knowledge reproduction strategies rather than knowledge-building ones. While this is obvious regarding much of the courseware on the market, in a more subtle way it is equally true of the software tools that are popularly thought to encourage more active learning. An explanation may be found in the origins of these software tools and in the evolution of the personal computer as a workstation. This evolution has been toward meeting the needs of a business community concerned with storing and retrieving information (hence, the saliency of files and folders), transferring it (hence, cut-and-paste, import-export, and communications software), displaying it (hence, graphing, graphics, desktop publishing, and multimedia presentation software), and making plans and decisions based on it (hence, spreadsheets, accounting, and projectmanagement software). Put it all together, and you have the desktop metaphor. It is not a metaphor for the construction and advancement of understanding. It represents activities that are important in any kind of information processing environment. We propose that these activities-copying, deleting, storing, retrieving, entering, displaying, and sending-be thought of as first-order knowledge-processing activities. In order to serve the purposes of knowledgebuilding, however, they must be subordinated to a second-order system of activities that has understanding as its primary purpose. In this article we discuss second-order computing facilities and a system we are developing that aims to foster and support knowledge building in school. The system is computer-supported intentional learning environments (CSILE). It aims to engage students in the same sorts of intellectual and cultural processes that sustain realworld scientists in efforts at knowledge advancement.",

Typical methods formulate an input as a document graph, integrating various intra-sentential and inter-sentential dependencies. The current state-of-the-art method splits the input graph into two DAGs, adopting a DAG-structured LSTM for each. Though being able to model rich linguistic knowledge by leveraging graph edges, important information can be lost in the splitting procedure. We propose a graph-state LSTM model, which uses a parallel state to model each word, recurrently enriching state values via message passing. Compared with DAG LSTMs, our graph LSTM keeps the original graph structure, and speeds up computation by allowing more parallelization. On a standard benchmark, our model shows the best result in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Recent efforts show that neural networks are vulnerable to small but intentional perturbations on input features in visual classification tasks. Due to the additional consideration of connections between examples (e.g., articles with citation link tend to be in the same class), graph neural networks could be more sensitive to the perturbations, since the perturbations from connected examples exacerbate the impact on a target example. Adversarial Training (AT), a dynamic regularization technique, can resist the worst-case perturbations on input features and is a promising choice to improve model robustness and generalization. However, existing AT methods focus on standard classification, being less effective when training models on graph since it does not model the impact from connected examples. In this work, we explore adversarial training on graph, aiming to improve the robustness and generalization of models learned on graph. We propose Graph Adversarial Training (GraphAT), which takes the impact from connected examples into account when learning to construct and resist perturbations. We give a general formulation of GraphAT, which can be seen as a dynamic regularization scheme based on the graph structure. To demonstrate the utility of GraphAT, we employ it on a state-of-the-art graph neural network model \u2014 Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We conduct experiments on two citation graphs (Citeseer and Cora) and a knowledge graph (NELL), verifying the effectiveness of GraphAT which outperforms normal training on GCN by 4.51 percent in node classification accuracy.

An experienced fifth grade teacher was videotaped as he taught a lesson sequence on functions and graphing. In addition, a subject matter knowledge interview and card sort task were conducted with the teacher and a mathematics educator. The results suggest that the teacher\u2019s knowledge of functions and graphing was missing several key mathematical ideas and that it was not organized in a manner to provide easily accessible, cross representational understanding of the domain. These limitations were found to relate to a narrowing of his instruction in three ways: the lack of provision of groundwork for future learning in this area, overemphasis of limited truths, and missed opportunities for fostering meaningful connections between key concepts and representations.",

An important and novel aspect of this approach is that our categorization method does not require a training set, which is in contrast to the traditional statistical and probabilistic methods. In the presented method, the ontology, including the domain concepts organized into hierarchies of categories and interconnected by relationships, as well as instances and connections among them, effectively becomes the classifier. Our method focuses on (i) converting a text document into a thematic graph of entities occurring in the document, (ii) ontological classification of the entities in the graph, and (iii) determining the overall categorization of the thematic graph, and as a result, the document itself. In the presented experiments, we used an RDF ontology constructed from the full English version of Wikipedia. Our experiments, conducted on corpora of Reuters news articles, showed that our training-less categorization method achieved a very good overall accuracy.",

We applied this knowledge-based similarity metric to a clique-finding algorithm for detecting sets of related genes with biological classifications. We also combined it with an expression-based distance metric to produce a co-cluster analysis, which accentuates genes with both similar expression profiles and similar biological characteristics and identifies gene clusters that are more stable and biologically meaningful. These algorithms are demonstrated in the analysis of MPRO cell differentiation time series experiments.",

            "abstract": "Beyond local convolution networks, we explore how to harness various external human knowledge for endowing the networks with the capability of semantic global reasoning. Rather than using separate graphical models (e.g. CRF) or constraints for modeling broader dependencies, we propose a new Symbolic Graph Reasoning (SGR) layer, which performs reasoning over a group of symbolic nodes whose outputs explicitly represent different properties of each semantic in a prior knowledge graph. To cooperate with local convolutions, each SGR is constituted by three modules: a) a primal local-to-semantic voting module where the features of all symbolic nodes are generated by voting from local representations; b) a graph reasoning module propagates information over knowledge graph to achieve global semantic coherency; c) a dual semantic-to-local mapping module learns new associations of the evolved symbolic nodes with local representations, and accordingly enhances local features. The SGR layer can be injected between any convolution layers and instantiated with distinct prior graphs. Extensive experiments show incorporating SGR significantly improves plain ConvNets on three semantic segmentation tasks and one image classification task. More analyses show the SGR layer learns shared symbolic representations for domains/datasets with the different label set given a universal knowledge graph, demonstrating its superior generalization capability.",

Our main insight is that the input reactant and reagent molecules can be jointly represented as a graph, and the process of generating product molecules from reactant molecules can be formulated as a sequence of graph transformations. To this end, we propose Graph Transformation Policy Network (GTPN) - a novel generic method that combines the strengths of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn reactions directly from data with minimal chemical knowledge. Compared to previous methods, GTPN has some appealing properties such as: end-to-end learning, and making no assumption about the length or the order of graph transformations. In order to guide model search through the complex discrete space of sets of bond changes effectively, we extend the standard policy gradient loss by adding useful constraints. Evaluation results show that GTPN improves the top-1 accuracy over the current state-of-the-art method by about 3% on the large USPTO dataset.",

            "abstract": "Recommendation can be framed as a graph link prediction task naturally. The user-item interaction graph built within a single domain often suffers from high sparsity. Thus, there has been a surge of approaches to alleviate the sparsity issue via cross-domain mutual augmentation. The SOTA cross-domain recommendation algorithms all try to bridge the gap via knowledge transfer in the latent space. We find there are mainly three problems in their formulations: 1) their knowledge transfer is unaware of the cross-domain graph structure. 2) their framework cannot capture high-order information propagation on the graph. 3) their cross-domain transfer formulations are generally more complicated to be optimized than the unified methods. In this paper, we propose the Preference Propagation GraphNet (PPGN) to address the above problems. Specifically, we construct a Cross-Domain Preference Matrix (CDPM) to model the interactions of different domains as a whole. Through the propagation layer of PPGN, we try to capture how user preferences propagate in the graph. Consequently, a joint objective for different domains is defined, and we simplify the cross-domain recommendation into a unified multi-task model. Extensive experiments on two pairs of real-world datasets show PPGN outperforms the SOTA algorithms significantly.",

One very widely used model is the vector space model which is based on the bag-of-words approach. However, it suffers from the fact that it loses important information about the original text, such as information about the order of the terms in the text or about the frontiers between sentences or paragraphs. In this paper, we propose a graph-based text representation, which is capable of capturing (i) Term order (ii) Term frequency (iii) Term co-occurrence (iv) Term context in documents. We also apply the graph model into our text mining task, which is to discover unapparent associations between two and more concepts (e.g. individuals) from a large text corpus. Counterterrorism corpus is used to evaluate the performance of various retrieval models, which demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness of graphic text representation in information retrieval and text mining.",

It is often impractical to expect a human with sufficient domain knowledge to be available to select the number of clusters/segments to return. We investigate techniques to determine the number of clusters or segments to return from hierarchical clustering and segmentation algorithms. We propose an efficient algorithm, the L method that finds the \"knee\" in a '# of clusters vs. clustering evaluation metric' graph. Using the knee is well-known, but is not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine in which situations it will and will not work. We also compare the L method to existing methods based on the accuracy of the number of clusters that are determined and efficiency. Our results show favorable performance for these criteria compared to the existing methods that were evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Detecting rumor source in social networks is one of the key issues for defeating rumors automatically. Although many efforts have been devoted to defeating online rumors, most of them are proposed based an assumption that the underlying propagation model is known in advance. However, this assumption may lead to impracticability on real data, since it is usually difficult to acquire the actual underlying propagation model. Some attempts are developed by using label propagation to avoid the limitation caused by lack of prior knowledge on the underlying propagation model. Nonetheless, they still suffer from the shortcoming that the node label is simply an integer which may restrict the prediction precision. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model, namely GCNSI (Graph Convolutional Networks based Source Identification), to locate multiple rumor sources without prior knowledge of underlying propagation model. By adopting spectral domain convolution, we build node representation by utilizing its multi-order neighbors information such that the prediction precision on the sources is improved. We conduct experiments on several real datasets and the results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art model.",

An efficient and complete symbolic representation has been developed to express the precedence knowledge clearly and precisely. This symbolic representation makes it possible to perform reasoning and manipulation of the precedence knowledge. Furthermore, the representation is complete in the sense that it can represent the assembly precedence knowledge as well as the disassembly precedence knowledge and these two forms of knowledge can be transformed from one to another. A geometric mating graph is developed to include all the necessary geometric and topological information for the precedence knowledge acquisition. Two algorithms are developed to obtain the precedence knowledge from the geometric mating graph systematically. The disassembly precedence knowledge thus obtained is equivalent to the assembly precedence knowledge and can be used to generate all the possible sets of assembly sequences.<<ETX>>",

Knowledge discovery and data mining systems contain the potential to automate the interpretation process, but these approaches frequently utilize computationally expensive algorithms. In particular, scientific discovery systems focus on the utilization of richer data representation, sometimes without regard for scalability. This research investigates approaches for scaling a particular knowledge discovery?data mining system, Subdue, using parallel and distributed resources. Subdue has been used to discover interesting and repetitive concepts in graph-based databases from a variety of domains, but requires a substantial amount of processing time. Experiments that demonstrate scalability of parallel versions of the Subdue system are performed using CAD circuit databases, satellite images, and artificially-generated databases, and potential achievements and obstacles are discussed.",

In the context of a heterogeneous graph, which contains nodes from different domains, classical random walks are biased towards highly visible domains where nodes are associated with a dominant number of paths. To overcome this bias, existing heterogeneous graph embedding techniques typically rely on meta-paths (i.e., fixed sequences of node types) to guide random walks. However, using these meta-paths either requires prior knowledge from domain experts for optimal meta-path selection, or requires extended computations to combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution that does not involve any meta-path. Specifically, we propose JUST, a heterogeneous graph embedding technique using random walks with JUmp and STay strategies to overcome the aforementioned bias in an more efficient manner. JUST can not only gracefully balance between homogeneous and heterogeneous edges, it can also balance the node distribution over different domains (i.e., node types). By conducting a thorough empirical evaluation of our method on three heterogeneous graph datasets, we show the superiority of our proposed technique. In particular, compared to a state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph embedding technique Hin2vec, which tries to optimally combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length, our technique yields better results in most experiments, with a dramatically reduced embedding learning time (about 3x speedup).",

Despite their success, there is a dearth of theoretical explorations of GCNN models such as their generalization properties. In this paper, we take a first step towards developing a deeper theoretical understanding of GCNN models by analyzing the stability of single-layer GCNN models and deriving their generalization guarantees in a semi-supervised graph learning setting. In particular, we show that the algorithmic stability of a GCNN model depends upon the largest absolute eigenvalue of its graph convolution filter. Moreover, to ensure the uniform stability needed to provide strong generalization guarantees, the largest absolute eigenvalue must be independent of the graph size. Our results shed new insights on the design of new & improved graph convolution filters with guaranteed algorithmic stability. We evaluate the generalization gap and stability on various real-world graph datasets and show that the empirical results indeed support our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study stability bounds on graph learning in a semi-supervised setting and derive generalization bounds for GCNN models.",

Transferring knowledge from known categories to novel classes with no or only a few labels is far less researched even though it is a common scenario. In this work, we extend transfer learning with semi-supervised learning to exploit unlabeled instances of (novel) categories with no or only a few labeled instances. Our proposed approach Propagated Semantic Transfer combines three techniques. First, we transfer information from known to novel categories by incorporating external knowledge, such as linguistic or expert-specified information, e.g., by a mid-level layer of semantic attributes. Second, we exploit the manifold structure of novel classes. More specifically we adapt a graph-based learning algorithm - so far only used for semi-supervised learning -to zero-shot and few-shot learning. Third, we improve the local neighborhood in such graph structures by replacing the raw feature-based representation with a mid-level object- or attribute-based representation. We evaluate our approach on three challenging datasets in two different applications, namely on Animals with Attributes and ImageNet for image classification and on MPII Composites for activity recognition. Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transfer and semi-supervised approaches on all datasets.",

On the other hand, network biology requires in-depth knowledge to construct disease-specific networks, but our current knowledge is very limited even with the recent advances in human cancer biology. Deep learning has shown an ability to address the problem like this. However, it conventionally used grid-like structured data, thus application of deep learning technologies to the human disease subtypes is yet to be explored. To overcome the issue, we propose a hybrid model, which integrates two key components 1) graph convolution neural network (graph CNN) and 2) relation network (RN). Experimental results on synthetic data and breast cancer data demonstrate that our proposed method shows better performances than existing methods.",

The architecture consists of three major components: a model utilization subsystem, a modeling subsystem, and an inference engine. The core of the system is the inference engine that applies the graph-based framework to drive the processes of model integration and selection. The graph-based framework includes a model representation scheme and reasoning mechanisms. The representation scheme depicts a set of data as a node, a set of functions as an edge, and a basic model as a combination of two nodes and one connecting edge. Based on this scheme, mechanisms for model integration and selection are discussed. These mechanisms enable a model management system to create composite models automatically. A prototype implemented in PROLOG is also presented to demonstrate the graph-based framework.",

This paper explores the notion of similarity based on connectivity alone, and proposes several algorithms to quantify it. Our metrics take advantage of the local neighborhoods of the nodes in the citation graph. Two variants of link-based similarity estimation between two nodes are described, one based on the separate local neighborhoods of the nodes, and another based on the joint local neighborhood expanded from both nodes at the same time. The algorithms are implemented and evaluated on a subgraph of the citation graph of computer science in a retrieval context. The results are compared with text-based similarity, and demonstrate the complementarity of link-based and text-based retrieval.",

            "abstract": "Entity Linking (EL) is the task of linking name mentions in Web text with their referent entities in a knowledge base. Traditional EL methods usually link name mentions in a document by assuming them to be independent. However, there is often additional interdependence between different EL decisions, i.e., the entities in the same document should be semantically related to each other. In these cases, Collective Entity Linking, in which the name mentions in the same document are linked jointly by exploiting the interdependence between them, can improve the entity linking accuracy. This paper proposes a graph-based collective EL method, which can model and exploit the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based representation, called Referent Graph, which can model the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Then we propose a collective inference algorithm, which can jointly infer the referent entities of all name mentions by exploiting the interdependence captured in Referent Graph. The key benefit of our method comes from: 1) The global interdependence model of EL decisions; 2) The purely collective nature of the inference algorithm, in which evidence for related EL decisions can be reinforced into high-probability decisions. Experimental results show that our method can achieve significant performance improvement over the traditional EL methods.",

In this paper we describe Green-Marl, a domain-specific language (DSL) whose high level language constructs allow developers to describe their graph analysis algorithms intuitively, but expose the data-level parallelism inherent in the algorithms. We also present our Green-Marl compiler which translates high-level algorithmic description written in Green-Marl into an efficient C++ implementation by exploiting this exposed data-level parallelism. Furthermore, our Green-Marl compiler applies a set of optimizations that take advantage of the high-level semantic knowledge encoded in the Green-Marl DSL. We demonstrate that graph analysis algorithms can be written very intuitively with Green-Marl through some examples, and our experimental results show that the compiler-generated implementation out of such descriptions performs as well as or better than highly-tuned hand-coded implementations.",

It is thus impractical to use standard supervised machine learning techniques dependent on annotated training examples. We do without such annotations by using label propagation to incorporate labels from a maximum entropy classifier trained on noisy labels and knowledge about word types encoded in a lexicon, in combination with the Twitter follower graph. Results on polarity classification for several datasets show that our label propagation approach rivals a model supervised with in-domain annotated tweets, and it outperforms the noisily supervised classifier it exploits as well as a lexicon-based polarity ratio classifier.",

These trajectories are usually generated at a low or an irregular frequency due to applications' characteristics or energy saving, leaving the routes between two consecutive points of a single trajectory uncertain (called an uncertain trajectory). In this paper, we present a Route Inference framework based on Collective Knowledge (abbreviated as RICK) to construct the popular routes from uncertain trajectories. Explicitly, given a location sequence and a time span, the RICK is able to construct the top-k routes which sequentially pass through the locations within the specified time span, by aggregating such uncertain trajectories in a mutual reinforcement way (i.e., uncertain + uncertain \u2192 certain). Our work can benefit trip planning, traffic management, and animal movement studies. The RICK comprises two components: routable graph construction and route inference. First, we explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of uncertain trajectories and construct a routable graph by collaborative learning among the uncertain trajectories. Second, in light of the routable graph, we propose a routing algorithm to construct the top-k routes according to a user-specified query. We have conducted extensive experiments on two real datasets, consisting of Foursquare check-in datasets and taxi trajectories. The results show that RICK is both effective and efficient.",

The problem of mining association rules focuses on discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items which appear together in a sufficient number of transactions; while the problem of mining sequential patterns focuses on discovering large sequences where a large sequence is an ordered list of sets of items which appear in a sufficient number of transactions. We present efficient graph based algorithms to solve these problems. The algorithms construct an association graph to indicate the associations between items and then traverse the graph to generate large itemsets and large sequences, respectively. Our algorithms need to scan the database only once. Empirical evaluations show that our algorithms outperform other algorithms which need to make multiple passes over the database.",

Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages. We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). Across eight European languages, our approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.",

The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyse network data on an unprecendented scale, and the development of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract knowledge from networks of many different kinds. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social science. This book brings together the most important breakthroughts in each of these fields and presents them in a unified fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Topics covered include the measurement of networks; methods for analysing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology; fundamentals of graph theory; computer algorithms, including spectral algorithms and community detection; mathematical models of networks such as random graph models and generative models; and models of processes taking place on networks.",

Herein, we propose a model that mimics chemical reasoning, and formalises reaction prediction as finding missing links in a knowledge graph. We have constructed a knowledge graph containing 14.4 million molecules and 8.2 million binary reactions, which represents the bulk of all chemical reactions ever published in the scientific literature. Our model outperforms a rule-based expert system in the reaction prediction task for 180\u2009000 randomly selected binary reactions. The data-driven model generalises even beyond known reaction types, and is thus capable of effectively (re-)discovering novel transformations (even including transition metal-catalysed reactions). Our model enables computers to infer hypotheses about reactivity and reactions by only considering the intrinsic local structure of the graph and because each single reaction prediction is typically achieved in a sub-second time frame, the model can be used as a high-throughput generator of reaction hypotheses for reaction discovery.",

The local triangle counting which counts triangles for each node in a graph is a very important problem with wide applications in social network analysis, anomaly detection, web mining, etc. In this paper, we propose MASCOT, a memory-efficient and accurate method for local triangle estimation in a graph stream based on edge sampling. To develop MASCOT, we first present two naive local triangle counting algorithms in a graph stream: MASCOT-C and MASCOT-A. MASCOT-C is based on constant edge sampling, and MASCOT-A improves its accuracy by utilizing more memory spaces. MASCOT achieves both accuracy and memory-efficiency of the two algorithms by an unconditional triangle counting for a new edge, regardless of whether it is sampled or not. In contrast to the existing algorithm which requires prior knowledge on the target graph and appropriately set parameters, MASCOT requires only one simple parameter, the edge sampling probability. Through extensive experiments, we show that for the same number of edges sampled, MASCOT provides the best accuracy compared to the existing algorithm as well as MASCOT-C and MASCOT-A. Thanks to MASCOT, we also discover interesting anomalous patterns in real graphs, like core-peripheries in the web and ambiguous author names in DBLP.",

GMR formalize this idea. We do not. Nevertheless, we hope that the reader who has not read their paper will still understand our proofs. Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson [GMW] take another leap forward. They show that if one makes a reasonable assumption (that one-way functions exist), then it is possible to convert any standard constructive proof of any of the theorems in a large natural class of theorems into a zero-knowledge proof that the theorem is true. GMW start by considering a particular NP-complete problem: Graph 3-Colorability. Instance. A graph G. Question. Can G be \"properly\" 3-colored (each node colored by one of 3 given colors so that no two adjacent nodes receive the same color). GMW show that a \"prover\" who knows how to 3-color a particular graph G can convince a verifier that (1) G is 3-colorable, and (2) the prover knows a 3-coloring, without giving away any additional information. In particular, the prover does not give away the slightest clue how to 3-color G.",

            "abstract": "Transfer learning is established as an effective technology to leverage rich labeled data from some source domain to build an accurate classifier for the target domain. The basic assumption is that the input domains may share certain knowledge structure, which can be encoded into common latent factors and extracted by preserving important property of original data, e.g., statistical property and geometric structure. In this paper, we show that different properties of input data can be complementary to each other and exploring them simultaneously can make the learning model robust to the domain difference. We propose a general framework, referred to as Graph Co-Regularized Transfer Learning (GTL), where various matrix factorization models can be incorporated. Specifically, GTL aims to extract common latent factors for knowledge transfer by preserving the statistical property across domains, and simultaneously, refine the latent factors to alleviate negative transfer by preserving the geometric structure in each domain. Based on the framework, we propose two novel methods using NMF and NMTF, respectively. Extensive experiments verify that GTL can significantly outperform state-of-the-art learning methods on several public text and image datasets.",

            "abstract": "Named entity disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentions in natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base such as Wikipedia. Such disambiguation can help enhance readability and add semantics to plain text. It is also a central step in constructing high-quality information network or knowledge graph from unstructured text. Previous research has tackled this problem by making use of various textual and structural features from a knowledge base. Most of the proposed algorithms assume that a knowledge base can provide enough explicit and useful information to help disambiguate a mention to the right entity. However, the existing knowledge bases are rarely complete (likely will never be), thus leading to poor performance on short queries with not well-known contexts. In such cases, we need to collect additional evidences scattered in internal and external corpus to augment the knowledge bases and enhance their disambiguation power. In this work, we propose a generative model and an incremental algorithm to automatically mine useful evidences across documents. With a specific modeling of \"background topic\" and \"unknown entities\", our model is able to harvest useful evidences out of noisy information. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly: boosting the disambiguation accuracy from 43% (baseline) to 86% on short queries derived from tweets.",

State-of-the-art methods, such as TransE, TransH, and TransR build embeddings by treating relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. However, previous models can not deal with reflexive/one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many relations properly, or lack of scalability and efficiency. Thus, we propose a novel method, flexible translation, named TransF, to address the above issues. TransF regards relation as translation between head entity vector and tail entity vector with flexible magnitude. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct link prediction and triple classification on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our method remarkably improve the performance compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Optimization techniques based on graph cuts have become a standard tool for many vision applications. These techniques allow to minimize efficiently certain energy functions corresponding to pairwise Markov random fields (MRFs). Currently, there is an accepted view within the computer vision community that graph cuts can only be used for optimizing a limited class of MRF energies (e.g., submodular functions). In this survey, we review some results that show that graph cuts can be applied to a much larger class of energy functions (in particular, nonsubmodular functions). While these results are well-known in the optimization community, to our knowledge they were not used in the context of computer vision and MRF optimization. We demonstrate the relevance of these results to vision on the problem of binary texture restoration.",

The graph summary is an aggregate graph in which each node corresponds to a set of nodes in G, and each edge represents the edges between all pair of nodes in the two sets. On the other hand, the corrections portion specifies the list of edge-corrections that should be applied to the summary to recreate G. Our representations allow for both lossless and lossy graph compression with bounds on the introduced error. Further, in combination with the MDL principle, they yield highly intuitive coarse-level summaries of the input graph G. We develop algorithms to construct highly compressed graph representations with small sizes and guaranteed accuracy, and validate our approach through an extensive set of experiments with multiple real-life graph data sets.\n To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to compute graph summaries using the MDL principle, and use the summaries (along with corrections) to compress graphs with bounded error.",

It is shown how one can introduce imprecision into such probabilities as a data base of cases accumulates. By exploiting the graphical structure, the updating can be performed locally, either approximately or exactly, and the setup makes it possible to take advantage of a range of well-established statistical techniques. As examples we discuss discrete models, models based on Dirichlet distributions and models of the logistic regression type.",

Mining the wealth of information available in the query logs has many important applications including query-log analysis, user profiling and personalization, advertising, query recommendation, and more.\n In this paper we introduce the query-flow graph, a graph representation of the interesting knowledge about latent querying behavior. Intuitively, in the query-flow graph a directed edge from query qi to query qj means that the two queries are likely to be part of the same \"search mission\". Any path over the query-flow graph may be seen as a searching behavior, whose likelihood is given by the strength of the edges along the path.\n The query-flow graph is an outcome of query-log mining and, at the same time, a useful tool for it. We propose a methodology that builds such a graph by mining time and textual information as well as aggregating queries from different users. Using this approach we build a real-world query-flow graph from a large-scale query log and we demonstrate its utility in concrete applications, namely, finding logical sessions, and query recommendation. We believe, however, that the usefulness of the query-flow graph goes beyond these two applications.",

In particular, data-driven approaches have been used for reconstructing high-dimensional motion sequences from low-dimensional control signals. In this article, we contribute to this strand of research by introducing a novel framework for generating full-body animations controlled by only four 3D accelerometers that are attached to the extremities of a human actor. Our approach relies on a knowledge base that consists of a large number of motion clips obtained from marker-based motion capturing. Based on the sparse accelerometer input a cross-domain retrieval procedure is applied to build up a lazy neighborhood graph in an online fashion. This graph structure points to suitable motion fragments in the knowledge base, which are then used in the reconstruction step. Supported by a kd-tree index structure, our procedure scales to even large datasets consisting of millions of frames. Our combined approach allows for reconstructing visually plausible continuous motion streams, even in the presence of moderate tempo variations which may not be directly reflected by the given knowledge base.",

In the core of these applications, lies a common and critical problem: Given a labeled network and a query graph, how to efficiently search the query graph in the target network. The presence of noise and the incomplete knowledge about the structure and content of the target network make it unrealistic to find an exact match. Rather, it is more appealing to find the top-k approximate matches.\n In this paper, we propose a neighborhood-based similarity measure that could avoid costly graph isomorphism and edit distance computation. Under this new measure, we prove that subgraph similarity search is NP hard, while graph similarity match is polynomial. By studying the principles behind this measure, we found an information propagation model that is able to convert a large network into a set of multidimensional vectors, where sophisticated indexing and similarity search algorithms are available. The proposed method, called Ness (Neighborhood Based Similarity Search), is appropriate for graphs with low automorphism and high noise, which are common in many social and information networks. Ness is not only efficient, but also robust against structural noise and information loss. Empirical results show that it can quickly and accurately find high-quality matches in large networks, with negligible cost.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a volumetric formulation for the multiview stereo problem which is amenable to a computationally tractable global optimization using Graph-cuts. Our approach is to seek the optimal partitioning of 3D space into two regions labeled as \"object\" and \"empty\" under a cost functional consisting of the following two terms: 1) A term that forces the boundary between the two regions to pass through photo-consistent locations; and 2) a ballooning term that inflates the \"object\" region. To take account of the effect of occlusion on the first term, we use an occlusion robust photo-consistency metric based on normalized cross correlation, which does not assume any geometric knowledge about the reconstructed object. The globally optimal 3D partitioning can be obtained as the minimum cut solution of a weighted graph.",

This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of prede-fined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance. Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.",

However, they are computationally intensive and require extensive knowledge of species' biology and behavior, limiting their application in many cases. An alternative to SEPMs is graph theory, which has minimal data requirements and efficient algorithms. Although only recently introduced to landscape ecology, graph theory is well suited to ecological applications concerned with connectivity or movement. This paper compares the performance of graph theory to a SEPM in selecting important habitat patches for Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) conservation. We use both models to identify habitat patches that act as population sources and persistent patches and also use graph theory to identify patches that act as stepping stones for dispersal. Correlations of patch rankings were very high between the two models. In addition, graph theory offers the ability to identify patches that are very important to habitat connectivity and thus long-term population persistence across the landscape. We show that graph theory makes very similar predictions in most cases and in other cases offers insight not available from the SEPM, and we conclude that graph theory is a suitable and possibly preferable alternative to SEPMs for species conservation in heterogeneous landscapes.",

Results showed that the COOP+META group significantly outperformed the IND +META group, which in turn significantly outperformed the COOP and IND groups on graph interpretation and various aspects of mathematical explanations. Furthermore, the metacognitive groups (COOP+META and IND +META) outperformed their counterparts (COOP and IND) on graph construction (transfer tasks) and metacognitive knowledge.

It is interesting that these methods turn out to be connected with such ideas as the Coxeter\u2014Weyl group and the Dynkin diagrams. We explain these connections by means of a very simple problem. We assume no preliminary knowledge. We do not touch on the connections between these questions and the theory of group representations or the theory of infinite\u2014dimensional Lie algebras. For this see [3]\u2014[5]. Let \u0393 be a finite connected graph; we denote the set of its vertices by \u0393\u03bf and the set of its edges by \u0393\u038a (we do not exclude the cases where two vertices are joined by several edges or there are loops joining a vertex to itself). We fix a certain orientation \u039b of the graph \u0393; this means that for each edge / e \u0393\u03b9 we distinguish a starting-point a(/) e \u0393\u03bf and an end-point",

We report the results of a qualitative. classroom-based study that examined (1) the role, knowledge and beliefs of a pre-calculus teacher, (2) how students used graphing calculators in support of their learning of mathematics, (3) the relationship and interactions between the teacher's role, knowledge and beliefs and the students' use of the graphing calculator in learning mathematics, and (4) some constraints of the graphing calculator technology that emerged within the classroom practice. We fhund five patterns and modes of graphing calculator tool use emerged in this practice: computational tool, transformational tool, data collection and analysis tool. visualizing tool, and checking tool. The results of this study suggest that nature of the mathematical tasks and the role, knowledge and beliefs of the teacher influenced the emergence of such rich usage of the graphing calculator. We also found that the use of the calculator as a personal device can inhibit communication in a small group setting. while its use as a shared device supported mathematical learning in the whole class setting.",

            "abstract": "Large graph datasets are ubiquitous in many domains, including social networking and biology. Graph summarization techniques are crucial in such domains as they can assist in uncovering useful insights about the patterns hidden in the underlying data. One important type of graph summarization is to produce small and informative summaries based on user-selected node attributes and relationships, and allowing users to interactively drill-down or roll-up to navigate through summaries with different resolutions. However, two key components are missing from the previous work in this area that limit the use of this method in practice. First, the previous work only deals with categorical node attributes. Consequently, users have to manually bucketize numerical attributes based on domain knowledge, which is not always possible. Moreover, users often have to manually iterate through many resolutions of summaries to identify the most interesting ones. This paper addresses both these key issues to make the interactive graph summarization approach more useful in practice. We first present a method to automatically categorize numerical attributes values by exploiting the domain knowledge hidden inside the node attributes values and graph link structures. Furthermore, we propose an interestingness measure for graph summaries to point users to the potentially most insightful summaries. Using two real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques.",

The research reported in this article evaluates the influence of tools for constructing representations of evidential models on collaborative learning processes and outcomes. Pairs of participants worked with 1 of 3 representations (Graph, Matrix, Text) while investigating complex science and public health problems. Dependent measures included (a) the content of participants' utterances and representational actions and the timing of these utterances and actions with respect to the availability of information; (b) a multiple choice test of the ability to recall the data, hypotheses, and evidential relations explored; and (c) the contents of a written essay. The results show that representational notations can have significant effects on learners' interactions, and may differ in their influence on subsequent collaborative use of the knowledge being manipulated. For example, Graph and Matrix users elaborated on previously represented information more than Text users. Representation and discussion of evidential relations was quantitatively greatest for Matrix users as predicted, yet this came at the cost of excessive consideration and revision of unimportant relations. Graph users may have been more focused in their consideration of evidence, and the work done in the Graph representation had the greatest impact on the contents of the essays. Although limited to initial use of representations in a laboratory setting, the work demonstrates that representational guidance of collaborative learning is worthy of study and suggests several lines of further investigation.",

We address this knowledge integration issue by computing semantic relatedness using personalized PageRank (random walks) on a graph derived from Wikipedia. This paper evaluates methods for building the graph, including link selection strategies, and two methods for representing input texts as distributions over the graph nodes: one based on a dictionary lookup, the other based on Explicit Semantic Analysis. We evaluate our techniques on standard word relatedness and text similarity datasets, finding that they capture similarity information complementary to existing Wikipedia-based relatedness measures, resulting in small improvements on a state-of-the-art measure.",

It aims at integrating and exploiting knowledge on several domains to provide cross-domain item recommendations. More specifically, we propose an approach that automatically extracts information about two different domains, such as architecture and music, which are available in Linked Data repositories. This enables to link concepts in the two domains by means of a weighted directed acyclic graph, and to perform weight spreading on such graph to identify items in the target domain (music artists) that are related to items of the source domain (places of interest).",

However, there is little or no history of work on the subject of evaluation of knowledge bases, either with respect to their contents or with respect to the processes by which they are constructed. This article proposes the application of a metric from software engineering known as the found/fixed graph to the problem of evaluating the processes by which genomic knowledge bases are built, as well as the completeness of their contents.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWell-understood patterns of change in the found/fixed graph are found to occur in two large publicly available knowledge bases. These patterns suggest that the current manual curation processes will take far too long to complete the annotations of even just the most important model organisms, and that at their current rate of production, they will never be sufficient for completing the annotation of all currently available proteomes.",

A weighted graph is constructed on the image sequence by connecting pixels that are in the spatiotemporal neighborhood of each other. At each pixel, we define motion profile vectors which capture the probability distribution of the image velocity. The distance between motion profiles is used to assign a weight on the graph edges. Using normalised cuts we find the most salient partitions of the spatiotemporal graph formed by the image sequence. For segmenting long image sequences, we have developed a recursive update procedure that incorporates knowledge of segmentation in previous frames for efficiently finding the group correspondence in the new frame.",

We describe GUESS, a novel system for graph exploration that combines an interpreted language with a graphical front end that allows researchers to rapidly prototype and deploy new visualizations. GUESS also contains a novel, interactive interpreter that connects the language and interface in a way that facilities exploratory visualization tasks. Our language, Gython, is a domain-specific embedded language which provides all the advantages of Python with new, graph specific operators, primitives, and shortcuts. We highlight key aspects of the system in the context of a large user survey and specific, real-world, case studies ranging from social and knowledge networks to distributed computer network analysis.",

Such descriptors are of two types: 1) the vertex attributes that convey the information of the vertices themselves and 2) some topological properties used to describe the connectivity of the vertices. These descriptors are mostly of numerical or ordinal types and their similarity can be captured by quantifying their covariation. Mining topological patterns relies on frequent pattern mining and graph topology analysis to reveal the links that exist between the relation encoded by the graph and the vertex attributes. We propose three interestingness measures of topological patterns that differ by the pairs of vertices considered while evaluating up and down co-variations between vertex descriptors. An efficient algorithm that combines search and pruning strategies to look for the most relevant topological patterns is presented. Besides a classical empirical study, we report case studies on four real-life networks showing that our approach provides valuable knowledge.",

Many models, however, produce inference problems with a lot of symmetries not reflected in the graphical structure and hence not exploitable by efficient inference techniques such as belief propagation (BP). In this paper, we present a new and simple BP algorithm, called counting BP, that exploits such additional symmetries. Starting from a given factor graph, counting BP first constructs a compressed factor graph of clusternodes and clusterfactors, corresponding to sets of nodes and factors that are indistinguishable given the evidence. Then it runs a modified BP algorithm on the compressed graph that is equivalent to running BP on the original factor graph. Our experiments show that counting BP is applicable to a variety of important AI tasks such as (dynamic) relational models and boolean model counting, and that significant efficiency gains are obtainable, often by orders of magnitude.",

We propose a methodology for the automatic construction of a large-scale multilingual lexical database where words of many languages are hierarchically organized in terms of their meanings and their semantic relations to other words. This resource is bootstrapped from WordNet, a well-known English-language resource. Our approach extends WordNet with around 1.5 million meaning links for 800,000 words in over 200 languages, drawing on evidence extracted from a variety of resources including existing (monolingual) wordnets, (mostly bilingual) translation dictionaries, and parallel corpora. Graph-based scoring functions and statistical learning techniques are used to iteratively integrate this information and build an output graph. Experiments show that this wordnet has a high level of precision and coverage, and that it can be useful in applied tasks such as cross-lingual text classification.",

The graph model is built by linking pairs of words which participate in particular syntactic relationships. We focus on the symmetric relationship between pairs of nouns which occur together in lists. An incremental cluster-building algorithm using this part of the graph achieves 82% accuracy at a lexical acquisition task, evaluated against WordNet classes. The model naturally realises domain and corpus specific ambiguities as distinct components in the graph surrounding an ambiguous word.",

This paper describes the SUBDUE system, which uses the minimum description length (MDL) principle to discover substructures that compress the database and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. Inclusion of background knowledge guides SUBDUE toward appropriate substructures for a particular domain or discovery goal, and the use of an inexact graph match allows a controlled amount of deviations in the instance of a substructure concept. We describe the application of SUBDUE to a variety of domains. We also discuss approaches to combining SUBDUE with non-structural discovery systems.",
