Recently, a number of question and answer (Q&A) sites have successfully built large growing knowledge repositories, each driven by a wide range of questions and answers from its users community. While sites like Yahoo Answers have stalled and begun to shrink, one site still going strong is Quora, a rapidly growing service that augments a regular Q&A system with social links between users. Despite its success, however, little is known about what drives Quora's growth, and how it continues to connect visitors and experts to the right questions as it grows. In this paper, we present results of a detailed analysis of Quora using measurements. We shed light on the impact of three different connection networks (or graphs) inside Quora, a graph connecting topics to users, a social graph connecting users, and a graph connecting related questions. Our results show that heterogeneity in the user and question graphs are significant contributors to the quality of Quora's knowledge base. One drives the attention and activity of users, and the other directs them to a small set of popular and interesting questions.",

This paper describes the generation procedure followed by TEXCOMON, the knowledge puzzle ontology learning tool, to extract concept maps from texts. It also explains how these concept maps are exported into a domain ontology. Data sources and techniques deployed by TEXCOMON for ontology learning from texts are briefly described herein. Then, the paper focuses on evaluating the generated domain ontology and advocates the use of a three-dimensional evaluation: structural, semantic, and comparative. Based on a set of metrics, structural evaluations consider ontologies as graphs. Semantic evaluations rely on human expert judgment, and finally, comparative evaluations are based on comparisons between the outputs of state-of-the-art tools and those of new tools such as TEXCOMON, using the very same set of documents in order to highlight the improvements of new techniques. Comparative evaluations performed in this study use the same corpus to contrast results from TEXCOMON with those of one of the most advanced tools for ontology generation from text. Results generated by such experiments show that TEXCOMON yields superior performance, especially regarding conceptual relation learning.",

It is an NP-complete problem to nd a triangulation with minimum state space. Our interest in this topic originates from the eld of knowledge engineering where the applied knowledge representation scheme is provided by the notion of causal probabilistic networks (belief networks); CPNs for short. The application of a generalised evidence propagation scheme in CPNs requires triangularity (chordality) of the actual network. The paper includes a survey and evaluation of existing triangulation algorithms most of which are found to be highly ineeective w.r.t. the applied ee-ciency measure. Simple heuristic methods are presented and found to produce high-quality triangulations. Moreover, we introduce a method by which any non-minimal triangulation may be turned into a minimal one. Furthermore, we present a stochastic algorithm based on a technique known as simulated annealing by which the optimal solution to NP-complete problems may be found with probability arbitrarily close to 1.",

Also known as spring embedders, such algorithms calculate the layout of a graph using only information contained within the structure of th eg raph itself, rather than relying on domain-specific knowledge. Graphs drawn with these algorithms tend to be aesthetically pleasing, exhibit symmetries, and tend to produce crossing-free layouts for planar graphs. In this survey we consider several classical algorithms, starting from Tutte\u2019s 1963 barycentric method, and including recent scalable multiscale methods for large and dynamic graphs.",

As a byproduct this leads to a new class of kernel functions. We demonstrate how the necessary computations can be carried out efficiently. Compared to marginalized graph kernels our method in some cases leads to a significant reduction of the prediction error. Further improvement can be gained, if expert knowledge is combined with our method. We also investigate a reduced graph representation of molecules by collapsing certain structural elements, like e.g. rings, into a single node of the molecular graph.",

            "abstract": "Many tools from the field of graph signal processing exploit knowledge of the underlying graph's structure (e.g., as encoded in the Laplacian matrix) to process signals on the graph. Therefore, in the case when no graph is available, graph signal processing tools cannot be used anymore. Researchers have proposed approaches to infer a graph topology from observations of signals on its vertices. Since the problem is ill-posed, these approaches make assumptions, such as smoothness of the signals on the graph, or sparsity priors. In this paper, we propose a characterization of the space of valid graphs, in the sense that they can explain stationary signals. To simplify the exposition in this paper, we focus here on the case where signals were i.i.d. at some point back in time and were observed after diffusion on a graph. We show that the set of graphs verifying this assumption has a strong connection with the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and forms a convex set. Along with a theoretical study in which these eigenvectors are assumed to be known, we consider the practical case when the observations are noisy, and experimentally observe how fast the set of valid graphs converges to the set obtained when the exact eigenvectors are known, as the number of observations grows. To illustrate how this characterization can be used for graph recovery, we present two methods for selecting a particular point in this set under chosen criteria, namely graph simplicity and sparsity. Additionally, we introduce a measure to evaluate how much a graph is adapted to signals under a stationarity assumption. Finally, we evaluate how state-of-the-art methods relate to this framework through experiments on a dataset of temperatures.",

As social networks often contain sensitive information about individuals, preserving privacy when publishing social graphs becomes an important issue. In this paper, we consider the identity disclosure problem in releasing <italic>weighted</italic> social graphs. We identify <italic>weighted 1*-neighborhood attacks</italic>, which assume that an attacker has knowledge about not only a target's one-hop neighbors and connections between them (<italic>1-neighborhood graph</italic>), but also related node degrees and edge weights. With this information, an attacker may re-identify a target with high confidence, even if any node's 1-neighborhood graph is isomorphic with <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k-1$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=\"liu-ieq1-2615020.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> other nodes\u2019 graphs. To counter this attack while preserving high utility of the published graph, we define a key privacy property, <italic> probabilistic indistinguishability</italic>, and propose a heuristic indistinguishable group anonymization (HIGA) scheme to anonymize a weighted social graph with such a property. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data sets illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

In this paper we prove that the opposite statement is also true, namely that planar minimally rigid graphs always admit pointed embeddings, even under certain natural topological and combinatorial constraints. The proofs yield efficient embedding algorithms. They also provide---to the best of our knowledge---the first algorithmically effective result on graph embeddings with oriented matroid constraints other than convexity of faces.",

As part of a research program that investigates the development of graphing practices from elementary school to professional science activities, this study was designed to investigate similarities and differences in graph-related interpretations between scientists and college students engaged in collective graph interpretation. Forty-five students in a second-year university ecology course and four scientists participated in the study. Guided by domain- specific concerns, scientists' graph-related activities were characterized by a large number of experience-based, domain-specific interpretive resources and practices. Students' group based activities were characterized by the lack of linguistic distinctions (between scientific terms) which led to ambiguities in group negotiations; there was also a lack of knowledge about specific organism populations which helped field ecologists construct meaning. Many students learned to provide correct answers to specific graphing questions but did not come to make linguistic distinctions or increase their knowledge of specific populations. In the absence of concerns other than to do well in the course, students did not appear to develop any general interpretive skills for graphs, but learned instead to apply the professor's interpretation. This is problematic because, as we have demonstrated, there are widely differing viable interpretations of the graph. Suggestions for changes in learning environments for graphing that should alleviate this problem are made. \u00a9 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 36: 1020\u20131043, 1999",

The present research identifies a gap in the existing knowledge of graph construction, namely potential problems in both 3D and 2D graphs that will impede comprehension of information when three or more variables are used in a graphical representation. Based on theories regarding perceptual issues of graph construction (Bertin 1981; Pinker 1991), we evaluate specific cases where 3D graphs may outperform 2D graphs, and vice-versa. Two experiments have been conducted to test these hypotheses, and 3D graphs have been found to consistently outperform 2D graphs in all of our experimental scenarios. A third experiment has been conducted to identify situations where 2D graphs might perform at least as well as 3D graphs, but its results suggest that 3D graphs outperform 2D graphs even for simple tasks, thus leading to the conclusion that 3D graphs perform better than 2D graphs under all task conditions with more than two variables.",

There is now a series of conferences on context, a website and a mailing list. The number of web pages with the word \u201ccontext\u201d has increased tenfold in the last five years. Being among the instigators of the use of context in real-world applications, I present in this paper the evolution of my thoughts over the last years and the results that have been obtained, including a representation formalism based on contextual graphs and the use of this formalism in a real-world application called SART. I present how procedures, practices and context are intertwined, as identified in the SART application and in different domains. I root my view of context in the artificial intelligence area and give a general presentation of my view of context under the three aspects \u2013 external knowledge, contextual knowledge and proceduralised context \u2013 with the implementation of this view in contextual graphs. I discuss how reasoning is carried out, based on procedure and practices, in the formalism of contextual graphs and show how incremental acquisition of practices is integrated in this formalism.",

To propose user-centred aesthetic criteria for a \"good\" layout, it is important to have knowledge on how people read graphs; how a particular graph layout characteristic can affect people's reading performance. On the other hand, despite the increasingly wide use of graphs in everyday life, yet we know surprisingly little about how people actually read graphs. The present eye tracking study in this paper is an attempt to perform an initial investigation into this issue and provide data that can help build the basic understanding of how people read graphs.",

            "abstract": "The hardest task in knowledge engineering for probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and in\u221euence diagrams, is obtaining their numerical parameters. Models based on acyclic directed graphs and composed of discrete variables, currently most common in practice, require for every variable a number of parameters that is exponential in the number of its parents in the graph, which makes elicitation from experts or learning from databases a daunting task. In this paper, we review the so called canonical models, whose main advantage is that they require much fewer parameters. We propose a general framework for them, based on three categories: deterministic models, ICI models, and simple canonical models. ICI models rely on the concept of independence of causal in\u221euence and can be subdivided into noisy and leaky. We then analyze the most common families of canonical models (the OR/MAX, the AND/MIN, and the noisy XOR), generalizing them and ofiering criteria for applying them in practice. We also brie\u221ey review temporal canonical models.",

We look at algorithmic constraints such as limited storage, no knowledge of an upper bound on the number of nodes, and no usage of identifiers.

In the standard version, knowledge previously collected about faces is used for finding the landmarks in the first frame. In a second version, the system is able to track the face without any prior knowledge about faces and is thus applicable to other object classes. By using Gabor filters as visual features, and by both avoiding limiting assumptions and many parameters our tracking tool is simple and easy to use. As a first application the tracking results are used to estimate the pose of a face.",

Sound and complete reasonings w.r.t. associated logic formulas are obtained through a kind of graph homomorphism called projection. \n \nConceptual Graphs Rules (or CG rules) are a standard extension to SGs, keeping sound and complete reasonings w.r.t. associated logic formulas (they have the same form as tuple generating dependencies in database): these graphs represent knowledge of the form \"IF ... THEN\". \n \nWe present here an optimization of the natural forward chaining algorithm for CG rules. Generating a graph of rules dependencies makes the following sequences of rule applications far more efficient, and the structure of this graph can be used to obtain new decidability results.",

CSILE allows information in several media (text, drawings, graphs, timelines, etc.) to be entered into a common database where it is available to be retrieved, linked, commented on, rated, and so forth. The environments and operations of CSILE are designed to support students in more purposeful and mature, or intentional, processing of information. In this article eleven principles, based on recent cognitive research, are suggested for designing computer environments that support intentional learning. These principles include making knowledge-construction activities overt, maintaining attention to learning goals as opposed to other goals of an activity, providing process-relevant feedback, and giving students responsibility for contributing to each other's learning. Applications of these principles in CSILE are described, as well as observations from the first year of school try-out.",

While valuable graph tools have been implemented in R/Bioconductor, to our knowledge there is currently no software package to parse and analyze KEGG pathways with graph theory. Results: We introduce the software package KEGGgraph in R and Bioconductor, an interface between KEGG pathways and graph models as well as a collection of tools for these graphs. Superior to existing approaches, KEGGgraph captures the pathway topology and allows further analysis or dissection of pathway graphs. We demonstrate the use of the package by the case study of analyzing human pancreatic cancer pathway. Availability:KEGGgraph is freely available at the Bioconductor web site (http://www.bioconductor.org). KGML files can be downloaded from KEGG FTP site (ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/xml).

            "abstract": "Researchers have proposed a variety of metrics to measure important graph properties, for instance, in social, biological, and computer networks. Values for a particular graph metric may capture a graph's resilience to failure or its routing efficiency. Knowledge of appropriate metric values may influence the engineering of future topologies, repair strategies in the face of failure, and understanding of fundamental properties of existing networks. Unfortunately, there are typically no algorithms to generate graphs matching one or more proposed metrics and there is little understanding of the relationships among individual metrics or their applicability to different settings. We present a new, systematic approach for analyzing network topologies. We first introduce the dK-series of probability distributions specifying all degree correlations within d-sized subgraphs of a given graph G. Increasing values of d capture progressively more properties of G at the cost of more complex representation of the probability distribution. Using this series, we can quantitatively measure the distance between two graphs and construct random graphs that accurately reproduce virtually all metrics proposed in the literature. The nature of the dK-series implies that it will also capture any future metrics that may be proposed. Using our approach, we construct graphs for d=0, 1, 2, 3 and demonstrate that these graphs reproduce, with increasing accuracy, important properties of measured and modeled Internet topologies. We find that the d=2 case is sufficient for most practical purposes, while d=3 essentially reconstructs the Internet AS-and router-level topologies exactly. We hope that a systematic method to analyze and synthesize topologies offers a significant improvement to the set of tools available to network topology and protocol researchers.",

The primary motivation for this work is to provide a paradigm for exploration and knowledge discovery in large social networks graphs. We present a formal definition of this problem, and an ideal solution based on electricity analogues. We then show how to accelerate the computations, to produce approximate, but high-quality connection subgraphs in real time on very large (disk resident) graphs.We describe our operational prototype, and we demonstrate results on a social network graph derived from the World Wide Web. Our graph contains 15 million nodes and 96 million edges, and our system still produces quality responses within seconds.",

            "abstract": "Querying complex graph databases such as knowledge graphs is a challenging task for non-professional users. Due to their complex schemas and variational information descriptions, it becomes very hard for users to formulate a query that can be properly processed by the existing systems. We argue that for a user-friendly graph query engine, it must support various kinds of transformations such as synonym, abbreviation, and ontology. Furthermore, the derived query results must be ranked in a principled manner. \n \nIn this paper, we introduce a novel framework enabling s chema l ess and s tructure l ess graph q uerying (SLQ), where a user need not describe queries precisely as required by most databases. The query engine is built on a set of transformation functions that automatically map keywords and linkages from a query to their matches in a graph. It automatically learns an effective ranking model, without assuming manually labeled training examples, and can efficiently return top ranked matches using graph sketch and belief propagation. The architecture of SLQ is elastic for \"plug-in\" new transformation functions and query logs. Our experimental results show that this new graph querying paradigm is promising: It identifies high-quality matches for both keyword and graph queries over real-life knowledge graphs, and outperforms existing methods significantly in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",

Our goal is to create such tools, so that a trained knowledge engineer is no longer required to mediate the interaction. This paper presents our work on the knowledge entry part of this overall knowledge capture task, which is based on several claims: that users can construct representations by connecting pre-fabricated, representational components, rather than writing low-level axioms; that these components can be presented to users as graphs; and the user can then perform composition through graph manipulation operations. To operationalize this, we have developed a novel technique of graphical dialog using examples of the component concepts, followed by an automated process for generalizing the user's graphically-entered assertions into axioms. We present these claims, our approach, the system (called SHAKEN) that we are developing, and an evaluation of our progress based on having users encode knowledge using the system.",

Graph interpretation competence is, in fact, essential to understanding today\u2019s world and to be scientifically literate. However, graph interpretation is a complex and challenging activity. Graph interpretation competence is affected by many factors, including aspects of graph characteristics, the content of the graph and viewers\u2019 prior knowledge. For instance, the prior theory and expectations that students have may lead to biases and misinterpretation of graphs. One basic controversy that remains unanswered, for example, is what should we teach first in order to make students scientific literate, how to graph or how to interpret a graph? If it is the case that the ability to interpret a graph be developed prior to the ability to create, then it is important to understand what graph interpretation entails. This paper reviews current literature on graph interpretation competence and argues that it should be explicitly taught given its importance and its complexity.",

However, obtaining a suitable feature vector representation from RDF graphs is a challenging task. In this paper, we extend the RDF2Vec approach, which leverages language modeling techniques for unsupervised feature extraction from sequences of entities. We generate sequences by exploiting local information from graph substructures, harvested by graph walks, and learn latent numerical representations of entities in RDF graphs. We extend the way we compute feature vector representations by comparing twelve different edge weighting functions for performing biased walks on the RDF graph, in order to generate higher quality graph embeddings. We evaluate our approach using different machine learning, as well as entity and document modeling benchmark data sets, and show that the naive RDF2Vec approach can be improved by exploiting Biased Graph Walks.",

Learning such continuous-space vector representations (or embeddings) of nodes in a graph is an important first step for using network information (from social networks, user-item graphs, knowledge bases, etc.) in many machine learning tasks. Unlike previous work, we (1) explicitly model an edge as a function of node embeddings, and we (2) propose a novel objective, the graph likelihood, which contrasts information from sampled random walks with non-existent edges. Individually, both of these contributions improve the learned representations, especially when there are memory constraints on the total size of the embeddings. When combined, our contributions enable us to significantly improve the state-of-the-art by learning more concise representations that better preserve the graph structure. We evaluate our method on a variety of link-prediction task including social networks, collaboration networks, and protein interactions, showing that our proposed method learn representations with error reductions of up to 76% and 55%, on directed and undirected graphs. In addition, we show that the representations learned by our method are quite space efficient, producing embeddings which have higher structure-preserving accuracy but are 10 times smaller.",

Conceptual graphs are a representational medium used to integrate and organize knowledge obtained from documents, verbal protocols, question probes, and observation of task performance. The method was validated by presenting two groups of subjects with text and graphics on a topic in engineering dynamics. One set of materials was written by a recognized subject matter expert. The other set was developed by subjecting the expert generated text to conceptual graph analysis. The text was first translated into a conceptual graph structure, then the graph was revised via question probes and observation/induction methods. The final graph was returned to a standard text format. Students receiving the knowledge-engineered text solved significantly more problems than students receiving the original text. Conceptual graph analysis is a generalized method that can be used for a broad range of training domains, providing a highly structured means for making explicit the knowledge base to be incorporated into instructional design.",

We consider the problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. We call these nodes effectors. We formally define the k-Effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. We show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only NP-hard to solve optimally, but also NP-hard to approximate. We also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-Effectors problem in networks. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the DBLP co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.",

This problem is critical in minimizing communication costs and running time for several large-scale distributed graph computation platforms (e.g., PowerGraph, Spark GraphX). We first prove that this problem is NP-hard, and then present a new partitioning heuristic with polynomial running time. We provide a worst-case upper bound of replication factor for our heuristic on general graphs. To our knowledge, we are the first to provide such bound for edge partitioning algorithms on general graphs. Applying this bound to random power-law graphs greatly improves the previous bounds of expected replication factor. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our partitioning algorithm consistently produces much smaller replication factors on various benchmark data sets than the state-of-the-art. When deployed in the production graph engine, PowerGraph, in average it reduces replication factor, communication, and running time by 54%, 66%, and 21%, respectively.",

Mining such uncertain graph data is semantically different from and computationally more challenging than mining conventional exact graph data. This paper investigates the problem of mining uncertain graph data and especially focuses on mining frequent subgraph patterns on an uncertain graph database. A novel model of uncertain graphs is presented, and the frequent subgraph pattern mining problem is formalized by introducing a new measure, called expected support. This problem is proved to be NP-hard. An approximate mining algorithm is proposed to find a set of approximately frequent subgraph patterns by allowing an error tolerance on expected supports of discovered subgraph patterns. The algorithm uses efficient methods to determine whether a subgraph pattern can be output or not and a new pruning method to reduce the complexity of examining subgraph patterns. Analytical and experimental results show that the algorithm is very efficient, accurate, and scalable for large uncertain graph databases. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to investigate the problem of mining frequent subgraph patterns from uncertain graph data.",

We assume that each normal node in the network has no knowledge of the network topology other than an upper bound on the number of malicious nodes in its neighborhood. We introduce a topological property known as r-robustness of a graph, and show that this property provides improved bounds on tolerating malicious behavior, in comparison to traditional concepts such as connectivity and minimum degree. We use this topological property to analyze the canonical problems of distributed consensus and broadcast, and provide sufficient conditions for these operations to succeed. Finally, we provide a construction for r-robust graphs and show that the common preferential-attachment model for scale-free networks produces a robust graph.",

Pointing out that this represents a heavy reliance on \"local\" properties of the web graph, we study the distribution of PageRank values on the web. Our measurements suggest that PageRank values on the web follow a power law. We then develop generative models for the web graph that explain this observation and moreover remain faithful to previously studied degree distributions. We analyze these models and compare the analysis to both snapshots from the web and to graphs generated by simulations on the new models. To our knowledge this represents the first modeling of the web that goes beyond fitting degree distributions on the web.",

However, the apparent simplicity of chain graphs belies the subtlety of the conditional independence hypotheses that they represent. There are many simple and apparently plausible, but ultimately fallacious, interpretations of chain graphs that are often invoked, implicitly or explicitly. These interpretations also lead to flawed methods for applying background knowledge to model selection. We present a valid interpretation by showing how the distribution corresponding to a chain graph may be generated from the equilibrium distributions of dynamic models with feed\u2010back. These dynamic interpretations lead to a simple theory of intervention, extending the theory developed for directed acyclic graphs. Finally, we contrast chain graph models under this interpretation with simultaneous equation models which have traditionally been used to model feed\u2010back in econometrics.",

CDSs have been proposed as a virtual backbone for routing in wireless ad hoc networks. However, it is NP-hard to find a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS). An approximation algorithm for MCDS in general graphs has been proposed in the literature with performance guarantee of 3 + In \u0394 where \u0394 is the maximal nodal degree [1]. This algorithm has been implemented in distributed manner in wireless networks [2]\u2013[4]. This distributed implementation suffers from high time and message complexity, and the performance ratio remains 3 + In \u0394. Another distributed algorithm has been developed in [5], with performance ratio of \u0398(n). Both algorithms require two-hop neighborhood knowledge and a message length of \u03a9 (\u0394). On the other hand, wireless ad hoc networks have a unique geometric nature, which can be modeled as a unit-disk graph (UDG), and thus admits heuristics with better performance guarantee. In this paper we propose two destributed heuristics with constant performance ratios. The time and message complexity for any of these algorithms is O(n), and O(n log n), respectively. Both of these algorithms require only single-hop neighborhood knowledge, and a message length of O (1).",

Such widespread usage of graphs has generated considerable interest in mining patterns from graph databases. While an array of techniques exists to mine frequent patterns, we still lack a scalable approach to mine statistically significant patterns, specifically patterns with low p-values, that occur at low frequencies. We propose a highly scalable technique, called GraphSig, to mine significant subgraphs from large graph databases. We convert each graph into a set of feature vectors where each vector represents a region within the graph. Domain knowledge is used to select a meaningful feature set. Prior probabilities of features are computed empirically to evaluate statistical significance of patterns in the feature space. Following analysis in the feature space, only a small portion of the exponential search space is accessed for further analysis. This enables the use of existing frequent subgraph mining techniques to mine significant patterns in a scalable manner even when they are infrequent. Extensive experiments are carried out on the proposed techniques, and empirical results demonstrate that GraphSig is effective and efficient for mining significant patterns. To further demonstrate the power of significant patterns, we develop a classifier using patterns mined by GraphSig. Experimental results show that the proposed classifier achieves superior performance, both in terms of quality and computation cost, over state-of-the-art classifiers.",

The feature extraction model is biologically motivated, and the locations of the features often correspond to salient facial features such as the eyes, nose, etc. Topological graphs are used to represent relations between features, and a simple deterministic graph-matching scheme that exploits the basic structure is used to recognize familiar faces from a database. Each of the stages in the system can be fully implemented in parallel to achieve real-time recognition. Experimental results for a 128*128 image with very little noise are evaluated.<<ETX>>",

Although several network management systems are available in the market, none of them have sufficient capabilities to detect faults in multi-tier Web-based systems with redundancy. We model a Web-based system as a weighted graph, where each node represents a \"service\" and each edge represents a dependency between services. Since the edge weights vary greatly over time, the problem we address is that of anomaly detection from a time sequence of graphs.In our method, we first extract a feature vector from the adjacency matrix that represents the activities of all of the services. The heart of our method is to use the principal eigenvector of the eigenclusters of the graph. Then we derive a probability distribution for an anomaly measure defined for a time-series of directional data derived from the graph sequence. Given a critical probability, the threshold value is adaptively updated using a novel online algorithm.We demonstrate that a fault in a Web application can be automatically detected and the faulty services are identified without using detailed knowledge of the behavior of the system.",

Knowledge assets, knowledge producing and disseminating organisations are referenced to spatial objects and integrated into GIS. They are further represented in thematic maps and in 3-D perspective graphs. Special attention is given to mapping and measuring knowledge clusters. Statistical procedures to measure the degree of knowledge clustering are discussed and ways are indicated to compare and determine the emergence of knowledge clusters. We conclude that the construction of knowledge maps showing the complexity of epistemic landscapes will enhance the chances of government agencies, companies and civic organisations to understand and use knowledge for development. This paper is in the first place meant as guideline for the related analysis.",

We show that determining whether s(G) \u2264 K, for a given integer K, is NP-hard for general graphs but can be solved in linear time for trees.

We also explore and evaluate methods that combine several open-text word sense disambiguation algorithms.",

Today, large amounts of graph data have been generated by various applications. Graph summarization techniques are crucial in uncovering useful insights about the patterns hidden in the underlying data. However, all existing works in graph summarization are single-process solutions, and as a result cannot scale to large graphs. In this paper, we introduce three distributed graph summarization algorithms to address this problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can produce good quality summaries and scale well with increasing data sizes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study distributed graph summarization methods.",

Existing graph kernels exploit only limited information about the graph structures but are still computationally expensive. We propose a novel graph kernel based on the structural characteristics of graphs. The key is to represent node labels as binary arrays and characterize each node using logical operations on the label set of the connected nodes. Our kernel has a linear time complexity with respect to the number of nodes times the average number of neighboring nodes in the given graphs. The experimental result shows that the proposed kernel performs comparable and much faster than a state-of-the-art graph kernel for benchmark data sets and shows high scalability for new applications with large graphs.",

Our approach is based on the concept of graphs; for example, the genome is a graph with genes as nodes and the pathway is another graph with gene products as nodes. We have developed a simple method for graph comparison to identify local similarities, termed correlated clusters, between two graphs, which allows gaps and mismatches of nodes and edges and is especially suitable for detecting biological features. The method was applied to a comparison of the complete genomes of 10 microorganisms and the KEGG metabolic pathways, which revealed, not surprisingly, a tendency for formation of correlated clusters called FRECs (functionally related enzyme clusters). However, this tendency varied considerably depending on the organism. The relative number of enzymes in FRECs was close to 50% for Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, but was <10% for SYNECHOCYSTIS: and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The FRECs collection is reorganized into a collection of ortholog group tables in KEGG, which represents conserved pathway motifs with the information about gene clusters in all the completely sequenced genomes.",

Traces of such activity may be fragmented across multiple logs and may not match analytic needs. As a result, the coherence of distributed interaction and emergent phenomena are analytically cloaked. Understanding distributed learning and knowledge creation requires multi-level analysis of the situated accomplishments of individuals and small groups and of how this local activity gives rise to larger phenomena in a network. We have developed an abstract transcript representation that provides a unified analytic artifact of distributed activity, and an analytic hierarchy that supports multiple levels of analysis. Log files are abstracted to directed graphs that record observed relationships (contingencies) between events, which may be interpreted as evidence of interaction and other influences between actors. Contingency graphs are further abstracted to two-mode directed graphs that record how associations between actors are mediated by digital artifacts and summarize sequential patterns of interaction. Transitive closure of these associograms creates sociograms, to which existing network analytic techniques may be applied, yielding aggregate results that can then be interpreted by reference to the other levels of analysis. We discuss how the analytic hierarchy bridges between levels of analysis and theory.",

It is the first mathematically rigorous textbook discussing both models of the web graph and algorithms for searching the web. After introducing key tools required for the study of web graph mathematics, an overview is given of the most widely studied models for the web graph. A discussion of popular web search algorithms, e.g. PageRank, is followed by additional topics, such as applications of infinite graph theory to the web graph, spectral properties of power law graphs, domination in the web graph, and the spread of viruses in networks. The book is based on a graduate course taught at the AARMS 2006 Summer School at Dalhousie University. As such it is self-contained and includes over 100 exercises. The reader of the book will gain a working knowledge of current research in graph theory and its modern applications. In addition, the reader will learn first-hand about models of the web, and the mathematics underlying modern search engines.",

Graph mining aims at finding interesting patterns within this data that represent novel knowledge. While current data mining deals with static graphs that do not change over time, coming years will see the advent of an increasing number of time series of graphs. In this article, we investigate how pattern mining on static graphs can be extended to time series of graphs. In particular, we are considering dynamic graphs with edge insertions and edge deletions over time. We define frequency in this setting and provide algorithmic solutions for finding frequent dynamic subgraph patterns. Existing subgraph mining algorithms can be easily integrated into our framework to make them handle dynamic graphs. Experimental results on real-world data confirm the practical feasibility of our approach.",

            "abstract": "Systems biologists use interaction graphs to model the behavior of biological systems at the molecular level. In an iterative process, such biologists observe the reactions of living cells under various experimental conditions, view the results in the context of the interaction graph, and then propose changes to the graph model. These graphs serve as a form of dynamic knowledge representation of the biological system being studied and evolve as new insight is gained from the experimental data. While numerous graph layout and drawing packages are available, these tools did not fully meet the needs of our immunologist collaborators. In this paper, we describe the data information display needs of these immunologists and translate them into design decisions. These decisions led us to create Cerebral, a system that uses a biologically guided graph layout and incorporates experimental data directly into the graph display. Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously. To illustrate the typical analysis tasks performed, we analyze two datasets using Cerebral. Based on feedback from our collaborators we conclude that Cerebral is a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data in the context of an interaction graph model.",

New graphs of faces are generated by an elastic graph matching procedure comparing the new face with a set of precomputed graphs: the \"general face knowledge\". The final phase of the matching process can be used to generate composite images of faces and to determine certain features represented in the general face knowledge, such as gender or the presence of glasses or a beard. The graphs can be compared by a similarity function which makes the system efficient in recognizing faces.",

We present MING, a principled method for extracting an informative subgraph for given query nodes. MING builds on a new notion of informativeness of nodes. This is used in a random-walk-with-restarts process to compute the informativeness of entire subgraphs.",

From this, we construct attack scenarios, and provide scores for the degree of causal correlation between their constituent events, as well as an overall relevancy score for each scenario. While intrusion event correlation and attack scenario construction have been previously studied, this is the first treatment based on association with network attack graphs. We handle missed detections through the analysis of network vulnerability dependencies, unlike previous approaches that infer hypothetical attacks. In particular, we quantify lack of knowledge through attack graph distance. We show that low-pass signal filtering of event correlation sequences improves results in the face of erroneous detections. We also show how a correlation threshold can be applied for creating strongly correlated attack scenarios. Our model is highly efficient, with attack graphs and their exploit distances being computed offline. Online event processing requires only a database lookup and a small number of arithmetic operations, making the approach feasible for real-time applications.",

Thus considerable interest has arisen in algorithms for drawing directed graphs so that they are easy to understand and remember. The paper defines three aesthetic criteria for drawings of directed graphs, and discusses a general method for obtaining drawings according to these criteria. Several recent algorithms to draw directed graphs are instances of this general method. The aesthetic criteria can be viewed as goals of optimization problems. Each step of the general method aims to achieve one of the criteria by solving these optimization problems. The authors discuss the current state of knowledge of each of these problems.<<ETX>>",

In this article, we propose a graph-aided method to solve this problem for two-level experiments. First, we choose the defining relations for a 2 n\u2013k design according to a goodness criterion such as the minimum aberration criterion. Then we construct all of the nonisomorphic graphs that represent the solutions to the problem of simultaneous estimation of main effects and two-factor interactions for the given defining relations. In each graph a vertex represents a factor and an edge represents the interaction between the two factors. For the experiment planner, the job is simple: Draw a graph representing the specified interactions and compare it with the list of graphs obtained previously. Our approach is a substantial improvement over Taguchi's linear graphs.",

However, the appropriate level of granularity for tracking provenance of RDF graph remains in debate. RDF document is too coarse since it could contain irrelevant information. RDF triple will fail when two triples share the same blank node. Therefore, this paper investigates lossless decomposition of RDF graph and tracking the provenance of RDF graph using RDF molecule, which is the finest and lossless component of an RDF graph. A sub-graph is {\\em lossless} if it can be used to restore the original graph without introducing new triples. A sub-graph is {\\em finest} if it cannot be further decomposed into lossless sub-graphs. The lossless decomposition algorithms and RDF molecule have been formalized and implemented by a prototype RDF graph provenance service in Swoogle project.",

By graph, we mean representations with nodes and edges to model the relationships within the space represented. Why are they the default representation? The answer that is usually proferred is that the Semantic Web is a Graph, ipso facto we use graphs to represent it. This notion that data should be presented to the user as it is represented in the computer is what we propose as the pathetic fallacy of RDF. In the following discussion, we consider examples of the pathetic fallacy in terms of the interaction challenge of * what knowledge these graphs communicate, * what tasks they support, and * whether these are the optimal paradigms for these representations/tasks. From this context, we investigate the question, are graphs the main default representation for the Semantic Web and if not, how might we think about formalized representations for the Semantic Web in order to make accessible the promised benefits of the Semantic Web for knowledge building.",

The graph structures are large, and the applications need regular access to a large, data-dependent portion of the graph for each operation (e.g., the algorithm may need to walk the graph, visiting all nodes, or propagate changes through many nodes in the graph). On conventional microprocessors, the graph structures exceed on-chip cache capacities, making main-memory bandwidth and latency the key performance limiters. To avoid this \"memory wall,\" we introduce a concurrent system architecture for sparse graph algorithms that places graph nodes in small distributed memories paired with specialized graph processing nodes interconnected by a lightweight network. This gives us a scalable way to map these applications so that they can exploit the high-bandwidth and low-latency capabilities of embedded memories (e.g., FPGA Block RAMs). On typical spreading-activation queries on the ConceptNet Knowledge Base, a sample application, this translates into an order of magnitude speedup per FPGA compared to a state-of-the-art Pentium processor",

We show in our critique that such views lead to a common assessment problem of how to account for variations in performance across contexts and tasks, and a common attribution problem that locates difficulties in students' deficient cognitive apparatus. Grounded in recent research of scientists at work and everyday cognition, this article provides an alternative perspective that conceives of graphing as observable practices employed to achieve specific goals. This perspective highlights the nature of graphs as semiotic objects, rhetorical devices, and conscription devices. This shift in perspective dissolves problems with assessment and inappropriate attribution of student difficulties. The plausibility and fruitfulness of the new perspective is illustrated in three ways. First, we show that successes and failures of various graphing curricula become understandable in terms of the presence or absence of social dimensions of the practice. Second, we show how our perspective necessitates new assessment practices. Third, we show how our practice perspective on graphing led us to different learning environments and to new foci for conducting research in student-centered open-inquiry contexts. \u00a9 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Some basic characteristics of a competence model are proposed for knowledge structures used in comprehending and generating graphs. Two types of common misconceptions, treating the graph as a picture and slope-height confusions, are discussed in terms of this model. Competence Model The ability to interpret graphs is important for mathematical literacy and for understanding the concepts of function and variable, as well as for developing basic concepts in calculus. I will first propose a partial model of four types of knowledge structures needed to comprehend graphs, shown in Figs. 1a and lb. This should not be viewed as a Platonic \"given\", but as a plausible competence model which provides an initial theoretical framework for interpreting students' errors. I will consider some of the conceptions needed to solve the problem of drawing the qualitative shape of the graph of speed vs. time for a bicycle rider coming down from the top of a hill. In particular, I want to incorporate (a) the connection to a real world context and (b) the idea of variation. Static model. Conception (1) in Fig. 1a is a naive practical representation incorporating everyday knowledge about the problem situation based on one's concrete experience with watching and riding bicycles, including the sensation of speeding up as one rides down a hill. Here I will simply refer to each knowledge structure as a conception, but they can also be thought of as occurring at different levels of representation. Conception (2) represents the idea that at a particular time, the bicycle is at a particular speed. Thus, the subject must have adequately developed concepts for speed and time and must be able to isolate these variables in the problem situation. In conception (3), I show the subject forming a spatial distance",

We represent prior knowledge of 3D shapes and scenes by probabilistic models at two levels - both are defined on graphs. The first level model is built on a graph representation for single objects, and it is a mixture model for both man-made block objects such as trees and grasses. It assumes surface and boundary smoothness, 3D angle symmetry etc. The second level model is built on the relation graph of all objects in a scene. It assumes that objects should be supported for maximum stability with global bounding surfaces, such as ground, sky and walls. Given an input image, we extract the geometry and photometric structures through image segmentation and sketching, and represent them in a big graph. Then we partition the graph into subgraphs each being an object, infer the 3D shape and recover occluded surfaces, edges and vertices in each subgraph, and infer the scene structures between the recovered 3D sub-graphs. The inference algorithm samples from the prior model under the constraint that it reproduces the observed image/sketch under projective geometry.",

The robot has no a priori knowledge of the topology of the graph, nor of its size. It is known that for any k-state robot, there exists a graph of maximum degree 3 that the robot cannot explore. This article considers the effects of allowing the system designer to add short labels to the graph nodes in a preprocessing stage, for helping the exploration by the robot. We describe an exploration algorithm that, given appropriate 2-bit labels (in fact, only 3-valued labels), allows a robot to explore all graphs. Furthermore, we describe a suitable labeling algorithm for generating the required labels in linear time. We also show how to modify our labeling scheme so that a robot can explore all graphs of bounded degree, given appropriate 1-bit labels. In other words, although there is no robot able to explore all graphs of maximum degree 3, there is a robot R, and a way to color in black or white the nodes of any bounded-degree graph G, so that R can explore the colored graph G. Finally, we give impossibility results regarding graph exploration by a robot with no internal memory (i.e., a single-state automaton).",

We present a new model for understanding scale-free networks based on multilevel geodesic approximation, using a new data structure called a multilevel mesh.Using this multilevel framework, we propose a new kind of graph clustering for data reduction of very large graph systems such as social, biological, or electronic networks. Finally, we apply our algorithms to real-world social networks and protein interaction graphs to show that they can reveal knowledge embedded in underlying graph structures. We also demonstrate how our data structures can be used to quickly answer approximate distance and shortest path queries on scale-free networks.",

The system is designed for drawing large graphs and uses a novel multi-dimensional force-directed method together with fast energy function minimization. The algorithm underlying the system employs a simple recursive coarsening scheme. Rather than being placed at random, vertices are placed intelligently, several at a time, at locations close to their final positions. The running time and space complexity of the system are near linear. The implementation is in C using OpenGL for 3D viewing. The GRIP system allows for drawing graphs with tens of thousands of vertices in under one minute on a mid-range PC. To the best of the authors' knowledge, GRIP surpasses the fastest previous algorithms. However, speed is not achieved at the expense of quality as the resulting drawings are quite aesthetically pleasing.",

We propose a formalism for simple conceptual graphs which generalizes the usually considered model, and preserves its fundamental properties. Links with important combinatorial notions (graph morphism, Constraint Satisfaction Problems) are established. Finally a notion of nested conceptual graph is fonnally defined, which significantly extends the simple model.",

Moreover, a translator is described which translates these graphical representations to textual representations in DESIRE. The strength of the combined environment is a powerful\u2014yet easy-to-use\u2014framework to support the development of knowledge-based and multi-agent systems. Finally, a mapping is presented from DESIRE to Conceptual Graphs. This provides a unifying perspective on the knowledge representation format of DESIRE and allows the use of conceptual graph tools to specify and maintain the knowledge representation part of a DESIRE specification.",
