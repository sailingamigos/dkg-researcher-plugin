While knowledge graphs are structure-flexible and content-rich, they are difficult to use. The challenge lies in the gap between their overwhelming complexity and the limited database knowledge of non-professional users. If writing structured queries over \u201csimple\u201d tables is difficult, complex graphs are only harder to query. As an initial step toward improving the usability of knowledge graphs, we propose to query such data by example entity tuples, without requiring users to form complex graph queries. Our system, Graph Query By Example (GQBE), automatically discovers a weighted hidden maximum query graph based on input query tuples, to capture a user's query intent. It then efficiently finds and ranks the top approximate matching answer graphs and answer tuples. We conducted experiments and user studies on the large Freebase and DBpedia datasets and observed appealing accuracy and efficiency. Our system provides a complementary approach to the existing keyword-based methods, facilitating user-friendly graph querying. To the best of our knowledge, there was no such proposal in the past in the context of graphs.",

These semantic knowledge graphs provide a scalable \u201cschema for the web\u201d, representing a significant opportunity for the spoken language understanding (SLU) research community. This paper leverages these resources to bootstrap a web-scale semantic parser with no requirement for semantic schema design, no data collection, and no manual annotations. Our approach is based on an iterative graph crawl algorithm. From an initial seed node (entity-type), the method learns the related entity-types from the graph structure, and automatically annotates documents that can be linked to the node (e.g., Wikipedia articles, web search documents). Following the branches, the graph is crawled and the procedure is repeated. The resulting collection of annotated documents is used to bootstrap webscale conditional random field (CRF) semantic parsers. Finally, we use a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) unsupervised adaptation technique on sample data from a specific domain to refine the parsers. The scale of the unsupervised parsers is on the order of thousands of domains and entity-types, millions of entities, and hundreds of millions of relations. The precision-recall of the semantic parsers trained with our unsupervised method approaches those trained with supervised annotations.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been utilized as useful side information to improve recommendation quality. In those recommender systems, knowledge graph information often contains fruitful facts and inherent semantic relatedness among items. However, the success of such methods relies on the high quality knowledge graphs, and may not learn quality representations with two challenges: i) The long-tail distribution of entities results in sparse supervision signals for KG-enhanced item representation; ii) Real-world knowledge graphs are often noisy and contain topic-irrelevant connections between items and entities. Such KG sparsity and noise make the item-entity dependent relations deviate from reflecting their true characteristics, which significantly amplifies the noise effect and hinders the accurate representation of user's preference. To fill this research gap, we design a general Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning framework (KGCL) that alleviates the information noise for knowledge graph-enhanced recommender systems. Specifically, we propose a knowledge graph augmentation schema to suppress KG noise in information aggregation, and derive more robust knowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, we exploit additional supervision signals from the KG augmentation process to guide a cross-view contrastive learning paradigm, giving a greater role to unbiased user-item interactions in gradient descent and further suppressing the noise. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of our KGCL over state-of-the-art techniques. KGCL also achieves strong performance in recommendation scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, long-tail and noisy KG entities.

            "abstract": "Deep learning on graphs has recently achieved remarkable success on a variety of tasks, while such success relies heavily on the massive and carefully labeled data. However, precise annotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, self-supervised learning (SSL) is emerging as a new paradigm for extracting informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels. In this survey, we extend the concept of SSL, which first emerged in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, to present a timely and comprehensive review of existing SSL techniques for graph data. Specifically, we divide existing graph SSL methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and predictive. More importantly, unlike other surveys that only provide a high-level description of published research, we present an additional mathematical summary of existing works in a unified framework. Furthermore, to facilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks, open-source implementations, and experimental study of various algorithms. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges and potential future directions for improving graph self-supervised learning. Latest advances in graph SSL are summarized in a GitHub repository https://github.com/LirongWu/awesome-graph-self-supervised-learning.",

However, most of existing knowledge graphs are represented with pure symbols, which hurts the machine's capability to understand the real world. The multi-modalization of knowledge graphs is an inevitable key step towards the realization of human-level machine intelligence. The results of this endeavor are Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs). In this survey on MMKGs constructed by texts and images, we first give definitions of MMKGs, followed with the preliminaries on multi-modal tasks and techniques. We then systematically review the challenges, progresses and opportunities on the construction and application of MMKGs respectively, with detailed analyses of the strength and weakness of different solutions. We finalize this survey with open research problems relevant to MMKGs.",

            "abstract": "Graph representation learning resurges as a trending research subject owing to the widespread use of deep learning for Euclidean data, which inspire various creative designs of neural networks in the non-Euclidean domain, particularly graphs. With the success of these graph neural networks (GNN) in the static setting, we approach further practical scenarios where the graph dynamically evolves. Existing approaches typically resort to node embeddings and use a recurrent neural network (RNN, broadly speaking) to regulate the embeddings and learn the temporal dynamics. These methods require the knowledge of a node in the full time span (including both training and testing) and are less applicable to the frequent change of the node set. In some extreme scenarios, the node sets at different time steps may completely differ. To resolve this challenge, we propose EvolveGCN, which adapts the graph convolutional network (GCN) model along the temporal dimension without resorting to node embeddings. The proposed approach captures the dynamism of the graph sequence through using an RNN to evolve the GCN parameters. Two architectures are considered for the parameter evolution. We evaluate the proposed approach on tasks including link prediction, edge classification, and node classification. The experimental results indicate a generally higher performance of EvolveGCN compared with related approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/IBM/EvolveGCN.",

Despite such efforts, it is well known that even state-of-the-art KGs suffer from incompleteness. Link Prediction (LP), the task of predicting missing facts among entities already a KG, is a promising and widely studied task aimed at addressing KG incompleteness. Among the recent LP techniques, those based on KG embeddings have achieved very promising performances in some benchmarks. Despite the fast growing literature in the subject, insufficient attention has been paid to the effect of the various design choices in those methods. Moreover, the standard practice in this area is to report accuracy by aggregating over a large number of test facts in which some entities are over-represented; this allows LP methods to exhibit good performance by just attending to structural properties that include such entities, while ignoring the remaining majority of the KG. This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of embedding-based LP methods, extending the dimensions of analysis beyond what is commonly available in the literature. We experimentally compare effectiveness and efficiency of 16 state-of-the-art methods, consider a rule-based baseline, and report detailed analysis over the most popular benchmarks in the literature.",

These methods have recently been applied to KG link prediction and question answering over incomplete KGs (KGQA). KGEs typically create an embedding for each entity in the graph, which results in large model sizes on real-world graphs with millions of entities. For downstream tasks these atomic entity representations often need to be integrated into a multi stage pipeline, limiting their utility. We show that an off-the-shelf encoder-decoder Transformer model can serve as a scalable and versatile KGE model obtaining state-of-the-art results for KG link prediction and incomplete KG question answering. We achieve this by posing KG link prediction as a sequence-to-sequence task and exchange the triple scoring approach taken by prior KGE methods with autoregressive decoding. Such a simple but powerful method reduces the model size up to 98% compared to conventional KGE models while keeping inference time tractable. After finetuning this model on the task of KGQA over incomplete KGs, our approach outperforms baselines on multiple large-scale datasets without extensive hyperparameter tuning.",

In this work, we investigate an alternative, from\u2013machine\u2013to\u2013corpus\u2013to\u2013machine: general language models author these commonsense knowledge graphs to train commonsense models. Our study leads to a new framework, Symbolic Knowledge Distillation. As with prior art in Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), our approach uses larger models to teach smaller models. A key difference is that we distill knowledge symbolically\u2013as text\u2013in addition to the neural model. We distill only one aspect\u2013the commonsense of a general language model teacher, allowing the student to be a different type, a commonsense model. Altogether, we show that careful prompt engineering and a separately trained critic model allow us to selectively distill high-quality causal commonsense from GPT-3, a general language model. Empirical results demonstrate that, for the first time, a human-authored commonsense knowledge graph is surpassed by our automatically distilled variant in all three criteria: quantity, quality, and diversity. In addition, it results in a neural commonsense model that surpasses the teacher model\u2019s commonsense capabilities despite its 100x smaller size. We apply this to the ATOMIC resource, and will share our new symbolic knowledge graph and commonsense models.",

Here we introduce a powerful new approach for learning generative models over graphs, which can capture both their structure and attributes. Our approach uses graph neural networks to express probabilistic dependencies among a graph's nodes and edges, and can, in principle, learn distributions over any arbitrary graph. In a series of experiments our results show that once trained, our models can generate good quality samples of both synthetic graphs as well as real molecular graphs, both unconditionally and conditioned on data. Compared to baselines that do not use graph-structured representations, our models often perform far better. We also explore key challenges of learning generative models of graphs, such as how to handle symmetries and ordering of elements during the graph generation process, and offer possible solutions. Our work is the first and most general approach for learning generative models over arbitrary graphs, and opens new directions for moving away from restrictions of vector- and sequence-like knowledge representations, toward more expressive and flexible relational data structures.",

In this survey, we review the recent advances in representation learning for dynamic graphs, including dynamic knowledge graphs. We describe existing models from an encoder-decoder perspective, categorize these encoders and decoders based on the techniques they employ, and analyze the approaches in each category.

The success of such a task heavily relies on the ability of modeling and inferring the patterns of (or between) the relations. In this paper, we present a new approach for knowledge graph embedding called RotatE, which is able to model and infer various relation patterns including: symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. Specifically, the RotatE model defines each relation as a rotation from the source entity to the target entity in the complex vector space. In addition, we propose a novel self-adversarial negative sampling technique for efficiently and effectively training the RotatE model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that the proposed RotatE model is not only scalable, but also able to infer and model various relation patterns and significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction.",

            "abstract": "The design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems often requires significant specialized knowledge and trial-and-error. Can we automate this challenging, tedious process, and learn the algorithms instead? In many real-world applications, it is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and again on a regular basis, maintaining the same problem structure but differing in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms that exploit the structure of such recurring problems. In this paper, we propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Link prediction for knowledge graphs is the task of predicting missing relationships between entities. Previous work on link prediction has focused on shallow, fast models which can scale to large knowledge graphs. However, these models learn less expressive features than deep, multi-layer models \u2014 which potentially limits performance. In this work we introduce ConvE, a multi-layer convolutional network model for link prediction, and report state-of-the-art results for several established datasets. We also show that the model is highly parameter efficient, yielding the same performance as DistMult and R-GCN with 8x and 17x fewer parameters. Analysis of our model suggests that it is particularly effective at modelling nodes with high indegree \u2014 which are common in highly-connected, complex knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO3. In addition, it has been noted that the WN18 and FB15k datasets suffer from test set leakage, due to inverse relations from the training set being present in the test set \u2014 however, the extent of this issue has so far not been quantified. We find this problem to be severe: a simple rule-based model can achieve state-of-the-art results on both WN18 and FB15k. To ensure that models are evaluated on datasets where simply exploiting inverse relations cannot yield competitive results, we investigate and validate several commonly used datasets \u2014 deriving robust variants where necessary. We then perform experiments on these robust datasets for our own and several previously proposed models, and find that ConvE achieves state-of-the-art Mean Reciprocal Rank across all datasets.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Designing accurate deep learning models for molecular property prediction plays an increasingly essential role in drug and material discovery. Recently, due to the scarcity of labeled molecules, self-supervised learning methods for learning generalizable and transferable representations of molecular graphs have attracted lots of attention. In this paper, we argue that there exist two major issues hindering current self-supervised learning methods from obtaining desired performance on molecular property prediction, that is, the ill-defined pre-training tasks and the limited model capacity. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KPGT), a novel self-supervised learning framework for molecular graph representation learning, to alleviate the aforementioned issues and improve the performance on the downstream molecular property prediction tasks. More specifically, we first introduce a high-capacity model, named Line Graph Transformer (LiGhT), which emphasizes the importance of chemical bonds and is mainly designed to model the structural information of molecular graphs. Then, a knowledge-guided pre-training strategy is proposed to exploit the additional knowledge of molecules to guide the model to capture the abundant structural and semantic information from large-scale unlabeled molecular graphs. Extensive computational tests demonstrated that KPGT can offer superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods on several molecular property prediction tasks.",

            "abstract": "Incorporating Knowledge Graphs (KG) into recommeder system as side information has attracted considerable attention. Recently, the technical trend of Knowledge-aware Recommendation (KGR) is to develop end-to-end models based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the extremely sparse user-item interactions significantly degrade the performance of the GNN-based models, from the following aspects: 1) the sparse interaction, itself, means inadequate supervision signals and limits the supervised GNN-based models; 2) the combination of sparse interactions (CF part) and redundant KG facts (KG part) further results in an unbalanced information utilization. Besides, the GNN paradigm aggregates local neighbors for node representation learning, while ignoring the non-local KG facts and making the knowledge extraction insufficient. Inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in mining supervised signals from data itself, in this paper, we focus on exploring contrastive learning in KGR and propose a novel multi-level interactive contrastive learning mechanism, to alleviate the aforementioned challenges. Different from traditional contrastive learning methods which contrast nodes of two generated graph views, interactive contrastive mechanism conducts layer-wise self-supervised learning by contrasting layers of different parts within graphs, which is also an \"interaction\" action. Specifically, we first construct local and non-local graphs for user/item in KG, exploring more KG facts for KGR. Then an intra-graph level interactive contrastive learning is performed within each local/non-local graph, which contrasts layers of the CF and KG parts, for more consistent information leveraging. Besides, an inter-graph level interactive contrastive learning is performed between the local and non-local graphs, for sufficiently and coherently extracting non-local KG signals. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.

This creates the need to build a more complete knowledge graph for enhancing the practical utilization of KGs. Link prediction is a fundamental task in knowledge graph completion that utilizes existing relations to infer new relations so as to build a more complete knowledge graph. Numerous methods have been proposed to perform the link-prediction task based on various representation techniques. Among them, KG-embedding models have significantly advanced the state of the art in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on KG-embedding models for link prediction in knowledge graphs. We first provide a theoretical analysis and comparison of existing methods proposed to date for generating KG embedding. Then, we investigate several representative models that are classified into five categories. Finally, we conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets to report comprehensive findings and provide some new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing models.",

This evolution has led to large graph-based neural network models that go beyond what existing deep learning frameworks or graph computing systems are designed for. We present NeuGraph, a new framework that bridges the graph and dataflow models to support efficient and scalable parallel neural network computation on graphs. NeuGraph introduces graph computation optimizations into the management of data partitioning, scheduling, and parallelism in dataflow-based deep learning frameworks. Our evaluation shows that, on small graphs that can fit in a single GPU, NeuGraph outperforms state-of-the-art implementations by a significant margin, while scaling to large real-world graphs that none of the existing frameworks can handle directly with GPUs.

Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on matching the target molecule with a large set of reaction templates, which are very computationally expensive and also suffer from the problem of coverage. In this paper, we propose a novel template-free approach called G2Gs by transforming a target molecular graph into a set of reactant molecular graphs. G2Gs first splits the target molecular graph into a set of synthons by identifying the reaction centers, and then translates the synthons to the final reactant graphs via a variational graph translation framework. Experimental results show that G2Gs significantly outperforms existing template-free approaches by up to 63% in terms of the top-1 accuracy and achieves a performance close to that of state-of-the-art template based approaches, but does not require domain knowledge and is much more scalable.",

Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.",

TuckER outperforms previous state-of-the-art models across standard link prediction datasets, acting as a strong baseline for more elaborate models. We show that TuckER is a fully expressive model, derive sufficient bounds on its embedding dimensionalities and demonstrate that several previously introduced linear models can be viewed as special cases of TuckER.",

When reading a domain text, experts make inferences with relevant knowledge. For machines to achieve this capability, we propose a knowledge-enabled language representation model (K-BERT) with knowledge graphs (KGs), in which triples are injected into the sentences as domain knowledge. However, too much knowledge incorporation may divert the sentence from its correct meaning, which is called knowledge noise (KN) issue. To overcome KN, K-BERT introduces soft-position and visible matrix to limit the impact of knowledge. K-BERT can easily inject domain knowledge into the models by being equipped with a KG without pre-training by itself because it is capable of loading model parameters from the pre-trained BERT. Our investigation reveals promising results in twelve NLP tasks. Especially in domain-specific tasks (including finance, law, and medicine), K-BERT significantly outperforms BERT, which demonstrates that K-BERT is an excellent choice for solving the knowledge-driven problems that require experts.",

Although several efforts have been made for CRS, two major issues still remain to be solved. First, the conversation data itself lacks of sufficient contextual information for accurately understanding users' preference. Second, there is a semantic gap between natural language expression and item-level user preference. To address these issues, we incorporate both word-oriented and entity-oriented knowledge graphs~(KG) to enhance the data representations in CRSs, and adopt Mutual Information Maximization to align the word-level and entity-level semantic spaces. Based on the aligned semantic representations, we further develop a KG-enhanced recommender component for making accurate recommendations, and a KG-enhanced dialog component that can generate informative keywords or entities in the response text. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in yielding better performance on both recommendation and conversation tasks.",

In contrast, knowledge embedding (KE) methods can effectively represent the relational facts in knowledge graphs (KGs) with informative entity embeddings, but conventional KE models cannot take full advantage of the abundant textual information. In this paper, we propose a unified model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre-trained LanguagERepresentation (KEPLER), which can not only better integrate factual knowledge into PLMs but also produce effective text-enhanced KE with the strong PLMs. In KEPLER, we encode textual entity descriptions with a PLM as their embeddings, and then jointly optimize the KE and language modeling objectives. Experimental results show that KEPLER achieves state-of-the-art performances on various NLP tasks, and also works remarkably well as an inductive KE model on KG link prediction. Furthermore, for pre-training and evaluating KEPLER, we construct Wikidata5M1 , a large-scale KG dataset with aligned entity descriptions, and benchmark state-of-the-art KE methods on it. It shall serve as a new KE benchmark and facilitate the research on large KG, inductive KE, and KG with text. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/THU-KEG/KEPLER.",

ERNIE-ViL tries to build the detailed semantic connections (objects, attributes of objects and relationships between objects) across vision and language, which are essential to vision-language cross-modal tasks. Utilizing scene graphs of visual scenes, ERNIE-ViL constructs Scene Graph Prediction tasks, i.e., Object Prediction, Attribute Prediction and Relationship Prediction tasks in the pre-training phase. Specifically, these prediction tasks are implemented by predicting nodes of different types in the scene graph parsed from the sentence. Thus, ERNIE-ViL can learn the joint representations characterizing the alignments of the detailed semantics across vision and language. After pre-training on large scale image-text aligned datasets, we validate the effectiveness of ERNIE-ViL on 5 cross-modal downstream tasks. ERNIE-ViL achieves state-of-the-art performances on all these tasks and ranks the first place on the VCR leaderboard with an absolute improvement of 3.7%.",

            "abstract": "Recently, a considerable literature has grown up around the theme of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). How to effectively leverage the rich structural information in complex graphs, such as knowledge graphs with heterogeneous types of entities and relations, is a primary open challenge in the field. Most GCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges (e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes only instead of jointly propagating and updating the embeddings of both nodes and edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework, namely the Knowledge Embedding based Graph Convolutional Network (KE-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based belief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge embedding (a.k.a. knowledge graph embedding) methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis shows that KE-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN methods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the advantageous performance of KE-GCN over strong baseline methods in the tasks of knowledge graph alignment and entity classification1.",

In this work, we propose to use pre-trained language models for knowledge graph completion. We treat triples in knowledge graphs as textual sequences and propose a novel framework named Knowledge Graph Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (KG-BERT) to model these triples. Our method takes entity and relation descriptions of a triple as input and computes scoring function of the triple with the KG-BERT language model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in triple classification, link prediction and relation prediction tasks.",

As such knowledge graphs represent an attractive source of information that could help improve recommender systems. However, existing approaches in this domain rely on manual feature engineering and do not allow for an end-to-end training. Here we propose Knowledge-aware Graph Neural Networks with Label Smoothness regularization (KGNN-LS) to provide better recommendations. Conceptually, our approach computes user-specific item embeddings by first applying a trainable function that identifies important knowledge graph relationships for a given user. This way we transform the knowledge graph into a user-specific weighted graph and then apply a graph neural network to compute personalized item embeddings. To provide better inductive bias, we rely on label smoothness assumption, which posits that adjacent items in the knowledge graph are likely to have similar user relevance labels/scores. Label smoothness provides regularization over the edge weights and we prove that it is equivalent to a label propagation scheme on a graph. We also develop an efficient implementation that shows strong scalability with respect to the knowledge graph size. Experiments on four datasets show that our method outperforms state of the art baselines. KGNN-LS also achieves strong performance in cold-start scenarios where user-item interactions are sparse.",

In general, this is a difficult task due to data non-stationarity, data heterogeneity, and its complex temporal dependencies. \nWe propose Chronological Rotation embedding (ChronoR), a novel model for learning representations for entities, relations, and time. Learning dense representations is frequently used as an efficient and versatile method to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs. The proposed model learns a k-dimensional rotation transformation parametrized by relation and time, such that after each fact's head entity is transformed using the rotation, it falls near its corresponding tail entity. By using high dimensional rotation as its transformation operator, ChronoR captures rich interaction between the temporal and multi-relational characteristics of a Temporal Knowledge Graph. Experimentally, we show that ChronoR is able to outperform many of the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets for temporal knowledge graph link prediction.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have gradually become valuable assets for many AI applications. In a KG, a node denotes an entity, and an edge (or link) denotes a relationship between the entities represented by the nodes. Knowledge graph completion infers and predicts missing edges in a KG automatically. Knowledge graph embeddings have shed light on addressing this task. Recent research embeds KGs in hyperbolic (negatively curved) space instead of conventional Euclidean (zero curved) space and is effective in capturing hierarchical structures. However, as multi-relational graphs, KGs are not structured uniformly and display intrinsic heterogeneous structures. They usually contain rich types of structures, such as hierarchical and cyclic typed structures. Embedding KGs in single-curvature space, such as Euclidean or hyperbolic space, overlooks the intrinsic heterogeneous structures of KGs, and therefore cannot accurately capture their structures. To address this issue, we propose Mixed-Curvature Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network (M2GNN), a generic approach that embeds multi-relational KGs in a mixed-curvature space for knowledge graph completion. Specifically, we define and construct a mixed-curvature space through a product manifold combining multiple single-curvature spaces (e.g., spherical, hyperbolic, or Euclidean) with the purpose of modeling a variety of structures. However, constructing a mixed-curvature space typically requires manually defining the fixed curvatures, which needs domain knowledge and additional data analysis. Improperly defined curvature space also cannot capture the structures of KGs accurately. To address this problem, we set mixed-curvatures as trainable parameters to better capture the underlying structures of the KGs. Furthermore, we propose a Graph Neural Updater by leveraging the heterogeneous relational context in mixed-curvature space to improve the quality of the embedding. Experiments on three KG datasets demonstrate that the proposed M2GNN can outperform its single geometry counterpart as well as state-of-the-art embedding methods on the KG completion task.",

In this paper, we propose a textual inference framework for answering commonsense questions, which effectively utilizes external, structured commonsense knowledge graphs to perform explainable inferences. The framework first grounds a question-answer pair from the semantic space to the knowledge-based symbolic space as a schema graph, a related sub-graph of external knowledge graphs. It represents schema graphs with a novel knowledge-aware graph network module named KagNet, and finally scores answers with graph representations. Our model is based on graph convolutional networks and LSTMs, with a hierarchical path-based attention mechanism. The intermediate attention scores make it transparent and interpretable, which thus produce trustworthy inferences.

In this paper, we consider knowledge graphs as the source of side information. We propose MKR, a Multi-task feature learning approach for Knowledge graph enhanced Recommendation. MKR is a deep end-to-end framework that utilizes knowledge graph embedding task to assist recommendation task. The two tasks are associated by crosscompress units, which automatically share latent features and learn high-order interactions between items in recommender systems and entities in the knowledge graph. We prove that crosscompress units have sufficient capability of polynomial approximation, and show that MKR is a generalized framework over several representative methods of recommender systems and multi-task learning. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MKR achieves substantial gains in movie, book, music, and news recommendation, over state-of-the-art baselines. MKR is also shown to be able to maintain satisfactory performance even if user-item interactions are sparse.",

Unlike most existing approaches that only focus on leveraging knowledge graphs for more accurate recommendation, we aim to conduct explicit reasoning with knowledge for decision making so that the recommendations are generated and supported by an interpretable causal inference procedure. To this end, we propose a method called Policy-Guided Path Reasoning (PGPR), which couples recommendation and interpretability by providing actual paths in a knowledge graph. Our contributions include four aspects. We first highlight the significance of incorporating knowledge graphs into recommendation to formally define and interpret the reasoning process. Second, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach featured by an innovative soft reward strategy, user-conditional action pruning and a multi-hop scoring function. Third, we design a policy-guided graph search algorithm to efficiently and effectively sample reasoning paths for recommendation. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method on several large-scale real-world benchmark datasets, obtaining favorable results compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

The communications between nodes are described by a time-varying sequence of directed graphs, which is uniformly strongly connected. For such communications, assuming that every node knows its out-degree, we develop a broadcast-based algorithm, termed the subgradient-push, which steers every node to an optimal value under a standard assumption of subgradient boundedness. The subgradient-push requires no knowledge of either the number of agents or the graph sequence to implement. Our analysis shows that the subgradient-push algorithm converges at a rate of O (ln t/\u221at), where the constant depends on the initial values at the nodes, the subgradient norms, and, more interestingly, on both the consensus speed and the imbalances of influence among the nodes.",

Previous work such as TransE, TransH and TransR/CTransR regard a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity and the CTransR achieves state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose a more fine-grained model named TransD, which is an improvement of TransR/CTransR. In TransD, we use two vectors to represent a named symbol object (entity and relation). The first one represents the meaning of a(n) entity (relation), the other one is used to construct mapping matrix dynamically. Compared with TransR/CTransR, TransD not only considers the diversity of relations, but also entities. TransD has less parameters and has no matrix-vector multiplication operations, which makes it can be applied on large scale graphs. In Experiments, we evaluate our model on two typical tasks including triplets classification and link prediction. Evaluation results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Compared to static knowledge graphs, temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) inherently reflect the transient nature of real-world knowledge. Naturally, automatic TKG completion has drawn much research interests for a more realistic modeling of relational reasoning. However, most of the existing models for TKG completion extend static KG embeddings that do not fully exploit TKG structure, thus lacking in 1) accounting for temporally relevant events already residing in the local neighborhood of a query, and 2) path-based inference that facilitates multi-hop reasoning and better interpretability. In this paper, we propose T-GAP, a novel model for TKG completion that maximally utilizes both temporal information and graph structure in its encoder and decoder. T-GAP encodes query-specific substructure of TKG by focusing on the temporal displacement between each event and the query timestamp, and performs path-based inference by propagating attention through the graph. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that T-GAP not only achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art baselines, but also competently generalizes to queries with unseen timestamps. Through extensive qualitative analyses, we also show that T-GAP enjoys transparent interpretability, and follows human intuition in its reasoning process.",

However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

However, like any other deep architectures, GNNs are data hungry. While requiring labels in real world is often expensive, pretraining GNNs in an unsupervised manner has been actively explored. Among them, graph contrastive learning, by maximizing the mutual information between paired graph augmentations, has been shown to be effective on various downstream tasks. However, the current graph contrastive learning framework has two limitations. First, the augmentations are designed for general graphs and thus may not be suitable or powerful enough for certain domains. Second, the contrastive scheme only learns representations that are invariant to local perturbations and thus does not consider the global structure of the dataset, which may also be useful for downstream tasks. In this paper, we study graph contrastive learning designed specifically for the biomedical domain, where molecular graphs are present. We propose a novel framework called MoCL, which utilizes domain knowledge at both local- and global-level to assist representation learning. The local-level domain knowledge guides the augmentation process such that variation is introduced without changing graph semantics. The global-level knowledge encodes the similarity information between graphs in the entire dataset and helps to learn representations with richer semantics. The entire model is learned through a double contrast objective. We evaluate MoCL on various molecular datasets under both linear and semi-supervised settings and results show that MoCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) is an extension of this task to temporal knowledge graphs, where each fact is additionally associated with a time stamp. Current approaches for TKGC primarily build on existing embedding models which are developed for static knowledge graph completion, and extend these models to incorporate time, where the idea is to learn latent representations for entities, relations, and timestamps and then use the learned representations to predict missing facts at various time steps. In this paper, we propose BoxTE, a box embedding model for TKGC, building on the static knowledge graph embedding model BoxE. We show that BoxTE is fully expressive, and possesses strong inductive capacity in the temporal setting. We then empirically evaluate our model and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on several TKGC benchmarks",

However, many knowledge graphs involve evolving data, e.g., the fact (The President of the United States is Barack Obama) is valid only from 2009 to 2017. This introduces important challenges for knowledge representation learning since the knowledge graphs change over time. In this paper, we present a novel time-aware knowledge graph embebdding approach, TeLM, which performs 4th-order tensor factorization of a Temporal knowledge graph using a Linear temporal regularizer and Multivector embeddings. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the temporal dataset\u2019s time granularity on temporal knowledge graph completion. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed models trained with the linear temporal regularizer achieve the state-of-the-art performances on link prediction over four well-established temporal knowledge graph completion benchmarks.",

By using motion planning approaches, a novel class of distributed consensus protocols are developed. With a prespecified settling time, the proposed protocols solve the consensus problem of linear multiagent systems over directed graphs containing a directed spanning tree. In particular, the settling time can be offline prespecified, according to task requirements. Compared with the existing results for multiagent systems, to our best knowledge, this is the first time specified-time consensus problems are raised and solved for general linear multiagent systems over directed graphs. Extensions to the specified-time formation flying are further studied for multiple satellites described by Hill equations.",

However, the data they are applied to usually evolves with time, such as friend graphs in social networks or user interactions with items in recommender systems. This is also the case for knowledge bases, which contain facts such as (US, has president, B. Obama, [2009-2017]) that are valid only at certain points in time. For the problem of link prediction under temporal constraints, i.e., answering queries of the form (US, has president, ?, 2012), we propose a solution inspired by the canonical decomposition of tensors of order 4. We introduce new regularization schemes and present an extension of ComplEx that achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we propose a new dataset for knowledge base completion constructed from Wikidata, larger than previous benchmarks by an order of magnitude, as a new reference for evaluating temporal and non-temporal link prediction methods.",

Those graphs are often constructed from semi-structured knowledge, such as Wikipedia, or harvested from the web with a combination of statistical and linguistic methods. The result are large-scale knowledge graphs that try to make a good trade-off between completeness and correctness. In order to further increase the utility of such knowledge graphs, various refinement methods have been proposed, which try to infer and add missing knowledge to the graph, or identify erroneous pieces of information. In this article, we provide a survey of such knowledge graph refinement approaches, with a dual look at both the methods being proposed as well as the evaluation methodologies used.",

In this paper, we present a novel open-domain conversation generation model to demonstrate how large-scale commonsense knowledge can facilitate language understanding and generation. Given a user post, the model retrieves relevant knowledge graphs from a knowledge base and then encodes the graphs with a static graph attention mechanism, which augments the semantic information of the post and thus supports better understanding of the post. Then, during word generation, the model attentively reads the retrieved knowledge graphs and the knowledge triples within each graph to facilitate better generation through a dynamic graph attention mechanism. This is the first attempt that uses large-scale commonsense knowledge in conversation generation. Furthermore, unlike existing models that use knowledge triples (entities) separately and independently, our model treats each knowledge graph as a whole, which encodes more structured, connected semantic information in the graphs.\u00a0Experiments show that the proposed model can generate more appropriate and informative responses than state-of-the-art baselines.\u00a0",

It performs multi-hop, multi-relational reasoning over subgraphs extracted from external knowledge graphs. The proposed reasoning module unifies path-based reasoning methods and graph neural networks to achieve better interpretability and scalability. We also empirically show its effectiveness and scalability on CommonsenseQA and OpenbookQA datasets, and interpret its behaviors with case studies.",

Cross-lingual KG alignment is the task of matching entities with their counterparts in different languages, which is an important way to enrich the cross-lingual links in multilingual KGs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cross-lingual KG alignment via graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Given a set of pre-aligned entities, our approach trains GCNs to embed entities of each language into a unified vector space. Entity alignments are discovered based on the distances between entities in the embedding space. Embeddings can be learned from both the structural and attribute information of entities, and the results of structure embedding and attribute embedding are combined to get accurate alignments. In the experiments on aligning real multilingual KGs, our approach gets the best performance compared with other embedding-based KG alignment approaches.",

Although recently have witnessed a surge of work on KGC, they are still insufficient to accurately capture complex relations, since they adopt the single and static representations. In this work, we propose a novel Disentangled Knowledge Graph Attention Network (DisenKGAT) for KGC, which leverages both micro-disentanglement and macro-disentanglement to exploit representations behind Knowledge graphs (KGs). To achieve micro-disentanglement, we put forward a novel relation-aware aggregation to learn diverse component representation. For macro-disentanglement, we leverage mutual information as a regularization to enhance independence. With the assistance of disentanglement, our model is able to generate adaptive representations in terms of the given scenario. Besides, our work has strong robustness and flexibility to adapt to various score functions. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets have been conducted to validate the superiority of DisenKGAT over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and explainability.",

Existing approaches have achieved promising results, however, they are still challenged by the lack of enough prior alignment as labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a bootstrapping approach to embedding-based entity alignment. It iteratively labels likely entity alignment as training data for learning alignment-oriented KG embeddings. Furthermore, it employs an alignment editing method to reduce error accumulation during iterations. Our experiments on real-world datasets showed that the proposed approach significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art embedding-based ones for entity alignment. The proposed alignment-oriented KG embedding, bootstrapping process and alignment editing method all contributed to the performance improvement.",

In contrast to prior work, our approach includes a reward function that takes the accuracy, diversity, and efficiency into consideration.

Despite much research conducted in related fields, the challenges of linkinglarge-scale heterogeneous entity graphs are far from resolved. Employing two billion-scale academic entity graphs (Microsoft Academic Graph and AMiner) as sources for our study, we propose a unified framework --- LinKG --- to address the problem of building a large-scale linked entity graph. LinKG is coupled with three linking modules, each of which addresses one category of entities. To link word-sequence-based entities (e.g., venues), we present a long short-term memory network-based method for capturing the dependencies. To link large-scale entities (e.g., papers), we leverage locality-sensitive hashing and convolutional neural networks for scalable and precise linking. To link entities with ambiguity (e.g., authors), we propose heterogeneous graph attention networks to model different types of entities. Our extensive experiments and systematical analysis demonstrate that LinKG can achieve linking accuracy with an F1-score of 0.9510, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art. LinKG has been deployed to Microsoft Academic Search and AMiner to integrate the two large graphs. We have published the linked results---the Open Academic Graph (OAG)\\footnote\\urlhttps://www.openacademic.ai/oag/ , making it the largest publicly available heterogeneous academic graph to date.",

            "abstract": "Reasoning on the knowledge graph (KG) aims to infer new facts from existing ones. Methods based on the relational path have shown strong, interpretable, and transferable reasoning ability. However, paths are naturally limited in capturing local evidence in graphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel relational structure, i.e., relational directed graph (r-digraph), which is composed of overlapped relational paths, to capture the KG\u2019s local evidence. Since the r-digraphs are more complex than paths, how to efficiently construct and effectively learn from them are challenging. Directly encoding the r-digraphs cannot scale well and capturing query-dependent information is hard in r-digraphs. We propose a variant of graph neural network, i.e., RED-GNN, to address the above challenges. Specifically, RED-GNN makes use of dynamic programming to recursively encodes multiple r-digraphs with shared edges, and utilizes query-dependent attention mechanism to select the strongly correlated edges. We demonstrate that RED-GNN is not only efficient but also can achieve significant performance gains in both inductive and transductive reasoning tasks over existing methods. Besides, the learned attention weights in RED-GNN can exhibit interpretable evidence for KG reasoning. 1",

Existing knowledge graph embedding models mainly focus on modeling relation patterns such as symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. However, many existing approaches fail to model semantic hierarchies, which are common in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding model\u2014namely, Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Graph Embedding (HAKE)\u2014which maps entities into the polar coordinate system. HAKE is inspired by the fact that concentric circles in the polar coordinate system can naturally reflect the hierarchy. Specifically, the radial coordinate aims to model entities at different levels of the hierarchy, and entities with smaller radii are expected to be at higher levels; the angular coordinate aims to distinguish entities at the same level of the hierarchy, and these entities are expected to have roughly the same radii but different angles. Experiments demonstrate that HAKE can effectively model the semantic hierarchies in knowledge graphs, and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for the link prediction task.",

            "abstract": "Entity alignment to find equivalent entities in cross-lingual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) plays a vital role in automatically integrating multiple KGs. Existing translation-based entity alignment methods jointly model the cross-lingual knowledge and monolingual knowledge into one unified optimization problem. On the other hand, the Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods either ignore the node differentiations, or represent relation through entity or triple instances. They all fail to model the meta semantics embedded in relation nor complex relations such as n-to-n and multi-graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Meta Relation Aware Entity Alignment (MRAEA) to directly model cross-lingual entity embeddings by attending over the node's incoming and outgoing neighbors and its connected relations' meta semantics. In addition, we also propose a simple and effective bi-directional iterative strategy to add new aligned seeds during training. Our experiments on all three benchmark entity alignment datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, exceeding by 15%-58% on Hit@1. Through an extensive ablation study, we validate that the proposed meta relation aware representations, relation aware self-attention and bi-directional iterative strategy of new seed selection all make contributions to significant performance improvement.

To improve recommendation performance, usage, and scalability, the research has evolved by producing several generations of recommender systems. There is much literature about it, although most proposals focus on traditional methods\u2019 theories and applications. Recently, knowledge graph-based recommendations have attracted attention in academia and the industry because they can alleviate information sparsity and performance problems. We found only two studies that analyze the recommendation system\u2019s role over graphs, but they focus on specific recommendation methods. This survey attempts to cover a broader analysis from a set of selected papers. In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) we explore traditional and more recent developments of filtering methods for a recommender system, (2) we identify and analyze proposals related to knowledge graph-based recommender systems, (3) we present the most relevant contributions using an application domain, and (4) we outline future directions of research in the domain of recommender systems. As the main survey result, we found that the use of knowledge graphs for recommendations is an efficient way to leverage and connect a user\u2019s and an item\u2019s knowledge, thus providing more precise results for users.",

XNMs allow us to pay more attention to teach machines how to ``think'', regardless of what they ``look''. As we will show in the paper, by using scene graphs as an inductive bias, 1) we can design XNMs in a concise and flexible fashion, i.e., XNMs merely consist of 4 meta-types, which significantly reduce the number of parameters by 10 to 100 times, and 2) we can explicitly trace the reasoning-flow in terms of graph attentions. XNMs are so generic that they support a wide range of scene graph implementations with various qualities. For example, when the graphs are detected perfectly, XNMs achieve 100% accuracy on both CLEVR and CLEVR CoGenT, establishing an empirical performance upper-bound for visual reasoning; when the graphs are noisily detected from real-world images, XNMs are still robust to achieve a competitive 67.5% accuracy on VQAv2.0, surpassing the popular bag-of-objects attention models without graph structures.",

            "abstract": "News recommendation systems play a key role in online news reading service. Knowledge graphs (KG), which contain comprehensive structural knowledge, are well known for their potential to enhance both accuracy and explainability. While existing works intensively study using KG to improve news recommendation accuracy, using KG for news recommendation reasoning has not been fully explored. A few works such as KPRN [18], [22] and ADAC [25] have discussed knowledge reasoning in some other recommendation domains such as music or movie, but their methods are not practical for the news. How to make reasoning scalable to generic KGs, easy to deploy for real-time serving and meanwhile elastic for both recall and ranking stages remains an open question. In this paper, we fill the research gap by proposing a novel recommendation reasoning paradigm AnchorKG. For each article, AnchorKG generates a compact Anchor Knowledge G raph, which corresponds to a subset of entities and their k-hop neighbors in the KG, restoring the most important knowledge information of the article. On one hand, the anchor graph can be used to enhance the latent representation of the article. On the other hand, the interaction between two anchor graphs can be used for reasoning. We develop a reinforcement learning-based framework to train the anchor graph generator, in which there are three major components, including the joint learning of recommendation and reasoning, sophisticated reward signals, and a warm-up learning stage. We conduct experiments on one public dataset and one private dataset. Results demonstrate that the AnchorKG framework not only improves recommendation accuracy, but also provides high quality knowledge-aware reasoning.

However, the ever growing size of knowledge graphs requires computationally efficient algorithms capable of scaling to graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges. This paper presents DGL-KE, an open-source package to efficiently compute knowledge graph embeddings. DGL-KE introduces various novel optimizations that accelerate training on knowledge graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges using multi-processing, multi-GPU, and distributed parallelism. These optimizations are designed to increase data locality, reduce communication overhead, overlap computations with memory accesses, and achieve high operation efficiency. Experiments on knowledge graphs consisting of over 86M nodes and 338M edges show that DGL-KE can compute embeddings in 100 minutes on an EC2 instance with 8 GPUs and 30 minutes on an EC2 cluster with 4 machines with 48 cores/machine. These results represent a 2\u00d7 ~ 5\u00d7 speedup over the best competing approaches. DGL-KE is available on https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-ke.",

KG embedding approaches have proved effective for KG completion, however, they have been developed mostly for static KGs. Developing temporal KG embedding models is an increasingly important problem. In this paper, we build novel models for temporal KG completion through equipping static models with a diachronic entity embedding function which provides the characteristics of entities at any point in time. This is in contrast to the existing temporal KG embedding approaches where only static entity features are provided. The proposed embedding function is model-agnostic and can be potentially combined with any static model. We prove that combining it with SimplE, a recent model for static KG embedding, results in a fully expressive model for temporal KG completion. Our experiments indicate the superiority of our proposal compared to existing baselines.",

Such embedding methods simplify the operations of conducting various in-KG tasks (e.g., link prediction) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., question answering). They can be viewed as general solutions for representing KGs. However, existing KGE methods are not applicable to inductive settings, where a model trained on source KGs will be tested on target KGs with entities unseen during model training. Existing works focusing on KGs in inductive settings can only solve the inductive relation prediction task. They can not handle other out-of-KG tasks as general as KGE methods since they don't produce embeddings for entities. In this paper, to achieve inductive knowledge graph embedding, we propose a model MorsE, which does not learn embeddings for entities but learns transferable meta-knowledge that can be used to produce entity embeddings. Such meta-knowledge is modeled by entity-independent modules and learned by meta-learning. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms corresponding baselines for in-KG and out-of-KG tasks in inductive settings.",

Despite such efforts, it is well known that even the largest KGs suffer from incompleteness; Link Prediction (LP) techniques address this issue by identifying missing facts among entities already in the KG. Among the recent LP techniques, those based on KG embeddings have achieved very promising performance in some benchmarks. Despite the fast-growing literature on the subject, insufficient attention has been paid to the effect of the design choices in those methods. Moreover, the standard practice in this area is to report accuracy by aggregating over a large number of test facts in which some entities are vastly more represented than others; this allows LP methods to exhibit good results by just attending to structural properties that include such entities, while ignoring the remaining majority of the KG. This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of embedding-based LP methods, extending the dimensions of analysis beyond what is commonly available in the literature. We experimentally compare the effectiveness and efficiency of 18 state-of-the-art methods, consider a rule-based baseline, and report detailed analysis over the most popular benchmarks in the literature.",

However, in real knowledge graphs (KGs), the counterpart entities usually have non-isomorphic neighborhood structures, which easily causes GNNs to yield different representations for them. To tackle this problem, we propose a new KG alignment network, namely AliNet, aiming at mitigating the non-isomorphism of neighborhood structures in an end-to-end manner. As the direct neighbors of counterpart entities are usually dissimilar due to the schema heterogeneity, AliNet introduces distant neighbors to expand the overlap between their neighborhood structures. It employs an attention mechanism to highlight helpful distant neighbors and reduce noises. Then, it controls the aggregation of both direct and distant neighborhood information using a gating mechanism. We further propose a relation loss to refine entity representations. We perform thorough experiments with detailed ablation studies and analyses on five entity alignment datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of AliNet.",

            "abstract": "Human-curated knowledge graphs provide critical supportive information to various natural language processing tasks, but these graphs are usually incomplete, urging auto-completion of them (a.k.a. knowledge graph completion). Prevalent graph embedding approaches, e.g., TransE, learn structured knowledge via representing graph elements (i.e., entities/relations) into dense embeddings and capturing their triple-level relationship with spatial distance. However, they are hardly generalizable to the elements never visited in training and are intrinsically vulnerable to graph incompleteness. In contrast, textual encoding approaches, e.g., KG-BERT, resort to graph triple\u2019s text and triple-level contextualized representations. They are generalizable enough and robust to the incompleteness, especially when coupled with pre-trained encoders. But two major drawbacks limit the performance: (1) high overheads due to the costly scoring of all possible triples in inference, and (2) a lack of structured knowledge in the textual encoder. In this paper, we follow the textual encoding paradigm and aim to alleviate its drawbacks by augmenting it with graph embedding techniques \u2013 a complementary hybrid of both paradigms. Specifically, we partition each triple into two asymmetric parts as in translation-based graph embedding approach, and encode both parts into contextualized representations by a Siamese-style textual encoder. Built upon the representations, our model employs both deterministic classifier and spatial measurement for representation and structure learning respectively. It thus reduces the overheads by reusing graph elements\u2019 embeddings to avoid combinatorial explosion, and enhances structured knowledge by exploring the spatial characteristics. Moreover, we develop a self-adaptive ensemble scheme to further improve the performance by incorporating triple scores from an existing graph embedding model. In experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks and a zero-shot dataset for link prediction, with highlights of inference costs reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to a sophisticated textual encoding method.",

Despite their large sizes, modern KGs are far from complete and comprehensive. This has motivated the research in knowledge graph completion (KGC), which aims to infer missing values in incomplete knowledge triples. However, most existing KGC models treat the triples in KGs independently without leveraging the inherent and valuable information from the local neighborhood surrounding an entity. To this end, we propose a Relational Graph neural network with Hierarchical ATtention (RGHAT) for the KGC task. The proposed model is equipped with a two-level attention mechanism: (i) the first level is the relation-level attention, which is inspired by the intuition that different relations have different weights for indicating an entity; (ii) the second level is the entity-level attention, which enables our model to highlight the importance of different neighboring entities under the same relation. The hierarchical attention mechanism makes our model more effective to utilize the neighborhood information of an entity. Finally, we extensively validate the superiority of RGHAT against various state-of-the-art baselines.",

In this paper, we propose to our best knowledge the first dedicated approach to distilling knowledge from a pre-trained GCN model. To enable the knowledge transfer from the teacher GCN to the student, we propose a local structure preserving module that explicitly accounts for the topological semantics of the teacher. In this module, the local structure information from both the teacher and the student are extracted as distributions, and hence minimizing the distance between these distributions enables topology-aware knowledge transfer from the teacher, yielding a compact yet high-performance student model. Moreover, the proposed approach is readily extendable to dynamic graph models, where the input graphs for the teacher and the student may differ. We evaluate the proposed method on two different datasets using GCN models of different architectures, and demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art knowledge distillation performance for GCN models.",

            "abstract": "Balanced graph partitioning in the streaming setting is a key problem to enable scalable and efficient computations on massive graph data such as web graphs, knowledge graphs, and graphs arising in the context of online social networks. Two families of heuristics for graph partitioning in the streaming setting are in wide use: place the newly arrived vertex in the cluster with the largest number of neighbors or in the cluster with the least number of non-neighbors. In this work, we introduce a framework which unifies the two seemingly orthogonal heuristics and allows us to quantify the interpolation between them. More generally, the framework enables a well principled design of scalable, streaming graph partitioning algorithms that are amenable to distributed implementations. We derive a novel one-pass, streaming graph partitioning algorithm and show that it yields significant performance improvements over previous approaches using an extensive set of real-world and synthetic graphs. Surprisingly, despite the fact that our algorithm is a one-pass streaming algorithm, we found its performance to be in many cases comparable to the de-facto standard offline software METIS and in some cases even superiror. For instance, for the Twitter graph with more than 1.4 billion of edges, our method partitions the graph in about 40 minutes achieving a balanced partition that cuts as few as 6.8% of edges, whereas it took more than 81/2 hours by METIS to produce a balanced partition that cuts 11.98% of edges. We also demonstrate the performance gains by using our graph partitioner while solving standard PageRank computation in a graph processing platform with respect to the communication cost and runtime.",

One popular way to accomplish this is to generate low-dimensional embeddings of entities and relations, and use these to make inferences. ConvE, a recently proposed approach, applies convolutional filters on 2D reshapings of entity and relation embeddings in order to capture rich interactions between their components. However, the number of interactions that ConvE can capture is limited. In this paper, we analyze how increasing the number of these interactions affects link prediction performance, and utilize our observations to propose InteractE. InteractE is based on three key ideas -- feature permutation, a novel feature reshaping, and circular convolution. Through extensive experiments, we find that InteractE outperforms state-of-the-art convolutional link prediction baselines on FB15k-237. Further, InteractE achieves an MRR score that is 9%, 7.5%, and 23% better than ConvE on the FB15k-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10 datasets respectively. The results validate our central hypothesis -- that increasing feature interaction is beneficial to link prediction performance. We make the source code of InteractE available to encourage reproducible research.",

            "abstract": "Communities are prevalent in social networks, knowledge graphs, and biological networks. Recently, the topic of community search (CS), extracting a dense subgraph containing a query vertex $q$q from a graph, has received great attention. However, existing CS solutions are designed for undirected graphs, and overlook directions of edges which potentially lose useful information carried on directions. In many applications (e.g., Twitter), users\u2019 relationships are often modeled as directed graphs (e.g., if a user $a$a follows another user $b$b, then there is an edge from $a$a to $b$b). In this paper, we study the problem of CS on directed graph. Given a vertex $q$q of a graph $G$G, we aim to find a densely connected subgraph containing $q$q from $G$G, in which vertices have strong interactions and high similarities, by using the minimum in/out-degrees metric. We first develop a baseline algorithm based on the concept of D-core. We further propose three index structures and corresponding query algorithms. Our experimental results on seven real graphs show that our solutions are very effective and efficient. For example, on a graph with over 1 billion of edges, we only need around 40mins to index it and 1$\\sim$\u223c2sec to answer a query.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to automatically answer natural language questions via well-structured relation information between entities stored in knowledge graphs. When faced with a multi-relation question, existing embedding-based approaches take the whole topic-entity-centric subgraph into account, resulting in high time complexity. Meanwhile, due to the high cost for data annotations, it is impractical to exactly show how to answer a complex question step by step, and only the final answer is labeled, as weak supervision. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a neural method based on reinforcement learning, namely Stepwise Reasoning Network, which formulates multi-relation question answering as a sequential decision problem. The proposed model performs effective path search over the knowledge graph to obtain the answer, and leverages beam search to reduce the number of candidates significantly. Meanwhile, based on the attention mechanism and neural networks, the policy network can enhance the unique impact of different parts of a given question over triple selection. Moreover, to alleviate the delayed and sparse reward problem caused by weak supervision, we propose a potential-based reward shaping strategy, which can accelerate the convergence of the training algorithm and help the model perform better. Extensive experiments conducted over three benchmark datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Communities, which are prevalent in attributed graphs such as social networks and knowledge bases, can be used in emerging applications such as product advertisement and setting up of social events. In this paper, we investigate the attributed community query (or ACQ), which returns an attributed community (AC) for an attributed graph. The AC is a subgraph of G, which satisfies both structure cohesiveness (i.e., its vertices are tightly connected) and keyword cohesiveness (i.e., its vertices share common keywords). The AC enables a better understanding of how and why a community is formed (e.g., members of an AC have a common interest in music, because they all have the same keyword \"music\"). An AC can be \"personalized\"; for example, an ACQ user may specify that an AC returned should be related to some specific keywords like \"research\" and \"sports\". \n \nTo enable efficient AC search, we develop the CL-tree index structure and three algorithms based on it. We evaluate our solutions on four large graphs, namely Flickr, DBLP, Tencent, and DBpedia. Our results show that ACs are more effective and efficient than existing community retrieval approaches. Moreover, an AC contains more precise and personalized information than that of existing community search and detection methods.",

Some further incorporate another type of features, such as attributes, for refinement. However, a vast of entity features are still unexplored or not equally treated together, which impairs the accuracy and robustness of embedding-based entity alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unifies multiple views of entities to learn embeddings for entity alignment. Specifically, we embed entities based on the views of entity names, relations and attributes, with several combination strategies. Furthermore, we design some cross-KG inference methods to enhance the alignment between two KGs. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art embedding-based entity alignment methods. The selected views, cross-KG inference and combination strategies all contribute to the performance improvement.",

Our experiments clearly show that our method achieves the state of the art on three benchmark KBQA datasets.",

Inasmuch as related knowledge bases are built in several different languages, achieving cross-lingual knowledge alignment will help people in constructing a coherent knowledge base, and assist machines in dealing with different expressions of entity relationships across diverse human languages. Unfortunately, achieving this highly desirable cross-lingual alignment by human labor is very costly and error-prone. Thus, we propose MTransE, a translation-based model for multilingual knowledge graph embeddings, to provide a simple and automated solution. By encoding entities and relations of each language in a separated embedding space, MTransE provides transitions for each embedding vector to its cross-lingual counterparts in other spaces, while preserving the functionalities of monolingual embeddings. We deploy three different techniques to represent cross-lingual transitions, namely axis calibration, translation vectors, and linear transformations, and derive five variants for MTransE using different loss functions. Our models can be trained on partially aligned graphs, where just a small portion of triples are aligned with their cross-lingual counterparts. The experiments on cross-lingual entity matching and triple-wise alignment verification show promising results, with some variants consistently outperforming others on different tasks. We also explore how MTransE preserves the key properties of its monolingual counterpart.",

From this view, the KB-alignment task can be formulated as a graph matching problem; and we further propose a graph-attention based solution, which first matches all entities in two topic entity graphs, and then jointly model the local matching information to derive a graph-level matching vector. Experiments show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

To utilize both the graph structures and the side information such as name, description and attributes, most of the works propagate the side information especially names through linked entities by graph neural networks. However, due to the heterogeneity of different knowledge graphs, the alignment accuracy will be suffered from aggregating different neighbors. This work presents an interaction model to only leverage the side information. Instead of aggregating neighbors, we compute the interactions between neighbors which can capture fine-grained matches of neighbors. Similarly, the interactions of attributes are also modeled. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the best state-of-the-art methods by 1.9-9.7% in terms of HitRatio@1 on the dataset DBP15K.",

Previous works have approached this problem by augmenting methods for static knowledge graphs to leverage time-dependent representations. However, these methods do not explicitly leverage multi-hop structural information and temporal facts from recent time steps to enhance their predictions. Additionally, prior work does not explicitly address the temporal sparsity and variability of entity distributions in TKGs. We propose the Temporal Message Passing (TeMP) framework to address these challenges by combining graph neural networks, temporal dynamics models, data imputation and frequency-based gating techniques. Experiments on standard TKG tasks show that our approach provides substantial gains compared to the previous state of the art, achieving a 10.7% average relative improvement in Hits@10 across three standard benchmarks. Our analysis also reveals important sources of variability both within and across TKG datasets, and we introduce several simple but strong baselines that outperform the prior state of the art in certain settings.",

The problem can be formulated in a reinforcement learning (RL) setup, where a policy-based agent sequentially extends its inference path until it reaches a target. However, in an incomplete KG environment, the agent receives low-quality rewards corrupted by false negatives in the training data, which harms generalization at test time. Furthermore, since no golden action sequence is used for training, the agent can be misled by spurious search trajectories that incidentally lead to the correct answer. We propose two modeling advances to address both issues: (1) we reduce the impact of false negative supervision by adopting a pretrained one-hop embedding model to estimate the reward of unobserved facts; (2) we counter the sensitivity to spurious paths of on-policy RL by forcing the agent to explore a diverse set of paths using randomly generated edge masks. Our approach significantly improves over existing path-based KGQA models on several benchmark datasets and is comparable or better than embedding-based models.",

At the core of this challenge is how to access contextually relevant knowledge on demand and reason over it.\n\nIn this paper, we present initial studies toward zero-shot commonsense question answering by formulating the task as inference over dynamically generated commonsense knowledge graphs. In contrast to previous studies for knowledge integration that rely on retrieval of existing knowledge from static knowledge graphs, our study requires commonsense knowledge integration where contextually relevant knowledge is often not present in existing knowledge bases. Therefore, we present a novel approach that generates contextually-relevant symbolic knowledge structures on demand using generative neural commonsense knowledge models.\n\nEmpirical results on two datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our neuro-symbolic approach for dynamically constructing knowledge graphs for reasoning. Our approach achieves significant performance boosts over pretrained language models and vanilla knowledge models, all while providing interpretable reasoning paths for its predictions.",

However, it remains a challenge to efficiently integrate information from KG into language modeling. And the understanding of a knowledge graph requires related context. We propose a novel joint pre-training framework, JAKET, to model both the knowledge graph and language. The knowledge module and language module provide essential information to mutually assist each other: the knowledge module produces embeddings for entities in text while the language module generates context-aware initial embeddings for entities and relations in the graph. Our design enables the pre-trained model to easily adapt to unseen knowledge graphs in new domains. Experiment results on several knowledge-aware NLP tasks show that our proposed framework achieves superior performance by effectively leveraging knowledge in language understanding.",

Over the last decade, large-scale knowledge bases, also known as knowledge graphs, have been automatically constructed from web contents and text sources, and have become a key asset for search engines. This machine knowledge can be harnessed to semantically interpret textual phrases in news, social media and web tables, and contributes to question answering, natural language processing and data analytics. This article surveys fundamental concepts and practical methods for creating and curating large knowledge bases. It covers models and methods for discovering and canonicalizing entities and their semantic types and organizing them into clean taxonomies. On top of this, the article discusses the automatic extraction of entity-centric properties. To support the long-term life-cycle and the quality assurance of machine knowledge, the article presents methods for constructing open schemas and for knowledge curation. Case studies on academic projects and industrial knowledge graphs complement the survey of concepts and methods.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Knowledge graph (KG) is known to be helpful for the task of question answering (QA), since it provides well-structured relational information between entities, and allows one to further infer indirect facts. However, it is challenging to build QA systems which can learn to reason over knowledge graphs based on question-answer pairs alone. First, when people ask questions, their expressions are noisy (for example, typos in texts, or variations in pronunciations), which is non-trivial for the QA system to match those mentioned entities to the knowledge graph. Second, many questions require multi-hop logic reasoning over the knowledge graph to retrieve the answers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and unified deep learning architecture, and an end-to-end variational learning algorithm which can handle noise in questions, and learn multi-hop reasoning simultaneously. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a recent benchmark dataset in the literature. We also derive a series of new benchmark datasets, including questions for multi-hop reasoning, questions paraphrased by neural translation model, and questions in human voice. Our method yields very promising results on all these challenging datasets.\n \n",

In this work we consider temporal knowledge graphs where relations between entities may only hold for a time interval or a specific point in time. In line with previous work on static knowledge graphs, we propose to address this problem by learning latent entity and relation type representations. To incorporate temporal information, we utilize recurrent neural networks to learn time-aware representations of relation types which can be used in conjunction with existing latent factorization methods. The proposed approach is shown to be robust to common challenges in real-world KGs: the sparsity and heterogeneity of temporal expressions. Experiments show the benefits of our approach on four temporal KGs. The data sets are available under a permissive BSD-3 license.",

Few works explore the potential of deep contextualized knowledge representation when injecting knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Contextualized Language and Knowledge Embedding (CoLAKE), which jointly learns contextualized representation for both language and knowledge with the extended MLM objective. Instead of injecting only entity embeddings, CoLAKE extracts the knowledge context of an entity from large-scale knowledge bases. To handle the heterogeneity of knowledge context and language context, we integrate them in a unified data structure, word-knowledge graph (WK graph). CoLAKE is pre-trained on large-scale WK graphs with the modified Transformer encoder. We conduct experiments on knowledge-driven tasks, knowledge probing tasks, and language understanding tasks. Experimental results show that CoLAKE outperforms previous counterparts on most of the tasks. Besides, CoLAKE achieves surprisingly high performance on our synthetic task called word-knowledge graph completion, which shows the superiority of simultaneously contextualizing language and knowledge representation.",

For example, they may contain inaccurate or outdated entries and do not cover enough facts, which limits their credibility and further utility. Data quality has a long research history in the field of traditional relational data and recently attracts more knowledge graph experts. In this paper, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the quality management on knowledge graphs, covering overall research topics about not only quality issues, dimentions and metrics, but also quality management processes from quality assessment and error detection, to error correction and KG completion. We categorize existing works in terms of target goals and used methods for better understanding.

Much progress has been made in knowledge graph completion, state-of-the-art models are based on graph convolutional neural networks. These models automatically extract features, in combination with the features of the graph model, to generate feature embeddings with a strong expressive ability. However, these methods assign the same weights on the relation path in the knowledge graph and ignore the rich information presented in neighbor nodes, which result in incomplete mining of triple features. To this end, we propose Graph Attenuated Attention networks(GAATs), a novel representation method, which integrates an attenuated attention mechanism to assign different weight in different relation path and acquire the information from the neighborhoods. As a result, entities and relations can be learned in any neighbors. Our empirical research provides insight into the effectiveness of the attenuated attention-based models, and we show significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets WN18RR and FB15k-237.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are large graph-structured knowledge bases with incomplete or partial information. Numerous studies have focused on knowledge graph embedding to identify the embedded representation of entities and relations, thereby predicting missing relations between entities. Previous embedding models primarily regard (subject entity, relation, and object entity) triplet as translational distance or semantic matching in vector space. However, these models only learn a few expressive features and hard to handle complex relations, i.e., 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N, in knowledge graphs. To overcome these issues, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic convolutional network (M-DCN) model for knowledge graph embedding. This model features topnotch performance and an ability to generate richer and more expressive feature embeddings than its counterparts. The subject entity and relation embeddings in M-DCN are composed in an alternating pattern in the input layer, which helps extract additional feature interactions and increase the expressiveness. Multi-scale filters are generated in the convolution layer to learn different characteristics among input embeddings. Specifically, the weights of these filters are dynamically related to each relation to model complex relations. The performance of M-DCN on the five benchmark datasets is tested via experiments. Results show that the model can effectively handle complex relations and achieve state-of-the-art link prediction results on most evaluation metrics.",

However, conventional manners for developing PSS require many professional consultations and still cannot meet with the new features of Smart PSS, such as user context-awareness and ever-evolving knowledge management. Therefore, aiming to assist Smart PSS development cost-effectively, this paper adopted the knowledge graph (KG) technique and concept\u2013knowledge (C-K) model to propose an evolutionary design approach. Two knowledge graphs are firstly established with open-source knowledge, prototype specifications, and user-generated textual data. Then, triggered by personalized requirements, four KG-aided C-K operators are conducted based on graph-based query patterns and computational linguistics algorithms, thus generating innovative solutions for evolving Smart PSS. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, a case study of a smart nursing bed fulfilling multiple personalized requirements is conducted, and the evaluation result of its knowledge evolution is acceptable. It hopes that this work can offer insightful guidance to industrial organizations in their development of Smart PSS.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KG) often encounter knowledge incompleteness. The path reasoning that predicts the unknown path relation between pairwise entities based on existing facts is one of the most promising approaches to the knowledge graph completion. However, most conventional path reasoning methods exclusively consider the entity description included in fact triples, ignoring both the type information of entities and the interaction between different semantic representations. In this study, we propose a novel method, Type-aware Attentive Path Reasoning (TAPR), to complete the knowledge graph by simultaneously considering KG structural information, textual information, and type information. More specifically, we first leverage types to enrich the representational learning of entities and relationships. Next, we describe a type-level attention to select the most relevant type of given entity in a specific triple without any predefined rules or patterns to reduce the impact of noisy types. After learning the distributed representation of all paths, path-level attention assigns different weights to paths, from which relations among entity pairs are calculated. We conduct a series of experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of TAPR. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines on link prediction and entity prediction tasks.",

In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the concept of knowledge graph embeddings by explaining what they are, how they can be generated and how they can be evaluated. We summarize the state-of-the-art in this field by describing the approaches that have been introduced to represent knowledge in the vector space. In relation to knowledge representation, we consider the problem of explainability, and discuss models and methods for explaining predictions obtained via knowledge graph embeddings.",
