            "abstract": "Most of the existing medicine recommendation systems that are mainly based on electronic medical records (EMRs) are significantly assisting doctors to make better clinical decisions benefiting both patients and caregivers. Even though the growth of EMRs is at a lighting fast speed in the era of big data, content limitations in EMRs restrain the existed recommendation systems to reflect relevant medical facts, such as drug-drug interactions. Many medical knowledge graphs that contain drug-related information, such as DrugBank, may give hope for the recommendation systems. However, the direct use of these knowledge graphs in the systems suffers from robustness caused by the incompleteness of the graphs. To address these challenges, we stand on recent advances in graph embedding learning techniques and propose a novel framework, called Safe Medicine Recommendation (SMR), in this paper. Specifically, SMR first constructs a high-quality heterogeneous graph by bridging EMRs (MIMIC-III) and medical knowledge graphs (ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank). Then, SMR jointly embeds diseases, medicines, patients, and their corresponding relations into a shared lower dimensional space. Finally, SMR uses the embeddings to decompose the medicine recommendation into a link prediction process while considering the patient's diagnoses and adverse drug reactions. To our best knowledge, SMR is the first to learn embeddings of a patient-disease-medicine graph for medicine recommendation in the world. Extensive experiments on real datasets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed framework.",

Structured query languages, such as SPARQL, offer a powerful expression ability to query RDF datasets. However, they are difficult to use. Keywords are simple but have a very limited expression ability. Natural language question (NLQ) is promising on querying knowledge graphs. A huge challenge is how to understand the question clearly so as to translate the unstructured question into a structured query. In this paper, we present a data + oracle approach to answer NLQs over knowledge graphs. We let users verify the ambiguities during the query understanding. To reduce the interaction cost, we formalize an interaction problem and design an efficient strategy to solve the problem. We also propose a query prefetch technique by exploiting the latency in the interactions with users. Extensive experiments over the QALD dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective as it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both precision and recall.",

Recent studies show that simply removing the identities of the nodes before publishing the graph/social network data does not guarantee privacy. The structure of the graph itself, and in its basic form the degree of the nodes, can be revealing the identities of individuals. To address this issue, we study a specific graph-anonymization problem. We call a graph k-degree anonymous if for every node v, there exist at least k-1 other nodes in the graph with the same degree as v. This definition of anonymity prevents the re-identification of individuals by adversaries with a priori knowledge of the degree of certain nodes. We formally define the graph-anonymization problem that, given a graph G, asks for the k-degree anonymous graph that stems from G with the minimum number of graph-modification operations. We devise simple and efficient algorithms for solving this problem. Our algorithms are based on principles related to the realizability of degree sequences. We apply our methods to a large spectrum of synthetic and real datasets and demonstrate their efficiency and practical utility.",

In contrast, Wikifarms like Fandom contain Wikis for specific topics, which are often complementary to the information contained in Wikipedia, and thus DBpedia and YAGO. Extracting these Wikis with the DBpedia extraction framework is possible, but results in many isolated knowledge graphs. In this paper, we show how to create one consolidated knowledge graph, called DBkWik, from thousands of Wikis. We perform entity resolution and schema matching, and show that the resulting large-scale knowledge graph is complementary to DBpedia.",

(b) We present a new parallel algorithm with quality guarantees. The algorithm is parallel scalable, which ensures its feasibility in distributed graphs. (3) We also develop a summary-based query evaluation scheme, which only refers to a small number of summaries.

It enables knowledge graphs to grow seamlessly and allows for new relationships and entities as needed. Knowledge graph has become a powerful tool to represent knowledge in the form of a labelled directed graph and to give semantics to textual information. A knowledge graph is a graph constructed by representing each item, entity and user as nodes, and linking those nodes that interact with each other via edges. Knowledge graph has abundant natural semantics and can contain various and more complete information. Its expression mechanism is close to natural language. However, we still lack a unified definition and standard expression form of knowledge graph. We propose to clarify the expression of knowledge graph as a whole. We clarify the architecture of knowledge graph from data, information, knowledge, and wisdom aspects respectively. We also propose to specify knowledge graph in a progressive manner as four basic forms including data graph, information graph, knowledge graph and wisdom graph.",

While these KBs are very large, they are still very incomplete, necessitating the use of inference to fill in gaps. Prior work has shown how to make use of a large text corpus to augment random walk inference over KBs. We present two improvements to the use of such large corpora to augment KB inference. First, we present a new technique for combining KB relations and surface text into a single graph representation that is much more compact than graphs used in prior work. Second, we describe how to incorporate vector space similarity into random walk inference over KBs, reducing the feature sparsity inherent in using surface text. This allows us to combine distributional similarity with symbolic logical inference in novel and effective ways. With experiments on many relations from two separate KBs, we show that our methods significantly outperform prior work on KB inference, both in the size of problem our methods can handle and in the quality of predictions made.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Knowledge graph embedding aims to represent entities and relations in a large-scale knowledge graph as elements in a continuous vector space. Existing methods, e.g., TransE and TransH, learn embedding representation by defining a global margin-based loss function over the data. However, the optimal loss function is determined during experiments whose parameters are examined among a closed set of candidates. Moreover, embeddings over two knowledge graphs with different entities and relations share the same set of candidate loss functions, ignoring the locality of both graphs. This leads to the limited performance of embedding related applications. In this paper, we propose a locally adaptive translation method for knowledge graph embedding, called TransA, to find the optimal loss function by adaptively determining its margin over different knowledge graphs. Experiments on two benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the-state-of-the-art ones.\n \n",

First, we note that short paths on knowledge graphs comprising of chains of entities and relations can encode valuable information regarding their contextual usage. We operationalize this notion by representing knowledge graphs not as a collection of triples but as a collection of entity-relation chains, and learn embeddings for entities and relations using deep neural models that capture such contextual usage. In particular, our model is based on Bi-Directional LSTMs and learn deep representations of entities and relations from constructed entity-relation chains. We show that these representations can very easily be incorporated into existing models to significantly advance the state of the art on several knowledge graph prediction tasks like link prediction, triple classification, and missing relation type prediction (in some cases by at least 9.5%).",

This paper studies a framework that discover to facilitate knowledge graph search. 1) We introduce a class of summaries characterized by graph patterns. In contrast to conventional summaries defined by frequent subgraphs, the summaries are capable of adaptively summarize entities with similar neighbors up to a bounded hop. 2) We formulate the computation of graph summarization as a bi-criteria pattern mining problem. Given a knowledge graph G, the problem is to discover k diversified summaries that maximizes the informativeness measure. Although this problem is NP-hard, we show that it is 2-approximable. We also introduce an online mining algorithm that trade-off speed and accuracy, under given resource constraints. 3) We develop query evaluation algorithms that make use of the summaries as views. These algorithms efficiently compute (approximate) answers with high accuracy, and only refer to a small number of summaries. Our experimental study verifies that online mining over large knowledge graphs is feasible, and can suggest bounded search in knowledge graphs.",

            "abstract": "A knowledge graph is a graph with entities of different types as nodes and various relations among them as edges. The construction of knowledge graphs in the past decades facilitates many applications, such as link prediction, web search analysis, question answering, and so on. Knowledge graph embedding aims to represent entities and relations in a large-scale knowledge graph as elements in a continuous vector space. Existing methods, for example, TransE, TransH, and TransR, learn the embedding representation by defining a global margin-based loss function over the data. However, the loss function is determined during experiments whose parameters are examined among a closed set of candidates. Moreover, embeddings over two knowledge graphs with different entities and relations share the same set of candidates, ignoring the locality of both graphs. This leads to the limited performance of embedding related applications. In this article, a locally adaptive translation method for knowledge graph embedding, called TransA, is proposed to find the loss function by adaptively determining its margin over different knowledge graphs. Then the convergence of TransA is verified from the aspect of its uniform stability. To make the embedding methods up-to-date when new vertices and edges are added into the knowledge graph, the incremental algorithm for TransA, called iTransA, is proposed by adaptively adjusting the optimal margin over time. Experiments on four benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art ones.",

However, we find that the loss function cannot ensure the fact that the scoring of correct triplets must be low enough to fulfill the translation. In this paper, we present a limit-based scoring loss to provide lower scoring of a golden triplet, and then to extend two basic translation models TransE and TransH, separately to TransE-RS and TransH-RS by combining limit-based scoring loss with margin-based ranking loss. Both the presented models have low complexities of parameters benefiting for application on large scale graphs. In experiments, we evaluate our models on two typical tasks including triplet classification and link prediction, and also analyze the scoring distributions of positive and negative triplets by different models. Experimental results show that the introduced limit-based scoring loss is effective to improve the capacities of knowledge graph embedding.",

Due to the highly irregular nature of the access patterns involved, caches and prefetchers, both hardware and software, perform poorly on graph workloads. This leads to CPU stalling for the majority of the time. However, in many cases the data access pattern is well defined and predictable in advance, many falling into a small set of simple patterns. Although existing implicit prefetchers cannot bring significant benefit, a prefetcher armed with knowledge of the data structures and access patterns could accurately anticipate applications' traversals to bring in the appropriate data. This paper presents a design of an explicitly configured prefetcher to improve performance for breadth-first searches and sequential iteration on the efficient and commonly-used compressed sparse row graph format. By snooping L1 cache accesses from the core and reacting to data returned from its own prefetches, the prefetcher can schedule timely loads of data in advance of the application needing it. For a range of applications and graph sizes, our prefetcher achieves average speedups of 2.3x, and up to 3.3x, with little impact on memory bandwidth requirements.",

According to a cognitive analysis, graph interpretation involves (a) relatively simple pattern perception and association processes in which viewers can associate graphic patterns to quantitative referents and (b) more complex and error-prone inferential processes in which viewers must mentally transform data. Experiment 1 establishes that graphs can be redesigned to improve viewers' interpretations by minimizing the inferential processes and maximizing the pattern association processes required to interpret relevant information. In Experiments 2 and 3, the researchers isolated one important factor that affects viewers' interpretation (i.e., the perceptual organization of the information in graphs). If relevant quantitative information is perceptually grouped to form visual chunks (because relevant data points are either connected in line graphs or close together in bar graphs), then viewers describe relevant trends. If relevant information is not perceptually grouped, viewers are less likely to comprehend relevant trends.",

This paper proposes context-dependent KG embedding, a twostage scheme that takes into account both types of connectivity patterns and obtains more accurate embeddings. We evaluate our approach on the tasks of link prediction and triple classification, and achieve significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",

Using a large semantic graph that contains all businesses in Bellevue, WA, extracted from Microsoft Satori, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can return significantly more relevant entities to the user than a baseline system using database lookup.",

A structure used for this task is a semantic graph,also known as a relational data graph or an attributed relational graph. These graphs encode relationships astyped links between a pair of typed nodes. Indeed, semantic graphs are very similar to semantic networks usedin AI. The node and link types are related through an ontology graph (also known as a schema). Furthermore,each node has a set of attributes associated with it (e.g., \u201cage\u201d may be an attribute of a node of type \u201cperson\u201d).Unfortunately, the selection of types and attributes for both nodes and links depends on human expertise and issomewhat subjective and even arbitrary. This subjectiveness introduces biases into any algorithm that operateson semantic graphs. Here, we raise some knowledge representation issues for semantic graphs and providesome possible solutions using recently developed ideas in the \ufb01eld of complex networks. In particular, we usethe concept of transitivity to evaluate the relevance of individual links in the semantic graph for detecting rela-tionships. We also propose new statistical measures for semantic graphs and illustrate these semantic measureson graphs constructed from movies and terrorism data.I. INTRODUCTION",

Exemplar outcomes of this shift are a wide range of graph data such as information, social, and knowledge graphs. The unique characteristics of graph data are challenging traditional search techniques like SQL and keyword search. Graph query is emerging as a promising complementary search form. In this paper, we study how to improve graph query by relevance feedback. Specifically, we focus on knowledge graph query, and formulate the graph relevance feedback (GRF) problem. We propose a general GRF framework that is able to (1) tune the original ranking function based on user feedback and (2) further enrich the query itself by mining new features from user feedback. As a consequence, a query-specific ranking function is generated, which is better aligned with the user search intent. Given a newly learned ranking function based on user feedback, we further investigate whether we shall re-rank the existing answers, or choose to search from scratch. We propose a strategy to train a binary classifier to predict which action will be more beneficial for a given query. The GRF framework is applied to searching DBpedia with graph queries derived from YAGO and Wikipedia. Experiment results show that GRF can improve the mean average precision by 80% to 100%.",

It enables knowledge graphs to grow seamlessly and allows for new relationships and entities as needed. Natural language questions are the most intuitive way of formulating an information need. People can formulate questions to express their information needs. Natural language questions as a query language present an ideal compromise between keyword and structured querying. Questions can be used to express complex information needs that cannot be expressed as keywords without a significant loss in structure and semantics. Knowledge graph has abundant natural semantics and can contain various and more complete information. Its expression mechanism is closer to natural language. We propose to clarify the expression of knowledge graph as a whole. We use knowledge graph to solve the Five Ws problems respectively which are guided by interrogative words such as who/when, what, how and why. We also propose to specify knowledge graph in a progressive manner as four basic forms including data graph, information graph, knowledge graph and wisdom graph. 1",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding, which aims to represent entities and relations in vector spaces, has shown outstanding performance on a few knowledge graph completion tasks. Most existing methods are based on the assumption that a knowledge graph is a set of separate triples, ignoring rich graph features, i.e., structural information in the graph. In this paper, we take advantages of structures in knowledge graphs, especially local structures around a triple, which we refer to as triple context. We then propose a Triple-Context-based knowledge Embedding model (TCE). For each triple, two kinds of structure information are considered as its context in the graph; one is the outgoing relations and neighboring entities of an entity and the other is relation paths between a pair of entities, both of which reflect various aspects of the triple. Triples along with their contexts are represented in a unified framework, in which way structural information in triple contexts can be embodied. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for link prediction.",

Notable knowledge graph systems include Google Knowledge Graph, DBPedia, YAGO, NELL, Probase and many others. Knowledge graph organizes the information in a structured way by explicitly describing the relations among entities. Since entity identification and relation extraction are highly depending on language itself, data sources largely determine the way the data are processed, relations are extracted, and ultimately how knowledge graphs are formed, which deeply involves the analysis of lexicon, syntax and semantics of the content. Currently, much progress has been made for knowledge graphs in English language. In this paper, we discuss the challenges facing Chinese knowledge graph construction because Chinese is significantly different from English in various linguistic perspectives. Specifically, we analyze the challenges from three aspects: data sources, taxonomy derivation and knowledge extraction. We also present our insights in addressing these challenges.",

A structural correlation pattern is a dense subgraph induced by a particular attribute set. Existing methods are not able to extract relevant knowledge regarding how vertex attributes interact with dense subgraphs. Structural correlation pattern mining combines aspects of frequent itemset and quasi-clique mining problems. We propose statistical significance measures that compare the structural correlation of attribute sets against their expected values using null models. Moreover, we evaluate the interestingness of structural correlation patterns in terms of size and density. An efficient algorithm that combines search and pruning strategies in the identification of the most relevant structural correlation patterns is presented. We apply our method for the analysis of three real-world attributed graphs: a collaboration, a music, and a citation network, verifying that it provides valuable knowledge in a feasible time.",

            "abstract": "Answering complex questions about textual narratives requires reasoning over both stated context and the world knowledge that underlies it. However, pretrained language models (LM), the foundation of most modern QA systems, do not robustly represent latent relationships between concepts, which is necessary for reasoning. While knowledge graphs (KG) are often used to augment LMs with structured representations of world knowledge, it remains an open question how to effectively fuse and reason over the KG representations and the language context, which provides situational constraints and nuances. In this work, we propose GreaseLM, a new model that fuses encoded representations from pretrained LMs and graph neural networks over multiple layers of modality interaction operations. Information from both modalities propagates to the other, allowing language context representations to be grounded by structured world knowledge, and allowing linguistic nuances (e.g., negation, hedging) in the context to inform the graph representations of knowledge. Our results on three benchmarks in the commonsense reasoning (i.e., CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA) and medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMLE) domains demonstrate that GreaseLM can more reliably answer questions that require reasoning over both situational constraints and structured knowledge, even outperforming models 8x larger.",

In order to allocate resources effectively, managers need to rely on their experience backed by code complexity metrics. But often dependencies exist between various pieces of code over which managers may have little knowledge. These dependencies can be construed as a low level graph of the entire system. In this paper, we propose to use network analysis on these dependency graphs. This allows managers to identify central program units that are more likely to face defects. In our evaluation on Windows Server 2003, we found that the recall for models built from network measures is by 10% points higher than for models built from complexity metrics. In addition, network measures could identify 60% of the binaries that the Windows developers considered as critical-twice as many as identified by complexity metrics.",

However, the existing pre-trained language models rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better language understanding. We argue that informative entities in KGs can enhance language representation with external knowledge. In this paper, we utilize both large-scale textual corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model (ERNIE), which can take full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information simultaneously. The experimental results have demonstrated that ERNIE achieves significant improvements on various knowledge-driven tasks, and meanwhile is comparable with the state-of-the-art model BERT on other common NLP tasks. The code and datasets will be available in the future.",

We present a machine learning approach to computing an affinity graph using a convolutional network (CN) trained using ground truth provided by human experts. The CN affinity graph can be paired with any standard partitioning algorithm and improves segmentation accuracy significantly compared to standard hand-designed affinity functions. We apply our algorithm to the challenging 3D segmentation problem of reconstructing neuronal processes from volumetric electron microscopy (EM) and show that we are able to learn a good affinity graph directly from the raw EM images. Further, we show that our affinity graph improves the segmentation accuracy of both simple and sophisticated graph partitioning algorithms. In contrast to previous work, we do not rely on prior knowledge in the form of hand-designed image features or image preprocessing. Thus, we expect our algorithm to generalize effectively to arbitrary image types.",

We motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a significant margin.",

This paper focuses on the index structure for similarity search on a set of large sparse graphs and proposes an efficient indexing mechanism by introducing the Q-Gram idea. By decomposing graphs to small grams (organized by \u03ba-Adjacent Tree patterns) and pairing-up on those \u03ba-Adjacent Tree patterns, the lower bound estimation of their edit distance can be calculated for candidate filtering. Furthermore, we have developed a series of techniques for inverted index construction and online query processing. By building the candidate set for the query graph before the exact edit distance calculation, the number of graphs need to proceed into exact matching can be greatly reduced. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data sets have been conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed indexing mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning models for graphs have achieved strong performance for the task of node classification. Despite their proliferation, currently there is no study of their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they are likely to be used, e.g. the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning models for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we introduce the first study of adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus on the training phase of a machine learning model.We generate adversarial perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus, taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our experimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly drops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are transferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node classification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful even when only limited knowledge about the graph is given.",

However, the ability to populate knowledge bases with facts automatically extracted from documents has improved frustratingly slowly. This paper simultaneously addresses two issues that have held back prior work. We first propose an effective new model, which combines an LSTM sequence model with a form of entity position-aware attention that is better suited to relation extraction. Then we build TACRED, a large (119,474 examples) supervised relation extraction dataset obtained via crowdsourcing and targeted towards TAC KBP relations. The combination of better supervised data and a more appropriate high-capacity model enables much better relation extraction performance. When the model trained on this new dataset replaces the previous relation extraction component of the best TAC KBP 2015 slot filling system, its F1 score increases markedly from 22.2% to 26.7%.",

The nodes may have qualitative and quantitative characteristics, and the edges may have properties such as weights and directions. Graph theory provides a flexible conceptual model that can clarify the relationship between structures and processes, including the mechanisms of configuration effects and compositional differences. Graph concepts apply to many ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including interspecific associations, spatial structure, dispersal in landscapes, and relationships within metapopulations and metacommunities. We review applications of graph theory in biology, emphasizing graphs with spatial contexts. We show how spatial graph properties can be used for description and comparison as well as to test specific hypotheses. We suggest that future applications should include explicit spatial elements for ...",

GNNs have been applied to numerous domains ranging from quantum chemistry, recommender systems to knowledge graphs and natural language processing. A major issue with arbitrary graphs is the absence of canonical positional information of nodes, which decreases the representation power of GNNs to distinguish e.g. isomorphic nodes and other graph symmetries. An approach to tackle this issue is to introduce Positional Encoding (PE) of nodes, and inject it into the input layer, like in Transformers. Possible graph PE are Laplacian eigenvectors. In this work, we propose to decouple structural and positional representations to make easy for the network to learn these two essential properties. We introduce a novel generic architecture which we call LSPE (Learnable Structural and Positional Encodings). We investigate several sparse and fully-connected (Transformer-like) GNNs, and observe a performance increase for molecular datasets, from 1.79% up to 64.14% when considering learnable PE for both GNN classes.",

We then provide a knowledge compilation map, which analyzes a large number of existing target compilation languages according to their succinctness and their polytime transformations and queries. We argue that such analysis is necessary for placing new compilation approaches within the context of existing ones. We also go beyond classical, flat target compilation languages based on CNF and DNF, and consider a richer, nested class based on directed acyclic graphs (such as OBDDs), which we show to include a relatively large number of target compilation languages.",

Unfortunately the computations required are usually intractable. This thesis presents a uni\ufb01ed variational Bayesian (VB) framework which approximates these computations in models with latent variables using a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. Chapter 1 presents background material on Bayesian inference, graphical models, and propagation algorithms. Chapter 2 forms the theoretical core of the thesis, generalising the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm for learning maximum likelihood parameters to the VB EM algorithm which integrates over model parameters. The algorithm is then specialised to the large family of conjugate-exponential (CE) graphical models, and several theorems are presented to pave the road for automated VB derivation procedures in both directed and undirected graphs (Bayesian and Markov networks, respectively).",

Graph data can be found in a broad spectrum of application domains such as social systems, ecosystems, biological networks, knowledge graphs, and information systems. With the continuous penetration of artificial intelligence technologies, graph learning (i.e., machine learning on graphs) is gaining attention from both researchers and practitioners. Graph learning proves effective for many tasks, such as classification, link prediction, and matching. Generally, graph learning methods extract relevant features of graphs by taking advantage of machine learning algorithms. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art of graph learning. Special attention is paid to four categories of existing graph learning methods, including graph signal processing, matrix factorization, random walk, and deep learning. Major models and algorithms under these categories are reviewed, respectively. We examine graph learning applications in areas such as text, images, science, knowledge graphs, and combinatorial optimization. In addition, we discuss several promising research directions in this field.",

However, the enormous size and high sparsity level of graphs hinder their applications under industrial scenarios. Although some scalable GNNs are proposed for large-scale graphs, they adopt a fixed K-hop neighborhood for each node, thus facing the over-smoothing issue when adopting large propagation depths for nodes within sparse regions. To tackle the above issue, we propose a new GNN architecture --- Graph Attention Multi-Layer Perceptron (GAMLP), which can capture the underlying correlations between different scales of graph knowledge. We have deployed GAMLP in Tencent with the Angel platform, and we further evaluate GAMLP on both real-world datasets and large-scale industrial datasets. Extensive experiments on these 14 graph datasets demonstrate that GAMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance while enjoying high scalability and efficiency. Specifically, it outperforms GAT by 1.3% regarding predictive accuracy on our large-scale Tencent Video dataset while achieving up to 50x training speedup. Besides, it ranks top-1 on both the leaderboards of the largest homogeneous and heterogeneous graph (i.e., ogbn-papers100M and ogbn-mag) of Open Graph Benchmark.",

A network of this sort can be used to represent the generic knowledge of a domain expert, and it turns into a computational architecture if the links are used not merely for storing factual knowledge but also for directing and activating the data flow in the computations which manipulate this knowledge. The first part of the paper deals with the task of fusing and propagating the impacts of new information through the networks in such a way that, when equilibrium is reached, each proposition will be assigned a measure of belief consistent with the axioms of probability theory. It is shown that if the network is singly connected (e.g. tree-structured), then probabilities can be updated by local propagation in an isomorphic network of parallel and autonomous processors and that the impact of new information can be imparted to all propositions in time proportional to the longest path in the network. The second part of the paper deals with the problem of finding a tree-structured representation for a collection of probabilistically coupled propositions using auxiliary (dummy) variables, colloquially called \"hidden causes.\" It is shown that if such a tree-structured representation exists, then it is possible to uniquely uncover the topology of the tree by observing pairwise dependencies among the available propositions (i.e., the leaves of the tree). The entire tree structure, including the strengths of all internal relationships, can be reconstructed in time proportional to n log n, where n is the number of leaves.",

            "abstract": "Next Point-of Interest (POI) recommendation plays an important role in location-based applications, which aims to recommend the next POIs to users that they are most likely to visit based on their historical trajectories. Existing methods usually use rich side information, or customized POI graphs to capture the sequential patterns among POIs. However, the graphs only focus on connectivity between POIs. Few studies propose to explicitly learn a weighted POI graph, which could reflect the transition patterns among POIs and show the importance of its different neighbors for each POI. In addition, these approaches simply utilize the user characteristics for personalized POI recommendation without sufficient consideration. To this end, we construct a novel User-POI Knowledge Graph with strong representation ability, called Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Graph (STKG). STKG is used to learn the representations of each node (i.e., user, POI) and each edge. Then, we design a similarity function to construct our POI transition graph based on the learned representations. To incorporate the learned graph into sequential model, we propose a novel network Graph-Flashback for recommendation. Graph-Flashback applies a simplified Graph Convolution Network (GCN) on the POI transition graph to enrich the representation of each POI. Further, we define a similarity function to consider both spatiotemporal information and user preference in modelling sequential regularity. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms all existing solutions.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning on graphs has attracted significant interests recently. However, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning, resulting in shortcomings including heavy label reliance, poor generalization, and weak robustness. To address these issues, self-supervised learning (SSL), which extracts informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels, has become a promising and trending learning paradigm for graph data. Different from SSL on other domains like computer vision and natural language processing, SSL on graphs has an exclusive background, design ideas, and taxonomies. Under the umbrella of graph self-supervised learning, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the existing approaches which employ SSL techniques for graph data. We construct a unified framework that mathematically formalizes the paradigm of graph SSL. According to the objectives of pretext tasks, we divide these approaches into four categories: generation-based, auxiliary property-based, contrast-based, and hybrid approaches. We further describe the applications of graph SSL across various research fields and summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation benchmark, performance comparison and open-source codes of graph SSL. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and potential future directions in this research field.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs provide a powerful representation of entities and the relationships between them, but automatically constructing such graphs from noisy extractions presents numerous challenges. Knowledge graph identification (KGI) is a technique for knowledge graph construction that jointly reasons about entities, attributes and relations in the presence of uncertain inputs and ontological constraints. Although knowledge graph identification shows promise scaling to knowledge graphs built from millions of extractions, increasingly powerful extraction engines may soon require knowledge graphs built from billions of extractions. One tool for scaling is partitioning extractions to allow reasoning to occur in parallel. We explore approaches which leverage ontological information and distributional information in partitioning. We compare these techniques with hash-based approaches, and show that using a richer partitioning model that incorporates the ontology graph and distribution of extractions provides superior results. Our results demonstrate that partitioning can result in order-of-magnitude speedups without reducing model performance.",

Most of these knowledge bases adopt the Semantic-Web data model RDF as a representation model. Querying these knowledge bases is typically done using structured queries utilizing graph-pattern languages such as SPARQL. However, such structured queries require some expertise from users which limits the accessibility to such data sources. To overcome this, keyword search must be supported. In this paper, we propose a retrieval model for keyword queries over RDF graphs. Our model retrieves a set of subgraphs that match the query keywords, and ranks them based on statistical language models. We show that our retrieval model outperforms the-state-of-the-art IR and DB models for keyword search over structured data using experiments over two real-world datasets.",

We present here a family of extensions of this model, based on rules and constraints, keeping graph homomorphism as the basic operation. We focus on the formal definitions of the different models obtained, including their operational semantics and relationships with FOL, and we analyze the decidability and complexity of the associated problems (consistency and deduction). As soon as rules are involved in reasonings, these problems are not decidable, but we exhibit a condition under which they fall in the polynomial hierarchy. These results extend and complete the ones already published by the authors. Moreover we systematically study the complexity of some particular cases obtained by restricting the form of constraints and/or rules.",

            "abstract": "Computing shortest paths between two given nodes is a fundamental operation over graphs, but known to be nontrivial over large disk-resident instances of graph data. While a number of techniques exist for answering reachability queries and approximating node distances efficiently, determining actual shortest paths (i.e. the sequence of nodes involved) is often neglected. However, in applications arising in massive online social networks, biological networks, and knowledge graphs it is often essential to find out many, if not all, shortest paths between two given nodes. In this paper, we address this problem and present a scalable sketch-based index structure that not only supports estimation of node distances, but also computes corresponding shortest paths themselves. Generating the actual path information allows for further improvements to the estimation accuracy of distances (and paths), leading to near-exact shortest-path approximations in real world graphs. We evaluate our techniques - implemented within a fully functional RDF graph database system - over large real-world social and biological networks of sizes ranging from tens of thousand to millions of nodes and edges. Experiments on several datasets show that we can achieve query response times providing several orders of magnitude speedup over traditional path computations while keeping the estimation errors between 0% and 1% on average.",

However, the primary focus has been on handling simple undirected graphs. Multi-relational graphs are a more general and prevalent form of graphs where each edge has a label and direction associated with it. Most of the existing approaches to handle such graphs suffer from over-parameterization and are restricted to learning representations of nodes only. In this paper, we propose CompGCN, a novel Graph Convolutional framework which jointly embeds both nodes and relations in a relational graph. CompGCN leverages a variety of entity-relation composition operations from Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques and scales with the number of relations. It also generalizes several of the existing multi-relational GCN methods. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, and achieve demonstrably superior results. We make the source code of CompGCN available to foster reproducible research.",

GLRS mainly employ advanced graph learning approaches to model users\u2019 preferences and intentions as well as items\u2019 characteristics and popularity for Recommender Systems (RS). Differently from other approaches, including content based filtering and collaborative filtering, GLRS are built on graphs where the important objects, e.g., users, items, and attributes, are either explicitly or implicitly connected. With the rapid development of graph learning techniques, exploring and exploiting homogeneous or heterogeneous relations in graphs is a promising direction for building more effective RS. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of GLRS, by discussing how they extract knowledge from graphs to improve the accuracy, reliability and explainability of the recommendations. First, we characterize and formalize GLRS, and then summarize and categorize the key challenges and main progress in this novel research area.",

Data stream mining faces hard constraints regarding time and space for processing, and also needs to provide for concept drift detection. In this paper we present a framework for studying graph pattern mining on time-varying streams. Three new methods for mining frequent closed subgraphs are presented. All methods work on coresets of closed subgraphs, compressed representations of graph sets, and maintain these sets in a batch-incremental manner, but use different approaches to address potential concept drift. An evaluation study on datasets comprising up to four million graphs explores the strength and limitations of the proposed methods. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work on mining frequent closed subgraphs in non-stationary data streams.",

First, we use localized node embeddings computed by a graph neural network to obtain an initial ranking of soft correspondences between nodes. Secondly, we employ synchronous message passing networks to iteratively re-rank the soft correspondences to reach a matching consensus in local neighborhoods between graphs. We show, theoretically and empirically, that our message passing scheme computes a well-founded measure of consensus for corresponding neighborhoods, which is then used to guide the iterative re-ranking process. Our purely local and sparsity-aware architecture scales well to large, real-world inputs while still being able to recover global correspondences consistently. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our method on real-world tasks from the fields of computer vision and entity alignment between knowledge graphs, on which we improve upon the current state-of-the-art.",

The seed (labeled) nodes are first detected using Markov random walks performed on two different graphs that represent the image. While the global properties of the image are computed from the random walk on a complete graph, the local properties are computed from a sparse k-regular graph. The most salient node is selected as the one which is globally most isolated but falls on a locally compact object. A few background nodes and salient nodes are further identified based upon the random walk based hitting time to the most salient node. The salient nodes and the background nodes will constitute the labeled nodes. A new graph representation of the image that represents the saliency between nodes more accurately, the \u201cpop-out graph\u201d model, is computed further based upon the knowledge of the labeled salient and background nodes. A semisupervised learning technique is used to determine the labels of the unlabeled nodes by optimizing a smoothness objective label function on the newly created \u201cpop-out graph\u201d model along with some weighted soft constraints on the labeled nodes.",

We investigate training time attacks on graph neural networks for node classification that perturb the discrete graph structure. Our core principle is to use meta-gradients to solve the bilevel problem underlying training-time attacks, essentially treating the graph as a hyperparameter to optimize. Our experiments show that small graph perturbations consistently lead to a strong decrease in performance for graph convolutional networks, and even transfer to unsupervised embeddings. Remarkably, the perturbations created by our algorithm can misguide the graph neural networks such that they perform worse than a simple baseline that ignores all relational information. Our attacks do not assume any knowledge about or access to the target classifiers.",

In this paper, we investigate two recent pretrained language models (PLMs) and analyze the impact of different task-adaptive pretraining strategies for PLMs in graph-to-text generation. We present a study across three graph domains: meaning representations, Wikipedia knowledge graphs (KGs) and scientific KGs. We show that approaches based on PLMs BART and T5 achieve new state-of-the-art results and that task-adaptive pretraining strategies improve their performance even further. We report new state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 49.72 on AMR-LDC2017T10, 59.70 on WebNLG, and 25.66 on AGENDA datasets - a relative improvement of 31.8%, 4.5%, and 42.4%, respectively, with our models generating significantly more fluent texts than human references. In an extensive analysis, we identify possible reasons for the PLMs\u2019 success on graph-to-text tasks. Our findings suggest that the PLMs benefit from similar facts seen during pretraining or fine-tuning, such that they perform well even when the input graph is reduced to a simple bag of node and edge labels.",

However, these embedding-based methods do not explicitly capture the compositional logical rules underlying the knowledge graph, and they are limited to the transductive setting, where the full set of entities must be known during training. Here, we propose a graph neural network based relation prediction framework, GraIL, that reasons over local subgraph structures and has a strong inductive bias to learn entity-independent relational semantics. Unlike embedding-based models, GraIL is naturally inductive and can generalize to unseen entities and graphs after training. We provide theoretical proof and strong empirical evidence that GraIL can represent a useful subset of first-order logic and show that GraIL outperforms existing rule-induction baselines in the inductive setting. We also demonstrate significant gains obtained by ensembling GraIL with various knowledge graph embedding methods in the transductive setting, highlighting the complementary inductive bias of our method.",

As the size of graphs reaches several Giga-, Tera- or Peta-bytes, the necessity for such a library grows too. To the best of our knowledge, PEGASUS is the first such library, implemented on the top of the Hadoop platform, the open source version of MapReduce. Many graph mining operations (PageRank, spectral clustering, diameter estimation, connected components etc.) are essentially a repeated matrix-vector multiplication. In this paper we describe a very important primitive for PEGASUS, called GIM-V (Generalized Iterated Matrix-Vector multiplication). GIM-V is highly optimized, achieving (a) good scale-up on the number of available machines (b) linear running time on the number of edges, and (c) more than 5 times faster performance over the non-optimized version of GIM-V. Our experiments ran on M45, one of the top 50 supercomputers in the world. We report our findings on several real graphs, including one of the largest publicly available Web Graphs, thanks to Yahoo!, with 6,7 billion edges.",

Namely, given a large graph G = (V;E) we want to estimate as accurately as possible the number of triangles incident to every node \u03c5 \u2208 V in the graph. The problem of computing the global number of triangles in a graph has been considered before, but to our knowledge this is the first paper that addresses the problem of local triangle counting with a focus on the efficiency issues arising in massive graphs. The distribution of the local number of triangles and the related local clustering coefficient can be used in many interesting applications. For example, we show that the measures we compute can help to detect the presence of spamming activity in large-scale Web graphs, as well as to provide useful features to assess content quality in social networks.\n For computing the local number of triangles we propose two approximation algorithms, which are based on the idea of min-wise independent permutations (Broder et al. 1998). Our algorithms operate in a semi-streaming fashion, using O(jV j) space in main memory and performing O(log jV j) sequential scans over the edges of the graph. The first algorithm we describe in this paper also uses O(jEj) space in external memory during computation, while the second algorithm uses only main memory. We present the theoretical analysis as well as experimental results in massive graphs demonstrating the practical efficiency of our approach.",

This paper proposes a novel framework for optimizing the latent representations with respect to the \\textit{analogical} properties of the embedded entities and relations. By formulating the learning objective in a differentiable fashion, our model enjoys both theoretical power and computational scalability, and significantly outperformed a large number of representative baseline methods on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the model offers an elegant unification of several well-known methods in multi-relational embedding, which can be proven to be special instantiations of our framework.",

            "abstract": "Spatio-temporal graphs are important structures to describe urban sensory data, e.g., traffic speed and air quality. Predicting over spatio-temporal graphs enables many essential applications in intelligent cities, such as traffic management and environment analysis. Recently, many deep learning models have been proposed for spatio-temporal graph prediction and achieved significant results. However, designing neural networks requires rich domain knowledge and expert efforts. To this end, we study automated neural architecture search for spatio-temporal graphs with the application to urban traffic prediction, which meets two challenges: 1) how to define search space for capturing complex spatio-temporal correlations; and 2) how to learn network weight parameters related to the corresponding attributed graph of a spatio-temporal graph. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework, entitled AutoSTG, for automated spatio-temporal graph prediction. In our AutoSTG, spatial graph convolution and temporal convolution operations are adopted in our search space to capture complex spatio-temporal correlations. Besides, we employ the meta learning technique to learn the adjacency matrices of spatial graph convolution layers and kernels of temporal convolution layers from the meta knowledge of the attributed graph. And specifically, such meta knowledge is learned by a graph meta knowledge learner that iteratively aggregates knowledge on the attributed graph. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world benchmark datasets to demonstrate that AutoSTG can find effective network architectures and achieve state-of-the-art results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study neural architecture search for spatio-temporal graphs.",

However, multi-relational knowledge graphs often exhibit multiple simultaneous hierarchies, which current hyperbolic models do not capture. To address this, we propose a model that embeds multi-relational graph data in the Poincare ball model of hyperbolic space. Our Multi-Relational Poincare model (MuRP) learns relation-specific parameters to transform entity embeddings by Mobius matrix-vector multiplication and Mobius addition. Experiments on the hierarchical WN18RR knowledge graph show that our Poincare embeddings outperform their Euclidean counterpart and existing embedding methods on the link prediction task, particularly at lower dimensionality.",

Prior conceptual graph construction approaches typically extract high-frequent, coarse-grained, and time-invariant concepts from formal texts such as Wikipedia. In real applications, however, it is necessary to extract less-frequent, fine-grained, and time-varying conceptual knowledge and build taxonomy in an evolving manner. In this paper, we introduce an approach to implementing and deploying the conceptual graph at Alibaba. Specifically, We propose a framework called AliCG which is capable of a) extracting fine-grained concepts by a novel bootstrapping with alignment consensus approach, b) mining long-tail concepts with a novel low-resource phrase mining approach, c) updating the graph dynamically via a concept distribution estimation method based on implicit and explicit user behaviors. We have deployed the conceptual graph at Alibaba UC Browser. Extensive offline evaluation as well as online A/B testing demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",

Certainly making visualizations is integral to scientific thinking. Scientists do not use words only but rely on diagrams, graphs, videos, photographs, and other images to make discoveries, explain findings, and excite public interest. From the notebooks of Faraday and Maxwell (1) to current professional practices of chemists (2), scientists imagine new relations, test ideas, and elaborate knowledge through visual representations (3\u20135).",

Here, we define both a measure of local community structure and an algorithm that infers the hierarchy of communities that enclose a given vertex by exploring the graph one vertex at a time. This algorithm runs in time O(k2d) for general graphs when d is the mean degree and k is the number of vertices to be explored. For graphs where exploring a new vertex is time consuming, the running time is linear, O(k). We show that on computer-generated graphs the average behavior of this technique approximates that of algorithms that require global knowledge. As an application, we use this algorithm to extract meaningful local clustering information in the large recommender network of an online retailer.",

However, most GCNs only work in a single domain (graph) incapable of transferring knowledge from/to other domains (graphs), due to the challenges in both graph representation learning and domain adaptation over graph structures. In this paper, we present a novel approach, unsupervised domain adaptive graph convolutional networks (UDA-GCN), for domain adaptation learning for graphs. To enable effective graph representation learning, we first develop a dual graph convolutional network component, which jointly exploits local and global consistency for feature aggregation. An attention mechanism is further used to produce a unified representation for each node in different graphs. To facilitate knowledge transfer between graphs, we propose a domain adaptive learning module to optimize three different loss functions, namely source classifier loss, domain classifier loss, and target classifier loss as a whole, thus our model can differentiate class labels in the source domain, samples from different domains, the class labels from the target domain, respectively. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the node classification task validate the performance of our method, compared to state-of-the-art graph neural network algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding has been an active research topic for knowledge base completion, with progressive improvement from the initial TransE, TransH, DistMult et al to the current state-of-the-art ConvE. ConvE uses 2D convolution over embeddings and multiple layers of nonlinear features to model knowledge graphs. The model can be efficiently trained and scalable to large knowledge graphs. However, there is no structure enforcement in the embedding space of ConvE. The recent graph convolutional network (GCN) provides another way of learning graph node embedding by successfully utilizing graph connectivity structure. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end StructureAware Convolutional Network (SACN) that takes the benefit of GCN and ConvE together. SACN consists of an encoder of a weighted graph convolutional network (WGCN), and a decoder of a convolutional network called Conv-TransE. WGCN utilizes knowledge graph node structure, node attributes and edge relation types. It has learnable weights that adapt the amount of information from neighbors used in local aggregation, leading to more accurate embeddings of graph nodes. Node attributes in the graph are represented as additional nodes in the WGCN. The decoder Conv-TransE enables the state-of-the-art ConvE to be translational between entities and relations while keeps the same link prediction performance as ConvE. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SACN on standard FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, and it gives about 10% relative improvement over the state-of-theart ConvE in terms of HITS@1, HITS@3 and HITS@10.",

Different from the conventional alignment models, we apply the graph convolutional network (GCN) to achieve more robust network embedding for the alignment task. In comparison with existing GCNs which cannot fully utilize multi-relation information, we propose a vectorized relational graph convolutional network (VR-GCN) to learn the embeddings of both graph entities and relations simultaneously for multi-relational networks. The role discrimination and translation property of knowledge graphs are adopted in the convolutional process. Thereafter, AVR-GCN, the alignment framework based on VR-GCN, is developed for multi-relational network alignment tasks. Anchors are used to supervise the objective function which aims at minimizing the distances between anchors, and to generate new cross-network triplets to build a bridge between different knowledge graphs at the level of triplet to improve the performance of alignment. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed solutions outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of network embedding, entity alignment, and relation alignment.",

However, the convolution operation is not applicable when the input data is supported on an irregular graph such as with social networks, citation networks, or knowledge graphs. This paper proposes the topology adaptive graph convolutional network (TAGCN), a novel graph convolutional network that generalizes CNN architectures to graph-structured data and provides a systematic way to design a set of fixed-size learnable filters to perform convolutions on graphs. The topologies of these filters are adaptive to the topology of the graph when they scan the graph to perform convolution, replacing the square filter for the grid-structured data in traditional CNNs. The outputs are the weighted sum of these filters\u2019 outputs, extraction of both vertex features and strength of correlation between vertices. It can be used with both directed and undirected graphs. The proposed TAGCN not only inherits the properties of convolutions in CNN for grid-structured data, but it is also consistent with convolution as defined in graph signal processing. Further, as no approximation to the convolution is needed, TAGCN exhibits better performance than existing graph-convolution-approximation methods on a number of data sets. As only the polynomials of degree two of the adjacency matrix are used, TAGCN is also computationally simpler than other recent methods.",

            "abstract": "The success of knowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia and the advances in automatic information extraction from textual and Web sources have made it possible to build large \"knowledge repositories\" such as DBpedia, Freebase, and YAGO. These collections can be viewed as graphs of entities and relationships (ER graphs) and can be represented as a set of subject-property-object (SPO) triples in the Semantic-Web data model RDF. Queries can be expressed in the W3C-endorsed SPARQL language or by similarly designed graph-pattern search. However, exact-match query semantics often fall short of satisfying the users' needs by returning too many or too few results. Therefore, IR-style ranking models are crucially needed. In this paper, we propose a language-model-based approach to ranking the results of exact, relaxed and keyword-augmented graph pattern queries over RDF graphs such as ER graphs. Our method estimates a query model and a set of result-graph models and ranks results based on their Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the query model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our ranking model by a comprehensive user study.",

            "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in many applications. However, their robustness against adversarial attacks is criticized. Prior studies show that using unnoticeable modifications on graph topology or nodal features can significantly reduce the performances of GNNs. It is very challenging to design robust graph neural networks against poisoning attack and several efforts have been taken. Existing work aims at reducing the negative impact from adversarial edges only with the poisoned graph, which is sub-optimal since they fail to discriminate adversarial edges from normal ones. On the other hand, clean graphs from similar domains as the target poisoned graph are usually available in the real world. By perturbing these clean graphs, we create supervised knowledge to train the ability to detect adversarial edges so that the robustness of GNNs is elevated. However, such potential for clean graphs is neglected by existing work. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of improving the robustness of GNNs against poisoning attacks by exploring clean graphs. Specifically, we propose PA-GNN, which relies on a penalized aggregation mechanism that directly restrict the negative impact of adversarial edges by assigning them lower attention coefficients. To optimize PA-GNN for a poisoned graph, we design a meta-optimization algorithm that trains PA-GNN to penalize perturbations using clean graphs and their adversarial counterparts, and transfers such ability to improve the robustness of PA-GNN on the poisoned graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of PA-GNN against poisoning attacks on graphs.",

We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees.",

A query is simply a list of keywords and does not require any schema or query language knowledge for its formulation. XKeyword is built on a relational database and, hence, can accommodate very large graphs. Query evaluation is optimized by using the graph's schema. In particular, XKeyword consists of two stages. In the preprocessing stage a set of keyword indices are built along with indexed path relations that describe particular patterns of paths in the graph. In the query processing stage plans are developed that use a near optimal set of path relations to efficiently locate the keyword query results. The results are presented graphically using the novel idea of interactive result graphs, which are populated on-demand according to the user's navigation and allow efficient information discovery. We provide theoretical and experimental points for the selection of the appropriate set of precomputed path relations. We also propose and experimentally evaluate algorithms to minimize the number of queries sent to the database to output the top-K results.",

Previous models based on event pairs or event chains cannot make full use of dense event connections, which may limit their capability of event prediction. To remedy this, we propose constructing an event graph to better utilize the event network information for script event prediction. In particular, we first extract narrative event chains from large quantities of news corpus, and then construct a narrative event evolutionary graph (NEEG) based on the extracted chains. NEEG can be seen as a knowledge base that describes event evolutionary principles and patterns. To solve the inference problem on NEEG, we present a scaled graph neural network (SGNN) to model event interactions and learn better event representations. Instead of computing the representations on the whole graph, SGNN processes only the concerned nodes each time, which makes our model feasible to large-scale graphs. By comparing the similarity between input context event representations and candidate event representations, we can choose the most reasonable subsequent event. Experimental results on widely used New York Times corpus demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, by using standard multiple choice narrative cloze evaluation.",

            "abstract": "\u2014Given a real world graph, how should we layout its edges? How can we compress it? These questions are closely related, and the typical approach so far is to find clique-like communities, like the 'cavemen graph', and compress them. We show that the block-diagonal mental image of the 'cavemen graph' is the wrong paradigm, in full agreement with earlier results that real world graphs have no good cuts. Instead, we propose to envision graphs as a collection of hubs connecting spokes, with super-hubs connecting the hubs, and so on, recursively. Based on the idea, we propose the SLASHBURN method to recursively split a graph into hubs and spokes connected only by the hubs. We also propose techniques to select the hubs and give an ordering to the spokes, in addition to the basic SLASHBURN. We give theoretical analysis of the proposed hub selection methods. Our view point has several advantages: (a) it avoids the 'no good cuts' problem, (b) it gives better compression, and (c) it leads to faster execution times for matrix-vector operations, which are the backbone of most graph processing tools. Through experiments, we show that SLASHBURN consistently outperforms other methods for all datasets, resulting in better compression and faster running time. Moreover, we show that SLASHBURN with the appropriate spokes ordering can further improve compression while hardly sacrificing the running time.",

            "abstract": "Comparison among graphs is ubiquitous in graph analytics. However, it is a hard task in terms of the expressiveness of the employed similarity measure and the efficiency of its computation. Ideally, graph comparison should be invariant to the order of nodes and the sizes of compared graphs, adaptive to the scale of graph patterns, and scalable. Unfortunately, these properties have not been addressed together. Graph comparisons still rely on direct approaches, graph kernels, or representation-based methods, which are all inefficient and impractical for large graph collections. In this paper, we propose the Network Laplacian Spectral Descriptor (NetLSD): the first, to our knowledge, permutation- and size-invariant, scale-adaptive, and efficiently computable graph representation method that allows for straightforward comparisons of large graphs. NetLSD extracts a compact signature that inherits the formal properties of the Laplacian spectrum, specifically its heat or wave kernel; thus, it \\em hears the shape of a graph. Our evaluation on a variety of real-world graphs demonstrates that it outperforms previous works in both expressiveness and efficiency.",

            "abstract": "How to proper encode high-order object relation in the detection system without any external knowledge? How to leverage the information between co-occurrence and locations of objects for better reasoning? These questions are key challenges towards large-scale object detection system that aims to recognize thousands of objects entangled with complex spatial and semantic relationships nowadays. Distilling key relations that may affect object recognition is crucially important since treating each region separately leads to a big performance drop when facing heavy long-tail data distributions and plenty of confusing categories. Recent works try to encode relation by constructing graphs, e.g. using handcraft linguistic knowledge between classes or implicitly learning a fully-connected graph between regions. However, the handcraft linguistic knowledge cannot be individualized for each image due to the semantic gap between linguistic and visual context while the fully-connected graph is inefficient and noisy by incorporating redundant and distracted relations/edges from irrelevant objects and backgrounds. In this work, we introduce a Spatial-aware Graph Relation Network (SGRN) to adaptive discover and incorporate key semantic and spatial relationships for reasoning over each object. Our method considers the relative location layouts and interactions among which can be easily injected into any detection pipelines to boost the performance. Specifically, our SGRN integrates a graph learner module for learning a interpatable sparse graph structure to encode relevant contextual regions and a spatial graph reasoning module with learnable spatial Gaussian kernels to perform graph inference with spatial awareness. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method, e.g. achieving around 32% improvement on VG(3000 classes) and 28% on ADE in terms of mAP.",

We focus on data which came from questionnaires and interviews which gives evidence of the mobilisation of several kinds of knowledge and experiences, in the interpretation of media statistical graphs. The discussion of results might contribute to an understanding of the complexity of the interpretation of such graphs, and to the development of pedagogical strategies which can help teachers think about the teaching and learning of statistics in ways that will support the balance of these kinds of knowledge.",

Our algorithm is based on an integer programming formulation for directed graphs and comprises preprocessing, separation algorithms, and primal heuristics. We are able to solve nearly all problem instances discussed in the literature to optimality, including one problem that\u2014to our knowledge\u2014has not yet been solved. We also report on our computational experiences with some very large Steiner tree problems arising from the design of electronic circuits. All test problems are gathered in a newly introduced library called SteinLib that is accessible via the World Wide Web. \u00a9 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Networks 32: 207\u2013232, 1998",

Fourth graders (n = 204) and seventh graders (n = 185) were given a prior-knowledge inventory, a graph test, and the SRA Reading and Mathematics Achievement Tests during four testing sessions. The unique predictors of graph comprehension for Grade 4 included reading achievement, mathematics achievement, and prior knowledge of the topic, mathematical content, and form of the graph. The unique predictors for Grade 7 were the same except that prior knowledge of topic and graphical form were not included. The results suggest that children should be involved in graphing activities to build and expand relevant schemata needed for comprehension.",
