            "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.",

            "abstract": "We propose a generalization of transformer neural network architecture for arbitrary graphs. The original transformer was designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), which operates on fully connected graphs representing all connections between the words in a sequence. Such architecture does not leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias, and can perform poorly when the graph topology is important and has not been encoded into the node features. We introduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard model. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood connectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is represented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the sinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP. Third, the layer normalization is replaced by a batch normalization layer, which provides faster training and better generalization performance. Finally, the architecture is extended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a. chemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge graphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph transformer architecture. This work closes the gap between the original transformer, which was designed for the limited case of line graphs, and graph neural networks, that can work with arbitrary graphs. As our architecture is simple and generic, we believe it can be used as a black box for future applications that wish to consider transformer and graphs.",

Recent works show that a knowledge graph (KG) can complement text data, offering structured background knowledge that provides a useful scaffold for reasoning. However, these works are not pretrained to learn a deep fusion of the two modalities at scale, limiting the potential to acquire fully joint representations of text and KG. Here we propose DRAGON (Deep Bidirectional Language-Knowledge Graph Pretraining), a self-supervised approach to pretraining a deeply joint language-knowledge foundation model from text and KG at scale. Specifically, our model takes pairs of text segments and relevant KG subgraphs as input and bidirectionally fuses information from both modalities. We pretrain this model by unifying two self-supervised reasoning tasks, masked language modeling and KG link prediction. DRAGON outperforms existing LM and LM+KG models on diverse downstream tasks including question answering across general and biomedical domains, with +5% absolute gain on average. In particular, DRAGON achieves notable performance on complex reasoning about language and knowledge (+10% on questions involving long contexts or multi-step reasoning) and low-resource QA (+8% on OBQA and RiddleSense), and new state-of-the-art results on various BioNLP tasks.

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) plays an increasingly important role in recommender systems. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) based model has gradually become the theme of knowledge-aware recommendation (KGR). However, there is a natural deficiency for GNN-based KGR models, that is, the sparse supervised signal problem, which may make their actual performance drop to some extent. Inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in mining supervised signals from data itself, in this paper, we focus on exploring the contrastive learning in KG-aware recommendation and propose a novel multi-level cross-view contrastive learning mechanism, named MCCLK. Different from traditional contrastive learning methods which generate two graph views by uniform data augmentation schemes such as corruption or dropping, we comprehensively consider three different graph views for KG-aware recommendation, including global-level structural view, local-level collaborative and semantic views. Specifically, we consider the user-item graph as a collaborative view, the item-entity graph as a semantic view, and the user-item-entity graph as a structural view. MCCLK hence performs contrastive learning across three views on both local and global levels, mining comprehensive graph feature and structure information in a self-supervised manner. Besides, in semantic view, a k-Nearest-Neighbor (k NN) item-item semantic graph construction module is proposed, to capture the important item-item semantic relation which is usually ignored by previous work. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) plays an increasingly important role in recommender systems. A recent technical trend is to develop end-to-end models founded on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNN-based models are coarse-grained in relational modeling, failing to (1) identify user-item relation at a fine-grained level of intents, and (2) exploit relation dependencies to preserve the semantics of long-range connectivity. In this study, we explore intents behind a user-item interaction by using auxiliary item knowledge, and propose a new model, Knowledge Graph-based Intent Network (KGIN). Technically, we model each intent as an attentive combination of KG relations, encouraging the independence of different intents for better model capability and interpretability. Furthermore, we devise a new information aggregation scheme for GNN, which recursively integrates the relation sequences of long-range connectivity (i.e., relational paths). This scheme allows us to distill useful information about user intents and encode them into the representations of users and items. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that, KGIN achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods like KGAT [41], KGNN-LS [38], and CKAN [47]. Further analyses show that KGIN offers interpretable explanations for predictions by identifying influential intents and relational paths.

The topological structures of real-world KGs, however, are rather heterogeneous, i.e., a KG is composed of multiple distinct hierarchies and non-hierarchical graph structures. Therefore, a homogeneous (either Euclidean or hyperbolic) geometry is not sufficient for fairly representing such heterogeneous structures. To capture the topological heterogeneity of KGs, we present an ultrahyperbolic KG embedding (UltraE) in an ultrahyperbolic (or pseudo-Riemannian) manifold that seamlessly interleaves hyperbolic and spherical manifolds. In particular, we model each relation as a pseudo-orthogonal transformation that preserves the pseudo-Riemannian bilinear form. The pseudo-orthogonal transformation is decomposed into various operators (i.e., circular rotations, reflections and hyperbolic rotations), allowing for simultaneously modeling heterogeneous structures as well as complex relational patterns. Experimental results on three standard KGs show that UltraE outperforms previous Euclidean, hyperbolic, and mixed-curvature KG embedding approaches.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning that predicts missing facts for incomplete KGs has been widely explored. However, reasoning over Temporal KG (TKG) that predicts facts in the future is still far from resolved. The key to predict future facts is to thoroughly understand the historical facts. A TKG is actually a sequence of KGs corresponding to different timestamps, where all concurrent facts in each KG exhibit structural dependencies and temporally adjacent facts carry informative sequential patterns. To capture these properties effectively and efficiently, we propose a novel Recurrent Evolution network based on Graph Convolution Network (GCN), called RE-GCN, which learns the evolutional representations of entities and relations at each timestamp by modeling the KG sequence recurrently. Specifically, for the evolution unit, a relation-aware GCN is leveraged to capture the structural dependencies within the KG at each timestamp. In order to capture the sequential patterns of all facts in parallel, the historical KG sequence is modeled auto-regressively by the gate recurrent components. Moreover, the static properties of entities, such as entity types, are also incorporated via a static graph constraint component to obtain better entity representations. Fact prediction at future timestamps can then be realized based on the evolutional entity and relation representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RE-GCN model obtains substantial performance and efficiency improvement for the temporal reasoning tasks on six benchmark datasets. Especially, it achieves up to 11.46% improvement in MRR for entity prediction with up to 82 times speedup compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.",

Graph neural networks (GNNs), as an effective graph representation technique, have shown impressive performance in learning graph embedding. However, KGs have an intrinsic property of heterogeneity, which contains various types of entities and relations. How to address complex graph data and aggregate multiple types of semantic information simultaneously is a critical issue. In this article, a novel heterogeneous GNNs framework based on attention mechanism is proposed. Specifically, the neighbor features of an entity are first aggregated under each relation-path. Then the importance of different relation-paths is learned through the relation features. Finally, each relation-path-based features with the learned weight values are aggregated to generate the embedding representation. Thus, the proposed method not only aggregates entity features from different semantic aspects but also allocates appropriate weights to them. This method can capture various types of semantic information and selectively aggregate informative features. The experiment results on three real-world KGs demonstrate superior performance when compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Accurate user and item embedding learning is crucial for modern recommender systems. However, most existing recommendation techniques have thus far focused on modeling users' preferences over singular type of user-item interactions. Many practical recommendation scenarios involve multi-typed user interactive behaviors (e.g., page view, add-to-favorite and purchase), which presents unique challenges that cannot be handled by current recommendation solutions. In particular: i) complex inter-dependencies across different types of user behaviors; ii) the incorporation of knowledge-aware item relations into the multi-behavior recommendation framework; iii) dynamic characteristics of multi-typed user-item interactions. To tackle these challenges, this work proposes a Knowledge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph Transformer Network (KHGT), to investigate multi-typed interactive patterns between users and items in recommender systems. Specifically, KHGT is build upon a graph-structured neural architecture to i) capture type-specific behavior semantics; ii) explicitly discriminate which types of user-item interactions are more important in assisting the forecasting task on the target behavior. Additionally, we further integrate the multi-modal graph attention layer with temporal encoding strategy, to empower the learned embeddings be reflective of both dedicated multiplex user-item and item-item collaborative relations, as well as the underlying interaction dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that KHGT consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art recommendation methods across various evaluation settings.

            "abstract": "Social recommendation task aims to predict users' preferences over items with the incorporation of social connections among users, so as to alleviate the sparse issue of collaborative filtering. While many recent efforts show the effectiveness of neural network-based social recommender systems, several important challenges have not been well addressed yet: (i) The majority of models only consider users\u2019 social connections, while ignoring the inter-dependent knowledge across items; (ii) Most of existing solutions are designed for singular type of user-item interactions, making them infeasible to capture the interaction heterogeneity; (iii) The dynamic nature of user-item interactions has been less explored in many social-aware recommendation techniques. To tackle the above challenges, this work proposes a Knowledge-aware Coupled Graph Neural Network (KCGN) that jointly injects the inter-dependent knowledge across items and users into the recommendation framework. KCGN enables the high-order user- and item-wise relation encoding by exploiting the mutual information for global graph structure awareness. Additionally, we further augment KCGN with the capability of capturing dynamic multi-typed user-item interactive patterns. Experimental studies on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our method against many strong baselines in a variety of settings.

            "abstract": "To provide more accurate, diverse, and explainable recommendation, it is compulsory to go beyond modeling user-item interactions and take side information into account. Traditional methods like factorization machine (FM) cast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an independent instance with side information encoded. Due to the overlook of the relations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an actor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the collaborative signal from the collective behaviors of users. In this work, we investigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the independent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We argue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order relations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes --- are an essential factor for successful recommendation. We propose a new method named Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) which explicitly models the high-order connectivities in KG in an end-to-end fashion. It recursively propagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors (which can be users, items, or attributes) to refine the node's embedding, and employs an attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of the neighbors. Our KGAT is conceptually advantageous to existing KG-based recommendation methods, which either exploit high-order relations by extracting paths or implicitly modeling them with regularization. Empirical results on three public benchmarks show that KGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Neural FM and RippleNet. Further studies verify the efficacy of embedding propagation for high-order relation modeling and the interpretability benefits brought by the attention mechanism.

KGs often exhibit hierarchical and logical patterns which must be preserved in the embedding space. For hierarchical data, hyperbolic embedding methods have shown promise for high-fidelity and parsimonious representations. However, existing hyperbolic embedding methods do not account for the rich logical patterns in KGs. In this work, we introduce a class of hyperbolic KG embedding models that simultaneously capture hierarchical and logical patterns. Our approach combines hyperbolic reflections and rotations with attention to model complex relational patterns. Experimental results on standard KG benchmarks show that our method improves over previous Euclidean- and hyperbolic-based efforts by up to 6.1% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) in low dimensions. Furthermore, we observe that different geometric transformations capture different types of relations while attention- based transformations generalize to multiple relations. In high dimensions, our approach yields new state-of-the-art MRRs of 49.6% on WN18RR and 57.7% on YAGO3-10.",

Our idea is based on the observation that the vast majority of the related work only models the relation as a single geometric operation such as translation or rotation, which limits the representation power of the underlying models and makes it harder to match the complicated relations existed in real-world datasets. To embrace a richer set of relational information, we propose a new method called dual quaternion knowledge graph embedding (DualE), which introduces dual quaternions into knowledge graph embeddings. Specifically, a dual quaternion behaves like a \u201ccomplex quaternion\u201d with its real and imaginary part all being quaternary. The core of DualE lies a specific design of dual-quaternion-based multiplication, which universally models relations as the compositions of a series of translation and rotation operations. The major merits of DualE are three-fold:1) it is the first unified framework embracing both rotation based and translation-based models, 2) it expands the embedding space to the dual quaternion space with a more intuitive physical and geometric interpretation, 3) it satisfies the key patterns and the multiple relations pattern of relational representation learning. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DualE method.",

            "abstract": "Smart contract vulnerability detection draws extensive attention in recent years due to the substantial losses caused by hacker attacks. Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which are labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by crafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. To highlight the critical nodes in the graph, we further design a node elimination phase to normalize the graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network to extract the graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with designed expert patterns to yield a final detection system. Extensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source code in Ethereum and VNT Chain platforms. Empirical results show significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on three types of vulnerabilities, where the detection accuracy of our method reaches 89.15, 89.02, and 83.21 percent for reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and infinite loop vulnerabilities, respectively.",

Most existing methods rely heavily on linguistic and semantic features from the news content, and fail to effectively exploit external knowledge which could help determine whether the news document is trusted. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph neural model called CompareNet, which compares the news to the knowledge base (KB) through entities for fake news detection. Considering that fake news detection is correlated with topics, we also incorporate topics to enrich the news representation. Specifically, we first construct a directed heterogeneous document graph for each news incorporating topics and entities. Based on the graph, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network for learning the topic-enriched news representation as well as the contextual entity representations that encode the semantics of the news content. The contextual entity representations are then compared to the corresponding KB-based entity representations through a carefully designed entity comparison network, to capture the consistency between the news content and KB. Finally, the topic-enriched news representation combining the entity comparison features is fed into a fake news classifier. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompareNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

We strive to train a multi-talented student GNN, without accessing human annotations, that \u201camalgamates\u201d knowledge from a couple of teacher GNNs with heterogeneous architectures and handling distinct tasks. The student derived in this way is expected to integrate the expertise from both teachers while maintaining a compact architecture. To this end, we propose an innovative approach to train a slimmable GNN that enables learning from teachers with varying feature dimensions. Meanwhile, to explicitly align topological semantics between the student and teachers, we introduce a topological attribution map (TAM) to highlight the structural saliency in a graph, based on which the student imitates the teachers\u2019 ways of aggregating information from neighbors. Experiments on seven datasets across various tasks, including multi-label classification and joint segmentation-classification, demonstrate that the learned student, with a lightweight architecture, achieves gratifying results on par with and sometimes even superior to those of the teachers in their specializations.

Although numerous efforts have been made toward more personalized recommendations, recommender systems still suffer from several challenges, such as data sparsity and cold-start problems. In recent years, generating recommendations with the knowledge graph as side information has attracted considerable interest. Such an approach can not only alleviate the above mentioned issues for a more accurate recommendation, but also provide explanations for recommended items. In this paper, we conduct a systematical survey of knowledge graph-based recommender systems. We collect recently published papers in this field, and group them into three categories, i.e., embedding-based methods, connection-based methods, and propagation-based methods. Also, we further subdivide each category according to the characteristics of these approaches. Moreover, we investigate the proposed algorithms by focusing on how the papers utilize the knowledge graph for accurate and explainable recommendation. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.",

Most existing methods focus on reasoning at past timestamps to complete the missing facts, and there are only a few works of reasoning on known TKGs to forecast future facts. Compared with the completion task, the forecasting task is more difficult that faces two main challenges: (1) how to effectively model the time information to handle future timestamps? (2) how to make inductive inference to handle previously unseen entities that emerge over time? To address these challenges, we propose the first reinforcement learning method for forecasting. Specifically, the agent travels on historical knowledge graph snapshots to search for the answer. Our method defines a relative time encoding function to capture the timespan information, and we design a novel time-shaped reward based on Dirichlet distribution to guide the model learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel representation method for unseen entities to improve the inductive inference ability of the model. We evaluate our method for this link prediction task at future timestamps. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvement meanwhile with higher explainability, less calculation, and fewer parameters when compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.",

First, we construct an exemplar relation graph to represent the knowledge learned by the original network and update gradually for new tasks learning. Then an exemplar relation loss function for discovering the relation knowledge between\ndifferent classes is introduced to learn and transfer the structural information in relation graph. A large number of experiments demonstrate that relation knowledge does exist in the exemplars and our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art class-incremental learning methods on the CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200 datasets.",

To properly represent molecules, graph contrastive learning is a promising paradigm as it utilizes self-supervision signals and has no requirements for human annotations. However, prior works fail to incorporate fundamental domain knowledge into graph semantics and thus ignore the correlations between atoms that have common attributes but are not directly connected by bonds. To address these issues, we construct a Chemical Element Knowledge Graph (KG) to summarize microscopic associations between elements and propose a novel Knowledge-enhanced Contrastive Learning (KCL) framework for molecular representation learning. KCL framework consists of three modules. The first module, knowledge-guided graph augmentation, augments the original molecular graph based on the Chemical Element KG. The second module, knowledge-aware graph representation, extracts molecular representations with a common graph encoder for the original molecular graph and a Knowledge-aware Message Passing Neural Network (KMPNN) to encode complex information in the augmented molecular graph. The final module is a contrastive objective, where we maximize agreement between these two views of molecular graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrated that KCL obtained superior performances against state-of-the-art baselines on eight molecular datasets. Visualization experiments properly interpret what KCL has learned from atoms and attributes in the augmented molecular graphs.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a teacher network to a student by enforcing the student to mimic the outputs of the pretrained teacher on training data. However, data samples are not always accessible in many cases due to large data sizes, privacy, or confidentiality. Many efforts have been made on addressing this problem for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose inputs lie in a grid domain within a continuous space such as images and videos, but largely overlook graph neural networks (GNNs) that handle non-grid data with different topology structures within a discrete space. The inherent differences between their inputs make these CNN-based approaches not applicable to GNNs. In this paper, we propose to our best knowledge the first dedicated approach to distilling knowledge from a GNN without graph data. The proposed graph-free KD (GFKD) learns graph topology structures for knowledge transfer by modeling them with multinomial distribution. We then introduce a gradient estimator to optimize this framework. Essentially, the gradients w.r.t. graph structures are obtained by only using GNN forward-propagation without back-propagation, which means that GFKD is compatible with modern GNN libraries such as DGL and Geometric. Moreover, we provide the strategies for handling different types of prior knowledge in the graph data or the GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFKD achieves the state-of-the-art performance for distilling knowledge from GNNs without training data.",

Existing approaches assume that KGs are static, despite the fact that almost every KG evolves over time. In this paper, we introduce the task of dynamic knowledge graph alignment, the main challenge of which is how to efficiently update entity embeddings for the evolving graph topology. Our key insight is to view the parameter matrix of GCN as a feature transformation operator and decouple the transformation process from the aggregation process. Based on that, we first propose a novel base algorithm (DINGAL-B) with topology-invariant mask gate and highway gate, which consistently outperforms 14 existing knowledge graph alignment methods in the static setting. More importantly, it naturally leads to two effective and efficient algorithms to align dynamic knowledge graph, including (1) DINGAL-O which leverages previous parameter matrices to update the embeddings of affected entities; and (2) DINGAL-U which resorts to newly obtained anchor links to fine-tune parameter matrices. Compared with their static counterpart (DINGAL-B), DINGAL-U and DINGAL-O are 10\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 faster respectively, with little alignment accuracy loss.",

The dynamic knowledge graph is implemented using technologies from the Semantic Web. It is composed of concepts and instances that are defined using ontologies, and of computational agents that operate on both the concepts and instances to update the dynamic knowledge graph. By construction, it is distributed, supports cross-domain interoperability, and ensures that data are connected, portable, discoverable, and queryable via a uniform interface. The knowledge graph includes the notions of a \u201cbase world\u201d that describes the real world and that is maintained by agents that incorporate real-time data, and of \u201cparallel worlds\u201d that support the intelligent exploration of alternative designs without affecting the base world. Use cases are presented that demonstrate the ability of the dynamic knowledge graph to host geospatial and chemical data, control chemistry experiments, perform cross-domain simulations, and perform scenario analysis. The questions of how to make intelligent suggestions for alternative scenarios and how to ensure alignment between the scenarios considered by the knowledge graph and the goals of society are considered. Work to extend the dynamic knowledge graph to develop a digital twin of the UK to support the decarbonization of the energy system is discussed. Important directions for future research are highlighted.",

These techniques can be used in a variety of applications such as completion of knowledge graph to predict missing information, recommender systems, question answering, query expansion, etc. The information embedded in Knowledge graph though being structured is challenging to consume in a real-world application. Knowledge graph embedding enables the real-world application to consume information to improve performance. Knowledge graph embedding is an active research area. Most of the embedding methods focus on structure-based information. Recent research has extended the boundary to include text-based information and image-based information in entity embedding. Efforts have been made to enhance the representation with context information. This paper introduces growth in the field of KG embedding from simple translation-based models to enrichment-based models. This paper includes the utility of the Knowledge graph in real-world applications.",

In general, the attributes are not isolated but connected with each other, which forms a knowledge graph (KG). In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), an end-to-end framework that captures inter-item relatedness effectively by mining their associated attributes on the KG. To automatically discover both high-order structure information and semantic information of the KG, we sample from the neighbors for each entity in the KG as their receptive field, then combine neighborhood information with bias when calculating the representation of a given entity. The receptive field can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity information and capture users' potential long-distance interests. Moreover, we implement the proposed KGCN in a minibatch fashion, which enables our model to operate on large datasets and KGs. We apply the proposed model to three datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation, and experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong recommender baselines.",

Due to the characteristics of large-scale, heterogeneous and diverse surveys and the loose organization of surveying and remote-sensing data, effectively obtaining information and knowledge from data can be difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of using ontology for heterogeneous data integration. Based on the heterogeneous, decentralized, and dynamic updates of large surveying and remote-sensing data, this paper constructs a knowledge graph for surveying and remote-sensing applications. First, data are extracted. Second, using the ontology editing tool Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a knowledge graph mode level is constructed. Then, using a relational database, data are stored, and a D2RQ tool maps the data from the mode level\u2019s ontology to the data layer. Then, using the D2RQ tool, a SPARQL protocol and resource description framework query language (SPARQL) endpoint service is used to describe functions such as query and reasoning of the knowledge graph. The graph database is then used to display the knowledge graph. Finally, the knowledge graph is used to describe the correlation between the fields of surveying and remote sensing.",

In order to solve this problem, a top-down approach is used to construct a knowledge graph of urban traffic system in this paper. First, the model layer of the knowledge graph was used to realize the reuse and sharing of knowledge. Furthermore, the model layer then was stored in the graph database Neo4j. Second, the representation learning based knowledge reasoning model was adopted to implement knowledge completion and improve the knowledge graph. Finally, the proposed method was validated with an urban traffic data set and the results showed that the model could be used to mine the implicit relationship between traffic entities and discover traffic knowledge effectively.",

This paper presents WorldKG - a new geographic knowledge graph aiming to provide a comprehensive semantic representation of geographic entities in OpenStreetMap. We describe the WorldKG knowledge graph, including its ontology that builds the semantic dataset backbone, the extraction procedure of the ontology and geographic entities from OpenStreetMap, and the methods to enhance entity annotation.

We present here a new version of the linked open data resource ConceptNet that is particularly well suited to be used with modern NLP techniques such as word embeddings. ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases of natural language with labeled edges. Its knowledge is collected from many sources that include expert-created resources, crowd-sourcing, and games with a purpose. It is designed to represent the general knowledge involved in understanding language, improving natural language applications by allowing the application to better understand the meanings behind the words people use. When ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired from distributional semantics (such as word2vec), it provides applications with understanding that they would not acquire from distributional semantics alone, nor from narrower resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. We demonstrate this with state-of-the-art results on intrinsic evaluations of word relatedness that translate into improvements on applications of word vectors, including solving SAT-style analogies.\n \n",

State-of-the-art methods generate captions using either scene-level or object-level information but without explicitly modeling object interactions. Thus, they often fail to make visually grounded predictions, and are sensitive to spurious correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph model for video captioning that exploits object interactions in space and time. Our model builds interpretable links and is able to provide explicit visual grounding. To avoid unstable performance caused by the variable number of objects, we further propose an object-aware knowledge distillation mechanism, in which local object information is used to regularize global scene features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on two benchmarks, showing our approach yields competitive performance with interpretable predictions.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities. In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings. Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH.\n \n",

            "abstract": "In this work, we move beyond the traditional complex-valued representations, introducing more expressive hypercomplex representations to model entities and relations for knowledge graph embeddings. More specifically, quaternion embeddings, hypercomplex-valued embeddings with three imaginary components, are utilized to represent entities. Relations are modelled as rotations in the quaternion space. The advantages of the proposed approach are: (1) Latent inter-dependencies (between all components) are aptly captured with Hamilton product, encouraging a more compact interaction between entities and relations; (2) Quaternions enable expressive rotation in four-dimensional space and have more degree of freedom than rotation in complex plane; (3) The proposed framework is a generalization of ComplEx on hypercomplex space while offering better geometrical interpretations, concurrently satisfying the key desiderata of relational representation learning (i.e., modeling symmetry, anti-symmetry and inversion). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four well-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks.",

However, since the distribution of real-world relationships is seriously unbalanced, existing methods perform quite poorly for the less frequent relationships. In this work, we find that the statistical correlations between object pairs and their relationships can effectively regularize semantic space and make prediction less ambiguous, and thus well address the unbalanced distribution issue. To achieve this, we incorporate these statistical correlations into deep neural networks to facilitate scene graph generation by developing a Knowledge-Embedded Routing Network. More specifically, we show that the statistical correlations between objects appearing in images and their relationships, can be explicitly represented by a structured knowledge graph, and a routing mechanism is learned to propagate messages through the graph to explore their interactions. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over current state-of-the-art competitors.",

            "abstract": "Automatic radiology report generation has been an attracting research problem towards computer-aided diagnosis to alleviate the workload of doctors in recent years. Deep learning techniques for natural image captioning are successfully adapted to generating radiology reports. However, radiology image reporting is different from the natural image captioning task in two aspects: 1) the accuracy of positive disease keyword mentions is critical in radiology image reporting in comparison to the equivalent importance of every single word in a natural image caption; 2) the evaluation of reporting quality should focus more on matching the disease keywords and their associated attributes instead of counting the occurrence of N-gram. Based on these concerns, we propose to utilize a pre-constructed graph embedding module (modeled with a graph convolutional neural network) on multiple disease findings to assist the generation of reports in this work. The incorporation of knowledge graph allows for dedicated feature learning for each disease finding and the relationship modeling between them. In addition, we proposed a new evaluation metric for radiology image reporting with the assistance of the same composed graph. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the methods integrated with the proposed graph embedding module on a publicly accessible dataset (IU-RR) of chest radiographs compared with previous approaches using both the conventional evaluation metrics commonly adopted for image captioning and our proposed ones.",

            "abstract": "Over two decades, context awareness has been incorporated into recommender systems in order to provide, not only the top-rated items to consumers but also the ones that are suitable to the user context. As a class of context-aware systems, context-aware service recommendation (CASR) aims to bind high-quality services to users, while taking into account their context requirements, including invocation time, location, social profiles, connectivity, and so on. However, current CASR approaches are not scalable with the huge amount of service data (QoS and context information, users reviews and feedbacks). In addition, they lack a rich representation of contextual information, as they adopt a simple matrix view. Moreover, current CASR approaches adopt the traditional user-service relation and they do not allow for multi-relational interactions between users and services in different contexts. To offer a scalable and context-sensitive service recommendation with great analysis and learning capabilities, we provide a rich and multi-relational representation of the CASR knowledge, based on the concept of knowledge graph. The constructed context-aware service knowledge graph (C-SKG) is, then, transformed into a low-dimensional vector space to facilitate its processing. For this purpose, we adopt Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks to propose a context-aware knowledge graph embedding, based on the principles of first-order and subgraph-aware proximity. Finally, a recommendation algorithm is defined to deliver the top-rated services according to the target user's context. Experiments have proved the accuracy and scalability of our solution, compared to state-of-the-art CASR approaches.",

It can benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion and relation extraction, and hence has quickly gained massive attention. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-the-arts but also those with latest trends. Particularly, we make the review based on the type of information used in the embedding task. Techniques that conduct embedding using only facts observed in the KG are first introduced. We describe the overall framework, specific model design, typical training procedures, as well as pros and cons of such techniques. After that, we discuss techniques that further incorporate additional information besides facts. We focus specifically on the use of entity types, relation paths, textual descriptions, and logical rules. Finally, we briefly introduce how KG embedding can be applied to and benefit a wide variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion, relation extraction, question answering, and so forth.",

            "abstract": "Incorporating knowledge graph (KG) into recommender system is promising in improving the recommendation accuracy and explainability. However, existing methods largely assume that a KG is complete and simply transfer the \u201dknowledge\u201d in KG at the shallow level of entity raw data or embeddings. This may lead to suboptimal performance, since a practical KG can hardly be complete, and it is common that a KG has missing facts, relations, and entities. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider the incomplete nature of KG when incorporating it into recommender system. In this paper, we jointly learn the model of recommendation and knowledge graph completion. Distinct from previous KG-based recommendation methods, we transfer the relation information in KG, so as to understand the reasons that a user likes an item. As an example, if a user has watched several movies directed by (relation) the same person (entity), we can infer that the director relation plays a critical role when the user makes the decision, thus help to understand the user's preference at a finer granularity. Technically, we contribute a new translation-based recommendation model, which specially accounts for various preferences in translating a user to an item, and then jointly train it with a KG completion model by combining several transfer schemes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods. Further analysis verifies the positive effect of joint training on both tasks of recommendation and KG completion, and the advantage of our model in understanding user preference.

A vast number of KGE techniques for multi-relational link prediction has been proposed in the recent literature, often with state-of-the-art performance. These approaches differ along a number of dimensions, including different model architectures, different training strategies, and different approaches to hyperparameter optimization. In this paper, we take a step back and aim to summarize and quantify empirically the impact of each of these dimensions on model performance. We report on the results of an extensive experimental study with popular model architectures and training strategies across a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We found that when trained appropriately, the relative performance differences between various model architectures often shrinks and sometimes even reverses when compared to prior results. For example, RESCAL, one of the first KGE models, showed strong performance when trained with state-of-the-art techniques; it was competitive to or outperformed more recent architectures. We also found that good (and often superior to prior studies) model configurations can be found by exploring relatively few random samples from a large hyperparameter space. Our results suggest that many of the more advanced architectures and techniques proposed in the literature should be revisited to reassess their individual benefits.",

            "abstract": "\n \n We deal with embedding a large scale knowledge graph composed of entities and relations into a continuous vector space. TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase. Experiments show TransH delivers significant improvements over TransE on predictive accuracy with comparable capability to scale up.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Question answering over knowledge graph (QA-KG) aims to use facts in the knowledge graph (KG) to answer natural language questions. It helps end users more efficiently and more easily access the substantial and valuable knowledge in the KG, without knowing its data structures. QA-KG is a nontrivial problem since capturing the semantic meaning of natural language is difficult for a machine. Meanwhile, many knowledge graph embedding methods have been proposed. The key idea is to represent each predicate/entity as a low-dimensional vector, such that the relation information in the KG could be preserved. The learned vectors could benefit various applications such as KG completion and recommender systems. In this paper, we explore to use them to handle the QA-KG problem. However, this remains a challenging task since a predicate could be expressed in different ways in natural language questions. Also, the ambiguity of entity names and partial names makes the number of possible answers large. To bridge the gap, we propose an effective Knowledge Embedding based Question Answering (KEQA) framework. We focus on answering the most common types of questions, i.e., simple questions, in which each question could be answered by the machine straightforwardly if its single head entity and single predicate are correctly identified. To answer a simple question, instead of inferring its head entity and predicate directly, KEQA targets at jointly recovering the question's head entity, predicate, and tail entity representations in the KG embedding spaces. Based on a carefully-designed joint distance metric, the three learned vectors' closest fact in the KG is returned as the answer. Experiments on a widely-adopted benchmark demonstrate that the proposed KEQA outperforms the state-of-the-art QA-KG methods.",

Most present works perform negative sampling from unobserved data to supply the training of recommender models with negative signals. Nevertheless, existing negative sampling strategies, either static or adaptive ones, are insufficient to yield high-quality negative samples \u2014 both informative to model training and reflective of user real needs. In this work, we hypothesize that item knowledge graph (KG), which provides rich relations among items and KG entities, could be useful to infer informative and factual negative samples. Towards this end, we develop a new negative sampling model, Knowledge Graph Policy Network (KGPolicy), which works as a reinforcement learning agent to explore high-quality negatives. Specifically, by conducting our designed exploration operations, it navigates from the target positive interaction, adaptively receives knowledge-aware negative signals, and ultimately yields a potential negative item to train the recommender. We tested on a matrix factorization (MF) model equipped with KGPolicy, and it achieves significant improvements over both state-of-the-art sampling methods like DNS [39] and IRGAN [30], and KG-enhanced recommender models like KGAT [32]. Further analyses from different angles provide insights of knowledge-aware sampling. We release the codes and datasets at https://github.com/xiangwang1223/kgpolicy.",

It is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Various neural encoder-decoder models have been proposed to achieve the goal by learning to map input text to output text. However, the input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate the desired output, so the performance of text generation is still far from satisfaction in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, researchers have considered incorporating (i) internal knowledge embedded in the input text and (ii) external knowledge from outside sources such as knowledge base and knowledge graph into the text generation system. This research topic is known as knowledge-enhanced text generation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the research on this topic over the past five years. The main content includes two parts: (i) general methods and architectures for integrating knowledge into text generation; (ii) specific techniques and applications according to different forms of knowledge data. This survey can have broad audiences, researchers and practitioners, in academia and industry.",

Most of existing computational models with AI techniques often concentrate on integrating multiple data sources and combining popular embedding methods together. Yet, researchers pay less attention to the potential correlations between drug and other entities such as targets and genes. Moreover, recent studies also adopted knowledge graph (KG) for DDI prediction. Yet, this line of methods learn node latent embedding directly, but they are limited in obtaining the rich neighborhood information of each entity in the KG. To address the above limitations, we propose an end-to-end framework, called Knowledge Graph Neural Network (KGNN), to resolve the DDI prediction. Our framework can effectively capture drug and its potential neighborhoods by mining their associated relations in KG. To extract both high-order structures and semantic relations of the KG, we learn from the neighborhoods for each entity in the KG as their local receptive, and then integrate neighborhood information with bias from representation of the current entity. This way, the receptive field can be naturally extended to multiple hops away to model high-order topological information and to obtain drugs potential long-distance correlations. We have implemented our method and conducted experiments based on several widely-used datasets. Empirical results show that KGNN outperforms the classic and state-of-the-art models.",

            "abstract": "A knowledge graph (KG), also known as a knowledge base, is a particular kind of network structure in which the node indicates entity and the edge represent relation. However, with the explosion of network volume, the problem of data sparsity that causes large-scale KG systems to calculate and manage difficultly has become more significant. For alleviating the issue, knowledge graph embedding is proposed to embed entities and relations in a KG to a low-, dense and continuous feature space, and endow the yield model with abilities of knowledge inference and fusion. In recent years, many researchers have poured much attention in this approach, and we will systematically introduce the existing state-of-the-art approaches and a variety of applications that benefit from these methods in this paper. In addition, we discuss future prospects for the development of techniques and application trends. Specifically, we first introduce the embedding models that only leverage the information of observed triplets in the KG. We illustrate the overall framework and specific idea and compare the advantages and disadvantages of such approaches. Next, we introduce the advanced models that utilize additional semantic information to improve the performance of the original methods. We divide the additional information into two categories, including textual descriptions and relation paths. The extension approaches in each category are described, following the same classification criteria as those defined for the triplet fact-based models. We then describe two experiments for comparing the performance of listed methods and mention some broader domain tasks such as question answering, recommender systems, and so forth. Finally, we collect several hurdles that need to be overcome and provide a few future research directions for knowledge graph embedding.",

Against this trend, we propose an approach called AnyBURL that is rooted in the symbolic space. Its core algorithm is based on sampling paths, which are generalized into Horn rules. Previously published results show that the prediction quality of AnyBURL is on the same level as current state of the art with the additional benefit of offering an explanation for the predicted fact. In this paper, we are concerned with two extensions of AnyBURL. Firstly, we change AnyBURLs interpretation of rules from $\\Theta$-subsumption into $\\Theta$-subsumption under Object Identity. Secondly, we introduce reinforcement learning to better guide the sampling process. We found out that reinforcement learning helps finding more valuable rules earlier in the search process. We measure the impact of both extensions and compare the resulting approach with current state of the art approaches. Our results show that AnyBURL outperforms most sub-symbolic methods.",

In this work we study open-domain knowledge, the setting when the knowledge required to answer a question is not given/annotated, neither at training nor test time. We tap into two types of knowledge representations and reasoning. First, implicit knowledge which can be learned effectively from unsupervised language pretraining and supervised training data with transformer-based models. Second, explicit, symbolic knowledge encoded in knowledge bases. Our approach combines both\u2014exploiting the powerful implicit reasoning of transformer models for answer prediction, and integrating symbolic representations from a knowledge graph, while never losing their explicit semantics to an implicit embedding. We combine diverse sources of knowledge to cover the wide variety of knowledge needed to solve knowledge-based questions. We show our approach, KRISP (Knowledge Reasoning with Implicit and Symbolic rePresentations), significantly out-performs state-of-the-art on OK-VQA, the largest available dataset for open-domain knowledge-based VQA. We show with extensive ablations that while our model successfully exploits implicit knowledge reasoning, the symbolic answer module which explicitly connects the knowledge graph to the answer vocabulary is critical to the performance of our method and generalizes to rare answers.1",

This paper considers the knowledge graph as the source of side information. To address the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based methods for knowledge-graph-aware recommendation, we propose RippleNet, an end-to-end framework that naturally incorporates the knowledge graph into recommender systems. Similar to actual ripples propagating on the water, RippleNet stimulates the propagation of user preferences over the set of knowledge entities by automatically and iteratively extending a user's potential interests along links in the knowledge graph. The multiple \"ripples\" activated by a user's historically clicked items are thus superposed to form the preference distribution of the user with respect to a candidate item, which could be used for predicting the final clicking probability. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that RippleNet achieves substantial gains in a variety of scenarios, including movie, book and news recommendation, over several state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Online news recommender systems aim to address the information explosion of news and make personalized recommendation for users. In general, news language is highly condensed, full of knowledge entities and common sense. However, existing methods are unaware of such external knowledge and cannot fully discover latent knowledge-level connections among news. The recommended results for a user are consequently limited to simple patterns and cannot be extended reasonably. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we propose a deep knowledge-aware network (DKN) that incorporates knowledge graph representation into news recommendation. DKN is a content-based deep recommendation framework for click-through rate prediction. The key component of DKN is a multi-channel and word-entity-aligned knowledge-aware convolutional neural network (KCNN) that fuses semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news. KCNN treats words and entities as multiple channels, and explicitly keeps their alignment relationship during convolution. In addition, to address users\u00bb diverse interests, we also design an attention module in DKN to dynamically aggregate a user\u00bbs history with respect to current candidate news. Through extensive experiments on a real online news platform, we demonstrate that DKN achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art deep recommendation models. We also validate the efficacy of the usage of knowledge in DKN.",

Even the state-of-the-art pre-trained language generation models struggle at this task and often produce implausible and anomalous sentences. One reason is that they rarely consider incorporating the knowledge graph which can provide rich relational information among the commonsense concepts. To promote the ability of commonsense reasoning for text generation, we propose a novel knowledge graph augmented pre-trained language generation model KG-BART, which encompasses the complex relations of concepts through the knowledge graph and produces more logical and natural sentences as output. Moreover, KG-BART can leverage the graph attention to aggregate the rich concept semantics that enhances the model generalization on unseen concept sets. Experiments on benchmark CommonGen dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach by comparing with several strong pre-trained language generation models, particularly KG-BART outperforms BART by 5.80, 4.60, in terms of BLEU-3, 4. Moreover, we also show that the generated context by our model can work as background scenarios to benefit downstream commonsense QA tasks.",

We argue that, to address these issues, the summarizer should acquire semantic interpretation over input, e.g., via structured representation, to allow the generation of more informative summaries. In this paper, we present ASGARD, a novel framework for Abstractive Summarization with Graph-Augmentation and semantic-driven RewarD. We propose the use of dual encoders\u2014a sequential document encoder and a graph-structured encoder\u2014to maintain the global context and local characteristics of entities, complementing each other. We further design a reward based on a multiple choice cloze test to drive the model to better capture entity interactions. Results show that our models produce significantly higher ROUGE scores than a variant without knowledge graph as input on both New York Times and CNN/Daily Mail datasets. We also obtain better or comparable performance compared to systems that are fine-tuned from large pretrained language models. Human judges further rate our model outputs as more informative and containing fewer unfaithful errors.",

            "abstract": "To provide accurate and explainable misinformation detection, it is often useful to take an auxiliary source (e.g., social context and knowledge base) into consideration. Existing methods use social contexts such as users' engagements as complementary information to improve detection performance and derive explanations. However, due to the lack of sufficient professional knowledge, users seldom respond to healthcare information, which makes these methods less applicable. In this work, to address these shortcomings, we propose a novel knowledge guided graph attention network for detecting health misinformation better. Our proposal, named as DETERRENT, leverages on the additional information from medical knowledge graph by propagating information along with the network, incorporates a Medical Knowledge Graph and an Article-Entity Bipartite Graph, and propagates the node embeddings through Knowledge Paths. In addition, an attention mechanism is applied to calculate the importance of entities to each article, and the knowledge guided article embeddings are used for misinformation detection. DETERRENT addresses the limitation on social contexts in the healthcare domain and is capable of providing useful explanations for the results of detection. Empirical validation using two real-world datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of DETERRENT. Comparing with the best results of eight competing methods, in terms of F1 Score, DETERRENT outperforms all methods by at least 4.78% on the diabetes dataset and 12.79% on cancer dataset. We release the source code of DETERRENT at: https://github.com/cuilimeng/DETERRENT.",

            "abstract": "Recognizing multiple labels of an image is a practical yet challenging task, and remarkable progress has been achieved by searching for semantic regions and exploiting label dependencies. However, current works utilize RNN/LSTM to implicitly capture sequential region/label dependencies, which cannot fully explore mutual interactions among the semantic regions/labels and do not explicitly integrate label co-occurrences. In addition, these works require large amounts of training samples for each category, and they are unable to generalize to novel categories with limited samples. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge-guided graph routing (KGGR) framework, which unifies prior knowledge of statistical label correlations with deep neural networks. The framework exploits prior knowledge to guide adaptive information propagation among different categories to facilitate multi-label analysis and reduce the dependency of training samples. Specifically, it first builds a structured knowledge graph to correlate different labels based on statistical label co-occurrence. Then, it introduces the label semantics to guide learning semantic-specific features to initialize the graph, and it exploits a graph propagation network to explore graph node interactions, enabling learning contextualized image feature representations. Moreover, we initialize each graph node with the classifier weights for the corresponding label and apply another propagation network to transfer node messages through the graph. In this way, it can facilitate exploiting the information of correlated labels to help train better classifiers, especially for labels with limited training samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the traditional multi-label image recognition (MLR) and multi-label few-shot learning (ML-FSL) tasks and show that our KGGR framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by sizable margins on the public benchmarks.",

To deal with the dynamic user preference and optimize accumulative utilities, researchers have introduced reinforcement learning (RL) into IRS. However, RL methods share a common issue of sample efficiency, i.e., huge amount of interaction data is required to train an effective recommendation policy, which is caused by the sparse user responses and the large action space consisting of a large number of candidate items. Moreover, it is infeasible to collect much data with explorative policies in online environments, which will probably harm user experience. In this work, we investigate the potential of leveraging knowledge graph (KG) in dealing with these issues of RL methods for IRS, which provides rich side information for recommendation decision making. Instead of learning RL policies from scratch, we make use of the prior knowledge of the item correlation learned from KG to (i) guide the candidate selection for better candidate item retrieval, (ii) enrich the representation of items and user states, and (iii) propagate user preferences among the correlated items over KG to deal with the sparsity of user feedback. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach with significant improvements against state-of-the-arts.",

Starting from the definition and types of KGC, existing technologies for KGC are analyzed in categories. From the evolving point of view, the KGC technologies could be divided into traditional and representation learning based methods. The former mainly includes rule-based reasoning method, probability graph model, such as Markov logic network, and graph computation based method. The latter further includes translation model based, semantic matching model based, representation learning based and other neural network model based methods. In this article, different KGC technologies are introduced, including their advantages, disadvantages and applicable fields. Finally the main challenges and problems faced by the KGC are discussed, as well as the potential research directions.",

However, no prior work has attempted to perform this generation at scale by converting an entire KG into natural text. In this paper, we verbalize the entire Wikidata KG, and create a KG-Text aligned corpus in the training process. We discuss the challenges in verbalizing an entire KG versus verbalizing smaller datasets. We further show that verbalizing an entire KG can be used to integrate structured and natural language data. In contrast to the many architectures that have been developed to integrate the structural differences between these two sources, our approach converts the KG into the same format as natural text allowing it to be seamlessly plugged into existing natural language systems. We evaluate this approach by augmenting the retrieval corpus in REALM and showing improvements, both on the LAMA knowledge probe and open domain QA.",

How to detect fake news automatically from a large of multimedia posts has become very important for people, the government and news recommendation sites. However, most of the existing approaches either extract features from the text of the post which is a single modality or simply concatenate the visual features and textual features of a post to get a multimodal feature and detect fake news. Most of them ignore the background knowledge hidden in the text content of the post which facilitates fake news detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel Knowledge-driven Multimodal Graph Convolutional Network (KMGCN) to model the semantic representations by jointly modeling the textual information, knowledge concepts and visual information into a unified framework for fake news detection. Instead of viewing text content as word sequences normally, we convert them into a graph, which can model non-consecutive phrases for better obtaining the composition of semantics. Besides, we not only convert visual information as nodes of graphs but also retrieve external knowledge from real-world knowledge graph as nodes of graphs to provide complementary semantics information to improve fake news detection. We utilize a well-designed graph convolutional network to extract the semantic representation of these graphs. Extensive experiments on two public real-world datasets illustrate the validation of our approach.",

            "abstract": "We consider open-domain question answering (QA) where answers are drawn from either a corpus, a knowledge base (KB), or a combination of both of these. We focus on a setting in which a corpus is supplemented with a large but incomplete KB, and on questions that require non-trivial (e.g., \u201cmulti-hop\u201d) reasoning. We describe PullNet, an integrated framework for (1) learning what to retrieve and (2) reasoning with this heterogeneous information to find the best answer. PullNet uses an iterative process to construct a question-specific subgraph that contains information relevant to the question. In each iteration, a graph convolutional network (graph CNN) is used to identify subgraph nodes that should be expanded using retrieval (or \u201cpull\u201d) operations on the corpus and/or KB. After the subgraph is complete, another graph CNN is used to extract the answer from the subgraph. This retrieve-and-reason process allows us to answer multi-hop questions using large KBs and corpora. PullNet is weakly supervised, requiring question-answer pairs but not gold inference paths. Experimentally PullNet improves over the prior state-of-the art, and in the setting where a corpus is used with incomplete KB these improvements are often dramatic. PullNet is also often superior to prior systems in a KB-only setting or a text-only setting.",

Existing approaches that integrate commonsense knowledge into generative pre-trained language models simply transfer relational knowledge by post-training on individual knowledge triples while ignoring rich connections within the knowledge graph. We argue that exploiting both the structural and semantic information of the knowledge graph facilitates commonsense-aware text generation. In this paper, we propose Generation with Multi-Hop Reasoning Flow (GRF) that enables pre-trained models with dynamic multi-hop reasoning on multi-relational paths extracted from the external commonsense knowledge graph. We empirically show that our model outperforms existing baselines on three text generation tasks that require reasoning over commonsense knowledge. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic multi-hop reasoning module with reasoning paths inferred by the model that provide rationale to the generation.",

This global response has led to a burst of publications on the pathophysiology of the virus, yet without coordinated efforts to organize this knowledge, it can remain hidden away from individual research groups. By extracting and formalizing this knowledge in a structured and computable form, as in the form of a knowledge graph, researchers can readily reason and analyze this information on a much larger scale. Here, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph, an expansive cause-and-effect network constructed from scientific literature on the new coronavirus that aims to provide a comprehensive view of its pathophysiology. To make this resource available to the research community and facilitate its exploration and analysis, we also implemented a web application and released the KG in multiple standard formats.

Most triples in these and other datasets in such studies belong to reverse and duplicate relations which exhibit high data redundancy due to semantic duplication, correlation or data incompleteness. This is a case of excessive data leakage---a model is trained using features that otherwise would not be available when the model needs to be applied for real prediction. There are also Cartesian product relations for which every triple formed by the Cartesian product of applicable subjects and objects is a true fact. Link prediction on the aforementioned relations is easy and can be achieved with even better accuracy using straightforward rules instead of sophisticated embedding models. A more fundamental defect of these models is that the link prediction scenario, given such data, is non-existent in the real-world. This paper is the first systematic study with the main objective of assessing the true effectiveness of embedding models when the unrealistic triples are removed. Our experiment results show these models are much less accurate than what we used to perceive. Their poor accuracy renders link prediction a task without truly effective automated solution. Hence, we call for re-investigation of possible effective approaches.",

            "abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are becoming a modish way for education, which provides a large-scale and open-access learning opportunity for students to grasp the knowledge. To attract students' interest, the recommendation system is applied by MOOCs providers to recommend courses to students. However, as a course usually consists of a number of video lectures, with each one covering some specific knowledge concepts, directly recommending courses overlook students' interest to some specific knowledge concepts. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of knowledge concept recommendation. We propose an end-to-end graph neural network based approach calledAttentional Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Deep Knowledge Recommender (ACKRec) for knowledge concept recommendation in MOOCs. Like other recommendation problems, it suffers from sparsity issue. To address this issue, we leverage both content information and context information to learn the representation of entities via graph convolution network. In addition to students and knowledge concepts, we consider other types of entities (e.g., courses, videos, teachers) and construct a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to capture the corresponding fruitful semantic relationships among different types of entities and incorporate them into the representation learning process. Specifically, we use meta-path on the HIN to guide the propagation of students' preferences. With the help of these meta-paths, the students' preference distribution with respect to a candidate knowledge concept can be captured. Furthermore, we propose an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse the context information from different meta-paths, in order to capture the different interests of different students. To learn the parameters of the proposed model, we propose to utilize extended matrix factorization (MF). A series of experiments are conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of ACKRec across multiple popular metrics compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods. The promising results show that the proposed ACKRec is able to effectively recommend knowledge concepts to students pursuing online learning in MOOCs.",

However, the existing methods fail to solve these two problems at the same time, which leads to unsatisfactory results. To mitigate this problem, we propose PairRE, a model with paired vectors for each relation representation. The paired vectors enable an adaptive adjustment of the margin in loss function to fit for different complex relations. Besides, PairRE is capable of encoding three important relation patterns, symmetry/antisymmetry, inverse and composition. Given simple constraints on relation representations, PairRE can encode subrelation further. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities of PairRE. Moreover, We set a new state-of-the-art on two knowledge graph datasets of the challenging Open Graph Benchmark.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion aims to predict missing relations between entities in a knowledge graph. In this work, we propose a relational message passing method for knowledge graph completion. Different from existing embedding-based methods, relational message passing only considers edge features (i.e., relation types) without entity IDs in the knowledge graph, and passes relational messages among edges iteratively to aggregate neighborhood information. Specifically, two kinds of neighborhood topology are modeled for a given entity pair under the relational message passing framework: (1) Relational context, which captures the relation types of edges adjacent to the given entity pair; (2) Relational paths, which characterize the relative position between the given two entities in the knowledge graph. The two message passing modules are combined together for relation prediction. Experimental results on knowledge graph benchmarks as well as our newly proposed dataset show that, our method PathCon outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge graph completion methods by a large margin. PathCon is also shown applicable to inductive settings where entities are not seen in training stage, and it is able to provide interpretable explanations for the predicted results. The code and all datasets are available at https://github.com/hwwang55/PathCon.",

            "abstract": "Fact-based Visual Question Answering (FVQA) requires external knowledge beyond the visible content to answer questions about an image. This ability is challenging but indispensable to achieve general VQA. One limitation of existing FVQA solutions is that they jointly embed all kinds of information without fine-grained selection, which introduces unexpected noises for reasoning the final answer. How to capture the question-oriented and information-complementary evidence remains a key challenge to solve the problem. In this paper, we depict an image by a multi-modal heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple layers of information corresponding to the visual, semantic and factual features. On top of the multi-layer graph representations, we propose a modality-aware heterogeneous graph convolutional network to capture evidence from different layers that is most relevant to the given question. Specifically, the intra-modal graph convolution selects evidence from each modality and cross-modal graph convolution aggregates relevant information across different graph layers. By stacking this process multiple times, our model performs iterative reasoning across three modalities and predicts the optimal answer by analyzing all question-oriented evidence. We achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the FVQA task and demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model with extensive experiments.",

Specialized neural models have been developed for extracting answers from either text alone or Knowledge Bases (KBs) alone. In this paper we look at a more practical setting, namely QA over the combination of a KB and entity-linked text, which is appropriate when an incomplete KB is available with a large text corpus. Building on recent advances in graph representation learning we propose a novel model, GRAFT-Net, for extracting answers from a question-specific subgraph containing text and KB entities and relations. We construct a suite of benchmark tasks for this problem, varying the difficulty of questions, the amount of training data, and KB completeness. We show that GRAFT-Net is competitive with the state-of-the-art when tested using either KBs or text alone, and vastly outperforms existing methods in the combined setting.",

To address the above problems, we propose to leverage external knowledge, including commonsense knowledge and emotional lexical knowledge, to explicitly understand and express emotions in empathetic dialogue generation. We first enrich the dialogue history by jointly interacting with external knowledge and construct an emotional context graph. Then we learn emotional context representations from the knowledge-enriched emotional context graph and distill emotional signals, which are the prerequisites to predicate emotions expressed in responses. Finally, to generate the empathetic response, we propose an emotional cross-attention mechanism to learn the emotional dependencies from the emotional context graph. Extensive experiments conducted on a benchmark dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we find the performance of our method can be further improved by integrating with a pre-trained model that works orthogonally.",

We propose HittER, a Hierarchical Transformer model to jointly learn Entity-relation composition and Relational contextualization based on a source entity\u2019s neighborhood. Our proposed model consists of two different Transformer blocks: the bottom block extracts features of each entity-relation pair in the local neighborhood of the source entity and the top block aggregates the relational information from outputs of the bottom block. We further design a masked entity prediction task to balance information from the relational context and the source entity itself. Experimental results show that HittER achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple link prediction datasets. We additionally propose a simple approach to integrate HittER into BERT and demonstrate its effectiveness on two Freebase factoid question answering datasets.",

The key goals of LibKGE are to enable reproducible research, to provide a framework for comprehensive experimental studies, and to facilitate analyzing the contributions of individual components of training methods, model architectures, and evaluation methods. LibKGE is highly configurable and every experiment can be fully reproduced with a single configuration file. Individual components are decoupled to the extent possible so that they can be mixed and matched with each other. Implementations in LibKGE aim to be as efficient as possible without leaving the scope of Python/Numpy/PyTorch. A comprehensive logging mechanism and tooling facilitates in-depth analysis. LibKGE provides implementations of common knowledge graph embedding models and training methods, and new ones can be easily added. A comparative study (Ruffinelli et al., 2020) showed that LibKGE reaches competitive to state-of-the-art performance for many models with a modest amount of automatic hyperparameter tuning.",

RECON uses a graph neural network to learn representations of both the sentence as well as facts stored in a KG, improving the overall extraction quality. These facts, including entity attributes (label, alias, description, instance-of) and factual triples, have not been collectively used in the state of the art methods. We evaluate the effect of various forms of representing the KG context on the performance of RECON. The empirical evaluation on two standard relation extraction datasets shows that RECON significantly outperforms all state of the art methods on NYT Freebase and Wikidata datasets.",

To increase the scale even further, we need to explore automatic methods for constructing knowledge bases. Previous approaches have primarily focused on text-based extraction, which can be very noisy. Here we introduce Knowledge Vault, a Web-scale probabilistic knowledge base that combines extractions from Web content (obtained via analysis of text, tabular data, page structure, and human annotations) with prior knowledge derived from existing knowledge repositories. We employ supervised machine learning methods for fusing these distinct information sources. The Knowledge Vault is substantially bigger than any previously published structured knowledge repository, and features a probabilistic inference system that computes calibrated probabilities of fact correctness. We report the results of multiple studies that explore the relative utility of the different information sources and extraction methods.",

In this paper, we argue that context derived from a knowledge graph (in our case: Wikidata) provides enough signals to inform pretrained transformer models and improve their performance for named entity disambiguation (NED) on Wikidata KG. We further hypothesize that our proposed KG context can be standardized for Wikipedia, and we evaluate the impact of KG context on the state of the art NED model for the Wikipedia knowledge base. Our empirical results validate that the proposed KG context can be generalized (for Wikipedia), and providing KG context in transformer architectures considerably outperforms the existing baselines, including the vanilla transformer models.",

With the increasing number of public databases and the rapid development of analytical methodologies, computational approaches have gained great momentum in the field of drug repurposing. In this study, we introduce an approach to knowledge-driven drug repurposing based on a comprehensive drug knowledge graph. We design and develop a drug knowledge graph by systematically integrating multiple drug knowledge bases. We describe path- and embedding-based data representation methods of transforming information in the drug knowledge graph into valuable inputs to allow machine learning models to predict drug repurposing candidates. The evaluation demonstrates that the knowledge-driven approach can produce high predictive results for known diabetes mellitus treatments by only using treatment information on other diseases. In addition, this approach supports exploratory investigation through the review of meta paths that connect drugs with diseases. This knowledge-driven approach is an effective drug repurposing strategy supporting large-scale prediction and the investigation of case studies.",

Existing GNN-based methods explicitly model the dependency between an entity and its local graph context in KG (i.e., the set of its first-order neighbors), but may not be effective in capturing its non-local graph context (i.e., the set of most related high-order neighbors). In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation framework, named Contextualized Graph Attention Network (CGAT), which can explicitly exploit both local and non-local graph context information of an entity in KG. More specifically, CGAT captures the local context information by a user-specific graph attention mechanism, considering a user\u2019s personalized preferences on entities. In addition, CGAT employs a biased random walk sampling process to extract the non-local context of an entity, and utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the dependency between the entity and its non-local contextual entities. To capture the user\u2019s personalized preferences on items, an item-specific attention mechanism is also developed to model the dependency between a target item and the contextual items extracted from the user\u2019s historical behaviors. We compared CGAT with state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods on real datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CGAT.",

As graph embeddings begin to be used more widely in NLP pipelines, there is a need to develop training methods which remove such biases. Previous approaches to this problem both significantly increase the training time, by a factor of eight or more, and decrease the accuracy of the model substantially. We present a novel approach, in which all embeddings are trained to be neutral to sensitive attributes such as gender by default using an adversarial loss. We then add sensitive attributes back on in whitelisted cases. Training time only marginally increases over a baseline model, and the debiased embeddings perform almost as accurately in the triple prediction task as their non-debiased counterparts.",

It helps to under stand user needs, answer pre-sales questions and generate explanation texts. We applied AliMe KG to several online business scenarios such as shopping guide, question answering over properties and selling point generation, and gained positive and beneficial business results. In the paper, we systematically introduce how we construct domain knowledge graph from free text, and demonstrate its business value with several applications. Our experience shows that min ing structured knowledge from free text in vertical domain is practicable, and can be of substantial value in industrial settings.",

The amount of data is huge, the production speed is fast, and the format is different. Case data is very important because it contains a lot of medical knowledge about diseases, drugs, treatments, etc. It can provide important support for the development of smart medicine. Knowledge graph is a graph-based data structure, which can well represent the relationship between these medical data in reality and form a semantic network. This research uses knowledge graph technology to connect trivial and scattered knowledge in various medical information systems to assist in disease diagnosis. This research takes thyroid disease as an example, constructs a medical knowledge graph and applies it to intelligent medical diagnosis. First, extract the relationships between biomedical entities to construct a biomedical knowledge graph. Then, the entities and relationships in the knowledge graph are transformed into low-dimensional continuous vectors through the knowledge graph embedding method. Finally, the known pathological disease relationship data is used to train the disease diagnosis model of the bidirectional long short-term memory network (BSTLM). Experiments show that the thyroid disease diagnosis method that combines knowledge graphs and deep learning has a better diagnostic effect. This shows that smart medical care based on the knowledge graph will provide a solution path for alleviating the shortage of domestic high-quality medical resources.",

The task of detecting emotions in textual conversations leads to a wide range of applications such as opinion mining in social networks. However, enabling machines to analyze emotions in conversations is challenging, partly because humans often rely on the context and commonsense knowledge to express emotions. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a Knowledge-Enriched Transformer (KET), where contextual utterances are interpreted using hierarchical self-attention and external commonsense knowledge is dynamically leveraged using a context-aware affective graph attention mechanism. Experiments on multiple textual conversation datasets demonstrate that both context and commonsense knowledge are consistently beneficial to the emotion detection performance. In addition, the experimental results show that our KET model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on most of the tested datasets in F1 score.",

We propose a novel Knowledge-driven Encode, Retrieve, Paraphrase (KERP) approach which reconciles traditional knowledge- and retrieval-based methods with modern learning-based methods for accurate and robust medical report generation. Specifically, KERP decomposes medical report generation into explicit medical abnormality graph learning and subsequent natural language modeling. KERP first employs an Encode module that transforms visual features into a structured abnormality graph by incorporating prior medical knowledge; then a Retrieve module that retrieves text templates based on the detected abnormalities; and lastly, a Paraphrase module that rewrites the templates according to specific cases. The core of KERP is a proposed generic implementation unit\u2014Graph Transformer (GTR) that dynamically transforms high-level semantics between graph-structured data of multiple domains such as knowledge graphs, images and sequences. Experiments show that the proposed approach generates structured and robust reports supported with accurate abnormality description and explainable attentive regions, achieving the state-of-the-art results on two medical report benchmarks, with the best medical abnormality and disease classification accuracy and improved human evaluation performance.",

            "abstract": "The key challenge of knowledge distillation is to extract general, moderate and sufficient knowledge from a teacher network to guide a student network. In this paper, a novel Instance Relationship Graph (IRG) is proposed for knowledge distillation. It models three kinds of knowledge, including instance features, instance relationships and feature space transformation, while the latter two kinds of knowledge are neglected by previous methods. Firstly, the IRG is constructed to model the distilled knowledge of one network layer, by considering instance features and instance relationships as vertexes and edges respectively. Secondly, an IRG transformation is proposed to models the feature space transformation across layers. It is more moderate than directly mimicking the features at intermediate layers. Finally, hint loss functions are designed to force a student's IRGs to mimic the structures of a teacher's IRGs. The proposed method effectively captures the knowledge along the whole network via IRGs, and thus shows stable convergence and strong robustness to different network architectures. In addition, the proposed method shows superior performance over existing methods on datasets of various scales.",
