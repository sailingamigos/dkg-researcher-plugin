            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KG) often encounter knowledge incompleteness. The path reasoning that predicts the unknown path relation between pairwise entities based on existing facts is one of the most promising approaches to the knowledge graph completion. However, most conventional path reasoning methods exclusively consider the entity description included in fact triples, ignoring both the type information of entities and the interaction between different semantic representations. In this study, we propose a novel method, Type-aware Attentive Path Reasoning (TAPR), to complete the knowledge graph by simultaneously considering KG structural information, textual information, and type information. More specifically, we first leverage types to enrich the representational learning of entities and relationships. Next, we describe a type-level attention to select the most relevant type of given entity in a specific triple without any predefined rules or patterns to reduce the impact of noisy types. After learning the distributed representation of all paths, path-level attention assigns different weights to paths, from which relations among entity pairs are calculated. We conduct a series of experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of TAPR. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines on link prediction and entity prediction tasks.",

These graphs, i.e. biological knowledge graphs, are then processed using graph exploratory approaches to perform different types of analytical and predictive tasks. Despite the high predictive accuracy of these approaches, they have limited scalability due to their dependency on time-consuming path exploratory procedures. In recent years, owing to the rapid advances of computational technologies, new approaches for modelling graphs and mining them with high accuracy and scalability have emerged. These approaches, i.e. knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, operate by learning low-rank vector representations of graph nodes and edges that preserve the graph's inherent structure. These approaches were used to analyse knowledge graphs from different domains where they showed superior performance and accuracy compared to previous graph exploratory approaches. In this work, we study this class of models in the context of biological knowledge graphs and their different applications. We then show how KGE models can be a natural fit for representing complex biological knowledge modelled as graphs. We also discuss their predictive and analytical capabilities in different biology applications. In this regard, we present two example case studies that demonstrate the capabilities of KGE models: prediction of drug-target interactions and polypharmacy side effects. Finally, we analyse different practical considerations for KGEs, and we discuss possible opportunities and challenges related to adopting them for modelling biological systems.",

Previous KG completion approaches require a large number of training instances (i.e., head-tail entity pairs) for every relation. The real case is that for most of the relations, very few entity pairs are available. Existing work of one-shot learning limits method generalizability for few-shot scenarios and does not fully use the supervisory information; however, few-shot KG completion has not been well studied yet. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot relation learning model (FSRL) that aims at discovering facts of new relations with few-shot references. FSRL can effectively capture knowledge from heterogeneous graph structure, aggregate representations of few-shot references, and match similar entity pairs of reference set for every relation. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that FSRL outperforms the state-of-the-art.",

In this paper, we propose a novel scene graph generation algorithm with external knowledge and image reconstruction loss to overcome these dataset issues. In particular, we extract commonsense knowledge from the external knowledge base to refine object and phrase features for improving generalizability in scene graph generation. To address the bias of noisy object annotations, we introduce an auxiliary image reconstruction path to regularize the scene graph generation network. Extensive experiments show that our framework can generate better scene graphs, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets: Visual Relationship Detection and Visual Genome datasets.",

            "abstract": "Explainability and effectiveness are two key aspects for building recommender systems. Prior efforts mostly focus on incorporating side information to achieve better recommendation performance. However, these methods have some weaknesses: (1) prediction of neural network-based embedding methods are hard to explain and debug; (2) symbolic, graph-based approaches (e.g., meta path-based models) require manual efforts and domain knowledge to define patterns and rules, and ignore the item association types (e.g. substitutable and complementary). In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning framework to integrate induction of explainable rules from knowledge graph with construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation model. The framework encourages two modules to complement each other in generating effective and explainable recommendation: 1) inductive rules, mined from item-centric knowledge graphs, summarize common multi-hop relational patterns for inferring different item associations and provide human-readable explanation for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented by induced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing with the cold-start issue. Extensive experiments1 show that our proposed method has achieved significant improvements in item recommendation over baselines on real-world datasets. Our model demonstrates robust performance over \u201cnoisy\u201d item knowledge graphs, generated by linking item names to related entities.",

Both rules and embeddings can be used for knowledge graph reasoning and they have their own advantages and difficulties. Rule-based reasoning is accurate and explainable but rule learning with searching over the graph always suffers from efficiency due to huge search space. Embedding-based reasoning is more scalable and efficient as the reasoning is conducted via computation between embeddings, but it has difficulty learning good representations for sparse entities because a good embedding relies heavily on data richness. Based on this observation, in this paper we explore how embedding and rule learning can be combined together and complement each other's difficulties with their advantages. We propose a novel framework IterE iteratively learning embeddings and rules, in which rules are learned from embeddings with proper pruning strategy and embeddings are learned from existing triples and new triples inferred by rules. Evaluations on embedding qualities of IterE show that rules help improve the quality of sparse entity embeddings and their link prediction results. We also evaluate the efficiency of rule learning and quality of rules from IterE compared with AMIE+, showing that IterE is capable of generating high quality rules more efficiently. Experiments show that iteratively learning embeddings and rules benefit each other during learning and prediction.",

To characterize CoDEx, we contribute thorough empirical analyses and benchmarking experiments. First, we analyze each CoDEx dataset in terms of logical relation patterns. Next, we report baseline link prediction and triple classification results on CoDEx for five extensively tuned embedding models. Finally, we differentiate CoDEx from the popular FB15K-237 knowledge graph completion dataset by showing that CoDEx covers more diverse and interpretable content, and is a more difficult link prediction benchmark.

All previous work including Trans(E, H, R, and D) ignore the heterogeneity (some relations link many entity pairs and others do not) and the imbalance (the number of head entities and that of tail entities in a relation could be different) of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach TranSparse to deal with the two issues. In TranSparse, transfer matrices are replaced by adaptive sparse matrices, whose sparse degrees are determined by the number of entities (or entity pairs) linked by relations. In experiments, we design structured and unstructured sparse patterns for transfer matrices and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We evaluate our approach on triplet classification and link prediction tasks. Experimental results show that TranSparse outperforms Trans(E, H, R, and D) significantly, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n \n",

Most existing methods typically rely on external information of entities such as Wikipedia links and require costly manual feature construction to complete alignment. In this paper, we present a novel approach for entity alignment via joint knowledge embeddings. Our method jointly encodes both entities and relations of various KGs into a unified low-dimensional semantic space according to a small seed set of aligned entities. During this process, we can align entities according to their semantic distance in this joint semantic space. More specifically, we present an iterative and parameter sharing method to improve alignment performance. Experiment results on realworld datasets show that, as compared to baselines, our method achieves significant improvements on entity alignment, and can further improve knowledge graph completion performance on various KGs with the favor of joint knowledge embeddings.",

Existing methods mainly rely on hand-engineered features from KGs (e.g., meta paths), which requires domain knowledge. This paper presents RKGE, a KG embedding approach that automatically learns semantic representations of both entities and paths between entities for characterizing user preferences towards items. Specifically, RKGE employs a novel recurrent network architecture that contains a batch of recurrent networks to model the semantics of paths linking a same entity pair, which are seamlessly fused into recommendation. It further employs a pooling operator to discriminate the saliency of different paths in characterizing user preferences towards items. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows the superiority of RKGE against state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that RKGE provides meaningful explanations for recommendation results.",

Knowledge graphs have firmly established themselves as valuable sources of information for search and question answering, and it is natural to wonder if a KG can contain information about products offered at online retail sites. There have been several successful examples of generic KGs, but organizing information about products poses many additional challenges, including sparsity and noise of structured data for products, complexity of the domain with millions of product types and thousands of attributes, heterogeneity across large number of categories, as well as large and constantly growing number of products. We describe AutoKnow, our automatic (self-driving) system that addresses these challenges. The system includes a suite of novel techniques for taxonomy construction, product property identification, knowledge extraction, anomaly detection, and synonym discovery. AutoKnow is (a) automatic, requiring little human intervention, (b) multi-scalable, scalable in multiple dimensions (many domains, many products, and many attributes), and (c) integrative, exploiting rich customer behavior logs. AutoKnow has been operational in collecting product knowledge for over 11K product types.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs typically suffer from incompleteness. A popular approach to knowledge graph completion is to infer missing knowledge by multihop reasoning over the information found along other paths connecting a pair of entities. However, multi-hop reasoning is still challenging because the reasoning process usually experiences multiple semantic issue that a relation or an entity has multiple meanings. In order to deal with the situation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework to learn chains of reasoning from a Knowledge Graph automatically. Our framework is inspired by the hierarchical structure through which human handle cognitionally ambiguous cases. The whole reasoning process is decomposed into a hierarchy of two-level Reinforcement Learning policies for encoding historical information and learning structured action space. As a consequence, it is more feasible and natural for dealing with the multiple semantic issue. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves substantial improvements in ambiguous relation tasks.",

Recently, a new knowledge graph completion method using a pre-trained language model, such as KG-BERT, is presented and showed high performance. However, its scores in ranking metrics such as Hits@k are still behind state-of-the-art models. We claim that there are two main reasons: 1) failure in sufficiently learning relational information in knowledge graphs, and 2) difficulty in picking out the correct answer from lexically similar candidates. In this paper, we propose an effective multi-task learning method to overcome the limitations of previous works. By combining relation prediction and relevance ranking tasks with our target link prediction, the proposed model can learn more relational properties in KGs and properly perform even when lexical similarity occurs. Experimental results show that we not only largely improve the ranking performances compared to KG-BERT but also achieve the state-of-the-art performances in Mean Rank and Hits@10 on the WN18RR dataset.",

A vast number of state-of-the-art KGC techniques have got published at top conferences in several research fields, including data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing. However, we notice that several recent papers report very high performance, which largely outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we find that this can be attributed to the inappropriate evaluation protocol used by them and propose a simple evaluation protocol to address this problem. The proposed protocol is robust to handle bias in the model, which can substantially affect the final results. We conduct extensive experiments and report performance of several existing methods using our protocol. The reproducible code has been made publicly available.",

However, existing large-scale knowledge graphs mainly focus on knowledge about entities while ignoring knowledge about activities, states, or events, which are used to describe how entities or things act in the real world. To fill this gap, we develop ASER (activities, states, events, and their relations), a large-scale eventuality knowledge graph extracted from more than 11-billion-token unstructured textual data. ASER contains 15 relation types belonging to five categories, 194-million unique eventualities, and 64-million unique edges among them. Both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of ASER.",

Most of the recent solutions for entity alignment are based on knowledge graph embedding, which maps knowledge entities in a low-dimension space where entities are connected with the guidance of prior aligned entity pairs. The study in this paper focuses on two important issues that limit the accuracy of current entity alignment solutions: 1) labeled data of priorly aligned entity pairs are difficult and expensive to acquire, whereas abundant of unlabeled data are not used; and 2) knowledge graph embedding is affected by entity's degree difference, which brings challenges to align high frequent and low frequent entities. We propose a semi-supervised entity alignment method (SEA) to leverage both labeled entities and the abundant unlabeled entity information for the alignment. Furthermore, we improve the knowledge graph embedding with awareness of the degree difference by performing the adversarial training. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with significant improvement on alignment accuracy.",

TransE is one of such models and the first translation-based method. TransE is well known because the principle of TransE can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge graph although it seems very simple. However, TransE has problems with its regularization and an unchangeable ratio of negative sampling. In this paper, we generalize TransE to solve these problems by proposing knowledge graph embedding on a Lie group (KGLG) and the Weighted Negative Part (WNP) method for the objective function of translation-based models. KGLG is the novel translation-based method which embeds entities and relations of a knowledge graph on any Lie group. It allows us not to employ regularization during training of the model if we choose a compact lie group for the embedding space. The WNP method is for changing the ratio of negative sampling, which enhances translation-based models. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as TransE, DistMult, and ComplEx on a standard link prediction task. We show that TorusE, KGLG on a torus, is scalable to large-size knowledge graphs and faster than the original TransE.",

State-of-the-art embedding models propose different trade-offs between modeling expressiveness, and time and space complexity. We reconcile both expressiveness and complexity through the use of complex-valued embeddings and explore the link between such complex-valued embeddings and unitary diagonalization. We corroborate our approach theoretically and show that all real square matrices---thus all possible relation/adjacency matrices---are the real part of some unitarily diagonalizable matrix. This results opens the door to a lot of other applications of square matrices factorization. Our approach based on complex embeddings is arguably simple, as it only involves a Hermitian dot product, the complex counterpart of the standard dot product between real vectors, whereas other methods resort to more and more complicated composition functions to increase their expressiveness. The proposed complex embeddings are scalable to large data sets as it remains linear in both space and time, while consistently outperforming alternative approaches on standard link prediction benchmarks.",

Commonsense knowledge graphs use free-form text to represent nodes, resulting in orders of magnitude more nodes compared to conventional KBs ( \u223c18x more nodes in ATOMIC compared to Freebase (FB15K-237)). Importantly, this implies significantly sparser graph structures \u2014 a major challenge for existing KB completion methods that assume densely connected graphs over a relatively smaller set of nodes.In this paper, we present novel KB completion models that can address these challenges by exploiting the structural and semantic context of nodes. Specifically, we investigate two key ideas: (1) learning from local graph structure, using graph convolutional networks and automatic graph densification and (2) transfer learning from pre-trained language models to knowledge graphs for enhanced contextual representation of knowledge. We describe our method to incorporate information from both these sources in a joint model and provide the first empirical results for KB completion on ATOMIC and evaluation with ranking metrics on ConceptNet. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of language model representations in boosting link prediction performance and the advantages of learning from local graph structure (+1.5 points in MRR for ConceptNet) when training on subgraphs for computational efficiency. Further analysis on model predictions shines light on the types of commonsense knowledge that language models capture well.",

However, the financial market reaction of events is also influenced by the lead-lag effect, which is driven by internal relationships. Therefore, in this paper, we present a knowledge graph-based event embedding framework for quantitative investments. In particular, we first extract structured events from raw texts, and construct the knowledge graph with the mentioned entities and relations simultaneously. Then, we leverage a joint model to merge the knowledge graph information into the objective function of an event embedding learning model. The learned representations are fed as inputs of downstream quantitative trading methods. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the event embeddings learned from financial news and knowledge graphs. We also deploy the framework for quantitative algorithm trading. The accumulated portfolio return contributed by our method significantly outperforms other baselines.",

            "abstract": "Commonsense question answering aims to answer questions which require background knowledge that is not explicitly expressed in the question. The key challenge is how to obtain evidence from external knowledge and make predictions based on the evidence. Recent studies either learn to generate evidence from human-annotated evidence which is expensive to collect, or extract evidence from either structured or unstructured knowledge bases which fails to take advantages of both sources simultaneously. In this work, we propose to automatically extract evidence from heterogeneous knowledge sources, and answer questions based on the extracted evidence. Specifically, we extract evidence from both structured knowledge base (i.e. ConceptNet) and Wikipedia plain texts. We construct graphs for both sources to obtain the relational structures of evidence. Based on these graphs, we propose a graph-based approach consisting of a graph-based contextual word representation learning module and a graph-based inference module. The first module utilizes graph structural information to re-define the distance between words for learning better contextual word representations. The second module adopts graph convolutional network to encode neighbor information into the representations of nodes, and aggregates evidence with graph attention mechanism for predicting the final answer. Experimental results on CommonsenseQA dataset illustrate that our graph-based approach over both knowledge sources brings improvement over strong baselines. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy (75.3%) on the CommonsenseQA dataset.",

It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of KGs and limited seed alignments. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised entity alignment method by joint Knowledge Embedding model and Cross-Graph model (KECG). It can make better use of seed alignments to propagate over the entire graphs with KG-based constraints. Specifically, as for the knowledge embedding model, we utilize TransE to implicitly complete two KGs towards consistency and learn relational constraints between entities. As for the cross-graph model, we extend Graph Attention Network (GAT) with projection constraint to robustly encode graphs, and two KGs share the same GAT to transfer structural knowledge as well as to ignore unimportant neighbors for alignment via attention mechanism. Results on publicly available datasets as well as further analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of KECG. Our codes can be found in https: //github.com/THU-KEG/KECG.",

Because knowledge graphs typically only contain positive facts, sampling useful negative training examples is a nontrivial task. Replacing the head or tail entity of a fact with a uniformly randomly selected entity is a conventional method for generating negative facts, but the majority of the generated negative facts can be easily discriminated from positive facts, and will contribute little towards the training. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), we use one knowledge graph embedding model as a negative sample generator to assist the training of our desired model, which acts as the discriminator in GANs. This framework is independent of the concrete form of generator and discriminator, and therefore can utilize a wide variety of knowledge graph embedding models as its building blocks. In experiments, we adversarially train two translation-based models, TRANSE and TRANSD, each with assistance from one of the two probability-based models, DISTMULT and COMPLEX. We evaluate the performances of KBGAN on the link prediction task, using three knowledge base completion datasets: FB15k-237, WN18 and WN18RR. Experimental results show that adversarial training substantially improves the performances of target embedding models under various settings.",

To the best of our knowledge, PeGaSus is the first such library, implemented on the top of the Hadoop platform, the open source version of MapReduce. Many graph mining operations (PageRank, spectral clustering, diameter estimation, connected components etc.) are essentially a repeated matrix-vector multiplication. In this paper we describe a very important primitive for PeGaSus, called GIM-V (Generalized Iterated Matrix-Vector multiplication). GIM-V is highly optimized, achieving (a) good scale-up on the number of available machines, (b) linear running time on the number of edges, and (c) more than 5 times faster performance over the non-optimized version of GIM-V. Our experiments ran on M45, one of the top 50 supercomputers in the world. We report our findings on several real graphs, including one of the largest publicly available Web Graphs, thanks to Yahoo!, with \u2248 6,7 billion edges.",

We present two self-supervised tasks learning over raw text with the guidance from knowledge graphs. Building upon entity-level masked language models, our first contribution is an entity masking scheme that exploits relational knowledge underlying the text. This is fulfilled by using a linked knowledge graph to select informative entities and then masking their mentions. In addition we use knowledge graphs to obtain distractors for the masked entities, and propose a novel distractor-suppressed ranking objective which is optimized jointly with masked language model. In contrast to existing paradigms, our approach uses knowledge graphs implicitly, only during pre-training, to inject language models with structured knowledge via learning from raw text. It is more efficient than retrieval-based methods that perform entity linking and integration during finetuning and inference, and generalizes more effectively than the methods that directly learn from concatenated graph triples. Experiments show that our proposed model achieves improved performance on five benchmark datasets, including question answering and knowledge base completion tasks.",

            "abstract": "Many practical graph problems, such as knowledge graph construction and drug-to-drug interaction, require to handle multi-relational graphs. However, handling real-world multi-label graphs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often challenging due to their evolving nature, where new entities (nodes) can emerge over time. Moreover, newly emerged entities often have few links, which makes the learning even more difficult. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce a realistic problem of few-shot out-of-graph link prediction, where we not only predict the links between the seen and unseen nodes as in a conventional out-of-knowledge link prediction but also between the unseen nodes, with only few edges per node. We tackle this problem with a novel transductive meta-learning framework which we refer to as Graph Extrapolation Networks (GEN). GEN meta-learns both the node embedding network for inductive inference (seen-to-unseen) and the link prediction network for transductive inference (unseen-to-unseen). For transductive link prediction, we further propose a stochastic embedding layer to model uncertainty in the link prediction between unseen entities. We validate our model on multiple benchmark datasets for knowledge graph link prediction and drug-to-drug interaction prediction. The results show that our model significantly outperforms relevant baselines for out-of-graph link prediction tasks.",

            "abstract": "A conceptual graph (CG) is a graph representation for logic based on the semantic networks of artificial intelligence and the existential graphs of Charles Sanders Peirce. Several versions of CGs have been designed and implemented over the past thirty years. The simplest are the typeless core CGs, which correspond to Peirce's original existential graphs. More common are the extended CGs, which are a typed superset of the core. The research CGs have explored novel techniques for reasoning, knowledge representation, and natural language semantics. The semantics of the core and extended CGs is defined by a formal mapping to and from the ISO standard for Common Logic, but the research CGs are defined by a variety of formal and informal extensions. This article surveys the notation, applications, and reasoning methods used with CGs and their mapping to and from other versions of logic. During the 1960s, graph-based semantic representations were popular in both theoretical and computational linguistics. At one of the most impressive conferences of the decade, Margaret Masterman [21] introduced a graph-based notation, called a semantic network, which included a lattice of concept types; Silvio Ceccato [1] presented correlational nets, which were based on 56 different relations, including subtype, instance , part-whole, case relations, kinship relations, and various kinds of attributes; and David Hays [15] presented dependency graphs, which formalized the notation developed by the linguist Lucien Tesni\u00e8re [40]. The early graph notations represented the relational structures underlying natural language semantics, but none of them could express full first-order logic. Woods [42] and McDermott [22] wrote scathing critiques of their logical weaknesses. In the late 1970s, many graph notations were designed to represent first-order logic or a formally-defined subset [7]. Sowa [32] developed a version of conceptual graphs (CGs) as an intermediate language for mapping natural language questions and assertions to a relational database.

They also provide support for relational learning models which are known to provide highly scalable and accurate predictions of associations between biological entities. Despite the success of the combination of biological knowledge graph and relation learning models in biological predictive tasks, there is a lack of unified biological knowledge graph resources. This forced all current efforts and studies for applying a relational learning model on biological data to compile and build biological knowledge graphs from open biological databases. This process is often performed inconsistently across such efforts, especially in terms of choosing the original resources, aligning identifiers of the different databases, and assessing the quality of included data. To make relational learning on biomedical data more standardised and reproducible, we propose a new biological knowledge graph which provides a compilation of curated relational data from open biological databases in a unified format with common, interlinked identifiers. We also provide a new module for mapping identifiers and labels from different databases which can be used to align our knowledge graph with biological data from other heterogeneous sources. Finally, to illustrate the practical relevance of our work, we provide a set of benchmarks based on the presented data that can be used to train and assess the relational learning models in various tasks related to pathway and drug discovery.",

The subgradient-push method can be implemented in a distributed way without requiring knowledge of either the number of agents or the graph sequence; each node is only required to know its out-degree at each time. Our main result is a convergence rate of O((ln t)/t) for strongly convex functions with Lipschitz gradients even if only stochastic gradient samples are available; this is asymptotically faster than the O((ln t)/\u221at) rate previously known for (general) convex functions.",

The study is motivated by the proven effectiveness of knowledge graphs for interpretable and controllable text generation and exploratory search. Original in our work is that we propose a model of the knowledge encapsulated in arguments. Based on this model, we build a new corpus that comprises about 16k manual annotations of 4740 claims with instances of the model's elements, and we develop an end-to-end framework that automatically identifies all modeled types of instances. The results of experiments show the potential of the framework for building a web-based argumentation graph that is of high quality and large scale.",

When faced with a complex question with compositional semantics, query graph generation is a practical semantic parsing-based method. But existing works rely on heuristic rules with limited coverage, making them impractical on more complex questions. This paper proposes a Director-Actor-Critic framework to overcome these challenges. Through options over a Markov Decision Process, query graph generation is formulated as a hierarchical decision problem. The Director determines which types of triples the query graph needs, the Actor generates corresponding triples by choosing nodes and edges, and the Critic calculates the semantic similarity between the generated triples and the given questions. Moreover, to train from weak supervision, we base the framework on hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with intrinsic motivation. To accelerate the training process, we pre-train the Critic with high-reward trajectories generated by hand-crafted rules, and leverage curriculum learning to gradually increase the complexity of questions during query graph generation. Extensive experiments conducted over widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

DTI predictions can help to quickly identify new promising (on-target) or unintended (off-target) effects of drugs. However, existing models face several challenges. Many can only process a limited number of drugs and/or have poor proteome coverage. The current approaches also often suffer from high false positive prediction rates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe propose a novel computational approach for predicting drug target proteins. The approach is based on formulating the problem as a link prediction in knowledge graphs (robust, machine-readable representations of networked knowledge). We use biomedical knowledge bases to create a knowledge graph of entities connected to both drugs and their potential targets. We propose a specific knowledge graph embedding model, TriModel, to learn vector representaions (i.e. embeddings) for all drugs and targets in the created knowledge graph. These representations are consequently used to infer candidate drug target interactions based on their scores computed by the trained TriModel model. We have experimentally evaluated our method using computer simulations and compared it to five existing models. This has shown that our approach outperforms all previous ones in terms of both area under ROC and precision-recall curves in standard benchmark tests.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe data, predictions, and models are available at: drugtargets.insight-centre.org.",

In the Data Mining Process, collecting, exploring and selecting the rightdata are critically important.Knowledge Discovery demonstrates intelligent computing at its best, and is the mostdesirable and interesting end-product of Information Technology. To be able to discoverand to extract knowledge from data is a task that many researchers and practitioners are endeavoring to accomplish. There is a lot of hidden knowledge waitingto be discovered \u2013 this is the challenge created by today\u2019s abundance of data.Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is the process of identifying valid,novel, useful, and understandable patterns from large datasets.",

As a frontier, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have aroused great interest recently, which update the representation of each node by aggregating information of its neighbors. However, most GNNs have shallow layers with a limited receptive field and may not achieve satisfactory performance especially when the number of labeled nodes is quite small. To address this challenge, we innovatively propose a graph few-shot learning (GFL) algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge learned from auxiliary graphs to improve classification accuracy on the target graph. Specifically, a transferable metric space characterized by a node embedding and a graph-specific prototype embedding function is shared between auxiliary graphs and the target, facilitating the transfer of structural knowledge. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four real-world graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and the contribution of each component.",

More specifically, the XR4DRAMA KG can represent information about: (a) Observations and Events (e.g., data collection of biometric sensors, information in photos and text messages), (b) Spatio-temporal (e.g., highlighted locations and timestamps), (c) Mitigation and response plans in crisis (e.g., first responder teams). Moreover, we offer a mechanism that can create or update Points-Of-Interest (POIs), based on a visual or textual messages received from users.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been applied to many tasks including Web search, link prediction, recommendation, natural language processing, and entity linking. However, most KGs are far from complete and are growing at a rapid pace. To address these problems, Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has been proposed to improve KGs by filling in its missing connections. Unlike existing methods which hold a closed-world assumption, i.e., where KGs are fixed and new entities cannot be easily added, in the present work we relax this assumption and propose a new open-world KGC task. As a first attempt to solve this task we introduce an open-world KGC model called ConMask. This model learns embeddings of the entity's name and parts of its text-description to connect unseen entities to the KG. To mitigate the presence of noisy text descriptions, ConMask uses a relationship-dependent content masking to extract relevant snippets and then trains a fully convolutional neural network to fuse the extracted snippets with entities in the KG. Experiments on large data sets, both old and new, show that ConMask performs well in the open-world KGC task and even outperforms existing KGC models on the standard closed-world KGC task.\n \n",

Computational fact checking may significantly enhance our ability to evaluate the veracity of dubious information. Here we show that the complexities of human fact checking can be approximated quite well by finding the shortest path between concept nodes under properly defined semantic proximity metrics on knowledge graphs. Framed as a network problem this approach is feasible with efficient computational techniques. We evaluate this approach by examining tens of thousands of claims related to history, entertainment, geography, and biographical information using a public knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia. Statements independently known to be true consistently receive higher support via our method than do false ones. These findings represent a significant step toward scalable computational fact-checking methods that may one day mitigate the spread of harmful misinformation.",

We propose a novel method of jointly embedding entities and words into the same continuous vector space. The embedding process attempts to preserve the relations between entities in the knowledge graph and the concurrences of words in the text corpus. Entity names and Wikipedia anchors are utilized to align the embeddings of entities and words in the same space. Large scale experiments on Freebase and a Wikipedia/NY Times corpus show that jointly embedding brings promising improvement in the accuracy of predicting facts, compared to separately embedding knowledge graphs and text. Particularly, jointly embedding enables the prediction of facts containing entities out of the knowledge graph, which cannot be handled by previous embedding methods. At the same time, concerning the quality of the word embeddings, experiments on the analogical reasoning task show that jointly embedding is comparable to or slightly better than word2vec (Skip-Gram).",

To our knowledge, this is the first application of these concepts to the field of graph analysis.

In this framework, we learn representations of knowledge graphs (KGs) and text within a unified parameter sharing semantic space. To achieve better fusion, we propose an effective mutual attention between KGs and text. The reciprocal attention mechanism enables us to highlight important features and perform better KGC and RE. Different from conventional joint models, no complicated linguistic analysis or strict alignments between KGs and text are required to train our models. Experiments on relation extraction and entity link prediction show that models trained under our joint framework are significantly improved in comparison with other baselines. Most existing methods for KGC and RE can be easily integrated into our framework due to its flexible architectures.

            "abstract": "\n \n Embedding knowledge graphs (KGs) into continuous vector spaces is a focus of current research. Combining such an embedding model with logic rules has recently attracted increasing attention. Most previous attempts made a one-time injection of logic rules, ignoring the interactive nature between embedding learning and logical inference. And they focused only on hard rules, which always hold with no exception and usually require extensive manual effort to create or validate. In this paper, we propose Rule-Guided Embedding (RUGE), a novel paradigm of KG embedding with iterative guidance from soft rules. RUGE enables an embedding model to learn simultaneously from 1) labeled triples that have been directly observed in a given KG, 2) unlabeled triples whose labels are going to be predicted iteratively, and 3) soft rules with various confidence levels extracted automatically from the KG. In the learning process, RUGE iteratively queries rules to obtain soft labels for unlabeled triples, and integrates such newly labeled triples to update the embedding model. Through this iterative procedure, knowledge embodied in logic rules may be better transferred into the learned embeddings. We evaluate RUGE in link prediction on Freebase and YAGO. Experimental results show that: 1) with rule knowledge injected iteratively, RUGE achieves significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines; and 2) despite their uncertainties, automatically extracted soft rules are highly beneficial to KG embedding, even those with moderate confidence levels. The code and data used for this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/iieir-km/RUGE.\n \n",

Existing knowledge graphs, with popular examples including DBpedia, YAGO and Wikidata, focus mostly on entity-centric information and are insufficient in terms of their coverage and completeness with respect to events and temporal relations. In this article we address this limitation, formalise the concept of a temporal knowledge graph and present its instantiation - EventKG. EventKG is a multilingual event-centric temporal knowledge graph that incorporates over 690 thousand events and over 2.3 million temporal relations obtained from several large-scale knowledge graphs and semi-structured sources and makes them available through a canonical RDF representation. Whereas popular entities often possess hundreds of relations within a temporal knowledge graph such as EventKG, generating a concise overview of the most important temporal relations for a given entity is a challenging task. In this article we demonstrate an application of EventKG to biographical timeline generation, where we adopt a distant supervision method to identify relations most relevant for an entity biography. Our evaluation results provide insights on the characteristics of EventKG and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed biographical timeline generation method.",

Recent attempts focused on either designing more complicated triple scoring models, or incorporating extra information beyond triples. This paper, by contrast, investigates the potential of using very simple constraints to improve KG embedding. We examine non-negativity constraints on entity representations and approximate entailment constraints on relation representations. The former help to learn compact and interpretable representations for entities. The latter further encode regularities of logical entailment between relations into their distributed representations. These constraints impose prior beliefs upon the structure of the embedding space, without negative impacts on efficiency or scalability. Evaluation on WordNet, Freebase, and DBpedia shows that our approach is simple yet surprisingly effective, significantly and consistently outperforming competitive baselines. The constraints imposed indeed improve model interpretability, leading to a substantially increased structuring of the embedding space.

General neural architectures that jointly learn representations and transformations of text are very data-inefficient, and it is hard to analyse their reasoning process. These issues are addressed by end-to-end differentiable reasoning systems such as Neural Theorem Provers (NTPs), although they can only be used with small-scale symbolic KBs. In this paper we first propose Greedy NTPs (GNTPs), an extension to NTPs addressing their complexity and scalability limitations, thus making them applicable to real-world datasets. This result is achieved by dynamically constructing the computation graph of NTPs and including only the most promising proof paths during inference, thus obtaining orders of magnitude more efficient models. Then, we propose a novel approach for jointly reasoning over KBs and textual mentions, by embedding logic facts and natural language sentences in a shared embedding space. We show that GNTPs perform on par with NTPs at a fraction of their cost while achieving competitive link prediction results on large datasets, providing explanations for predictions, and inducing interpretable models.

Most previous methods require that all entities should be seen during training, which is unpractical for real-world knowledge graphs with new entities emerging on a daily basis. Recent efforts on this issue suggest training a neighborhood aggregator in conjunction with the conventional entity and relation embeddings, which may help embed new entities inductively via their existing neighbors. However, their neighborhood aggregators neglect the unordered and unequal natures of an entity\u2019s neighbors. To this end, we summarize the desired properties that may lead to effective neighborhood aggregators. We also introduce a novel aggregator, namely, Logic Attention Network (LAN), which addresses the properties by aggregating neighbors with both rules- and network-based attention weights. By comparing with conventional aggregators on two knowledge graph completion tasks, we experimentally validate LAN\u2019s superiority in terms of the desired properties.",

Even though users\u2019 identity information is always removed, attackers can still de-anonymize users with the help of auxiliary information. To protect against de-anonymization attack, various privacy protection techniques for social networks have been proposed. However, most existing approaches assume specific and restrict network structure as background knowledge and ignore semantic level prior belief of attackers, which are not always realistic in practice and do not apply to arbitrary privacy scenarios. Moreover, the privacy inference attack in the presence of semantic background knowledge is barely investigated. To address these shortcomings, in this work, we introduce knowledge graphs to explicitly express arbitrary prior belief of the attacker for any individual user. The processes of de-anonymization and privacy inference are accordingly formulated based on knowledge graphs. Our experiment on data of real social networks shows that knowledge graphs can power de-anonymization and inference attacks, and thus increase the risk of privacy disclosure. This suggests the validity of knowledge graphs as a general effective model of attackers\u2019 background knowledge for social network attack and privacy preservation.",

            "abstract": "Inferring missing links in knowledge graphs (KG) has attracted a lot of attention from the research community. In this paper, we tackle a practical query answering task involving predicting the relation of a given entity pair. We frame this prediction problem as an inference problem in a probabilistic graphical model and aim at resolving it from a variational inference perspective. In order to model the relation between the query entity pair, we assume that there exists an underlying latent variable (paths connecting two nodes) in the KG, which carries the equivalent semantics of their relations. However, due to the intractability of connections in large KGs, we propose to use variation inference to maximize the evidence lower bound. More specifically, our framework (Diva) is composed of three modules, i.e. a posterior approximator, a prior (path finder), and a likelihood (path reasoner). By using variational inference, we are able to incorporate them closely into a unified architecture and jointly optimize them to perform KG reasoning. With active interactions among these sub-modules, Diva is better at handling noise and coping with more complex reasoning scenarios. In order to evaluate our method, we conduct the experiment of the link prediction task on multiple datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances on both datasets.",

We will discuss basic properties including cohomology and Hodge theory. The main feature of our approach is simplicity, requiring only knowledge of linear algebra and graph theory. We have also isolated the algebra from the topology to show that a large part of cohomology and Hodge theory is nothing more than the linear algebra of matrices satisfying $AB = 0$. For the remaining topological aspect, we cast our discussions entirely in terms of graphs as opposed to less-familiar topological objects like simplicial complexes.",

This is emphasized by recent discussions on the increasing proliferation of scientific literature and the reproducibility crisis. This presents an opportunity to rethink the dominant paradigm of document-centric scholarly information communication and transform it into knowledge-based information flows by representing and expressing information through semantically rich, interlinked knowledge graphs. At the core of knowledge-based information flows is the creation and evolution of information models that establish a common understanding of information communicated between stakeholders as well as the integration of these technologies into the infrastructure and processes of search and information exchange in the research library of the future. By integrating these models into existing and new research infrastructure services, the information structures that are currently still implicit and deeply hidden in documents can be made explicit and directly usable. This has the potential to revolutionize scientific work as information and research results can be seamlessly interlinked with each other and better matched to complex information needs. Furthermore, research results become directly comparable and easier to reuse. As our main contribution, we propose the vision of a knowledge graph for science, present a possible infrastructure for such a knowledge graph as well as our early attempts towards an implementation of the infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Knowledge graphs are useful for many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts. To populate the graphs, knowledge graph embedding models have been developed. Knowledge graph embedding models map entities and relations in a knowledge graph to a vector space and predict unknown triples by scoring candidate triples. TransE is the first translation-based method and it is well known because of its simplicity and efficiency for knowledge graph completion. It employs the principle that the differences between entity embeddings represent their relations. The principle seems very simple, but it can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge graph. However, TransE has a problem with its regularization. TransE forces entity embeddings to be on a sphere in the embedding vector space. This regularization warps the embeddings and makes it difficult for them to fulfill the abovementioned principle. The regularization also affects adversely the accuracies of the link predictions. On the other hand, regularization is important because entity embeddings diverge by negative sampling without it. This paper proposes a novel embedding model, TorusE, to solve the regularization problem. The principle of TransE can be defined on any Lie group. A torus, which is one of the compact Lie groups, can be chosen for the embedding space to avoid regularization. To the best of our knowledge, TorusE is the first model that embeds objects on other than a real or complex vector space, and this paper is the first to formally discuss the problem of regularization of TransE. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as TransE, DistMult and ComplEx on a standard link prediction task. We show that TorusE is scalable to large-size knowledge graphs and is faster than the original TransE.\n \n",

Traditional knowledge representation learning (KRL) methods usually treat a single triple as a training unit, neglecting the usage of graph contextualized knowledge. To utilize these unexploited graph-level knowledge, we propose an approach to model subgraphs in a medical KG. Then, the learned knowledge is integrated with a pre-trained language model to do the knowledge generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several medical NLP tasks, and the improvement above MedERNIE indicates that graph contextualized knowledge is beneficial.",

            "abstract": "Complex-valued representations have demonstrated promising results on modeling relational data, i.e., knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a new knowledge graph embedding method. More concretely, we move beyond standard complex representations, adopting expressive hypercomplex representations for learning representations of entities and relations. Hypercomplex embeddings, or Quaternion embeddings (QuatE), are complex valued embeddings with three imaginary components. Different from standard complex (Hermitian) inner product, latent inter-dependencies (between all components) are aptly captured via the Hamilton product in Quaternion space, encouraging a more efficient and expressive representation learning process. Moreover, Quaternions are intuitively desirable for smooth and pure rotation in vector space, preventing noise from sheer/scaling operators. Finally, Quaternion inductive biases enjoy and satisfy the key desiderata of relational representation learning (i.e., modeling symmetry, anti-symmetry and inversion). Experimental results demonstrate that QuatE achieves state-of-the-art performance on four well-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "In this document I provide a hands-on introduction to both factor graphs and GTSAM. Factor graphs are graphical models (Koller and Friedman, 2009) that are well suited to modeling complex estimation problems, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) or Structure from Motion (SFM). You might be familiar with another often used graphical model, Bayes networks, which are directed acyclic graphs. A factor graph, however, is a bipartite graph consisting of factors connected to variables. The variables represent the unknown random variables in the estimation problem, whereas the factors represent probabilistic information on those variables, derived from measurements or prior knowledge. In the following sections I will show many examples from both robotics and vision. The GTSAM toolbox (GTSAM stands for \u201cGeorgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping\u201d) toolbox is a BSD-licensed C++ library based on factor graphs, developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology by myself, many of my students, and collaborators. It provides state of the art solutions to the SLAM and SFM problems, but can also be used to model and solve both simpler and more complex estimation problems. It also provides a MATLAB interface which allows for rapid prototype development, visualization, and user interaction. GTSAM exploits sparsity to be computationally efficient. Typically measurements only provide information on the relationship between a handful of variables, and hence the resulting factor graph will be sparsely connected. This is exploited by the algorithms implemented in GTSAM to reduce computational complexity. Even when graphs are too dense to be handled efficiently by direct methods, GTSAM provides iterative methods that are quite efficient regardless.

Unfortunately, existing scientific knowledge graphs (SciKGs) represent factual knowledge as a flat relational network of concepts, as same as the KGs in general domain, without considering the conditions of the facts being valid, which loses important contexts for inference and exploration. In this work, we propose a novel representation of SciKG, which has three layers. The first layer has concept nodes, attribute nodes, as well as the attaching links from attribute to concept. The second layer represents both fact tuples and condition tuples. Each tuple is a node of the relation name, connecting to the subject and object that are concept or attribute nodes in the first layer. The third layer has nodes of statement sentences traceable to the original paper and authors. Each statement node connects to a set of fact tuples and/or condition tuples in the second layer. We design a semi-supervised Multi-Input Multi-Output sequence labeling model that learns complex dependencies between the sequence tags from multiple signals and generates output sequences for fact and condition tuples. It has a self-training module of multiple strategies to leverage the massive scientific data for better performance when manual annotation is limited. Experiments on a data set of 141M sentences show that our model outperforms existing methods and the SciKGs we constructed provide a good understanding of the scientific statements.",

Major themes include the relationships between knowledge graphs and machine learning, the use of natural language processing to construct knowledge graphs, and the expansion of novel knowledge-based approaches to clinical and biological domains.",

            "abstract": "Learning the underlying patterns in data goes beyond instance-based generalization to external knowledge represented in structured graphs or networks. Deep learning that primarily constitutes neural computing stream in AI has shown significant advances in probabilistically learning latent patterns using a multi-layered network of computational nodes (i.e., neurons/hidden units). Structured knowledge that underlies symbolic computing approaches and often supports reasoning, has also seen significant growth in recent years, in the form of broad-based (e.g., DBPedia, Yago) and domain, industry or application specific knowledge graphs. A common substrate with careful integration of the two will raise opportunities to develop neuro-symbolic learning approaches for AI, where conceptual and probabilistic representations are combined. As the incorporation of external knowledge will aid in supervising the learning of features for the model, deep infusion of representational knowledge from knowledge graphs within hidden layers will further enhance the learning process. Although much work remains, we believe that knowledge graphs will play an increasing role in developing hybrid neuro-symbolic intelligent systems (bottom-up deep learning with top-down symbolic computing) as well as in building explainable AI systems for which knowledge graphs will provide scaffolding for punctuating neural computing. In this position paper, we describe our motivation for such a neuro-symbolic approach and framework that combines knowledge graph and neural networks.",

EDRM represents queries and documents by their words and entity annotations. The semantics from knowledge graphs are integrated in the distributed representations of their entities, while the ranking is conducted by interaction-based neural ranking networks. The two components are learned end-to-end, making EDRM a natural combination of entity-oriented search and neural information retrieval. Our experiments on a commercial search log demonstrate the effectiveness of EDRM. Our analyses reveal that knowledge graph semantics significantly improve the generalization ability of neural ranking models.",

To address that, in this paper, we propose a State Transition-based approach to translate a complex natural language question N to a semantic query graph (SQG), which is used to match the underlying knowledge graph to find the answers to question N. In order to generate SQG, we propose four primitive operations (expand, fold, connect and merge) and a learning-based state transition approach. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks (such as QALD, WebQuestions and ComplexQuestions) with two knowledge bases (DBpedia and Freebase) confirm the superiority of our approach compared with state-of-the-arts.",

In this paper, we present AceKG, a new large-scale KG in academic domain. AceKG not only provides clean academic information, but also offers a large-scale benchmark dataset for researchers to conduct challenging data mining projects including link prediction, community detection and scholar classification. Specifically, AceKG describes 3.13 billion triples of academic facts based on a consistent ontology, including necessary properties of papers, authors, fields of study, venues and institutes, as well as the relations among them. To enrich the proposed knowledge graph, we also perform entity alignment with existing databases and rule-based inference. Based on AceKG, we conduct experiments of three typical academic data mining tasks and evaluate several state-of-the-art knowledge embedding and network representation learning approaches on the benchmark datasets built from AceKG. Finally, we discuss promising research directions that benefit from AceKG.",

A key challenge of the task is to filter out \u201cirrelevant\u201d facts extracted from corpus, in order to maintain an effective search space during path inference. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework to train two collaborative agents jointly, i.e., a multi-hop graph reasoner and a fact extractor. The fact extraction agent generates fact triples from corpora to enrich the graph on the fly; while the reasoning agent provides feedback to the fact extractor and guides it towards promoting facts that are helpful for the interpretable reasoning.

Previous work usually utilizes knowledge graphs such as ConceptNet as external knowledge, and extracts triples from them to enhance the initial representation of the machine comprehension context. However, such method cannot capture the structural information in the knowledge graph. To this end, we propose a Structural Knowledge Graph-aware Network(SKG) model, constructing sub-graphs for entities in the machine comprehension context. Our method dynamically updates the representation of the knowledge according to the structural information of the constructed sub-graph. Experiments show that SKG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ReCoRD dataset.",

            "abstract": "Representing words into vectors in continuous space can form up a potentially powerful basis to generate high-quality textual features for many text mining and natural language processing tasks. Some recent efforts, such as the skip-gram model, have attempted to learn word representations that can capture both syntactic and semantic information among text corpus. However, they still lack the capability of encoding the properties of words and the complex relationships among words very well, since text itself often contains incomplete and ambiguous information. Fortunately, knowledge graphs provide a golden mine for enhancing the quality of learned word representations. In particular, a knowledge graph, usually composed by entities (words, phrases, etc.), relations between entities, and some corresponding meta information, can supply invaluable relational knowledge that encodes the relationship between entities as well as categorical knowledge that encodes the attributes or properties of entities. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework called RC-NET to leverage both the relational and categorical knowledge to produce word representations of higher quality. Specifically, we build the relational knowledge and the categorical knowledge into two separate regularization functions, and combine both of them with the original objective function of the skip-gram model. By solving this combined optimization problem using back propagation neural networks, we can obtain word representations enhanced by the knowledge graph. Experiments on popular text mining and natural language processing tasks, including analogical reasoning, word similarity, and topic prediction, have all demonstrated that our model can significantly improve the quality of word representations.",

One prominent goal of these approaches is to improve the quality of knowledge graphs by removing errors and adding missing facts. Surprisingly, most embedding techniques have been evaluated on benchmark datasets consisting of dense and reliable subsets of human-curated KGs, which tend to be fairly complete and have few errors. In this paper, we consider the problem of applying embedding techniques to KGs extracted from text, which are often incomplete and contain errors. We compare the sparsity and unreliability of different KGs and perform empirical experiments demonstrating how embedding approaches degrade as sparsity and unreliability increase.",

However, even though these KGs are impressively large, most of them are suffering from incompleteness, which leads to performance degradation of AI applications. Most existing researches are focusing on knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. Nevertheless, those models simply embed entities and relations into latent vectors without leveraging the rich information from the relation structure. Indeed, relations in KGs conform to a three-layer hierarchical relation structure (HRS), i.e., semantically similar relations can make up relation clusters and some relations can be further split into several fine-grained sub-relations. Relation clusters, relations and sub-relations can fit in the top, the middle and the bottom layer of three-layer HRS respectively. To this end, in this paper, we extend existing KGE models TransE, TransH and DistMult, to learn knowledge representations by leveraging the information from the HRS. Particularly, our approach is capable to extend other KGE models. Finally, the experiment results clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against baselines.",

Manually authoring the domain models is costly and thus not scalable. We present a novel class of story generation system that can generate stories in an unknown domain. Our system (a) automatically learns a domain model by crowdsourcing a corpus of narrative examples and (b) generates stories by sampling from the space defined by the domain model. A large-scale evaluation shows that stories generated by our system for a previously unknown topic are comparable in quality to simple stories authored by untrained humans\n \n",

In this paper, we explore the problem of automatically generating question answer pairs from a given knowledge graph. The generated question answer (QA) pairs can be used in several downstream applications. For example, they could be used for training better QA systems. To generate such QA pairs, we first extract a set of keywords from entities and relationships expressed in a triple stored in the knowledge graph. From each such set, we use a subset of keywords to generate a natural language question that has a unique answer. We treat this subset of keywords as a sequence and propose a sequence to sequence model using RNN to generate a natural language question from it. Our RNN based model generates QA pairs with an accuracy of 33.61 percent and performs 110.47 percent (relative) better than a state-of-the-art template based method for generating natural language question from keywords. We also do an extrinsic evaluation by using the generated QA pairs to train a QA system and observe that the F1-score of the QA system improves by 5.5 percent (relative) when using automatically generated QA pairs in addition to manually generated QA pairs available for training.",

Existing works for integrating and utilizing the TMK mainly focus on straightforward connections establishment and pay less attention to make computers interpret and retrieve knowledge correctly and quickly. In this paper, we explore a novel model to organize and integrate the TMK into conceptual graphs. We then employ a framework to automatically retrieve knowledge in knowledge graphs with a high precision. In order to perform reasonable inference on knowledge graphs, we propose a contextual inference pruning algorithm to achieve efficient chain inference. Our algorithm achieves a better inference result with precision and recall of 92% and 96%, respectively, which can avoid most of the meaningless inferences. In addition, we implement two prototypes and provide services, and the results show our approach is practical and effective.",

Previously, most works focused on symbolic representation of knowledge graph with structure information, which can not handle new entities or entities with few facts well. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture to utilize both structural and textual information of entities. Specifically, we introduce three neural models to encode the valuable information from text description of entity, among which an attentive model can select related information as needed. Then, a gating mechanism is applied to integrate representations of structure and text into a unified architecture. Experiments show that our models outperform baseline and obtain state-of-the-art results on link prediction and triplet classification tasks.",

            "abstract": "Machine Learning has been the quintessential solution for many AI problems, but learning models are heavily dependent on specific training data. Some learning models can be incorporated with prior knowledge using a Bayesian setup, but these learning models do not have the ability to access any organized world knowledge on demand. In this work, we propose to enhance learning models with world knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph (KG) fact triples for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Our aim is to develop a deep learning model that can extract relevant prior support facts from knowledge graphs depending on the task using attention mechanism. We introduce a convolution-based model for learning representations of knowledge graph entity and relation clusters in order to reduce the attention space. We show that the proposed method is highly scalable to the amount of prior information that has to be processed and can be applied to any generic NLP task. Using this method we show significant improvement in performance for text classification with 20Newsgroups (News20) & DBPedia datasets, and natural language inference with Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. We also demonstrate that a deep learning model can be trained with substantially less amount of labeled training data, when it has access to organized world knowledge in the form of a knowledge base.",

At Amazon we are building a Product Graph, an authoritative knowledge graph for all products in the world. The thousands of product verticals we need to model, the vast number of data sources we need to extract knowledge from, the huge volume of new products we need to handle every day, and the various applications in Search, Discovery, Personalization, Voice, that we wish to support, all present big challenges in constructing such a graph. In this talk we describe four scientific directions we are investigating in building and using such a knowledge graph. First, we have been developing advanced extraction technologies to harvest product knowledge from semi-structured sources on the web and from text product profiles. Our annotation-based extraction tool selects a few webpages (typically below 10 pages) from a website for annotations, and can derive XPaths to extract from the whole website with average precision and recall of 97% [1]. Our distantly supervised extraction tool, CERES, uses an existing knowledge graph to automatically generate (noisy) training labels, and can obtain a precision over 90% when extracting from long-tail websites in various languages [1]. Our OpenTag technique extends state-of-the-art techniques such as Recursive Neural Network (RNN) and Conditional Random Field with attention and active learning, to achieve over 90% precision and recall in extracting attribute values (including values unseen in training data) from product titles, descriptions, and bullets [3].",

            "abstract": "Missing data is a severe problem for algorithms that operate over knowledge graphs (KGs). Most previous research in KG completion has focused on the problem of inferring missing entities and missing relation types between entities. However, in addition to these, many KGs also suffer from missing entity types (i.e. the category labels for entities, such as /music/artist). Entity types are a critical enabler for many NLP tasks that use KGs as a reference source, and inferring missing entity types remains an important outstanding obstacle in the field of KG completion. Inspired by recent work to build a contextual KG embedding model, we propose a novel approach to address the entity type prediction problem. We compare the performance of our method with several state-of-the-art KG embedding methods, and show that our approach gives higher prediction accuracy compared to baseline algorithms on two real-world datasets. Our approach also produces consistently high accuracy when inferring entities and relation types, as well as the primary task of inferring entity types. This is in contrast to many of the baseline methods that specialize in one prediction task or another. We achieve this while preserving linear scalability with the number of entity types.

            "abstract": "The Industrial Knowledge Graph has become an integral elements in Siemens\u2019 digitalization strategy towards integlligent engineering and manufacturing. In the presentation, we will share details on how semantic technologies are used in Industrial Knowledge Graph use cases and generate business value in real-world applications. Siemens is building an intelligent knowledge hub that can support knowledgedriven applications across the company, and serve as a smart knowledge factory generating new knowledge. Towards this end, we are creating an industrial knowledge graph as an intelligible domain model to support the easy integration of multiple data sources and to provide a formal semantic representation to enable inference and machine processing. The path towards this goal involves four major steps: First, we extend single data silos with domain-specific models for many use cases, knowledge graphs can already generate value on this level, for instance by facilitating information access for domain users. Next, we connect the different islands by integrating their individual models, thereby enabling for information flow between silos. Our third step is the formation of an integrated Siemens Data Space from those linked islands. Here, our focus lies on a tighter and more consistent integration, together with a more sophisticated framework of higher-level models mediating between domains and use cases. This integrated data space then serves as the basis for our fourth stage, where the integration of graph-specific machine learning capabilities transforms the passive data space into an active knowledge factory building on the vast amount of knowledge available within Siemens. Siemens\u2019 industrial knowledge graph applications are implemented on a general knowledge graph infrastructure developed by Siemens together with metaphacts including the metaphactory platform, graph databases such as Amazon Neptune, and others, with the following main components: \u2013 a scalable graph database backend for query processing and analytics, \u2013 a data integration layer for both phyiscal as well as virtualized integration and federation across heterogeneous and distributed data sources, 3 http://www.metaphacts.com/product/ 4 https://de.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/new-launch-amazon-neptuneoverview-and-customer-use-cases-dat319-reinvent-2017 \u2013 end-user oriented interaction components for semantic search, visualization, exploration of data, \u2013 expert-user oriented components for knowledge graph management, including components for authoring and maintenance of knowledge assets such as ontologies, vocabularies, instance data, and queries, \u2013 a knowlegde graph middleware comprising components and services for rapid application development for specific knowledge graph solutions as well as interfaces to third party applications. In the presentation, we will showcase several of the industrial knolwedge graph use cases involving various user groups and application areas: Building Digital Twin: The knowledge graph is used to integrate and represent knowledge about a building in order to create a full virtual copy (Digital Twin) of the real building. This virtual representation comprises a model of the building, which describes the whole structure and physical shape of the building, as well as dynamic sensor data about the current state of the building, such temperatures, humidity and other parameters. Based on this integrated information space run several applications for building management and services. Risk Management: Industry projects need careful planning and constant monitoring of all potential risks. On the financial side, the relations between all stakeholders, investors and partners, as well as their investments and information about them, such as official legal location, currencies and similar parameters are integrated in one knowledge graph. The internal data is augmented with external data from third-parties to cover additional areas. This integrated knowledge graph allows to discover risks unable to be seen before, to assess potential conflicts of interest as well as to monitor portfolios and keep KPIs on track. Process Monitoring: Production processes involve many steps, which are highly automated using Siemens\u2019 technology. Each valve and control unit produces data, which is integrated to the model describing each physical component and device in one knowledge graph allowing a comprehensive process supervision. Machine Service Operations: Large industry machine, such as turbines, transformers or generators, are valuable assets and are kept in maintenance program. All events are documented in high detail. Having all maintenance events, model of the machines, information about location, usage and connected components in one knowledge graphs allows for better maintenance cycles in terms of prediction and error detection, which yields higher availability and lower costs. Factory Monitoring: Having machines and processes modeled, the obvious next step is to have the entire factory integrated in a knowledge graph. Already in the planning phase of a production plant, but also during construction and operation, the knowledge graph is the basis for getting faster insights into dependencies and relations and allows comprehensive supervision and monitoring. For each of the use cases, we will emphasize challenges, demonstrate how knowledge graph technology is used to address these challenges, provide technical solutions, and explain the generated business value. We will share our practical experiences and lessons learned on aspects of technology maturity, scalability and performance and end user experience. Further, we will discuss open research challenges and future work in the areas of data virtualization and federation, integration of knowledge graphs and machine learning techniques, as well as end-user oriented interfaces for knowledge modelling and data transformation.",

We show that the random walk probabilities computed (at great expense) by PRA provide no discernible benefit to performance on this task, so they can safely be dropped. This allows us to define a simpler algorithm for generating feature matrices from graphs, which we call subgraph feature extraction (SFE). In addition to being conceptually simpler than PRA, SFE is much more efficient, reducing computation by an order of magnitude, and more expressive, allowing for much richer features than paths between two nodes in a graph. We show experimentally that this technique gives substantially better performance than PRA and its variants, improving mean average precision from .432 to .528 on a knowledge base completion task using the NELL KB.",

A standard approach distributes the graph over a cluster of nodes, but performing computations on a distributed graph is expensive if large amount of data have to be moved. Without partitioning the graph, communication quickly becomes a limiting factor in scaling the system up. Existing graph partitioning heuristics incur high computation and communication cost on large graphs, sometimes as high as the future computation itself. Observing that the graph has to be loaded into the cluster, we ask if the partitioning can be done at the same time with a lightweight streaming algorithm.\n We propose natural, simple heuristics and compare their performance to hashing and METIS, a fast, offline heuristic. We show on a large collection of graph datasets that our heuristics are a significant improvement, with the best obtaining an average gain of 76%. The heuristics are scalable in the size of the graphs and the number of partitions. Using our streaming partitioning methods, we are able to speed up PageRank computations on Spark, a distributed computation system, by 18% to 39% for large social networks.",

Most of the existing methods perform this task based solely on observed facts. The only requirement is that the learned embeddings should be compatible within each individual fact. In this paper, aiming at further discovering the intrinsic geometric structure of the embedding space, we propose Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE). The key idea of SSE is to take full advantage of additional semantic information and enforce the embedding space to be semantically smooth, i.e., entities belonging to the same semantic category will lie close to each other in the embedding space. Two manifold learning algorithms Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding are used to model the smoothness assumption. Both are formulated as geometrically based regularization terms to constrain the embedding task. We empirically evaluate SSE in two benchmark tasks of link prediction and triple classification, and achieve significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, SSE is a general framework. The smoothness assumption can be imposed to a wide variety of embedding models, and it can also be constructed using other information besides entities\u2019 semantic categories.",

We present evidence that this structure is similar to a labeled graph: a network of topological connections between places, labeled with local metric information. In contrast to route knowledge, we find that the most frequent routes and detours to target locations had not been traveled during learning. Contrary to purely topological knowledge, participants typically traveled the shortest metric distance to a target, rather than topologically equivalent but longer paths. The results are consistent with the proposal that people learn a labeled graph of their environment.",

However, such models without any human knowledge often produce topics that are not interpretable. In recent years, a number of knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, but they could not process fact-oriented triple knowledge in knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embeddings, on the other hand, automatically capture relations between entities in knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-based topic model by incorporating knowledge graph embeddings into topic modeling. By combining latent Dirichlet allocation, a widely used topic model with knowledge encoded by entity vectors, we improve the semantic coherence significantly and capture a better representation of a document in the topic space. Our evaluation results will demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\n \n",
