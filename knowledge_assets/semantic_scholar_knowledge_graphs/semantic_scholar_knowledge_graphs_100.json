Entities, in this context, are usually taken to be anyone or anything considered to be globally important. This, however, rules out many entities people interact with on a daily basis. In this position paper, we present the concept of personal knowledge graphs: resources of structured information about entities personally related to its user, including the ones that might not be globally important. We discuss key aspects that separate them for general knowledge graphs, identify the main challenges involved in constructing and using them, and define a research agenda.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph, or knowledge base, plays an important role in a variety of applications in the field of artificial intelligence. In both research and application of knowledge graph, knowledge representation learning is one of the fundamental tasks. Existing representation learning approaches are mainly based on structural knowledge between entities and relations, while knowledge among entities per se is largely ignored. Though a few approaches integrated entity knowledge while learning representations, these methods lack the flexibility to apply to multimodalities. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a new representation learning method, TransAE, by combining multimodal autoencoder with TransE model, where TransE is a simple and effective representation learning method for knowledge graphs. In TransAE, the hidden layer of autoencoder is used as the representation of entities in the TransE model, thus it encodes not only the structural knowledge, but also the multimodal knowledge, such as visual and textural knowledge, into the final representation. Compared with traditional methods based on only structural knowledge, TransAE can significantly improve the performance in the sense of link prediction and triplet classification. Also, TransAE has the ability to learn representations for entities out of knowledge base in zero-shot. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TransAE method.",

Prior work on automating this task focuses on estimating truthfulness using numerical scores which are not human-interpretable. Others extract explicit mentions of the candidate fact in the text as an evidence for the candidate fact, which can be hard to directly spot. In our work, we introduce ExFaKT, a framework focused on generating human-comprehensible explanations for candidate facts. ExFaKT uses background knowledge encoded in the form of Horn clauses to rewrite the fact in question into a set of other easier-to-spot facts. The final output of our framework is a set of semantic traces for the candidate fact from both text and knowledge graphs. The experiments demonstrate that our rewritings significantly increase the recall of fact-spotting while preserving high precision. Moreover, we show that the explanations effectively help humans to perform fact-checking and can also be exploited for automating this task.",

Many existing methods construct a structured query for the input question based on a syntactic parser. Once the input question is parsed incorrectly, a false structured query will be generated, which may result in false or incomplete answers. The problem gets worse especially for complex questions. In this paper, we propose a novel systematic method to understand natural language questions by using a large number of binary templates rather than semantic parsers. As sufficient templates are critical in the procedure, we present a low-cost approach that can build a huge number of templates automatically. To reduce the search space, we carefully devise an index to facilitate the online template decomposition. Moreover, we design effective strategies to perform the two-level disambiguations (i.e., entity-level ambiguity and structure-level ambiguity) by considering the query semantics. Extensive experiments over several benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective as it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both precision and recall.",

Its popularity is clearly in-\ufb02uenced by the introduction of Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph in 2012, and since then the term has been widely used without a de\ufb01nition. A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph, although no o\ufb03cial documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a de\ufb01nition that is free from ambiguity. We tackle this issue by discussing and de\ufb01ning the term knowledge graph, considering its history and diversity in interpretations and use. Our goal is to propose a de\ufb01nition of knowledge graphs that serves as basis for discussions on this topic and contributes to a common vision.",

In such a conversational setting, the user's inputs are often incomplete, with entities or predicates left out, and ungrammatical phrases. This poses a huge challenge to question answering (QA) systems that typically rely on cues in full-fledged interrogative sentences. As a solution, we develop CONVEX, an unsupervised method that can answer incomplete questions over a knowledge graph (KG) by maintaining conversation context using entities and predicates seen so far and automatically inferring missing or ambiguous pieces for follow-up questions. The core of our method is a graph exploration algorithm that judiciously expands a frontier to find candidate answers for the current question. To evaluate CONVEX, we release ConvQuestions, a crowdsourced benchmark with 11,200 distinct conversations from five different domains. We show that CONVEX: (i) adds conversational support to any stand-alone QA system, and (ii) outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and question completion strategies.",

Conversational AI simulates conversations with humans; however, it is limited by the data captured in the training datasets. In contrast, QASs retrieve the most recent information from a KG by understanding and translating the natural language question into a formal query supported by the database engine. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the characteristics of the existing alternatives towards combining both worlds into novel KG chatbots. Our framework compares two representative conversational models, ChatGPT and Galactica, against KGQAN, the current state-of-the-art QAS. We conduct a thorough evaluation using four real KGs across various application domains to identify the current limitations of each category of systems. Based on our findings, we propose open research opportunities to empower QASs with chatbot capabilities for KGs. All benchmarks and all raw results are available1 for further analysis.",

It builds these graphs recurrently for each step of the described procedure, and uses them to track the evolving states of participant entities. We harness and extend a recently proposed machine reading comprehension (MRC) model to query for entity states, since these states are generally communicated in spans of text and MRC models perform well in extracting entity-centric spans. The explicit, structured, and evolving knowledge graph representations that our model constructs can be used in downstream question answering tasks to improve machine comprehension of text, as we demonstrate empirically. On two comprehension tasks from the recently proposed PROPARA dataset (Dalvi et al., 2018), our model achieves state-of-the-art results. We further show that our model is competitive on the RECIPES dataset (Kiddon et al., 2015), suggesting it may be generally applicable. We present some evidence that the model\u2019s knowledge graphs help it to impose commonsense constraints on its predictions.",

To answer a natural language question, the existing work takes a two-stage approach: question understanding and query evaluation. Their focus is on question understanding to deal with the disambiguation of the natural language phrases. The most common technique is the joint disambiguation, which has the exponential search space. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to answer natural language questions over RDF repository (RDF Q/A) from a graph data-driven perspective. We propose a semantic query graph to model the query intention in the natural language question in a structural way, based on which, RDF Q/A is reduced to subgraph matching problem. More importantly, we resolve the ambiguity of natural language questions at the time when matches of query are found. The cost of disambiguation is saved if there are no matching found. More specifically, we propose two different frameworks to build the semantic query graph, one is relation (edge)-first and the other one is node-first. We compare our method with some state-of-the-art RDF Q/A systems in the benchmark dataset. Extensive experiments confirm that our method not only improves the precision but also speeds up query performance greatly.",

Traditionally, machine learning models for graphs have been mostly designed for static graphs. However, many applications involve evolving graphs. This introduces important challenges for learning and inference since nodes, attributes, and edges change over time. In this survey, we review the recent advances in representation learning for dynamic graphs, including dynamic knowledge graphs. We describe existing models from an encoder-decoder perspective, categorize these encoders and decoders based on the techniques they employ, and analyze the approaches in each category. We also review several prominent applications and widely used datasets, and highlight directions for future research.",

Simple questions, which can be answered by the extraction of a single fact, constitute a large part of questions asked on the web but still pose challenges to QA systems, especially when asked against a large knowledge resource. Existing QA systems usually rely on various components each specialised in solving different sub-tasks of the problem (such as segmentation, entity recognition, disambiguation, and relation classification etc.). In this work, we follow a quite different approach: We train a neural network for answering simple questions in an end-to-end manner, leaving all decisions to the model. It learns to rank subject-predicate pairs to enable the retrieval of relevant facts given a question. The network contains a nested word/character-level question encoder which allows to handle out-of-vocabulary and rare word problems while still being able to exploit word-level semantics. Our approach achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches that rely on an attention mechanism.",

Inspired by the way humans utilize semantic knowledge between objects of interests, we propose a framework that incorporates knowledge graphs for describing the relationships between multiple labels. Our model learns an information propagation mechanism from the semantic label space, which can be applied to model the interdependencies between seen and unseen class labels. With such investigation of structured knowledge graphs for visual reasoning, we show that our model can be applied for solving multi-label classification and ML-ZSL tasks. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, comparable or improved performances can be achieved by our method.",

            "abstract": "Embedding methods which enforce a partial order or lattice structure over the concept space, such as Order Embeddings (OE), are a natural way to model transitive relational data (e.g. entailment graphs). However, OE learns a deterministic knowledge base, limiting expressiveness of queries and the ability to use uncertainty for both prediction and learning (e.g. learning from expectations). Probabilistic extensions of OE have provided the ability to somewhat calibrate these denotational probabilities while retaining the consistency and inductive bias of ordered models, but lack the ability to model the negative correlations found in real-world knowledge. In this work we show that a broad class of models that assign probability measures to OE can never capture negative correlation, which motivates our construction of a novel box lattice and accompanying probability measure to capture anti-correlation and even disjoint concepts, while still providing the benefits of probabilistic modeling, such as the ability to perform rich joint and conditional queries over arbitrary sets of concepts, and both learning from and predicting calibrated uncertainty. We show improvements over previous approaches in modeling the Flickr and WordNet entailment graphs, and investigate the power of the model.",

The evolution of search engine responses to user queries in the last few years is partly because of the role of KGs such as Google KG. KGs are significantly contributing to various AI applications from link prediction, entity relations prediction, node classification to recommendation and question answering systems. This article is an attempt to summarize the journey of KG for AI.",

Previous work on semantic similarity methods have focused on either the structure of the semantic network between concepts (e.g., path length and depth), or only on the Information Content (IC) of concepts. We propose a semantic similarity method, namely wpath, to combine these two approaches, using IC to weight the shortest path length between concepts. Conventional corpus-based IC is computed from the distributions of concepts over textual corpus, which is required to prepare a domain corpus containing annotated concepts and has high computational cost. As instances are already extracted from textual corpus and annotated by concepts in KGs, graph-based IC is proposed to compute IC based on the distributions of concepts over instances. Through experiments performed on well known word similarity datasets, we show that the wpath semantic similarity method has produced a statistically significant improvement over other semantic similarity methods. Moreover, in a real category classification evaluation, the wpath method has shown the best performance in terms of accuracy and F score.",

The two types of graphs can contain distinct and complementary information for the same entities/nodes. However, previous works focus either on knowledge graph embedding or behavior graph embedding while few works consider both in a unified way. Here we present BEM, a Bayesian framework that incorporates the information from knowledge graphs and behavior graphs. To be more specific, BEM takes as prior the pre-trained embeddings from the knowledge graph, and integrates them with the pre-trained embeddings from the behavior graphs via a Bayesian generative model. BEM is able to mutually refine the embeddings from both sides while preserving their own topological structures. To show the superiority of our method, we conduct a range of experiments on three benchmark datasets: node classification, link prediction, triplet classification on two small datasets related to Freebase, and item recommendation on a large-scale e-commerce dataset.",

However, traditional centralized construction of knowledge graph faces many challenges, such as laborious and time-consuming, vulnerable to manipulation or tampering, lacking scrutiny, among others. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel decentralized knowledge graph construction method by means of crowdsourcing, and the business logic of crowdsourcing is implemented by blockchain-powered smart contracts to guarantee the transparency, integrity, and auditability. On this basis, the decentralized knowledge graph is used for a deep recommender system, and case studies validate the effectiveness of the system. This paper is aimed at providing a novel decentralized approach for constructing knowledge graph and serving as reference and guidance for future research and practical applications of knowledge graph.",

            "abstract": "Representation learning of knowledge graphs aims to encode both entities and relations into a continuous low-dimensional vector space. Most existing methods only concentrate on learning representations with structured information located in triples, regardless of the rich information located in hierarchical types of entities, which could be collected in most knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Type-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning (TKRL) to take advantages of hierarchical entity types. We suggest that entities should have multiple representations in different types. More specifically, we consider hierarchical types as projection matrices for entities, with two type encoders designed to model hierarchical structures. Meanwhile, type information is also utilized as relation-specific type constraints. We evaluate our models on two tasks including knowledge graph completion and triple classification, and further explore the performances on long-tail dataset. Experimental results show that our models significantly outperform all baselines on both tasks, especially with long-tail distribution. It indicates that our models are capable of capturing hierarchical type information which is significant when constructing representations of knowledge graphs.

Humans can learn about the characteristics of objects and the relationships that occur between them to learn a large variety of visual concepts, often with few examples. This paper investigates the use of structured prior knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs and shows that using this knowledge improves performance on image classification. We build on recent work on end-to-end learning on graphs, introducing the Graph Search Neural Network as a way of efficiently incorporating large knowledge graphs into a vision classification pipeline. We show in a number of experiments that our method outperforms standard neural network baselines for multi-label classification.",

Adopting a straightforward decomposition of the problem into entity detection, entity linking, relation prediction, and evidence combination, we explore simple yet strong baselines. On the popular SimpleQuestions dataset, we find that basic LSTMs and GRUs plus a few heuristics yield accuracies that approach the state of the art, and techniques that do not use neural networks also perform reasonably well. These results show that gains from sophisticated deep learning techniques proposed in the literature are quite modest and that some previous models exhibit unnecessary complexity.",

This observation gives rise to evolving knowledge graphs whose structure temporally grows over time. However, both the modal characterization and the algorithmic implementation of evolving knowledge graphs remain unexplored. To this end, we propose EvolveKG, a framework that reveals cross-time knowledge interaction with desirable performance of storage and computation. The novelty of EvolveKG lies in Derivative Graph \u2013 a static weighted snapshot of evolution at a certain time. Particularly, each weight quantifies knowledge effectiveness with a temporarily decaying function of consistency and attenuation, two proposed factors depicting whether or not the effectiveness of a fact fades away with time. Thanks to the cross-time interaction, EvolveKG allows future knowledge prediction by virtue of the influence from the historical ones. Empirically tested under two real datasets, the superiority of EvolveKG is confirmed via its prediction accuracy.",

Leveraging this wealth of heterogeneous information for top-N item recommendation is a challenging task, as it requires the ability of effectively encoding a diversity of semantic relations and connectivity patterns. In this work, we propose entity2rec, a novel approach to learning user-item relatedness from knowledge graphs for top-N item recommendation. We start from a knowledge graph modeling user-item and item-item relations and we learn property-specific vector representations of users and items applying neural language models on the network. These representations are used to create property-specific user-item relatedness features, which are in turn fed into learning to rank algorithms to learn a global relatedness model that optimizes top-N item recommendations. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of ranking quality on the MovieLens 1M dataset, outperforming a number of state-of-the-art recommender systems, and we assess the importance of property-specific relatedness scores on the overall ranking quality.",

Existing state-of-the-art algorithms, including deep neural networks, only focus on utilizing features within an image itself, largely neglecting the vast amount of background knowledge about the real world. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of knowledge-aware object detection, which enables the integration of external knowledge such as knowledge graphs into any object detection algorithm. The framework employs the notion of semantic consistency to quantify and generalize knowledge, which improves object detection through a re-optimization process to achieve better consistency with background knowledge. Finally, empirical evaluation on two benchmark datasets show that our approach can significantly increase recall by up to 6.3 points without compromising mean average precision, when compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.",

In recent years, knowledge graph has been widely applied in different kinds of applications, such as semantic search, question answering, knowledge management and so on. Techniques for building Chinese knowledge graphs are also developing rapidly and different Chinese knowledge graphs have been constructed to support various applications. Under the background of the \u201cOne Belt One Road (OBOR)\u201d initiative, cooperating with the countries along OBOR on studying knowledge graph techniques and applications will greatly promote the development of artificial intelligence. At the same time, the accumulated experience of China in developing knowledge graphs is also a good reference to develop non-English knowledge graphs. In this paper, we aim to introduce the techniques of constructing Chinese knowledge graphs and their applications, as well as analyse the impact of knowledge graph on OBOR. We first describe the background of OBOR, and then introduce the concept and development history of knowledge graph and typical Chinese knowledge graphs. Afterwards, we present the details of techniques for constructing Chinese knowledge graphs, and demonstrate several applications of Chinese knowledge graphs. Finally, we list some examples to explain the potential impacts of knowledge graph on OBOR.",

We first extract the sets of properties associated with individual entities; these property sets (aka. characteristic sets) are annotated with cardinalities and used to induce a lattice based on set-containment relations, forming a natural hierarchical structure describing the knowledge graph. We then propose an algebra over such schema lattices, which allows to compute diffs between lattices (for example, to summarise the changes from one version of a knowledge graph to another), to add lattices (for example, to project future changes), and so forth. While we argue that this lattice structure (and associated algebra) may have various applications, we currently focus on the use-case of modelling and predicting the dynamic behaviour of knowledge graphs. Along those lines, we instantiate and evaluate our methods for analysing how versions of the Wikidata knowledge graph have changed over a period of 11 weeks. We propose algorithms for constructing the lattice-based schema from Wikidata, and evaluate their efficiency and scalability. We then evaluate use of the resulting schema(ta) for predicting how the knowledge graph will evolve in future versions.",

However, many of these knowledge bases are static representations of knowledge and do not model time on its own dimension or do it only for a small portion of the graph. In contrast, projects such as GDELT and ICEWS have constructed large temporally annotated knowledge graphs of events collected from news hubs. In this paper, we study the problem of reasoning over such graphs. In particular, transpose two well-known techniques from knowledge base reasoning to utilize the temporal dimension: rule mining and graph embeddings. We mine temporally constrained first-order inference rules using the state-of-the-art relational knowledge base model. We interpret the learned rules as event sequence rules. We also use simple embedding methods to jointly learn a universal representation of entities and time-specific representations of the knowledge graph. We present the first set of temporal rules mined over event knowledge graphs and preliminary results on using the learned embeddings in the temporal link prediction task.",

            "abstract": "Aiming to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of tradi- tional recommender systems, incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement auxiliary information has recently gained considerable attention. Via unifying the KG with user-item interactions into a tripartite graph, recent works explore the graph topologies to learn the low-dimensional representations of users and items with rich semantics. These real-world tripartite graphs are usually scale-free, however, the intrinsic hierarchical graph structures of which are underemphasized in existing works, consequently, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To address this issue and provide more accurate recommendation, we propose a knowledge-aware recommendation method with Lorentz model of the hyperbolic geometry, namely Lorentzian Knowledge-enhanced Graph convolutional networks for Recommendation (LKGR). LKGR facilitates better modeling of scale-free tripartite graphs after the data unification. Specifically, we employ different information propagation strategies in the hyperbolic space to explicitly encode heterogeneous information from historical interactions and KGs. Additionally, our proposed knowledge-aware attention mechanism enables the model to automatically measure the information contribution, producing the coherent information aggregation in the hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LKGR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.6-15.3% of Recall@20 on Top-K recommendation.",

In this tutorial, we cover the many sophisticated approaches that complete and correct knowledge graphs. We organize this exploration into two main classes of models. The first include probabilistic logical frameworks that use graphical models, random walks, or statistical rule mining to construct knowledge graphs. The second class of models includes latent space models such as matrix and tensor factorization and neural networks. We conclude the tutorial with a critical comparison of techniques and results. We will offer practical advice for novices to identify common empirical challenges and concrete data sets for initial experimentation. Finally, we will highlight promising areas of current and future work.",

In the past years, feature learning methods that are applicable to graph\u2010structured data are becoming available, but have not yet widely been applied and evaluated on structured biological knowledge. Results: We develop a novel method for feature learning on biological knowledge graphs. Our method combines symbolic methods, in particular knowledge representation using symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neural networks to generate embeddings of nodes that encode for related information within knowledge graphs. Through the use of symbolic logic, these embeddings contain both explicit and implicit information. We apply these embeddings to the prediction of edges in the knowledge graph representing problems of function prediction, finding candidate genes of diseases, protein\u2010protein interactions, or drug target relations, and demonstrate performance that matches and sometimes outperforms traditional approaches based on manually crafted features. Our method can be applied to any biological knowledge graph, and will thereby open up the increasing amount of Semantic Web based knowledge bases in biology to use in machine learning and data analytics.

There have been many hybrid systems proposed in the past that use a mix of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to boost the performance. More recently, some work has focused on recommendations that use external knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement content-based recommendation. In this paper, we investigate three methods for making KG based recommendations using a general-purpose probabilistic logic system called ProPPR. The simplest of the models, EntitySim, uses only the links of the graph. We then extend the model to TypeSim that also uses the types of the entities to boost its generalization capabilities. Next, we develop a graph based latent factor model, GraphLF, which combines the strengths of latent factorization with graphs. We compare our approaches to a recently proposed state-of-the-art graph recommendation method on two large datasets, Yelp and MovieLens-100K. The experiments illustrate that our approaches can give large performance improvements. Additionally, we demonstrate that knowledge graphs give maximum advantage when the dataset is sparse, and gradually become redundant as more training data becomes available, and hence are most useful in cold-start settings.",

However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts (edges) which disrupts path queries. Recent models for knowledge base completion impute missing facts by embedding knowledge graphs in vector spaces. We show that these models can be recursively applied to answer path queries, but that they suffer from cascading errors. This motivates a new \"compositional\" training objective, which dramatically improves all models' ability to answer path queries, in some cases more than doubling accuracy. On a standard knowledge base completion task, we also demonstrate that compositional training acts as a novel form of structural regularization, reliably improving performance across all base models (reducing errors by up to 43%) and achieving new state-of-the-art results.",

            "abstract": "The Web has moved, slowly but steadily, from a collection of documents towards a collection of structured data. Knowledge graphs have then emerged as a way of representing the knowledge encoded in such data as well as a tool to reason on them in order to extract new and implicit information. Knowledge graphs are currently used, for example, to explain search results, to explore knowledge spaces, to semantically enrich textual documents, or to feed knowledge-intensive applications such as recommender systems. In this work, we describe how to create and exploit a knowledge graph to supply a hybrid recommendation engine with information that builds on top of a collections of documents describing musical and sound items. Tags and textual descriptions are exploited to extract and link entities to external graphs such as WordNet and DBpedia, which are in turn used to semantically enrich the initial data. By means of the knowledge graph we build, recommendations are computed using a feature combination hybrid approach. Two explicit graph feature mappings are formulated to obtain meaningful item feature representations able to catch the knowledge embedded in the graph. Those content features are further combined with additional collaborative information deriving from implicit user feedback. An extensive evaluation on historical data is performed over two different datasets: a dataset of sounds composed of tags, textual descriptions, and user\u2019s download information gathered from Freesound.org and a dataset of songs that mixes song textual descriptions with tags and user\u2019s listening habits extracted from Songfacts.com and Last.fm, respectively. Results show significant improvements with respect to state-of-the-art collaborative algorithms in both datasets. In addition, we show how the semantic expansion of the initial descriptions helps in achieving much better recommendation quality in terms of aggregated diversity and novelty.",

However, due to the schema-free nature of RDF data, it is very difficult for users to have full knowledge of the underlying schema. Furthermore, the same kind of information can be represented in diverse graph fragments. Hence, it is a huge challenge to formulate complex SPARQL expressions by taking the union of all possible structures. \n \nIn this paper, we propose an effective framework to access the RDF repository even if users have no full knowledge of the underlying schema. Specifically, given a SPARQL query, the system could return as more answers that match the query based on the semantic similarity as possible. Interestingly, we propose a systematic method to mine diverse semantically equivalent structure patterns. More importantly, incorporating both structural and semantic similarities we are the first to propose a novel similarity measure, semantic graph edit distance. In order to improve the efficiency performance, we apply the semantic summary graph to summarize the knowledge graph, which supports both high-level pruning and drill-down pruning. We also devise an effective lower bound based on the TA-style access to each of the candidate sets. Extensive experiments over real datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",

They encode knowledge through entities and relations which define each other through the connective structure of the graph. This has inspired methods for the joint embedding of entities and relations in continuous low-dimensional vector spaces, that can be used to induce new edges in the graph, i.e., link prediction in knowledge graphs. Learning these representations relies on contrasting positive instances with negative ones. Knowledge graphs include only positive relation instances, leaving the door open for a variety of methods for selecting negative examples. In this paper we present an empirical study on the impact of negative sampling on the learned embeddings, assessed through the task of link prediction. We use state-of-the-art knowledge graph embeddings -- \\rescal , TransE, DistMult and ComplEX -- and evaluate on benchmark datasets -- FB15k and WN18. We compare well known methods for negative sampling and additionally propose embedding based sampling methods. We note a marked difference in the impact of these sampling methods on the two datasets, with the \"traditional\" corrupting positives method leading to best results on WN18, while embedding based methods benefiting the task on FB15k.",

            "abstract": "\n \n The management of uncertainty is crucial when harvesting structured content from unstructured and noisy sources. Knowledge Graphs ( KGs ) are a prominent example. KGs maintain both numerical and non-numerical facts, with the support of an underlying schema. These facts are usually accompanied by a confidence score that witnesses how likely is for them to hold. Despite their popularity, most of existing KGs focus on static data thus impeding the availabilityof timewise knowledge. What is missing is a comprehensive solution for the management of uncertain and temporal data in KGs . The goal of this paper is to fill this gap. We rely on two main ingredients. The first is a numerical extension of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) that provide the necessary underpinning to formalize the syntax and semantics of uncertain temporal KGs . The second is a set of Datalog constraints with inequalities that extend the underlying schema of the KGs and help to detect inconsistencies. From a theoretical point of view, we discuss the complexity of two important classes of queries for uncertain temporal KGs: maximuma-posteriori and conditional probability inference. Due to the hardness of these problems and the fact that MLN solvers do not scale well, we also explore the usage of Probabilistic Soft Logics (PSL) as a practical tool to support our reasoning tasks. We report on an experimental evaluation comparing the MLN and PSL approaches.\n \n",

Computational approaches for fact checking may be the key to help mitigate the risks of massive misinformation spread. Such approaches can be designed to not only be scalable and effective at assessing veracity of dubious claims, but also to boost a human fact checker's productivity by surfacing relevant facts and patterns to aid their analysis. We present a novel, unsupervised network-flow based approach to determine the truthfulness of a statement of fact expressed in the form of a triple. We view a knowledge graph of background information about real-world entities as a flow network, and show that computational fact checking then amounts to finding a \"knowledge stream\" connecting the subject and object of the triple. Evaluation on a range of real-world and hand-crafted datasets of facts reveals that this network-flow model can be very effective in discerning true statements from false ones, outperforming existing algorithms on many test cases. Moreover, the model is expressive in its ability to automatically discover several useful patterns and surface relevant facts that may help a human fact checker.",

Recent works in this area of knowledge graph embeddings such as TransE, TransH and TransR have shown extremely competitive and promising results in relational learning. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of the translational embedding model to solve three main problems of the current models. Firstly, translational models are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as margin and learning rate. Secondly, the translation principle only allows one spot in vector space for each golden triplet. Thus, congestion of entities and relations in vector space may reduce precision. Lastly, the current models are not able to handle dynamic data especially the introduction of new unseen entities/relations or removal of triplets. In this paper, we propose Parallel Universe TransE (puTransE), an adaptable and robust adaptation of the translational model. Our approach non-parametrically estimates the energy score of a triplet from multiple embedding spaces of structurally and semantically aware triplet selection. Our proposed approach is simple, robust and parallelizable. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms TransE and many other embedding methods for link prediction on knowledge graphs on both public benchmark dataset and a real world dynamic dataset.\n \n",

Even though users' identity information is always removed, attackers can still de-anonymize users with the help of auxiliary information. To protect against de-anonymization attack, various privacy protection techniques for social networks have been proposed. However, most existing approaches assume specific and restrict network structure as background knowledge and ignore semantic level prior belief of attackers, which are not always realistic in practice and do not apply to arbitrary privacy scenarios. Moreover, the privacy inference attack in the presence of semantic background knowledge is barely investigated. To address these shortcomings, in this work, we introduce knowledge graphs to explicitly express arbitrary prior belief of the attacker for any individual user. The processes of de-anonymization and privacy inference are accordingly formulated based on knowledge graphs. Our experiment on data of real social networks shows that knowledge graphs can strengthen de-anonymization and inference attacks, and thus increase the risk of privacy disclosure. This suggests the validity of knowledge graphs as a general effective model of attackers' background knowledge for social network privacy preservation.",

In this short paper, we are providing a comparison of two state-of-the-art knowledge graph embeddings for which their equivalence has recently been established, i.e., ComplEx and HolE [Nickel, Rosasco, and Poggio, 2016; Trouillon et al., 2016; Hayashi and Shimbo, 2017]. First, we briefly review both models and discuss how their scoring functions are equivalent. We then analyze the discrepancy of results reported in the original articles, and show experimentally that they are likely due to the use of different loss functions. In further experiments, we evaluate the ability of both models to embed symmetric and antisymmetric patterns. Finally, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of both models and under which conditions one would be preferable to the other.",

Most of the existing methods perform this task based solely on observed facts. The only requirement is that the learned embeddings should be compatible within each individual fact. In this paper, aiming at further discovering the intrinsic geometric structure of the embedding space, we propose Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE). The key idea of SSE is to take full advantage of additional semantic information and enforce the embedding space to be semantically smooth, i.e., entities belonging to the same semantic category will lie close to each other in the embedding space. Two manifold learning algorithms Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding are used to model the smoothness assumption. Both are formulated as geometrically based regularization terms to constrain the embedding task. Two lines of embedding strategies are tested, i.e., strategies based on latent distance models and strategies based on tensor factorization techniques. We empirically evaluate SSE on two benchmark tasks of link prediction and triple classification, and achieve significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the superiority and generality of SSE.",

            "abstract": "Many popular knowledge graphs such as Freebase, YAGO or DBPedia maintain a list of non-discrete attributes for each entity. Intuitively, these attributes such as height, price or population count are able to richly characterize entities in knowledge graphs. This additional source of information may help to alleviate the inherent sparsity and incompleteness problem that are prevalent in knowledge graphs. Unfortunately, many state-of-the-art relational learning models ignore this information due to the challenging nature of dealing with non-discrete data types in the inherently binary-natured knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for both encoding and prediction of non-discrete attribute information in a relational setting. Specifically, we train a neural network for triplet prediction along with a separate network for attribute value regression. Via multi-task learning, we are able to learn representations of entities, relations and attributes that encode information about both tasks. Moreover, such attributes are not only central to many predictive tasks as an information source but also as a prediction target. Therefore, models that are able to encode, incorporate and predict such information in a relational learning context are highly attractive as well. We show that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art methods for the tasks of relational triplet classification and attribute value prediction.",

A surge of recent developments in entity linking and retrieval methods gave rise to a new line of research that aims at utilizing KGs for text-centric retrieval applications, making this an ideal time to pause and report current findings to the community, summarizing successful approaches, and soliciting new ideas.

It can be applied in applications such as web search, item recommendation and query expansion. Traditionally, people solve this problem by exploiting the co-occurrence of entities within web pages, where latent semantic correlation among seed entities cannot be revealed. We propose a novel approach to solve the problem using knowledge graphs, by considering the deficiency (e.g., incompleteness) of knowledge graphs. We design an effective ranking model based on the semantic features of seeds to retrieve the candidate entities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed solution significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.",

Vector space models excel at determining similarity between concepts, but are severely constrained when evaluating complex dependency relations and other logic-based operations that are a strength of knowledge graphs. We describe the VKG structure that helps unify knowledge graphs and vector representation of entities, and enables powerful inference methods and search capabilities that combine their complementary strengths. We analogize this to thinking `fast' in vector space along with thinking 'slow' and `deeply' by reasoning over the knowledge graph. We have created a query processing engine that takes complex queries and decomposes them into subqueries optimized to run on the respective knowledge graph or vector view of a VKG. We show that the VKG structure can process specific queries that are not efficiently handled by vector spaces or knowledge graphs alone. We also demonstrate and evaluate the VKG structure and the query processing engine by developing a system called Cyber-All-Intel for knowledge extraction, representation and querying in an end-to-end pipeline grounded in the cybersecurity informatics domain. arXiv:1708.03310v2 [cs.AI]",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are a versatile framework to encode richly structured data relationships, but it can be challenging to combine these graphs with unstructured data. Methods for retrofitting pre-trained entity representations to the structure of a knowledge graph typically assume that entities are embedded in a connected space and that relations imply similarity. However, useful knowledge graphs often contain diverse entities and relations (with potentially disjoint underlying corpora) which do not accord with these assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we present Functional Retrofitting, a framework that generalizes current retrofitting methods by explicitly modeling pairwise relations. Our framework can directly incorporate a variety of pairwise penalty functions previously developed for knowledge graph completion. Further, it allows users to encode, learn, and extract information about relation semantics. We present both linear and neural instantiations of the framework. Functional Retrofitting significantly outperforms existing retrofitting methods on complex knowledge graphs and loses no accuracy on simpler graphs (in which relations do imply similarity). Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the framework by predicting new drug\u2013disease treatment pairs in a large, complex health knowledge graph.",

These strengths align well with the needs of an ever growing information industry. Today, giants like Google, Facebook, and Wikimedia consciously deploy ontological models, and store information in graph-like data structures that are more similar to DL ABoxes than to traditional relational databases. Many smaller organisations follow, and \u201cknowledge graphs\u201d appear in numerous places. Clearly, logic-based KR can make significant contributions to this development, yet there is often very little adoption in typical knowledge graph applications. Focusing on Wikidata as a particular use case, this invited contribution asks which technical issues might limit the impact of symbolic KR in this area, and summarises some recent developments towards addressing them in various logics.",

            "abstract": "Given a graph query Q posed on a knowledge graph G, top-k graph querying is to find k matches in G with the highest ranking score according to a ranking function. Fast top-k search in knowledge graphs is challenging as both graph traversal and similarity search are expensive. Conventional top-k graph search is typically based on threshold algorithm (TA), which can no long fit the demand in the new setting. This work proposes STAR, a top-k knowledge graph search framework. It has two components: (a) a fast top-k algorithm for star queries, and (b) an assembling algorithm for general graph queries. The assembling algorithm uses star query as a building block and iteratively sweeps the star match lists with a dynamically adjusted bound. For top-k star graph query where an edge can be matched to a path with bounded length d, we develop a message passing algorithm, achieving time complexity O(d2|E| + md) and space complexity linear to d|V| (assuming the size of Q and k is bounded by a constant), where m is the maximum node degree in G. STAR can further be leveraged to answer general graph queries by decomposing a query to multiple star queries and joining their results later. Learning-based techniques to optimize query decomposition are also developed. We experimentally verify that STAR is 5-10 times faster than the state-of-the-art TA-style graph search algorithm, and 10-100 times faster than a belief propagation approach.",

            "abstract": "We present the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), a diverse set of challenging and realistic benchmark datasets to facilitate scalable, robust, and reproducible graph machine learning (ML) research. OGB datasets are large-scale (up to 100+ million nodes and 1+ billion edges), encompass multiple important graph ML tasks, and cover a diverse range of domains, ranging from social and information networks to biological networks, molecular graphs, source code ASTs, and knowledge graphs. For each dataset, we provide a unified evaluation protocol using meaningful application-specific data splits and evaluation metrics. In addition to building the datasets, we also perform extensive benchmark experiments for each dataset. Our experiments suggest that OGB datasets present significant challenges of scalability to large-scale graphs and out-of-distribution generalization under realistic data splits, indicating fruitful opportunities for future research. Finally, OGB provides an automated end-to-end graph ML pipeline that simplifies and standardizes the process of graph data loading, experimental setup, and model evaluation. OGB will be regularly updated and welcomes inputs from the community. OGB datasets as well as data loaders, evaluation scripts, baseline code, and leaderboards are publicly available at this https URL .",

            "abstract": "The representation of a knowledge graph (KG) in a latent space recently has attracted more and more attention. To this end, some proposed models (e.g., TransE) embed entities and relations of a KG into a \"point\" vector space by optimizing a global loss function which ensures the scores of positive triplets are higher than negative ones. We notice that these models always regard all entities and relations in a same manner and ignore their (un)certainties. In fact, different entities and relations may contain different certainties, which makes identical certainty insufficient for modeling. Therefore, this paper switches to density-based embedding and propose KG2E for explicitly modeling the certainty of entities and relations, which learn the representations of KGs in the space of multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Each entity/relation is represented by a Gaussian distribution, where the mean denotes its position and the covariance (currently with diagonal covariance) can properly represent its certainty. In addition, compared with the symmetric measures used in point-based methods, we employ the KL-divergence for scoring triplets, which is a natural asymmetry function for effectively modeling multiple types of relations. We have conducted extensive experiments on link prediction and triplet classification with multiple benchmark datasets (WordNet and Freebase). Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively model the (un)certainties of entities and relations in a KG, and it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (including TransH and TransR).",

With large knowledge graphs, structured querying on their relational facts is an alternative, but often suffers from poor recall because of mismatches between user queries and the knowledge graph or because of weakly populated relations. This paper presents the TriniT search engine for querying and ranking on extended knowledge graphs that combine relational facts with textual web contents. Our query language is designed on the paradigm of SPO triple patterns, but is more expressive, supporting textual phrases for each of the SPO arguments. We present a model for automatic query relaxation to compensate for mismatches between the data and a user's query. Query answers -- tuples of entities -- are ranked by a statistical language model. We present experiments with different benchmarks, including complex relationship queries, over a combination of the Yago knowledge graph and the entity-annotated ClueWeb'09 corpus.",

Whereas there is a large body of research on mining homogeneous graphs, this new generation of information networks are highly heterogeneous, with thousands of entity and relation types and billions of instances of those types (graph vertices and edges). In this tutorial, we present the state of the art in constructing, mining, and growing knowledge graphs. The purpose of the tutorial is to equip newcomers to this exciting field with an understanding of the basic concepts, tools and methodologies, open research challenges, as well as pointers to available datasets and relevant literature. Knowledge graphs have become an enabling resource for a plethora of new knowledge-rich applications. Consequently, the tutorial will also discuss the role of knowledge bases in empowering a range of web applications, from web search to social networks to digital assistants. A publicly available knowledge base (Freebase) will be used throughout the tutorial to exemplify the different techniques.",

Modeling topical coherence is crucial for this task based on the assumption that information from the same semantic context tends to belong to the same topic. This paper presents a novel deep semantic relatedness model (DSRM) based on deep neural networks (DNN) and semantic knowledge graphs (KGs) to measure entity semantic relatedness for topical coherence modeling. The DSRM is directly trained on large-scale KGs and it maps heterogeneous types of knowledge of an entity from KGs to numerical feature vectors in a latent space such that the distance between two semantically-related entities is minimized. Compared with the state-of-the-art relatedness approach proposed by (Milne and Witten, 2008a), the DSRM obtains 19.4% and 24.5% reductions in entity disambiguation errors on two publicly available datasets respectively.",

Questions of this kind have ample applications, for instance, to educate users about or to evaluate their knowledge in a specific domain. To solve the problem, we propose a novel end-to-end approach. The approach first selects a named entity from the knowledge graph as an answer. It then generates a structured triple-pattern query, which yields the answer as its sole result. If a multiple-choice question is desired, the approach selects alternative answer options as distractors. Finally, our approach uses a template-based method to verbalize the structured query and yield a natural language question. A key challenge is estimating how difficult the generated question is to human users. To do this, we make use of historical data from the Jeopardy! quiz show and a semantically annotated Web-scale document collection, engineer suitable features, and train a logistic regression classifier to predict question difficulty. Experiments demonstrate the viability of our overall approach.",

Our system learns to relate concepts in science questions to propositions in a fact corpus, stores new concepts and relations in a knowledge graph (KG), and uses the graph to solve questions. We are the first to acquire knowledge for question-answering from open, natural language dialogs without a fixed ontology or domain model that predetermines what users can say. Our relation-based strategies complete more successful dialogs than a query expansion baseline, our taskdriven relations are more effective for solving science questions than relations from general knowledge sources, and our method is practical enough to generalize to other domains.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have evolved as flexible and powerful means for representing general world knowledge. Typical examples are DBpedia, Yago, or the Google Knowledge Graph, which all started off by representing information derived from Wikipedia and were then greatly expanded. In this paper we use the concept of a knowledge graph to present information about specific classes of entities, such as patients or users. The knowledge graph represents all that is known about the entities and their relationships and the goal is to integrate and exploit that information for prediction and decision support. In previous papers it was shown that embedding learning, a.k.a. representation learning, is capable of modelling large-scale semantic knowledge graphs, by exploiting information that describes the context of an entity in the knowledge graph. In Machine Learning we often map the knowledge graph to a tensor representation. Then we learn the latent representations of the entities that compose the tensor and use them to predict unobserved facts. However knowledge graphs represent the current status of the world and therefore they lack of a temporal dimension, which means we can only use them to predict facts about the present moment. In this paper we introduce an additional set of tensors that contain temporal information. Each of this event tensors contains all the events that occurred on a particular time step. Our goal will be to predict the events that will happen in future time steps, using for that task both dynamic information from the previous event tensors and static information that is stored in the knowledge graph. Therefore, this architecture allows us to fuse static and dynamic information to predict future events. We present experiments showing how this model performs well in multiple scenarios: medical data, a recommendation engine and sensor data.",

In this paper, we present a new method of materializing Datalog inferences, which combines a column-based memory layout with novel optimization methods that avoid redundant inferences at runtime. The pro-active caching of certain subqueries further increases efficiency. Our empirical evaluation shows that this approach can often match or even surpass the performance of state-of-the-art systems, especially under restricted resources.\n \n",

Conventional methods of acquiring commonsense knowledge generally require laborious and costly human annotations, which are not feasible on a large scale. In this paper, we explore a practical way of mining commonsense knowledge from linguistic graphs, with the goal of transferring cheap knowledge obtained with linguistic patterns into expensive commonsense knowledge. The result is a conversion of ASER [Zhang et al., 2020], a large-scale selectional preference knowledge resource, into TransOMCS, of the same representation as ConceptNet [Liu and Singh, 2004] but two orders of magnitude larger. Experimental results demonstrate the transferability of linguistic knowledge to commonsense knowledge and the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of quantity, novelty, and quality. TransOMCS is publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/TransOMCS.",

In this tutorial, we will present the state of the art in constructing, mining, and growing knowledge graphs. The purpose of the tutorial is to equip newcomers to this exciting field with an understanding of the basic concepts, tools and methodologies, available datasets, and open research challenges. A publicly available knowledge base (Freebase) will be used throughout the tutorial to exemplify the different techniques.",

We model this task as a learning to rank problem for sentences and employ a rich set of features. When evaluated on a large set of manually annotated sentences, we find that our method significantly improves over state-of-the-art baseline models.",

Fusion of a knowledge graph and texts might yield mutually reinforcing advantages, but there is less study on that. To address this challenge, we propose a knowledge aware chatting machine with three components, an augmented knowledge graph with both triples and texts, knowledge selector, and knowledge aware response generator. For knowledge selection on the graph, we formulate it as a problem of multi-hop graph reasoning to effectively capture conversation flow, which is more explainable and flexible in comparison with previous works. To fully leverage long text information that differentiates our graph from others, we improve a state of the art reasoning algorithm with machine reading comprehension technology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on two datasets in comparison with state-of-the-art models.",

Answers to tasks such as \u201clist university professors who have designed some programming languages and also won an award in Computer Science\u201d are best found in knowledge graphs that record entities and their relationships. Real-world knowledge graphs are difficult to use due to their sheer size and complexity and the challenging task of writing complex structured graph queries. Toward better usability of query systems over knowledge graphs, GQBE allows users to query knowledge graphs by example entity tuples without writing complex queries. In this demo we present: 1) a detailed description of the various features and user-friendly GUI of GQBE, 2) a brief description of the system architecture, and 3) a demonstration scenario that we intend to show the audience.",
