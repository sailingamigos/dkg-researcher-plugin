Here, the challenge is to learn accurate \u201cfew-shot\u201d models for classes existing at the tail of the class distribution, for which little data is available. Inspired by the rich semantic correlations between classes at the long tail and those at the head, we take advantage of the knowledge from data-rich classes at the head of the distribution to boost the performance of the data-poor classes at the tail. First, we propose to leverage implicit relational knowledge among class labels from knowledge graph embeddings and learn explicit relational knowledge using graph convolution networks. Second, we integrate that relational knowledge into relation extraction model by coarse-to-fine knowledge-aware attention mechanism. We demonstrate our results for a large-scale benchmark dataset which show that our approach significantly outperforms other baselines, especially for long-tail relations.",

Most of previous studies do not explicitly model factual description of products, tending to generate uninformative content. Moreover, they mainly focus on word-level generation, but cannot accurately reflect more abstractive user preference in multiple aspects. To address the above issues, we propose a novel knowledgeenhanced PRG model based on capsule graph neural network (CapsGNN). We first construct a heterogeneous knowledge graph (HKG) for utilizing rich item attributes. We adopt Caps-GNN to learn graph capsules for encoding underlying characteristics from the HKG. Our generation process contains two major steps, namely aspect sequence generation and sentence generation. First, based on graph capsules, we adaptively learn aspect capsules for inferring the aspect sequence. Then, conditioned on the inferred aspect label, we design a graph-based copy mechanism to generate sentences by incorporating related entities or words from HKG. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilize knowledge graph for the PRG task. The incorporated KG information is able to enhance user preference at both aspect and word levels. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model on the PRG task.",

            "abstract": "Modeling concurrent events of multiple types and their involved actors from open-source social sensors is an important task for many domains such as health care, disaster relief, and financial analysis. Forecasting events in the future can help human analysts better understand global social dynamics and make quick and accurate decisions. Anticipating participants or actors who may be involved in these activities can also help stakeholders to better respond to unexpected events. However, achieving these goals is challenging due to several factors: (i) it is hard to filter relevant information from large-scale input, (ii) the input data is usually high dimensional, unstructured, and Non-IID (Non-independent and identically distributed) and (iii) associated text features are dynamic and vary over time. Recently, graph neural networks have demonstrated strengths in learning complex and relational data. In this paper, we study a temporal graph learning method with heterogeneous data fusion for predicting concurrent events of multiple types and inferring multiple candidate actors simultaneously. In order to capture temporal information from historical data, we propose Glean, a graph learning framework based on event knowledge graphs to incorporate both relational and word contexts. We present a context-aware embedding fusion module to enrich hidden features for event actors. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets and show that the proposed method is competitive against various state-of-the-art methods for social event prediction and also provides much-need interpretation capabilities.",

We define a query graph that resembles subgraphs of the knowledge base and can be directly mapped to a logical form. Semantic parsing is reduced to query graph generation, formulated as a staged search problem. Unlike traditional approaches, our method leverages the knowledge base in an early stage to prune the search space and thus simplifies the semantic matching problem. By applying an advanced entity linking system and a deep convolutional neural network model that matches questions and predicate sequences, our system outperforms previous methods substantially, and achieves an F1 measure of 52.5% on the WEBQUESTIONS dataset.",

These models are highly sample efficient as related concepts in the graph structure share statistical strength allowing generalization to new classes when faced with a lack of data. However, multi-layer architectures, which are required to propagate knowledge to distant nodes in the graph, dilute the knowledge by performing extensive Laplacian smoothing at each layer and thereby consequently decrease performance. In order to still enjoy the benefit brought by the graph structure while preventing dilution of knowledge from distant nodes, we propose a Dense Graph Propagation (DGP) module with carefully designed direct links among distant nodes. DGP allows us to exploit the hierarchical graph structure of the knowledge graph through additional connections. These connections are added based on a node's relationship to its ancestors and descendants. A weighting scheme is further used to weigh their contribution depending on the distance to the node to improve information propagation in the graph. Combined with finetuning of the representations in a two-stage training approach our method outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot learning approaches.",

From the viewpoint of data structure, the coursework can be potentially structured as a graph. Incorporating this graph-structured nature into the knowledge tracing model as a relational inductive bias can improve its performance; however, previous methods, such as deep knowledge tracing, did not consider such a latent graph structure. Inspired by the recent successes of the graph neural network (GNN), we herein propose a GNN-based knowledge tracing method, i.e., graph-based knowledge tracing. Casting the knowledge structure as a graph enabled us to reformulate the knowledge tracing task as a time-series node-level classification problem in the GNN. As the knowledge graph structure is not explicitly provided in most cases, we propose various implementations of the graph structure. Empirical validations on two open datasets indicated that our method could potentially improve the prediction of student performance and demonstrated more interpretable predictions compared to those of the previous methods, without the requirement of any additional information.CCS CONCEPTS \u2022 Computing methodologies \u2192 Neural networks; \u2022 Information systems \u2192 Data mining; \u2022 Applied computing \u2192 Learning management systems.",

Besides the challenges for conversational dialogue systems (e.g. topic transition coherency and question understanding), automatic medical diagnosis further poses more critical requirements for the dialogue rationality in the context of medical knowledge and symptom-disease relations. Existing dialogue systems (Madotto, Wu, and Fung 2018; Wei et al. 2018; Li et al. 2017) mostly rely on datadriven learning and cannot be able to encode extra expert knowledge graph. In this work, we propose an End-to-End Knowledge-routed Relational Dialogue System (KR-DS) that seamlessly incorporates rich medical knowledge graph into the topic transition in dialogue management, and makes it cooperative with natural language understanding and natural language generation. A novel Knowledge-routed Deep Q-network (KR-DQN) is introduced to manage topic transitions, which integrates a relational refinement branch for encoding relations among different symptoms and symptomdisease pairs, and a knowledge-routed graph branch for topic decision-making. Extensive experiments on a public medical dialogue dataset show our KR-DS significantly beats stateof-the-art methods (by more than 8% in diagnosis accuracy). We further show the superiority of our KR-DS on a newly collected medical dialogue system dataset, which is more challenging retaining original self-reports and conversational data between patients and doctors.",

Previous knowledge distillation strategies used for dense prediction tasks often directly borrow the distillation scheme for image classification and perform knowledge distillation for each pixel separately, leading to sub-optimal performance. Here we propose to distill structured knowledge from large networks to compact networks, taking into account the fact that dense prediction is a structured prediction problem. Specifically, we study two structured distillation schemes: i) pair-wise distillation that distills the pair-wise similarities by building a static graph; and ii) holistic distillation that uses adversarial training to distill holistic knowledge. The effectiveness of our knowledge distillation approaches is demonstrated by experiments on three dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation, depth estimation and object detection.

            "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding has emerged as an active area of research resulting in the development of several KG embedding methods. Relational facts in KG often show temporal dynamics, e.g., the fact (Cristiano_Ronaldo, playsFor, Manchester_United) is valid only from 2003 to 2009. Most of the existing KG embedding methods ignore this temporal dimension while learning embeddings of the KG elements. In this paper, we propose HyTE, a temporally aware KG embedding method which explicitly incorporates time in the entity-relation space by associating each timestamp with a corresponding hyperplane. HyTE not only performs KG inference using temporal guidance, but also predicts temporal scopes for relational facts with missing time annotations. Through extensive experimentation on temporal datasets extracted from real-world KGs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over both traditional as well as temporal KG embedding methods.",

However, most of these models have two common drawbacks, including (i) current methods are not sensitive enough to abrupt changes of stock trend, and (ii) forecasting results are not interpretable for humans. To address these two problems, we propose a novel Knowledge-Driven Temporal Convolutional Network (KDTCN) for stock trend prediction and explanation. Firstly, we extract structured events from financial news, and utilize external knowledge from knowledge graph to obtain event embeddings. Then, we combine event embeddings and price values together to forecast stock trend. We evaluate the prediction accuracy to show how knowledge-driven events work on abrupt changes. We also visualize the effect of events and linkage among events based on knowledge graph, to explain why knowledge-driven events are common sources of abrupt changes. Experiments demonstrate that KDTCN can (i) react to abrupt changes much faster and outperform state-of-the-art methods on stock datasets, as well as (ii) facilitate the explanation of prediction particularly with abrupt changes.",

Our goals are to boost coverage by using knowledge-guided retrieval to find more relevant passages than text-matching methods, and to improve accuracy by allowing for better knowledge-guided fusion of information across related passages. Our graph retrieval method expands a set of seed keyword-retrieved passages by traversing the graph structure of the knowledge base. Our reader extends a BERT-based architecture and updates passage representations by propagating information from related passages and their relations, instead of reading each passage in isolation. Experiments on three open-domain QA datasets, WebQuestions, Natural Questions and TriviaQA, show improved performance over non-graph baselines by 2-11% absolute. Our approach also matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art in every case, without using an expensive end-to-end training regime.",

Current approaches extractively select portions of web text as input to Sequence-to-Sequence models using methods such as TF-IDF ranking. We propose constructing a local graph structured knowledge base for each query, which compresses the web search information and reduces redundancy. We show that by linearizing the graph into a structured input sequence, models can encode the graph representations within a standard Sequence-to-Sequence setting. For two generative tasks with very long text input, long-form question answering and multi-document summarization, feeding graph representations as input can achieve better performance than using retrieved text portions.",

This can be sub-optimal as it requires memorizing and generalizing to all possible entity relationships using these fixed representations. We thus propose a novel attention-based method to learn query-dependent representation of entities which adaptively combines the relevant graph neighborhood of an entity leading to more accurate KG completion. The proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets for knowledge graph completion, and experimental results show that the proposed model performs competitively or better than existing state-of-the-art, including recent methods for explicit multi-hop reasoning. Qualitative probing offers insight into how the model can reason about facts involving multiple hops in the knowledge graph, through the use of neighborhood attention.",

            "abstract": "To address the sparsity and cold-start problem of collaborative filtering, researchers usually make use of side information, such as social networks or item attributes, to improve the performance of recommendation. In this article, we consider the knowledge graph (KG) as the source of side information. To address the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based methods for KG-aware recommendation, we propose RippleNet, an end-to-end framework that naturally incorporates the KG into recommender systems. RippleNet has two versions: (1) The outward propagation version, which is analogous to the actual ripples on water, stimulates the propagation of user preferences over the set of knowledge entities by automatically and iteratively extending a user\u2019s potential interests along links in the KG. The multiple \u201cripples\u201d activated by a user\u2019s historically clicked items are thus superposed to form the preference distribution of the user with respect to a candidate item. (2) The inward aggregation version aggregates and incorporates the neighborhood information biasedly when computing the representation of a given entity. The neighborhood can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity and capture users\u2019 long-distance interests. In addition, we intuitively demonstrate how a KG assists with recommender systems in RippleNet, and we also find that RippleNet provides a new perspective of explainability for the recommended results in terms of the KG. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that both versions of RippleNet achieve substantial gains in a variety of scenarios, including movie, book, and news recommendations, over several state-of-the-art baselines.",

To generate semantically-faithful embeddings, we develop techniques to recognize node heterogeneity, and semantic regularization that incorporate structural constraints into the embedding. Experiments show that our approach improves the performance of models trained to perform entailment checking and visual relation prediction. Interestingly, we observe a connection between the tractability of the propositional theory representation and the ease of embedding. Future exploration of this connection may elucidate the relationship between knowledge compilation and vector representation learning.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding, which projects symbolic entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, is gaining increasing attention. Previous methods allow a single static embedding for each entity or relation, ignoring their intrinsic contextual nature, i.e., entities and relations may appear in different graph contexts, and accordingly, exhibit different properties. This work presents Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding (CoKE), a novel paradigm that takes into account such contextual nature, and learns dynamic, flexible, and fully contextualized entity and relation embeddings. Two types of graph contexts are studied: edges and paths, both formulated as sequences of entities and relations. CoKE takes a sequence as input and uses a Transformer encoder to obtain contextualized representations. These representations are hence naturally adaptive to the input, capturing contextual meanings of entities and relations therein. Evaluation on a wide variety of public benchmarks verifies the superiority of CoKE in link prediction and path query answering. It performs consistently better than, or at least equally well as current state-of-the-art in almost every case, in particular offering an absolute improvement of 19.7% in H@10 on path query answering.

As a family of effective approaches for link predictions, embedding methods try to learn low-rank representations for both entities and relations such that the bilinear form defined therein is a well-behaved scoring function. Despite of their successful performances, existing bilinear forms overlook the modeling of relation compositions, resulting in lacks of interpretability for reasoning on KG. To fulfill this gap, we propose a new model called DihEdral, named after dihedral symmetry group. This new model learns knowledge graph embeddings that can capture relation compositions by nature. Furthermore, our approach models the relation embeddings parametrized by discrete values, thereby decrease the solution space drastically. Our experiments show that DihEdral is able to capture all desired properties such as (skew-) symmetry, inversion and (non-) Abelian composition, and outperforms existing bilinear form based approach and is comparable to or better than deep learning models such as ConvE.",

However, complex relations such as N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N still remain challenging to predict. In this work, we propose a novel distance-based approach for knowledge graph link prediction. First, we extend the RotatE from 2D complex domain to high dimensional space with orthogonal transforms to model relations. The orthogonal transform embedding for relations keeps the capability for modeling symmetric/anti-symmetric, inverse and compositional relations while achieves better modeling capacity. Second, the graph context is integrated into distance scoring functions directly. Specifically, graph context is explicitly modeled via two directed context representations. Each node embedding in knowledge graph is augmented with two context representations, which are computed from the neighboring outgoing and incoming nodes/edges respectively. The proposed approach improves prediction accuracy on the difficult N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N cases. Our experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two common benchmarks FB15k-237 and WNRR-18, especially on FB15k-237 which has many high in-degree nodes.",

We first provide a comprehensive comparison between PKG and ordinary knowledge graph (KG) and then illustrate why KG embedding methods are not suitable for PKG learning. We construct a self-attention-enhanced distributed representation learning model for learning PKG embeddings from raw customer activity data in an end-to-end fashion. We design an effective multi-task learning schema to fully leverage the multi-modal e-commerce data. The \u00b6oincare embedding is also employed to handle complex entity structures. We use a real-world dataset from \\textslgrocery.walmart.com to evaluate the performances on knowledge completion, search ranking and recommendation.

However, the small market size of individual rare diseases, combined with the time and capital requirements of pharmaceutical R&D, have hindered the development of new drugs for these cases. A promising alternative is drug repurposing, whereby existing FDA-approved drugs might be used to treat diseases different from their original indications. In order to generate drug repurposing hypotheses in a systematic and comprehensive fashion, it is essential to integrate information from across the literature of pharmacology, genetics, and pathology. To this end, we leverage a newly developed knowledge graph, the Global Network of Biomedical Relationships (GNBR). GNBR is a large, heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising drug, disease, and gene (or protein) entities linked by a small set of semantic themes derived from the abstracts of biomedical literature. We apply a knowledge graph embedding method that explicitly models the uncertainty associated with literature-derived relationships and uses link prediction to generate drug repurposing hypotheses. This approach achieves high performance on a gold-standard test set of known drug indications (AUROC = 0.89) and is capable of generating novel repurposing hypotheses, which we independently validate using external literature sources and protein interaction networks. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our model to produce explanations of its predictions.",

The amount of background knowledge they have about the evolving and new attacks makes a significant difference in their ability to detect attacks. Open source threat intelligence sources, like text descriptions about cyber-attacks, can be stored in a structured fashion in a cybersecurity knowledge graph. A cybersecurity knowledge graph can be paramount in aiding a security analyst to detect cyber threats because it stores a vast range of cyber threat information in the form of semantic triples which can be queried. A semantic triple contains two cybersecurity entities with a relationship between them. In this work, we propose a system to create semantic triples over cybersecurity text, using deep learning approaches to extract possible relationships. We use the set of semantic triples generated through our system to assert in a cybersecurity knowledge graph. Security Analysts can retrieve this data from the knowledge graph, and use this information to form a decision about a cyber-attack.",

To addresses this challenge, ESR represents queries and documents in the entity space and ranks them based on their semantic connections from their knowledge graph embedding. Experiments demonstrate ESR's ability in improving Semantic Scholar's online production system, especially on hard queries where word-based ranking fails.",

For a more coarse-grained classification using eight labels we achieve an F1- score of 87.20, while a detailed classification using 343 labels yields an F1-score of 64.70.

            "abstract": "Recently, much attention has been paid to the usage of knowledge graph within the context of recommender systems to alleviate the data sparsity and cold-start problems. However, when incorporating entities from a knowledge graph to represent users, most existing works are unaware of the relationships between these entities and users. As a result, the recommendation results may suffer a lot from some unrelated entities. In this paper, we investigate how to explore these relationships which are essentially determined by the interactions among entities. Firstly, we categorize the interactions among entities into two types: inter-entity-interaction and intra-entity-interaction. Inter-entity-interaction is the interactions among entities that affect their importances to represent users. And intra-entity-interaction is the interactions within an entity that describe the different characteristics of this entity when involved in different relations. Then, considering these two types of interactions, we propose a novel model named Attention-enhanced Knowledge-aware User Preference Model (AKUPM) for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. More specifically, a self-attention network is utilized to capture the inter-entity-interaction by learning appropriate importance of each entity w.r.t the user. Moreover, the intra-entity-interaction is modeled by projecting each entity into its connected relation spaces to obtain the suitable characteristics. By doing so, AKUPM is able to figure out the most related part of incorporated entities (i.e., filter out the unrelated entities). Extensive experiments on two real-world public datasets demonstrate that AKUPM achieves substantial gains in terms of common evaluation metrics (e.g., AUC, ACC and Recall@top-K) over several state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Scoring functions (SFs), which measure the plausibility of triplets in knowledge graph (KG), have become the crux of KG embedding. Lots of SFs, which target at capturing different kinds of relations in KGs, have been designed by humans in recent years. However, as relations can exhibit complex patterns that are hard to infer before training, none of them can consistently perform better than others on existing benchmark data sets. In this paper, inspired by the recent success of automated machine learning (AutoML), we propose to automatically design SFs (AutoSF) for distinct KGs by the AutoML techniques. However, it is non-trivial to explore domain- specific information here to make AutoSF efficient and effective. We firstly identify a unified representation over popularly used SFs, which helps to set up a search space for AutoSF. Then, we propose a greedy algorithm to search in such a space efficiently. The algorithm is further sped up by a filter and a predictor, which can avoid repeatedly training SFs with same expressive ability and help removing bad candidates during the search before model training. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on benchmark data sets. Results on link prediction and triplets classification show that the searched SFs by AutoSF, are KG dependent, new to the literature, and outperform the state-of- the-art SFs designed by humans. 1",

Due to its benefit to a variety of downstream tasks such as knowledge graph completion, question answering and recommendation, KGE has gained significant attention recently. Despite its effectiveness in a benign environment, KGE's robustness to adversarial attacks is not well-studied. Existing attack methods on graph data cannot be directly applied to attack the embeddings of knowledge graph due to its heterogeneity. To fill this gap, we propose a collection of data poisoning attack strategies, which can effectively manipulate the plausibility of arbitrary targeted facts in a knowledge graph by adding or deleting facts on the graph. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack strategies are verified by extensive evaluations on two widely-used benchmarks.",

The main challenge of this task is the novel categories are prone to dominated by color, texture, shape of the object or background context (namely specificity), which are distinct for the given few training samples but not common for the corresponding categories (see Figure 1). Fortunately, we find that transferring information of the correlated based categories can help learn the novel concepts and thus avoid the novel concept being dominated by the specificity. Besides, incorporating semantic correlations among different categories can effectively regularize this information transfer. In this work, we represent the semantic correlations in the form of structured knowledge graph and integrate this graph into deep neural networks to promote few-shot learning by a novel Knowledge Graph Transfer Network (KGTN). Specifically, by initializing each node with the classifier weight of the corresponding category, a propagation mechanism is learned to adaptively propagate node message through the graph to explore node interaction and transfer classifier information of the base categories to those of the novel ones. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset show significant performance improvement compared with current leading competitors. Furthermore, we construct an ImageNet-6K dataset that covers larger scale categories, i.e, 6,000 categories, and experiments on this dataset further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

Our CapsE represents each triple as a 3-column matrix where each column vector represents the embedding of an element in the triple. This 3-column matrix is then fed to a convolution layer where multiple filters are operated to generate different feature maps. These feature maps are reconstructed into corresponding capsules which are then routed to another capsule to produce a continuous vector. The length of this vector is used to measure the plausibility score of the triple. Our proposed CapsE obtains better performance than previous state-of-the-art embedding models for knowledge graph completion on two benchmark datasets WN18RR and FB15k-237, and outperforms strong search personalization baselines on SEARCH17.",

In this way, we not only construct graph-structured explanations but also enable message passing designed in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to scale with graph sizes. We take the inspiration from the consciousness prior proposed by and develop a two-GNN framework to simultaneously encode input-agnostic full graph representation and learn input-dependent local one coordinated by an attention module. Experiments demonstrate the reasoning capability of our model that is to provide clear graphical explanations as well as deliver accurate predictions, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods in knowledge base completion tasks.",

Recently, translation-based embedding models (e.g. TransE) have aroused increasing attention for their simplicity and effectiveness. These models attempt to translate semantics from head entities to tail entities with the relations and infer richer facts outside the knowledge graph. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding method named TransMS, which translates and transmits multidirectional semantics: i) the semantics of head/tail entities and relations to tail/head entities with nonlinear functions\u00a0and ii) the semantics from entities to relations with linear bias vectors. Our model has merely one additional parameter\u00a0\u03b1\u00a0than TransE for each triplet, which results in its better scalability in large-scale knowledge graph. Experiments show that TransMS achieves substantial improvements against state-of-the-art baselines, especially the Hit@10s of head entity prediction for N-1 relations and tail entity prediction for 1-N relations improved by about 27.1% and 24.8% on FB15K database respectively.",

Existing embedding-based KBC models assume that all test entities are available at training time, making it unclear how to obtain embeddings for new entities without costly retraining. To solve the OOKB entity problem without retraining, we use graph neural networks (Graph-NNs) to compute the embeddings of OOKB entities, exploiting the limited auxiliary knowledge provided at test time.The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model in the OOKB setting.Additionally, in the standard KBC setting in which OOKB entities are not involved, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WordNet dataset.

Because of data duplication, database decentralization, weak data relations, and sluggish data updates, the power asset management system eager to adopt a new strategy to avoid the information losses, bias, and improve the data storage efficiency and extraction process. Knowledge graph has been widely developed in large part owing to its schema-less nature. It enables the knowledge graph to grow seamlessly and allows new relations addition and entities insertion when needed. This study proposes an approach for constructing power equipment knowledge graph by merging existing multi-source heterogeneous power equipment related data. A graph-search method to illustrate exhaustive results to the desired information based on the constructed knowledge graph is proposed. A case of a 500 kV station example is then demonstrated to show relevant search results and to explain that the knowledge graph can improve the efficiency of power equipment management.",

The metaphactory platform aims at supporting different categories of knowledge graph users within the organization by realizing relevant services for knowledge graph data management tasks, providing a rich and customizable user interface, and enabling rapid building of use case-specific applications. The paper discusses how the platform architecture design built on open standards enables its reusability in various application domains and use cases as well as facilitates integration of the knowledge graph with other parts of the organizational data and software infrastructure. We highlight the capabilities of the platform by describing its usage in four different knowledge graph application domains and share the lessons learnt from the practical experience of building knowledge graph applications in the enterprise context.",

However, automatic coding is difficult since the clinical note is composed of multiple long and heterogeneous textual narratives (e.g., discharge diagnosis, pathology reports, surgical procedure notes). Furthermore, the code label space is large and the label distribution is extremely unbalanced. The state-of-the-art methods mainly regard EHR coding as a multi-label text classification task and use shallow convolution neural network with fixed window size, which is incapable of learning variable n-gram features and the ontology structure between codes. In this paper, we leverage a densely connected convolutional neural network which is able to produce variable n-gram features for clinical note feature learning. We also incorporate a multi-scale feature attention to adaptively select multi-scale features since the most informative n-grams in clinical notes for each word can vary in length according to the neighborhood. Furthermore, we leverage graph convolutional neural network to capture both the hierarchical relationships among medical codes and the semantics of each code. Finally, We validate our method on the public dataset, and the evaluation results indicate that our method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art models.",

            "abstract": "The goal of diagnosis prediction task is to predict the future health information of patients from their historical Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR). The most important and challenging problem of diagnosis prediction is to design an accurate, robust and interpretable predictive model. Existing work solves this problem by employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms, but these approaches suffer from the data sufficiency problem. To obtain good performance with insufficient data, graph-based attention models are proposed. However, when the training data are sufficient, they do not offer any improvement in performance compared with ordinary attention-based models. To address these issues, we propose KAME, an end-to-end, accurate and robust model for predicting patients' future health information. KAME not only learns reasonable embeddings for nodes in the knowledge graph, but also exploits general knowledge to improve the prediction accuracy with the proposed knowledge attention mechanism. With the learned attention weights, KAME allows us to interpret the importance of each piece of knowledge in the graph. Experimental results on three real world datasets show that the proposed KAME significantly improves the prediction performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, guarantees the robustness with both sufficient and insufficient data, and learns interpretable disease representations.",

Automatically interpreting such relationships bears a great potential for the intelligent systems to understand human behavior in depth and to better interact with people at a social level. Human beings interpret the social relationships within a group not only based on the people alone, and the interplay between such social relationships and the contextual information around the people also plays a significant role. However, these additional cues are largely overlooked by the previous studies. We found that the interplay between these two factors can be effectively modeled by a novel structured knowledge graph with proper message propagation and attention. And this structured knowledge can be efficiently integrated into the deep neural network architecture to promote social relationship understanding by an end-to-end trainable Graph Reasoning Model (GRM), in which a propagation mechanism is learned to propagate node message through the graph to explore the interaction between persons of interest and the contextual objects. Meanwhile, a graph attentional mechanism is introduced to explicitly reason about the discriminative objects to promote recognition. Extensive experiments on the public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing leading competitors.",

The NLI problem has gained significant attention due to the release of large scale, challenging datasets. Present approaches to the problem largely focus on learning-based methods that use only textual information in order to classify whether a given premise entails, contradicts, or is neutral with respect to a given hypothesis. Surprisingly, the use of methods based on structured knowledge \u2013 a central topic in artificial intelligence \u2013 has not received much attention vis-a-vis the NLI problem. While there are many open knowledge bases that contain various types of reasoning information, their use for NLI has not been well explored. To address this, we present a combination of techniques that harness external knowledge to improve performance on the NLI problem in the science questions domain. We present the results of applying our techniques on text, graph, and text-and-graph based models; and discuss the implications of using external knowledge to solve the NLI problem. Our model achieves close to state-of-the-art performance for NLI on the SciTail science questions dataset.",

By leveraging on heterogeneous data (e.g., pedagogical data and learning assessment data) from the education domain, this system first extracts the concepts of subjects or courses and then identifies the educational relations between the concepts. More specifically, it adopts the neural sequence labeling algorithm on pedagogical data to extract instructional concepts and employs probabilistic association rule mining on learning assessment data to identify the relations with educational significance. We detail all the abovementioned efforts through an exemplary case of constructing a demonstrative knowledge graph for mathematics, where the instructional concepts and their prerequisite relations are derived from curriculum standards and concept-based performance data of students. Evaluation results show that the F1 score for concept extraction exceeds 0.70, and for relation identification, the area under the curve and mean average precision achieve 0.95 and 0.87, respectively.",

In this paper, we present Thomson Reuters\u2019 effort in developing a family of services for building and querying an enterprise knowledge graph in order to address this challenge. We first acquire data from various sources via different approaches. Furthermore, we mine useful information from the data by adopting a variety of techniques, including Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction; such mined information is further integrated with existing structured data (e.g., via Entity Linking techniques) in order to obtain relatively comprehensive descriptions of the entities. By modeling the data as an RDF graph model, we enable easy data management and the embedding of rich semantics in our data. Finally, in order to facilitate the querying of this mined and integrated data, i.e., the knowledge graph, we propose TR Discover, a natural language interface that allows users to ask questions of our knowledge graph in their own words; such natural language questions are then translated into executable queries for answer retrieval. We evaluate our services, i.e., named entity recognition, relation extraction, entity linking and natural language interface, on real-world datasets, and demonstrate and discuss their practicability and limitations.",

Considering that each filter in a conv-layer of a pre-trained CNN usually represents a mixture of object parts, we propose a simple yet efficient method to automatically disentangles different part patterns from each filter, and construct an explanatory graph. In the explanatory graph, each node represents a part pattern, and each edge encodes co-activation relationships and spatial relationships between patterns. More importantly, we learn the explanatory graph for a pre-trained CNN in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without a need of annotating object parts. Experiments show that each graph node consistently represents the same object part through different images. We transfer part patterns in the explanatory graph to the task of part localization, and our method significantly outperforms other approaches.\n \n",

Most of the traditional works for knowledge embedding need negative sampling to minimize a margin-based ranking loss. However, those works construct negative samples through a random mode, by which the samples are often too trivial to fit the model efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge representation learning framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In this GAN-based framework, we take advantage of a generator to obtain high-quality negative samples. Meanwhile, the discriminator in GAN learns the embeddings of the entities and relations in knowledge graph. Thus, we can incorporate the proposed GAN-based framework into various traditional models to improve the ability of knowledge representation learning. Experimental results show that our proposed GAN-based framework outperforms baselines on triplets classification and link prediction tasks.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding is a fundamental problem in data mining research with many real-world applications. It aims to encode the entities and relations in the graph into low dimensional vector space, which can be used for subsequent algorithms. Negative sampling, which samples negative triplets from non-observed ones in the training data, is an important step in KG embedding. Recently, generative adversarial network (GAN), has been introduced in negative sampling. By sampling negative triplets with large scores, these methods avoid the problem of vanishing gradient and thus obtain better performance. However, using GAN makes the original model more complex and harder to train, where reinforcement learning must be used. In this paper, motivated by the observation that negative triplets with large scores are important but rare, we propose to directly keep track of them with cache. However, how to sample from and update the cache are two important questions. We carefully design the solutions, which are not only efficient but also achieve good balance between exploration and exploitation. In this way, our method acts as a \"distilled\" version of previous GAN-based methods, which does not waste training time on additional parameters to fit the full distribution of negative triplets. The extensive experiments show that our method can gain significant improvement on various KG embedding models, and outperform the state-of-the-arts negative sampling methods based on GAN.",

Most conventional knowledge embedding methods encode both entities (concepts and instances) and relations as vectors in a low dimensional semantic space equally, ignoring the difference between concepts and instances. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding model named TransC by differentiating concepts and instances. Specifically, TransC encodes each concept in knowledge graph as a sphere and each instance as a vector in the same semantic space. We use the relative positions to model the relations between concepts and instances (i.e.,instanceOf), and the relations between concepts and sub-concepts (i.e., subClassOf). We evaluate our model on both link prediction and triple classification tasks on the dataset based on YAGO. Experimental results show that TransC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and captures the semantic transitivity for instanceOf and subClassOf relation. Our codes and datasets can be obtained from https://github.com/davidlvxin/TransC.",

To address this challenge, a number of knowledge graph completion methods have been developed using low-dimensional graph embeddings. Although researchers continue to improve these models using an increasingly complex feature space, we show that simple changes in the architecture of the underlying model can outperform state-of-the-art models without the need for complex feature engineering. In this work, we present a shared variable neural network model called ProjE that fills-in missing information in a knowledge graph by learning joint embeddings of the knowledge graph\u2019s entities and edges, and through subtle, but important, changes to the standard loss function. In doing so, ProjE has a parameter size that is smaller than 11 out of 15 existing methods while performing 37% better than the current-best method on standard datasets. We also show, via a new fact checking task, that ProjE is capable of accurately determining the veracity of many declarative statements.\n \n",

In this paper, we focus on API caveats that developers should be aware of in order to avoid unintended use of an API. Our formative study of Stack Overflow questions suggests that API caveats are often scattered in multiple API documents, and are buried in lengthy textual descriptions. These characteristics make the API caveats less discoverable. When developers fail to notice API caveats, it is very likely to cause some unexpected programming errors. In this paper, we propose natural language processing(NLP) techniques to extract ten subcategories of API caveat sentences from API documentation and link these sentences to API entities in an API caveats knowledge graph. The API caveats knowledge graph can support information retrieval based or entity-centric search of API caveats. As a proof-of-concept, we construct an API caveats knowledge graph for Android APIs from the API documentation on the Android Developers website. We study the abundance of different subcategories of API caveats and use a sampling method to manually evaluate the quality of the API caveats knowledge graph. We also conduct a user study to validate whether and how the API caveats knowledge graph may improve the accessibility of API caveats in API documentation.",

The open-ended dialogue state in this setting poses new challenges for existing dialogue systems. We collected a dataset of 11K human-human dialogues, which exhibits interesting lexical, semantic, and strategic elements. To model both structured knowledge and unstructured language, we propose a neural model with dynamic knowledge graph embeddings that evolve as the dialogue progresses. Automatic and human evaluations show that our model is both more effective at achieving the goal and more human-like than baseline neural and rule-based models.",

In this way, knowledge graph is compatible with numerical machine learning models. Major knowledge embedding methods employ geometric translation to design score function, which is weak-semantic for natural language processing. To overcome this disadvantage, in this paper, we propose our model based on multi-view clustering framework, which could generate semantic representations of knowledge elements (i.e., entities/relations). With our semantic model, we also present an empowered solution to entity retrieval with entity description. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves substantial improvements against baselines on the task of knowledge graph completion, triple classification, entity classification, and entity retrieval.",

In this paper, we propose a multimodal translation-based approach that defines the energy of a KG triple as the sum of sub-energy functions that leverage both multimodal (visual and linguistic) and structural KG representations. Next, a ranking-based loss is minimized using a simple neural network architecture. Moreover, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for multimodal KG representation learning. We compared the performance of our approach to other baselines on two standard tasks, namely knowledge graph completion and triple classification, using our as well as the WN9-IMG dataset. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms all baselines on both tasks and datasets.",

Most questions in them are \u2018simple\u2019 questions which can be answered based on a single relation in the knowledge base. Such data-sets lack the capability of evaluating KBQA systems on complicated questions. Motivated by this issue, we release a new data-set, namely ComplexQuestions, aiming to measure the quality of KBQA systems on \u2018multi-constraint\u2019 questions which require multiple knowledge base relations to get the answer. Beside, we propose a novel systematic KBQA approach to solve multi-constraint questions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach not only obtains comparable results on the two existing benchmark data-sets, but also achieves significant improvements on the ComplexQuestions.",

By regarding each relation as one translation from head entity to tail entity, translation-based methods including TransE, TransH and TransR are simple, effective and achieving the state-of-the-art performance. However, they still suffer the following issues: (i) low performance when modeling 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations. (ii) limited performance due to the structure sparseness of the knowledge graph. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph representation learning method by taking advantage of the rich context information in a text corpus. The rich textual context information is incorporated to expand the semantic structure of the knowledge graph and each relation is enabled to own different representations for different head and tail entities to better handle 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method successfully addresses the above issues and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

To appropriately handle the semantic variety of entities/relations in distinct triples, we propose an accurate text-enhanced knowledge graph representation learning method, which can represent a relation/entity with different representations in different triples by exploiting additional textual information. Specifically, our method enhances representations by exploiting the entity descriptions and triple-specific relation mention. And a mutual attention mechanism between relation mention and entity description is proposed to learn more accurate textual representations for further improving knowledge graph representation. Experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both link prediction and triple classification tasks, and significantly outperforms previous text-enhanced knowledge representation models.",

Though there have been a variety of models for knowledge graph embedding, most methods merely concentrate on the fact triples, while supplementary textual descriptions of entities and relations have not been fully employed. To this end, this paper proposes the semantic space projection (SSP) model which jointly learns from the symbolic triples and textual descriptions. Our model builds interaction between the two information sources, and employs textual descriptions to discover semantic relevance and offer precise semantic embedding. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves substantial improvements against baselines on the tasks of knowledge graph completion and entity classification.\n \n",

However,due to the limited public disclosure of technical details,people find it difficult to understand the connotation and value of this technology.In this paper,we introduce the key techniques involved in the construction of knowledge graph in a bottom-up way,starting from a clearly defined concept and a technical architecture of the knowledge graph.Firstly,we describe in detail the definition and connotation of the knowledge graph,and then we propose the technical framework for knowledge graph construction,in which the construction process is divided into three levels according to the abstract level of the input knowledge materials,including the information extraction layer,the knowledge integration layer,and the knowledge processing layer,respectively.Secondly,the research status of the key technologies for each level are surveyed comprehensively and also investigated criticaly for the purposes of gradualy revealing the mysteries of the knowledge graph technology,the state-of-the-art progress,and its relationship with related disciplines.Finaly,five major research chalenges in this area are summarized,and the corresponding key research issues are highlighted.",

Most conventional methods learn knowledge representations merely from structured triples, ignoring rich visual information extracted from entity images. In this paper, we propose a novel Image-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning model (IKRL), where knowledge representations are learned with both triple facts and images. More specifically, we first construct representations for all images of an entity with a neural image encoder. These image representations are then integrated into an aggregated image-based representation via an attention-based method. We evaluate our IKRL models on knowledge graph completion and triple classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our models outperform all baselines on both tasks, which indicates the significance of visual information for knowledge representations and the capability of our models in learning knowledge representations with images.",

This paper addresses a new issue of multiple relation semantics that a relation may have multiple meanings revealed by the entity pairs associated with the corresponding triples, and proposes a novel Gaussian mixture model for embedding, TransG. The new model can discover latent semantics for a relation and leverage a mixture of relation component vectors for embedding a fact triple. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative model for knowledge graph embedding, which is able to deal with multiple relation semantics. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model achieves substantial improvements against the state-of-the-art baselines.",

In this paper, we establish a knowledge graph triple trustworthiness measurement model that quantify their semantic correctness and the true degree of the facts expressed. The model is a crisscrossing neural network structure. It synthesizes the internal semantic information in the triples and the global inference information of the KG to achieve the trustworthiness measurement and fusion in the three levels of entity level, relationship level, and KG global level. We analyzed the validity of the model output confidence values, and conducted experiments in the real-world dataset FB15K (from Freebase) for the knowledge graph error detection task. The experimental results showed that compared with other models, our model achieved significant and consistent improvements.",

Zero-knowledge proofs are defined as those proofs that convey no additional knowledge other than the correctness of the proposition in question. Examples of zero-knowledge proof systems are given for the languages of quadratic residuosity and 'quadratic nonresiduosity. These are the first examples of zero-knowledge proofs for languages not known to be efficiently recognizable.",

To develop PHKG, aggregating knowledge from various heterogeneous sources such as the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, clinical notes, and Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is necessary. In this paper, we explain the challenges of collecting, managing, analyzing, and integrating patients' health data from various sources in order to synthesize and deduce meaningful information embodying the vision of the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom (DIKW) pyramid. Furthermore, we sketch a solution that combines: 1) IoT data analytics, and 2) explicit knowledge and illustrate it using three chronic disease use cases - asthma, obesity, and Parkinson's.",

In this paper, we present a novel time-aware knowledge graph completion model that is able to predict links in a KG using both the existing facts and the temporal information of the facts. To incorporate the happening time of facts, we propose a time-aware KG embedding model using temporal order information among facts. To incorporate the valid time of facts, we propose a joint time-aware inference model based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) using temporal consistencyinformationasconstraints.

For example, annotations of entities from large general purpose knowledge bases, such as Freebase and the Google Knowledge Graph. Understanding how to leverage these entity annotations of text to improve ad hoc document retrieval is an open research area. Query expansion is a commonly used technique to improve retrieval effectiveness. Most previous query expansion approaches focus on text, mainly using unigram concepts. In this paper, we propose a new technique, called entity query feature expansion (EQFE) which enriches the query with features from entities and their links to knowledge bases, including structured attributes and text. We experiment using both explicit query entity annotations and latent entities. We evaluate our technique on TREC text collections automatically annotated with knowledge base entity links, including the Google Freebase Annotations (FACC1) data. We find that entity-based feature expansion results in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art text expansion approaches.",

We propose a way to distinguish errors made in the extraction process from factual errors in the web source per se, by using joint inference in a novel multi-layer probabilistic model.\n \n We call the trustworthiness score we computed\n Knowledge-Based Trust (KBT)\n . On synthetic data, we show that our method can reliably compute the true trustworthiness levels of the sources. We then apply it to a database of 2.8B facts extracted from the web, and thereby estimate the trustworthiness of 119M webpages. Manual evaluation of a subset of the results confirms the effectiveness of the method.\n",

This is mainly because they acquire knowledge based on statistical co-occurrences, even if most of the knowledge words are rarely observed named entities. In this paper, we propose a Neural Knowledge Language Model (NKLM) which combines symbolic knowledge provided by a knowledge graph with the RNN language model. At each time step, the model predicts a fact on which the observed word is to be based. Then, a word is either generated from the vocabulary or copied from the knowledge graph. We train and test the model on a new dataset, WikiFacts. In experiments, we show that the NKLM significantly improves the perplexity while generating a much smaller number of unknown words. In addition, we demonstrate that the sampled descriptions include named entities which were used to be the unknown words in RNN language models.",

Prior work has proposed effective methods to learn event representations that can capture syntactic and semantic information over text corpus, demonstrating their effectiveness for downstream tasks such as event-driven stock prediction. On the other hand, events extracted from raw texts do not contain background knowledge on entities and relations that they are mentioned. To address this issue, this paper proposes to leverage extra information from knowledge graph, which provides ground truth such as attributes and properties of entities and encodes valuable relations between entities. Specifically, we propose a joint model to combine knowledge graph information into the objective function of an event embedding learning model. Experiments on event similarity and stock market prediction show that our model is more capable of obtaining better event embeddings and making more accurate prediction on stock market volatilities.",

However, existing methods could not characterize the knowledge graph in a fine degree to make a precise prediction. There are two reasons: being an ill-posed algebraic system and applying an overstrict geometric form. As precise prediction is critical, we propose an manifold-based embedding principle (\\textbf{ManifoldE}) which could be treated as a well-posed algebraic system that expands the position of golden triples from one point in current models to a manifold in ours. Extensive experiments show that the proposed models achieve substantial improvements against the state-of-the-art baselines especially for the precise prediction task, and yet maintain high efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge embedding, which projects triples in a given knowledge base to d-dimensional vectors, has attracted considerable research efforts recently. Most existing approaches treat the given knowledge base as a set of triplets, each of whose representation is then learned separately. However, as a fact, triples are connected and depend on each other. In this paper, we propose a graph aware knowledge embedding method (GAKE), which formulates knowledge base as a directed graph, and learns representations for any vertices or edges by leveraging the graph\u2019s structural information. We introduce three types of graph context for embedding: neighbor context, path context, and edge context, each reflects properties of knowledge from different perspectives. We also design an attention mechanism to learn representative power of different vertices or edges. To validate our method, we conduct several experiments on two tasks. Experimental results suggest that our method outperforms several state-of-art knowledge embedding models.",

One approach to breaking these silos is to map local, often database-specific identifiers to shared global identifiers. This mapping can then be used to construct a knowledge graph, where entities such as taxa, publications, people, places, specimens, sequences, and institutions are all part of a single, shared knowledge space. Motivated by the 2018 GBIF Ebbe Nielsen Challenge I explore the feasibility of constructing a \u201cbiodiversity knowledge graph\u201d for the Australian fauna. These steps involved in constructing the graph are described, and examples its application are discussed. A web interface to the knowledge graph (called \u201cOzymandias\u201d) is available at https://ozymandias-demo.herokuapp.com.",

Where a decade ago data scien-tists were still engineering features, manually picking out the details they thought salient, they now prefer the data in their raw form. As long as we can assume that all relevant and ir-relevant information is present in the input data, we can de-sign deep models that build up intermediate representations to sift out relevant features. However, these models are often domain specific and tailored to the task at hand, and therefore unsuited for learning on heterogeneous knowledge: informa-tion of different types and from different domains. If we can develop methods that operate on this form of knowledge, we can dispense with a great deal of ad-hoc feature engineering and train deep models end-to-end in many more domains. To accomplish this, we first need a data model capable of ex-pressing heterogeneous knowledge naturally in various do-mains, in as usable a form as possible, and satisfying as many use cases as possible. In this position paper, we argue that the knowledge graph is a suitable candidate for this data model. This paper describes current research and discusses some of the promises and challenges of this approach.",

Our method relies on the use of a semantic network, namely the DBpedia knowledge base, for acquiring fine-grained information about entities and their semantic relations, thus resulting in a knowledge-rich document model. We demonstrate the benefits of these semantic representations in two tasks: entity ranking and computing document semantic similarity. To this end, we couple DBpedia's structure with an information-theoretic measure of concept association, based on its explicit semantic relations, and compute semantic similarity using a Graph Edit Distance based measure, which finds the optimal matching between the documents' entities using the Hungarian method. Experimental results show that our general model outperforms baselines built on top of traditional methods, and achieves a performance close to that of highly specialized methods that have been tuned to these specific tasks.",

Current approaches lack explicit background knowledge.In this paper, we introduce a novel technical question understanding approach to recommending probable solutions to users. First, a knowledge graph is constructed which contains abundant technical information, and an augmented knowledge graph is built on the basis of the knowledge graph, to link the knowledge graph and documents. Then we develop a light weight question driven mechanism to select candidate documents. To improve the online performance, we propose an index-based random walk to support the online search. We use comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a large scale of real-world query logs. Our system outperforms main-stream search engine and the state-of-art information retrieval methods. Meanwhile, extensive experiments confirm the efficiency of our index-based online search mechanism.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Many knowledge repositories nowadays contain billions of triplets, i.e. (head-entity, relationship, tail-entity), as relation instances. These triplets form a directed graph with entities as nodes and relationships as edges. However, this kind of symbolic and discrete storage structure makes it difficult for us to exploit the knowledge to enhance other intelligenceacquired applications (e.g. the QuestionAnswering System), as many AI-related algorithms prefer conducting computation on continuous data. Therefore, a series of emerging approaches have been proposed to facilitate knowledge computing via encoding the knowledge graph into a low-dimensional embedding space. TransE is the latest and most promising approach among them, and can achieve a higher performance with fewer parameters by modeling the relationship as a transitional vector from the head entity to the tail entity. Unfortunately, it is not flexible enough to tackle well with the various mapping properties of triplets, even though its authors spot the harm on performance. In this paper, we thus propose a superior model called TransM to leverage the structure of the knowledge graph via pre-calculating the distinct weight for each training triplet according to its relational mapping property. In this way, the optimal function deals with each triplet depending on its own weight. We carry out extensive experiments to compare TransM with the state-of-the-art method TransE and other prior arts. The performance of each approach is evaluated within two different application scenarios on several benchmark datasets. Results show that the model we proposed significantly outperforms the former ones with lower parameter complexity as TransE.",
