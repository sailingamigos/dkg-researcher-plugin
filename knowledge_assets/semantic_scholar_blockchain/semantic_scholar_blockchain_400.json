            "abstract": "Over the last decade, blockchain technology has emerged to provide solutions to thecomplexity and privacy challenges of using distributed databases. It reduces cost for customers byeliminating intermediaries and builds trust in peer-to-peer communications. Over this time, theconcept of blockchain has shifted greatly due to its potential in business growth for enterprisesand the rapidly evolving applications in a collaborative smart-city ecosystem, healthcare, andgovernance. Many platforms, with different architectures and consensus protocols, have beenintroduced. Consequently, it becomes challenging for an application developer to choose the rightplatform. Furthermore, blockchain has misaligned with the goals for an efficient green collaborativedigital ecosystem. Therefore, it becomes critical to address this gap and to build new frameworks toalign blockchain with those goals. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of blockchain architectureand consensus protocols, bringing a retrospective analysis and discussing the rationale of theevolution of the various architectures and protocols, as well as capturing the assumptions conduciveto their development and contributions to building collaborative applications. We introduce aclassification of those architectures helping developers to choose a suitable platform for applicationsand providing insights for future research directions in the field to build new frameworks.",

            "abstract": "Vehicular energy network (VEN), as an important part of the Internet of Things for the smart city, can facilitate the renewable energy (RE) transportation over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs) through wireless power transfer technology. However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs\u2019 utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes.",

In particular, academic literature in transport and logistics to date has not sufficiently distinguished between blockchain adoption (\u2018what to adopt\u2019) and the identification of the right business opportunity (\u2018where to start\u2019). In response, this paper (1) uses Rogers\u2019 (2003) \u2018attributes of innovation framework\u2019 to identify potential blockchain applications and (2) presents a framework explicating four transformation phases to subsequently categorise the identified areas of application according to their effects on organisational structures and processes. Using academic and practitioner literature, we classify possible applications for adoption and provide a framework to identify blockchain opportunities in the logistics industry, thereby helping managers to systematically assess where to start building organisational capabilities in order to successfully adopt and deploy blockchain-based technology.",

Towards this goal, we attribute attack viability in the attack surface to 1) the Blockchain cryptographic constructs, 2) the distributed architecture of the systems using Blockchain, and 3) the Blockchain application context. To each of those contributing factors, we outline several attacks, including selfish mining, the 51% attack, Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, consensus delay (due to selfish behavior or distributed denial-of-service attacks), Blockchain forks, orphaned and stale blocks, block ingestion, wallet thefts, smart contract attacks, and privacy attacks. We also explore the causal relationships between these attacks to demonstrate how various attack vectors are connected to one another. A secondary contribution of this work is outlining effective defense measures taken by the Blockchain technology or proposed by researchers to mitigate the effects of these attacks and patch associated vulnerabilities",

            "abstract": "The privacy-preserving authentication is considered as the first line of defense against the attacks in addition to preserving the identity privacy of the vehicles in the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, the existing authentication schemes suffer from drawbacks such as nontransparency of the trusted authorities (TAs), heavy workload to revoke certificates, and high computation overhead to authenticate identities and messages. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving authentication (BPPA) scheme for VANETs. In BPPA, all the certificates and transactions are recorded permanently and immutably in the blockchain to make the activities of the semi-TAs transparent and verifiable. However, it remains a challenge how to use such blockchain effectively for authentication in real driving scenarios (e.g., high speed or large amount of messages during congestion). With a novel data structure named the Merkle Patricia tree (MPT), we extend the conventional blockchain structure to provide a distributed authentication scheme without the revocation list. To achieve conditional privacy, we allow a vehicle to use multiple certificates. The linkability between the certificates and real identity is encrypted and stored in the blockchain and can only be revealed in case of disputes. We evaluate the validity and performance of BPPA on the Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) platform for each entity. The experimental results show that the distributed authentication can be processed by individual vehicles within 1 ms, which meets the real-time requirement and is much more efficient, in terms of the processing time and storage requirement, than existing approaches.",

In particular, the performance of the Hyperledger Fabric platform is evaluated in terms of: (a) throughput, i.e., successful transactions per second; (b) latency, i.e., response time per transaction in seconds; and (c) scalability, i.e., number of participants serviceable by the platform. The results indicate that the instance of Hyperledger Fabric platform being implemented can support up to 100,000 participants on the selected AWS EC2 instance. As long as the transaction rate is maintained within 200 transactions per seconds, the network latency is in the order of fraction of a second.",

A wireless sensor network is the core technology to support the operation of the IoT, and the security problem is becoming more and more serious. Aiming at the problem that the existing malicious node detection methods in wireless sensor networks cannot be guaranteed by fairness and traceability of detection process, we present a blockchain trust model (BTM) for malicious node detection in wireless sensor networks. First, it gives the whole framework of the trust model. Then, it constructs the blockchain data structure which is used to detect malicious nodes. Finally, it realizes the detection of malicious nodes in 3D space by using the blockchain smart contract and the WSNs\u2019 quadrilateral measurement localization method, and the voting consensus results are recorded in the blockchain distributed. The simulation results show that the model can effectively detect malicious nodes in WSNs, and it can also ensure the traceability of the detection process.",

It brings convenience to people's daily lives; however, the issues of security and privacy of IoT become challenges. Blockchain, a decentralized database based on cryptographic techniques, is promising for IoT security, which may influence a variety of areas including manufacture, finance, and trading. The blockchain framework in an IoT system is an intriguing alternative to the traditional centralized model, which is struggling to meet some specified demands in IoT. In this article, we investigate typical security and privacy issues in IoT and develop a framework to integrate blockchain with IoT, which can provide great assurance for IoT data and various functionalities and desirable scalability including authentication, decentralized payment, and so on. We also suggest some possible solutions to these security and privacy issues in IoT based on blockchain and Ethereum to show how blockchain contributes to IoT.",

Blockchain technology enables the creation of decentralized currencies, self-executing digital contracts (smart contracts) and intelligent assets that can be controlled over the Internet (smart property). The blockchain also enables the development of new governance systems with more democratic or participatory decision-making, and decentralized (autonomous) organizations that can operate over a network of computers without any human intervention. These applications have lead many to compare the blockchain to the Internet, with accompanying predictions that this technology will shift the balance of power away from centralized authorities in the field of communications, business, and even politics or law.In this Article, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of this emerging decentralized technology and argue that its widespread deployment will lead to expansion of a new subset of law, which we term Lex Cryptographia: rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (autonomous) organizations. As blockchain technology becomes widely adopted, centralized authorities, such as governmental agencies and large multinational corporations, could lose the ability to control and shape the activities of disparate people through existing means. As a result, there will be an increasing need to focus on how to regulate blockchain technology and how to shape the creation and deployment of these emerging decentralized organizations in ways that have yet to be explored under current legal theory.",

            "abstract": "Both in the design and deployment of blockchain solutions many performance-impacting configuration choices need to be made. We introduce BlockSim, a framework and software tool to build and simulate discrete-event dynamic systems models for blockchain systems. BlockSim is designed to support the analysis of a large variety of blockchains and blockchain deployments as well as a wide set of analysis questions. At the core of BlockSim is a Base Model, which contains the main model constructs common across various blockchain systems organized in three abstraction layers (network, consensus, and incentives layer). The Base Model is usable for a wide variety of blockchain systems and can be extended easily to include system or deployment particulars. The BlockSim software tool provides a simulator that implements the Base Model in Python. The paper describes the Base Model, the simulator implementation, and the application of BlockSim to Bitcoin, Ethereum and other consensus algorithms. We validate BlockSim simulation results by comparison with performance results from actual systems and from other studies in the literature. We close the paper by a BlockSim simulation study of the impact of uncle blocks rewards on mining decentralization, for a variety of blockchain configurations.",

In addition, we combine the emerging blockchain technology with PHS, via constructing a consortium blockchain linking patients, hospitals, health bureaus, and healthcare communities for comprehensive healthcare data sharing, medical records review, and care auditability. Finally, a prototype named parallel gout diagnosis and treatment system is built and deployed to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the blockchain-powered PHS framework.",

The historical perspective presented in the last two decades suggests that it has not been so successful due to the security and privacy flaws observed over time. This paper suggests a framework by using effective hashing techniques to ensure the security of the data. The concept of block creation and block sealing is introduced in this paper. The introduction of a block sealing concept helps in making the blockchain adjustable to meet the need of the polling process. The use of consortium blockchain is suggested, which ensures that the blockchain is owned by a governing body (e.g., election commission), and no unauthorized access can be made from outside. The framework proposed in this paper discusses the effectiveness of the polling process, hashing algorithms\u2019 utility, block creation and sealing, data accumulation, and result declaration by using the adjustable blockchain method. This paper claims to apprehend the security and data management challenges in blockchain and provides an improved manifestation of the electronic voting process.",

As a result, there may be opportunities to leverage insights from RFID research to inform the consideration of blockchain. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the Reyes et al. (2016) framework for the implementation of RFID may inform the consideration of blockchain in the supply chain.,A two-stage approach is used to explore RFID implementation considerations from the Reyes et al. (2016) RFID implementation framework, using an initial exploration of managers interested in blockchain using a focus group and a survey and to more in depth explore three case companies pioneering blockchain.,Several RFID implementation considerations can inform the consideration of blockchain but there are also differences in considering blockchain. A framework is developed that details considerations found to be relevant by implementation stage.,This paper adds to the limited amount of empirical research on blockchain in the supply chain and advances research beyond the consideration of use cases into the exploration of actual implementation of blockchain in the supply chain. The decision framework developed both leverages and nuances findings from RFID research and can inform managerial decision making. It also adds to research a multi-stage approach to implementation and uncovers rich opportunity to further learn from pioneers.",

            "abstract": "Nakamoto's famous blockchain protocol enables achieving consensus in a so-called permissionless setting---anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution, and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players. His ingenious protocol prevents \"sybil attacks\" (where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relying on computational puzzles (a.k.a. \"moderately hard functions\") introduced by Dwork and Naor (Crypto'92). Recent work by Garay et al (EuroCrypt'15) and Pass et al (manuscript, 2016) demonstrate that this protocol provably achieves consistency and liveness assuming a) honest players control a majority of the computational power in the network, b) the puzzle-hardness is appropriately set as a function of the maximum network delay and the total computational power of the network, and c) the computational puzzle is modeled as a random oracle. Assuming honest participation, however, is a strong assumption, especially in a setting where honest players are expected to perform a lot of work (to solve the computational puzzles). In Nakamoto's Bitcoin application of the blockchain protocol, players are incentivized to solve these puzzles by receiving rewards for every \"block\" (of transactions) they contribute to the blockchain. An elegant work by Eyal and Sirer (FinancialCrypt'14), strengthening and formalizing an earlier attack discussed on the Bitcoin forum, demonstrates that a coalition controlling even a minority fraction of the computational power in the network can gain (close to) 2 times its \"fair share\" of the rewards (and transaction fees) by deviating from the protocol instructions. In contrast, in a fair protocol, one would expect that players controlling a \u03c6 fraction of the computational resources to reap a \u03c6 fraction of the rewards. We present a new blockchain protocol---the FruitChain protocol---which satisfies the same consistency and liveness properties as Nakamoto's protocol (assuming an honest majority of the computing power), and additionally is \u03b4-approximately fair: with overwhelming probability, any honest set of players controlling a \u03c6 fraction of computational power is guaranteed to get at least a fraction (1-\u03b4)\u03c6 of the blocks (and thus rewards) in any \u03a9(\u03ba/\u03b4) length segment of the chain (where \u03ba is the security parameter). Consequently, if this blockchain protocol is used as the ledger underlying a cryptocurrency system, where rewards and transaction fees are evenly distributed among the miners of blocks in a length \u03ba segment of the chain, no coalition controlling less than a majority of the computing power can gain more than a factor (1+3\u03b4) by deviating from the protocol (i.e., honest participation is an n/2-coalition-safe 3\u03b4-Nash equilibrium). Finally, the FruitChain protocol enables decreasing the variance of mining rewards and as such significantly lessens (or even obliterates) the need for mining pools.",

Blockchain, as a distributed public ledger technology, has been widely adopted in the design of new energy trading schemes. However, there are many challenging issues in blockchain-based energy trading, e.g., low efficiency, high transaction cost, and security and privacy issues. To tackle these challenges, many solutions have been proposed. In this survey, the blockchain-based energy trading in the electrical power system is thoroughly investigated. Firstly, the challenges in blockchain-based energy trading are identified and summarized. Then, the existing energy trading schemes are studied and classified into three categories based on their main focuses: energy transaction, consensus mechanism, and system optimization. Blockchain-based energy trading has been a popular research topic, new blockchain architectures, models and products are continually emerging to overcome the limitations of existing solutions, forming a virtuous circle. The internal combination of different blockchain types and the combination of blockchain with other technologies improve the blockchain-based energy trading system to better satisfy the practical requirements of modern power systems. However, there are still some problems to be solved, for example, the lack of regulatory system, environmental challenges and so on. In the future, we will strive for a better optimized structure and establish a comprehensive security assessment model for blockchain-based energy trading system.",

Moreover, providing integrated, personalized, and on-demand services have shared, connected, and autonomous cars in the smart city for a sustainable ecosystem. To address these issues in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based distributed framework for the automotive industry in the smart city. The proposed framework includes a novel miner node selection algorithm for the blockchain-based distributed network architecture. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed framework, we simulated the proposed model on a private Ethereum blockchain platform using captured dataset of mined blocks from litecoinpool.org.

Performing experiments on actual blockchains is difficult because a large number of nodes in wide areas are necessary. In this study, we developed a blockchain network simulator SimBlock for such experiments. Unlike the existing simulators, SimBlock can easily change behavior of nodes, so that it enables to investigate the influence of nodes' behavior on blockchains. We compared some simulation results with the measured values in actual blockchains to demonstrate the validity of this simulator. Furthermore, to show practical usage, we conducted two experiments which clarify the influence of neighbor node selection algorithms and relay networks on the block propagation time. The simulator could depict the effects of the two techniques on block propagation time. The simulator will be publicly available in a few months.",

Intensive research is currently being conducted in both academia and industry applying the Blockchain technology in multifarious applications. Proof-of-Work (PoW), a cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital role in ensuring BC security by maintaining a digital ledger of transactions, which is considered to be incorruptible. Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the users' identity, which provides an extra layer of privacy. Not only in cryptocurrency has the successful adoption of BC been implemented but also in multifaceted non-monetary systems such as in: distributed storage systems, proof-of-location, healthcare, decentralized voting and so forth. Recent research articles and projects/applications were surveyed to assess the implementation of BC for enhanced security, to identify associated challenges and to propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced security systems.",

This special issue addresses the need for innovative research that offers a fresh look at the opportunities and challenges of blockchain. This editorial integrates and goes beyond the papers included in this special issue by providing a framework for blockchain research in IS that emphasizes two important issues. First, we direct the attention of IS research toward the blockchain protocol level, which is characterized by recursive interactions between human agents and the blockchain protocol. Second, we highlight the need for IS research to consider how the protocol level constrains and affords blockchain applications, and how these constraints and other concerns at the application level lead to changes at the protocol level. Rooted in a sociomaterial view of IS, we offer a multi-paradigmatic IS research agenda that underscores the need for behavioral (individual, group, and organizational), design science, and IS economics research on blockchain. Our research agenda emphasizes issues of blockchain governance, human and material agency, blockchain affordances and constraints, as well as the consequences of its use.",

In recent years, cloud-based electronic medical record sharing scheme has brought a lot of conveniences, but the centralization of cloud exposes threats inevitably to data security and privacy preservation. Blockchain technology can be seen as a promising solution to address these problems on account of its unique propertis of decentration, anonymity, unforgeability and verifiability. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based secure and privacy-preserving EHR sharing protocol. Data requester can search desired keyword from data provider to find relevant EHRs on the EHR consortium blockchain and get the re-encryption ciphertext from cloud server after getting the data owner\u2019s authorization. The scheme mainly uses searchable encryption and conditional proxy re-encryption to realize data security, privacy preservation, and access control. Furthermore, proof of authorization is designed as the consensus mechanism for consortium blockchain to guarantee system\u2019s availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can achieve security goals. Besides, we emulate the cryptographic primitives and implement the proposed scheme on Ethereum platform. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has high computational efficiency.",

To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure FaBric blockchain-based data transmission technique for industrial IoT. This technique uses the blockchain-based dynamic secret sharing mechanism. A reliable trading center is realized using the power blockchain sharing model, which can also share power trading books. The power data consensus mechanism and dynamic linked storage are designed to realize the secure matching of the power data transmission. Experiments show that the optimized FaBric power data storage and transmission has high security and reliability. The proposed technique can improve the transmission rate and packet receiving rate by 12% and 13%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed technique has good superiority in sharing management and decentralization.",

This paper presents a systematic literature review of the blockchain technology, tracking its increase in popularity in relation to similar technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. The objective of this paper is to identify the current standing of the blockchain technology within the literature while also identifying the major fields of study and areas of application for which blockchain offers a valuable solution. This paper finds that unique features to the blockchain, such as privacy, security, anonymity, decentralization, and immutability, provide valuable benefits to various fields and subjects. This paper also finds that exploring the application of blockchain has only begun with some limited studies in areas, such as the Internet of Things, energy, finance, healthcare, and government, that also stand to benefit disproportionately from its implementation.",

Payment records in V2G networks are useful for extracting user behaviors and facilitating decision-making for optimized power supply, scheduling, pricing, and consumption. Sharing payment and user information, however, raises serious privacy concerns in addition to the existing challenge of secure and reliable transaction processing. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based privacy preserving payment mechanism for V2G networks, which enables data sharing while securing sensitive user information. The mechanism introduces a registration and data maintenance process that is based on a blockchain technique, which ensures the anonymity of user payment data while enabling payment auditing by privileged users. Our design is implemented based on Hyperledger to carefully evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.",

Using Internet of Things (IoT) to mine makes blockchain more ubiquitous and decentralized, which has become a main development trend of blockchain. However, the limited resources of existing IoT cannot satisfy the high requirements of on-demand energy consumption in the mining process through a decentralized way. To address this, we propose a decentralized on-demand energy supply approach based on microgrids to provide decentralized on-demand energy for mining in IoT devices. First, energy supply architecture is proposed to satisfy different energy demands of miners in response to different consensus protocols. Then, we formulate the energy allocation as a Stackelberg game and adapt backward induction to achieve an optimal profit strategy for both microgrids and miners in IoT. The simulation results show the fairness and incentive of the proposed approach.",

IoTChain consists of two components, an authorization blockchain based on the ACE framework and the OSCAR object security model, extended with a group key scheme. The blockchain provides a flexible and trustless way to handle authorization while OSCAR uses the public ledger to set up multicast groups for authorized clients. To evaluate the feasibility of our architecture, we have implemented the authorization blockchain on top of a private Ethereum network. We report on several experiments that assess the performance of different architecture components.",

However, blockchain adoption and use in the context of e-Government is rather unexplored in academic literature. In this paper, we systematically review relevant research to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding blockchain adoption for e-Government. The results show that the adoption of blockchain-based applications in e-Government is still very limited and there is a lack of empirical evidence. The main challenges faced in blockchain adoption are predominantly presented as technological aspects such as security, scalability and flexibility. From an organizational point of view, the issues of acceptability and the need of new governance models are presented as the main barriers to adoption. Moreover, the lack of legal and regulatory support is identified as the main environmental barrier of adoption. Based on the challenges presented in the literature, we propose future research questions that need to be addressed to inform how the public sector should approach the blockchain technology adoption.",

Analysing these records shows that (i) current research on FinTech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding; (ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways; (iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation; (iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries; and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all.",

The main benefit of a blockchain is faster and more flexible settlement, whereas settlement fails need to be ruled out where participants fork the chain to cancel trading losses. With a proof-of-work protocol, the blockchain needs to restrict settlement speed through block size and time in order to generate transaction fees, which finance costly mining. Despite mining being a deadweight cost, our estimates for the U.S. corporate debt market yield net gains from a blockchain in the range of 1\u20134 bps.Received May 31, 2017; editorial decision May 29, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein.

Nevertheless, some key challenges still need to be given particular attention so that IoT solutions further support the growing demand for connected devices and the services offered. Due to the potential relevance and sensitivity of services, IoT solutions should address the security and privacy concerns surrounding these devices and the data they collect, generate, and process. Recently, the Blockchain technology has gained much attention in IoT solutions. Its primary usage scenarios are in the financial domain, where Blockchain creates a promising applications world and can be leveraged to solve security and privacy issues. However, this emerging technology has a great potential in the most diverse technological areas and can significantly help achieve the Internet of Things view in different aspects, increasing the capacity of decentralization, facilitating interactions, enabling new transaction models, and allowing autonomous coordination of the devices. The paper goal is to provide the concepts about the structure and operation of Blockchain and, mainly, analyze how the use of this technology can be used to provide security and privacy in IoT. Finally, we present the stalker, which is a selfish miner variant that has the objective of preventing a node to publish its blocks on the main chain.",

This study explores blockchain acceptance by mining the collective intelligence of users on Twitter. It maps blockchain user acceptance drivers to technology acceptance constructs. The analysis shows that users are attracted by security, privacy, transparency, trust and traceability aspects provided by blockchain. On Twitter more discussions on blockchain benefits than on drawbacks. Initial coin offering (ICO) is extensively discussed. The study provides guidelines for managers and concludes by presenting the limitations of the study along with future research directions.",

As we argue, there are several reasons to prefer an editable blockchain, spanning from the necessity to remove inappropriate content and the possibility to support applications requiring re-writable storage, to \"the right to be forgotten.\" Our approach generically leverages so-called chameleon hash functions (Krawczyk and Rabin, NDSS '00), which allow determining hash collisions efficiently, given a secret trapdoor information. We detail how to integrate a chameleon hash function in virtually any blockchain-based technology, for both cases where the power of redacting the blockchain content is in the hands of a single trusted entity and where such a capability is distributed among several distrustful parties (as is the case with Bitcoin). We also report on a proof-of-concept implementation of a redactable blockchain, building on top of Nakamoto's Bitcoin core. The prototype only requires minimal changes to the way current client software interprets the information stored in the blockchain and to the current blockchain, block, or transaction structures. Moreover, our experiments show that the overhead imposed by a redactable blockchain is small compared to the case of an immutable one.",

Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology.

We confirm generally understood trends in the blockchain market with new projects following the industry\u2019s general hype and funding levels. We observe most activity in the Agriculture/Grocery sector and the Freight/Logistics sector. We see the shift of market interest from private companies (startups) to public companies and consortia and the change in blockchain adoption from Ethereum to Hyperledger. Finally, we observe more market-ready solutions and fewer inactive projects for Hyperledger-based projects than Ethereum-based projects.",

However, emerging applications and services require major changes in underlying network models and computing that require new road network planning. Meanwhile, blockchain widely known as one of the disruptive technologies has emerged in recent years, is experiencing rapid development and has the potential to revolutionize intelligent transport systems. Blockchain can be used to build an intelligent, secure, distributed and autonomous transport system. It allows better utilization of the infrastructure and resources of intelligent transport systems, particularly effective for crowdsourcing technology. In this paper, we proposes a vehicle network architecture based on blockchain in the smart city (Block-VN). Block-VN is a reliable and secure architecture that operates in a distributed way to build the new distributed transport management system. We are considering a new network system of vehicles, Block-VN, above them. In addition, we examine how the network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused on networking and vehicular information. Finally, we discuss service scenarios and design principles for Block-VN.",

This paper aims to investigate whether the consensus process using Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) could be a performance bottleneck for networks with a large number of peers. We model the PBFT consensus process using Stochastic Reward Nets (SRN) to compute the mean time to complete consensus for networks up to 100 peers. We create a blockchain network using IBM Bluemix service, running a production-grade IoT application and use the data to parameterize and validate our models. We also conduct sensitivity analysis over a variety of system parameters and examine the performance of larger networks",

One potential solution for improving security, integrity, data provenance, and functionality of the health supply chain is blockchain technology. \nObjectives: Provide an overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with blockchain adoption and deployment for the health supply chain, with a focus on the pharmaceutical supply, medical device and supplies, Internet of Healthy Things (IoHT), and public health sectors. \nMethods: A narrative review was conducted of the academic literature, grey literature, and industry publications, in addition to identifying and characterizing select stakeholders engaged in exploring blockchain solutions for the health supply chain. \nResults: Critical challenges in protecting the integrity of the health supply chain appear well suited for adoption of blockchain technology. Use cases are emerging, including using blockchain to combat counterfeit medicines,\u00a0securing medical devices, optimizing functionality of IoHT, and improving the public health supply chain. Despite these clear opportunities, most blockchain initiatives remain in proof-of-concept or pilot phase. \nConclusion: Blockchain technology has the unrealized promise to help improve the health supply chain, but further study, evaluation and alignment with policy mechanisms is needed. \nKeywords:\u00a0Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical, Supply chain",

            "abstract": "This paper conducts a performance analysis of two popular private blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum (private deployment), to assess the performance and limitations of these state-of-the-art platforms. Blockchain, a decentralized transaction and data management technology, is said to be the technology that will have similar impacts as the Internet had on people's lives. Many industries have become interested in adopting blockchain in their IT systems, but scalability is an often- cited concern of current blockchain technology. Therefore, the goals of this preliminary performance analysis are twofold. First, a methodology for evaluating a blockchain platform is developed. Second, the analysis results are presented to inform practitioners in making decisions regarding adoption of blockchain technology in their IT systems. The experimental results, based on varying number of transactions, show that Hyperledger Fabric consistently outperforms Ethereum across all evaluation metrics which are execution time, latency and throughput. Additionally, both platforms are still not competitive with current database systems in term of performances in high workload scenarios.",

The sample data were collected from 397 supply chain practitioners in India to validate the conceptual model. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to ascertain the validity of the measures used and a structural model was analyzed for testing the proposed conceptual framework.,The results of the present study show that blockchain technology can improve supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility which lead to competitive advantage, which leads to better firm performance. Besides, trust generated through blockchain use also increases firm performance.,Currently, the respondents do not have practical experience of using blockchain technology. They have responded based on their knowledge about supply chain and blockchain which they acquired from published sources. Different supply chains require different strategic choices and different information needs. But the present study assumes that all supply chain needs are identical. The present study assumes that government regulations regarding blockchain technology are favorable; however, currently, there is no legal framework to address blockchain technology. The findings of the current study indicate that companies not only should create more awareness regarding blockchain but also should actively work with IT companies that are engaged in developing blockchain-based supply chain solution. Managers, as well as IT companies and academicians, should join hands to study and develop a framework for regulating blockchain technology and suggest these to the policy actors.,The present study shows that supply chain practitioners are confident that blockchain technology will help improve supply chain parameters. These findings can help IT companies and their marketers for developing and promoting blockchain-based IT applications. In addition, the important implication for supply chain practitioners is that blockchain helps in creating a competitive advantage and increases firm performance.,The effect of IT on important supply chain variables has been studied in the past; however, there is not a single study which sheds light on how disruptive technologies such as blockchain will affect supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility and firm performance.",

            "abstract": "Despite recent intensive research, existing blockchain systems do not adequately address all the characteristics of distributed applications. In particular, distributed applications collaborate with each other following service level agreements (SLAs) to provide different services. While collaboration between applications, e.g., cross-application transactions, should be visible to all applications, the internal data of each application, e.g, internal transactions, might be confidential. In this paper, we introduce CAPER, a permissioned blockchain system to support both internal and cross-application transactions of collaborating distributed applications. In CAPER, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph where each application accesses and maintains only its own view of the ledger including its internal and all cross-application transactions. CAPER also introduces three consensus protocols to globally order crossapplication transactions between applications with different internal consensus protocols. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of CAPER in terms of performance and scalability. PVLDB Reference Format: Mohammad Javad Amiri, Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi.

Although still new and in experimenting phase, the Blockchain is being seen as a revolutionary solution, addressing modern technology concerns like decentralization, trust, identity, data ownership and data-driven decisions. At the same time, the world is facing an expansion in quantity and diversity of digital data that are generated by both users and machines. While actively searching for the best way to store, organize and process Big Data, the Blockchain technology comes in providing significant input. Its proposed solutions about decentralized management of private data, digital property resolution, IoT communication and public institutions' reforms are having significant impact on how Big Data may evolve. This paper presents the novel solutions associated with some of the Big Data areas that can be empowered by the Blockchain technology.",

            "abstract": "As an emerging decentralized secure data management platform, blockchain has gained much popularity recently. To maintain a canonical state of blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block of transactions through a process of \u201cblock mining\u201d by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a proof-of-work based blockchain network, which is constrained by the computing resource and deployed as an infrastructure for decentralized data management applications. Due to the competition among miners in the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing service provider.",

However, most of the existing research and practices are focused on the blockchain itself (i.e. technical challenges and limitations) or its applications in the finance service sector (i.e. Bitcoin). This paper aims to investigate the potential of applying blockchain technology in the construction sector. Three types of blockchain-enabled applications are proposed to improve the current processes of contract management, supply chain management, and equipment leasing, respectively. Challenges of blockchain implementation are also discussed in this paper.",

However, trust and privacy are still open issues due to the unique characteristics of vehicles. It is crucial for VANETs to prevent internal vehicles from broadcasting forged messages while simultaneously protecting the privacy of each vehicle against tracking attacks. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based anonymous reputation system (BARS) to break the linkability between real identities and public keys to preserve privacy. The certificate and revocation transparency is implemented efficiently using two blockchains. We design a trust model to improve the trustworthiness of messages relying on the reputation of the sender based on both direct historical interactions and indirect opinions about the sender. Experiments are conducted to evaluate BARS in terms of security and performance and the results show that BARS is able to establish distributed trust management, while protecting the privacy of vehicles.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain technology has gained substantial attention in recent years with increased interest in several diverse fields, including the healthcare industry. Blockchain offers a secure, distributed database that can operate without a central authority or administrator. Blockchain uses a distributed, peer-to-peer network to make a continuous, growing list of ordered records called blocks to form a digital ledger. Each transaction, represented in a cryptographically signed block, is then automatically validated by the network itself. Blockchain has also garnered interest as a platform to improve the authenticity and transparency of healthcare data through many use cases, from maintaining permissions in electronic health records (EHR) to streamlining claims processing. In this article, we describe the basics of blockchain and illustrate current and future applications of this technology within the healthcare industry.\n\nBitcoin, a cryptocurrency and payment system first introduced in 2008, is one of the most well-known implementations of blockchain.1 The transfer of digital assets, such as bitcoin, within a blockchain is initiated when a seller or payer submits a transaction (Figure [A]).2 These transactions are broadcasted to every peer connected to the blockchain network where clients, called miners, use a cryptographic algorithm to validate the transaction. This validation solves 2 key problems that previously existed with digital currency exchange: ensuring that the digital asset exists and that it has not already been spent. A transaction is said to be valid if a miner deems it is well formed (the input and output contain only the fields that are defined in the protocol), and the outputs it attempts to transfer exist. Miners are not certified and can be anyone who volunteers to invest their resources. The incentive for miners comes in the form of the bitcoin, which are generated and rewarded to the miners for every block of transactions validated. \u2026",

            "abstract": "The paper focuses on various legal-related aspects of the application of blockchain technologies in the copyright sphere. Specifically, it outlines the existing challenges for distribution of copyrighted works in the digital environment, how they can be solved with blockchain, and what associated issues need to be addressed in this regard. It is argued that blockchain can introduce long\u2013awaited transparency in matters of copyright ownership chain; substantially mitigate risks of online piracy by enabling control over digital copy and creating a civilized market for \u201cused\u201d digital content. It also allows to combine the simplicity of application of creative commons/open source type of licenses with revenue streams, and thus facilitate fair compensation of authors by means of cryptocurrency payments and Smart contracts. However, these benefits do not come without a price: many new issues will need to be resolved to enable the potential of blockchain technologies. Among them are: where to store copyrighted content (on blockchain or \u201coff-chain\u201d) and the associated need to adjust the legal status of online intermediaries; how to find a right balance between immutable nature of blockchain records and the necessity to adjust them due to the very nature of copyright law, which assigns ownership based on a set of informal facts, not visible to the public. Blockchain as a kind of time stamping service cannot itself ensure the trustworthiness of facts, which originate \u201coff-chain\u201d. Much work needs to be done on the legal side: special provisions aimed at facilitating user\u2019s trust in blockchain records and their good faith usage of copyrighted works based on them need to be introduced and transactions with cryptocurrencies have to be legalized as well as the status of Smart contracts and their legal consequences. Finally, the economics of blockchain copyright management systems need to be carefully considered in order to ensure that they will have necessary network effects. If those issues are resolved in a satisfactory way, blockchain has the potential to rewrite how the copyright industry functions and digital content is distributed",

The proposed system allows the consumer to reconstruct the product history up to the origin in order to verify product health and quality by simple QR code scan. The blockchain chosen for this purpose is Hyperledger Sawtooth, issued with writing permissions and rules to guarantee access only to members recognized as legitimate participants in the process. The whole system has been realized according to an agile methodology (ABCDE), recently devised for designing a general blockchain system with software engineering practices by mean of User Stories and UML diagrams, in order to obtain a higher software quality. All of the involved operators are able to identify any participants along the entire supply chain, increasing the degree of trust between organizations and individuals, with autonomous management of temporal sequence of activities.",

            "abstract": "A key aspect of Federated Learning (FL) is the requirement of a centralized aggregator to maintain and update the global model. However, in many cases orchestrating a centralized aggregator might be infeasible due to numerous operational constraints. In this paper, we introduce BAFFLE, an aggregator free, blockchain driven, FL environment that is inherently decentralized. BAFFLE leverages Smart Contracts (SC) to coordinate the round delineation, model aggregation and update tasks in FL. BAFFLE boosts computational performance by decomposing the global parameter space into distinct chunks followed by a score and bid strategy. In order to characterize the performance of BAFFLE, we conduct experiments on a private Ethereum network and use the centralized and aggregator driven methods as our benchmark. We show that BAFFLE significantly reduces the gas costs for FL on the blockchain as compared to a direct adaptation of the aggregator based method. Our results also show that BAFFLE achieves high scalability and computational efficiency while delivering similar accuracy as the benchmark methods.",

Some current researches have shown that applying blockchain can help ensure food safety. However, they tend to study the traceability of food but not its supervision. This paper provides a blockchain-based credit evaluation system to strengthen the effectiveness of supervision and management in the food supply chain. The system gathers credit evaluation text from traders by smart contracts on the blockchain. Then the gathered text is analyzed directly by a deep learning network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Finally traders\u2019 credit results are used as a reference for the supervision and management of regulators. By applying blockchain, traders can be held accountable for their actions in the process of transaction and credit evaluation. Regulators can gather more reliable, authentic and sufficient information about traders. The results of experiments show that adopting LSTM results in better performance than traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Navie Bayes (NB) to analyze the credit evaluation text. The system provides a friendly interface for the convenience of users.",

            "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is facing significant scalability and security challenges. On one hand, IoT devices are \u201cweak\u201d and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively \u201cvulnerable\u201d facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named \u201cEdgeChain\u201d based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or \u201ccoin\u201d system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device\u2019 account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on predefined rules on priority, application types, and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a nondeniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range.",

In a move towards grid resilience, blockchain commoditizes trust and enables automated smart contracts to support auditable multiparty transactions based on predefined rules between distributed energy providers and customers. Blockchain based smart contracts also help remove the need to interact with third-parties, facilitating the adoption and monetization of distributed energy transactions and exchanges, both energy flows as well as financial transactions. This may help reduce transactive energy costs and increase the security and sustainability of distributed energy resource (DER) integration, helping to remove barriers to a more decentralized and resilient power grid. This paper explores the application of blockchain and smart contracts to improve smart grid cyber resiliency and secure transactive energy applications.",

In this paper, we propose the design of a blockchain connected gateway which adaptively and securely maintains user privacy preferences for IoT devices in the blockchain network. Individual privacy leakage can be prevented because the gateway effectively protects users\u2019 sensitive data from being accessed without their consent. A robust digital signature mechanism is proposed for the purposes of authentication and secure management of privacy preferences.

In the past decade, the blockchain technology has evolved and became viable for various applications beyond the domain of finance. However, due to the complexity of blockchain technology, it is usually difficult and costly for most developers or teams to build, maintain and monitor a blockchain network that supports their applications. Most common developers or teams are unable to ensure the reliability and security of the blockchain system, which to a certain extent affects the quality of their applications. In this paper, we develop a BaaS platform called NutBaaS, which provides blockchain service over cloud computing environments, such as network deployment and system monitoring, smart contracts analysis and testing. Based on these services, developers can focus on the business code to explore how to apply blockchain technology more appropriately to their business scenarios, without bothering to maintain and monitor the system.",

Alas, Bitcoins privacy promise has proven illusory, and despite growing interest in privacy-centric blockchains, most blockchain users remain susceptible to privacy attacks that exploit network-layer information and access patterns that leak as users interact with blockchains. Understanding if and how blockchain-based applications can provide strong privacy guarantees is a matter of increasing urgency. Many researchers advocate using anonymous communications networks, such as Tor, to ensure access privacy. We challenge this approach, showing the need for mechanisms through which non-anonymous users can (i) publish transactions that cannot be linked to their network addresses or to their other transactions, and (ii) fetch details of specific transactions without revealing which transactions they seek. We hope this article inspires blockchain researchers to think beyond Tor and tackle these important access privacy problems head-on.",

Smart construction relies on BIM for manipulating information flow, data flow, and management flow. Currently, BIM model has been explored mainly for information construction and utilization, but rare works pay efforts to information security, e.g., critical model audit and sensitive model exposure. Moreover, few BIM systems are proposed to chase after upcoming computing paradigms, such as mobile cloud computing, big data, blockchain, and Internet of Things. In this paper, we make the first attempt to propose a novel BIM system model called bcBIM to tackle information security in mobile cloud architectures. More specifically, bcBIM is proposed to facilitate BIM data audit for historical modifications by blockchain in mobile cloud with big data sharing. The proposed bcBIM model can guide the architecture design for further BIM information management system, especially for integrating BIM cloud as a service for further big data sharing. We propose a method of BIM data organization based on blockchains and discuss it based on private and public blockchain. It guarantees to trace, authenticate, and prevent tampering with BIM historical data. At the same time, it can generate a unified format to support future open sharing, data audit, and data provenance.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, blockchain technology has attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. The popularity of blockchains was originated from the concept of crypto-currencies to serve as a decentralized and tamper-proof transaction data ledger. Nowadays, blockchains as the key framework in the decentralized public data-ledger have been applied to a wide range of scenarios far beyond crypto-currencies, such as the Internet of Things, healthcare, and insurance. This survey aims to fill the gap between a large number of studies on blockchain networks, where game theory emerges as an analytical tool, and the lack of a comprehensive survey on the game theoretical approaches applied in blockchain-related issues. In this survey, we review the game models proposed to address common issues in the blockchain network. The focus is placed on security issues, e.g., selfish mining, majority attack and denial of service attack, issues regarding mining management, e.g., computational power allocation, reward allocation, and pool selection, as well as issues regarding blockchain economic and energy trading. Additionally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these selected game theoretical models and solutions. Finally, we highlight important challenges and future research directions of applying game theoretical approaches to incentive mechanism design and the combination of blockchain with other technologies.",

At the same time, implementation changes to the consensuscritical parts of Bitcoin must necessarily be handled very conservatively. As a result, Bitcoin has greater difficulty than other Internet protocols in adapting to new demands and accommodating new innovation. We propose a new technology, pegged sidechains, which enables bitcoins and other ledger assets to be transferred between multiple blockchains. This gives users access to new and innovative cryptocurrency systems using the assets they already own. By reusing Bitcoin\u2019s currency, these systems can more easily interoperate with each other and with Bitcoin, avoiding the liquidity shortages and market fluctuations associated with new currencies. Since sidechains are separate systems, technical and economic innovation is not hindered. Despite bidirectional transferability between Bitcoin and pegged sidechains, they are isolated: in the case of a cryptographic break (or malicious design) in a sidechain, the damage is entirely confined to the sidechain itself. This paper lays out pegged sidechains, their implementation requirements, and the work needed to fully benefit from the future of interconnected blockchains.",

They are expected to have an impact on both business and society in the next few decades. This paper aims to provide general insights into blockchain technology and the extent to which it might transform the accounting system.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nAnalysing the previous literature, the paper provides a general overview of this phenomenon, identifying pending technical as well as non-technical issues that will have to be addressed for the full potential of blockchain technology to be embraced. The paper also proposes ways in which the information quality dimension might be improved.\n\n\nFindings\nThe paper identifies the pending challenges for blockchain, such as scalability, flexibility, a suitable architecture and cybersecurity. Additionally, to integrate blockchain technology fully into a real accounting ecosystem, a consensus between regulators, auditors and other parties is needed.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nA general overview of this new phenomenon, as well as a summary of how the quality of accounting information might be improved, is provided. Given that it features elements such as decentralization and transparency, blockchain certainly has the potential to improve information and accounting quality.\n",

It provides benefits to the society with improved precision and accuracy in diagnosis procedures. However, the existing telesurgery system has the security, privacy, and interoperability issues, which limits its applicability in healthcare centers across the world in future. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose, a framework named as HaBiTs (blockchain-based secure and flawless inter-operable telesurgery), where security can be achieved with immutability and interoperability by Smart Contracts (SCs). SC is a piece of code written in solidity or other blockchain specific languages to establish the trust between all the parties connected through blockchain and also eliminate the need of an intermediary for data sharing. Finally, we highlight some issues of the traditional telesurgery system and how they are mitigated with usage of the proposed HaBiTs framework.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain's evolution during the past decade is astonishing: from bitcoin to over 2.000 altcoins, and from decentralised electronic payments to transactions programmable by smart contracts and complex tokens governed by decentralised organisations. While the new generation of blockchain applications is still evolving, blockchain's technical characteristics are also advancing. Yet, immutability, a hitherto indisputable and highly advertised property according to which blockchain data cannot be edited nor deleted, remains the cornerstone of blockchain's security. Nevertheless, blockchain's immutability is being called into question lately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR's \u201cRight to be Forgotten (RtbF)\u201d provision. As the RtbF obliges blockchain data to be editable in order restricted content redactions, modifications or deletions to be applied when requested, blockchains compliance with the regulation is indeed challenging, if not impracticable. Towards resolving this contradiction, various methods and techniques for mutable blockchains have been proposed to satisfy regulatory erasing requirements while preserving blockchains\u2019 security. To this end, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research approaches, technical workarounds and advanced cryptographic techniques that have been put forward to resolve this conflict and to discuss their potentials, constraints and limitations when applied in the wild to either permissioned or permissionless blockchains.",

We highlight several similarities between features provided by blockchain platforms and a replicated relational database, although they are conceptually different, primarily in their trust model. Motivated by this, we leverage the rich features, decades of research and optimization, and available tooling in relational databases to build a blockchain relational database. We consider a permissioned blockchain model of known, but mutually distrustful organizations each operating their own database instance that are replicas of one another. The replicas execute transactions independently and engage in decentralized consensus to determine the commit order for transactions. We design two approaches, the first where the commit order for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second where transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order while the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent and respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of SSI based on block height for the latter approach. We implement our system on PostgreSQL and present detailed performance experiments analyzing both approaches.\n",

Although many recent papers study the use-cases of blockchain in different industrial areas, such as finance, health care, legal relations, IoT, information security, and consensus building systems, only few studies scrutinize the cryptographic concepts used in blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) that gives a complete picture of the existing cryptographic concepts which have been deployed or have the potential to be deployed in blockchain. In this paper, we thoroughly review and systematize all cryptographic concepts which are already used in blockchain. Additionally, we give a list of cryptographic concepts which have not yet been applied but have big potentials to improve the current blockchain solutions. We also include possible instantiations of these cryptographic concepts in the blockchain domain. Last but not least, we explicitly postulate 21 challenging problems that cryptographers interested in blockchain can work on.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain technology developed as a technical platform for electronic money. It is now considered a next generation information technology tool for sustainable growth in supply chain (SC) management. However, its study is relatively rare in the literature on SC collaboration and sustainability management research, despite its advantages in sustaining connectivity and reliability among SC partners. This study investigates how the use of blockchain in SC activities can influence (increase or decrease) SC partnership efficiency and growth, thereby affecting SC performance outcomes. Specifically, this study empirically validates a measurement and structural equation model with 306 SC experts from various industries. The findings show that the blockchain technology characteristics (information transparency, information immutability, and smart contracts) have significant positive effects on partnership growth and marginal effects on partnership efficiency. Though partnership growth has a positive effect on firm performance, partnership efficiency shows a negative effect.",

            "abstract": "Power grid resilience, reliability, and sustainability can be improved significantly by decomposing the large grids into networked microgrids (NMGs). However, the optimal energy management problem and preserving the security in NMGs are more complicated and challenging. This paper aims to propose a secured stochastic energy management framework for NMGs based on the modified blockchain approach, utilizing the directed acyclic graph (DAG). Using the decentralized and transparent blockchain technology will help to have higher security and lower risks within the network, thus eliminating the financial fraud and cutting down the total operational cost. In order to address the issues arising in the traditional blockchain models, mainly due to the storage and high complexities of hash address calculations, this paper proposes a new modified blockchain technology based on the DAG method. Also, a novel data restoration technique is developed to provide a way to restore the data with appropriate accuracy. The unscented transform (UT) approach is employed to model the uncertainties of forecast error in hourly load demand, solar power output, and wind turbines power output. Finally, the proposed model is tested on an NMG system with four MGs, including two residential MGs (as the noncrucial loads), a commercial MG (as the intermediate level loads), and a hospital MG (as the crucial loads).",

Blockchain with its decentralized, transparent and secure nature has emerged as a disruptive technology for the next generation of numerous industrial applications. One of them is Cloud of Things enabled by the combination of cloud computing and Internet of Things. In this context, blockchain provides innovative solutions to address challenges in Cloud of Things in terms of decentralization, data privacy and network security, while Cloud of Things offer elasticity and scalability functionalities to improve the efficiency of blockchain operations. Therefore, a novel paradigm of blockchain and Cloud of Things integration, called BCoT, has been widely regarded as a promising enabler for a wide range of application scenarios. In this article, we present a state-of-the-art review on the BCoT integration to provide general readers with an overview of the BCoT in various aspects, including background knowledge, motivation, and integrated architecture. Particularly, we also provide an in-depth survey of BCoT applications in different use-case domains such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation and smart industry. Then, we review the recent BCoT developments with the emerging blockchain and cloud platforms, services, and research projects. Finally, some important research challenges and future directions are highlighted to spur further research in this promising area.",

There is limited understanding of the use and benefits of Blockchain on supply chains, and less so at processes level. To date, there is no research on the effects of Blockchain in the customer order management process.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA twofold method is followed. First, a Blockchain is programmed and implemented in a large international firm. Second, a series of simulations are built based on three scenarios: current with no-Blockchain, 1-year and 5-year Blockchain use.\n\n\nFindings\nBlockchain improves the efficiency of the process: it reduces the number of operations, reduces the average time of orders in the system, reduces workload, shows traceability of orders and improves visibility to various supply chain participants.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe research is based on a single in-depth case that has the scope to be tested in other contexts in future.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThis is the first study that demonstrates with real data from an industrial firm the effects of Blockchain on the efficiency gains, reduction on the number of operations and human-processing savings. A detailed description of the Blockchain implementation is provided. Furthermore, this research shows a list of the resources and capabilities needed for building and maintaining a Blockchain in the context of supply chains.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis is the first study that demonstrates with real data from an industrial firm the effects of Blockchain on the efficiency gains, the reduction in the number of operations and human-processing savings. A detailed description of the Blockchain implementation is provided.

            "abstract": "Purpose This article evaluates the application of blockchain technology to improve organic or fair-trade food traceability from \u201cFarm to Fork\u201d in light of European regulations. This study aims to shed light on the challenges in the organic food chain to overcome, the drivers for blockchain technology, and the challenges in current projects. Design/Methodology/Approach For this research, a case study approach was taken in which four blockchain projects were evaluated on their success. Findings Organic food supply chain companies aiming to improve food traceability with blockchain face two key decisions, depending on the characteristics of the organic value chain, regarding (1) optimizing chain partner collaboration and (2) the selection of which data to capture in the blockchain. Other challenges were data confidentiality, validation of data inputs, and interoperability. Easy verification of certification data, accountability, improved risk management, insight into trade transactions, simplified data collection and exchange, and improved communication account for the benefits. Regardless of what drives companies toward whole-chain traceability, for example, customer satisfaction, it does not necessarily require blockchain technology. Blockchain does enable faster food traceability, which is expected to be more applicable to a complex food supply chain. Research limitations/Implications The limitations of this study are represented mainly by the scarcity of organic blockchain projects aiming to minimize pesticide inputs and limited availability of information of commercial projects. Practical Implications This study shows that blockchain is currently successfully being implemented on a small scale to create whole-chain traceability of organic and fair-trade food. Originality/Value This research addresses the intersection of food supply chain and organic food quality and certification. The focus on origin information and importance of organic data elements may underpin other research on European Union regulations in relation to food traceability, adding value to the body of knowledge on the current status of blockchain technology.",

Thus, properly understanding what and how the data are stored and manipulated ultimately determines the degree of utility, performance, and cost of a blockchain-based application. While blockchains enhance the quality of the data by providing a transparent, immutable, and consistent data store, the technology also brings new challenges from a data management perspective. In this paper, we analyse blockchains from the viewpoint of a developer to highlight important concepts and considerations when incorporating a blockchain into a larger software system as a data store. The work aims to increase the level of understanding of blockchain technology as a data store and to promote a methodical approach in applying it to large software systems. First, we identify the common architectural layers of a typical software system with data stores and conceptualise each layer in blockchain terms. Second, we examine the placement and flow of data in blockchain-based applications. Third, we explore data administration aspects for blockchains, especially as a distributed data store. Fourth, we discuss the analytics of blockchain data and trustable data analytics enabled by blockchain. Lastly, we examine the data governance issues in blockchains in terms of privacy and quality assurance.",

Various systems that adopts the blockchain in managing medical records have been proposed. However, there is a need for more work to better characterize, understand and evaluate the employment of blockchain technology in the healthcare industry. In this paper, a design of blockchain based system, namely MedChain, for managing medical records is proposed. MedChain is designed to improve the current systems as it provides interoperable, secure, and effective access for medical records by patients, health care providers, and other third parties, while keeping the patients\u2019 privacy. MedChain employs timed-based smart contracts for governing transactions and controlling accesses to electronic medical records. It adopts advanced encryption techniques for providing further security. This work proposes a new incentive mechanism that leverages the degree of health providers regarding their efforts on maintaining medical records and creating new blocks. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the MedChain performance, and results indicate the efficiency of our proposal in handling a large dataset at low latency.",

The global economy, politics and society as a whole have a greater impact. As an effective means of product quality and safety management and control, many countries and regions have been researched, developed and operated of the traceability system. On the one hand, these technologies have not been able to achieve more accurate traceability, these results cannot be directly used in Chinese market. Therefore, the article introduces the concept of Blockchain technology, putting forward the application of Blockchain technology in information security of the food supply chain and comparing it with the traditional supply chain system.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting things to the Internet in a peer-to-peer paradigm for data collecting and data sharing in our daily life. A blockchain is an immutable append-only ledger maintained by a peer-to-peer network, where the whole network needs to reach a consensus on the transactional data stored on the ledger. With the decentralization nature, the design of IoT and blockchain aligns with each other well. Blockchain has been integrated with the IoT to solve the existing IoT problems. Our research focuses on analyzing the solutions proposed in academia and the methodologies used to integrate blockchain with the IoT. Through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on peer-reviewed, published articles on blockchain-based solutions for IoT, we gather the knowledge on current technical approaches implemented to integrate blockchain into the IoT. Majority of the research in this space is either at a conceptual level or at a very early stage. However, we only found 35 published papers with the real implementation of blockchain in the IoT platforms. We elicit the challenges of the IoT that were being addressed, and the detailed design of the blockchain-based solutions from two perspectives, namely data management and thing management. The evaluation methods and metrics used by those works are also being recorded and analyzed. In addition to the analysis of the literature, we provide our insights on improving the existing solutions and research methodology based on our expertise and experience on the blockchain.",
