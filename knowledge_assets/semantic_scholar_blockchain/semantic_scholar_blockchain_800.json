            "abstract": "The concept of a decentralized ledger usually implies that each node of a blockchain network stores the entire blockchain. However, in the case of popular blockchains, which each weigh several hundreds of GB, the large amount of data to be stored can incite new or low-capacity nodes to run lightweight clients. Such nodes do not participate to the global storage effort and can result in a centralization of the blockchain by very few nodes, which is contrary to the basic concepts of a blockchain. To avoid this problem, we propose new low storage nodes that store a reduced amount of data generated from the blockchain by using erasure codes. The properties of this technique ensure that any block of the chain can be easily rebuilt from a small number of such nodes. This system should encourage low storage nodes to contribute to the storage of the blockchain and to maintain decentralization despite of a globally increasing size of the blockchain. This system paves the way to new types of blockchains which would only be managed by low capacity nodes.",

            "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in using online technologies to design protocols for secure electronic voting. The main challenges include vote privacy and anonymity, ballot irrevocability and transparency throughout the vote counting process. The introduction of the blockchain as a basis for cryptocurrency protocols, provides for the exploitation of the immutability and transparency properties of these distributed ledgers. In this paper, we discuss possible uses of the blockchain technology to implement a secure and fair voting system. In particular, we introduce a secret share-based voting system on the blockchain, the so-called SHARVOT protocol. Our solution uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to enable on-chain, i.e. within the transactions script, votes submission and winning candidate determination. The protocol is also using a shuffling technique, Circle Shuffle, to de-link voters from their submissions.",

We focused the attention on monitoring the environment quality in urban area by means of a distributed network of small mobile sensors that are devices on the Internet of Things (IoT). Sensors produce digital measurements, useful for investigating and studying the life quality in every part of the city. In our vision, environmental data must be available by everyone and shared with citizens, but it must be unmodifiable. We propose to solve the problem of the sensors data storage and management using a disruptive technology called blockchain. The blockchain responds to the demand of availability and unchangeability and, thanks to the potentiality of smart contracts, makes us able to manage sensor information and implement a control logic. In order to develop the software based on blockchain we chose to apply the SCRUM methodology because of its capabilities of being a flexible, adaptive and iterative methodology.",

Blockchain became popular in various industries due to its decentralized trust ecosystem. When integrating blockchain with big data, one encounters many challenges. Current public blockchain does not support high transaction throughput; it does not scale in terms of big data storage and management; it does not provide keyword-based search and retrieval; and so on. As a result, it is hard to incorporate existing blockchain systems for big data applications. In this research, we propose a new blockchain storage \"Mystiko\" that is built over the Apache Cassandra distributed database to incorporate big data. Mystiko supports high transaction throughput, high scalability, high availability and full text search features. With Mystiko, we make big data more secure, structured and meaningful, and allows further data analytics on big data to be more easily performed.",

Since the introduction of Bitcoin cryptocurrency, which was the rst implementation of the Blockchain technology in 2008, the interest in Blockchain technology has been constantly increasing. Blockchain is not applicable only in nancial transaction systems but it is transforming our society from the way we use our cars, smartphones, healthcare, vote, and even personal identi cation. As such when we discuss the Blockchain implementation we are really discussing three di erent things: Blockchain ledger, Blockchain network and clients. Modern Blockchain implementations have to adapt to some technical challenges and limitations required for Blockchain technology. For example, security, privacy, throughput, size and bandwidth, performance, usability, data integrity and scalability are just some of the attributes required for high quality Blockchain implementation. In this paper, we aim to analyze the current quality issues in the Blockchain implementation and to identify the Blockchain quality attributes. A literature review is conducted to investigate the current quality requirements for Blockchain implementation. Findings show that the research on quality requirements for Blockchain implementation is still in its early stage. The conclusions of this study could be used for further analysis of the quality attributes required for the Blockchain implementations and improvement of the quality of the Blockchain systems.",

Unfortunately, new participants of the blockchain network are required to download the whole blockchain to gain an overview about the state of the system and to validate incoming transactions. Approaches like IOTA, SegWit or the Lightning Network try to solve the scalability issues of blockchain applications. Unfortunately, they focus on strategies slowing down the blockchain's growth instead of reducing the problems arising from a growing chain or introduce new concepts to oust the linear blockchain altogether. The approach proposed in this paper is based on the idea of Ethereum to keep the state of the system explicitly in the current block but further pursues this by including the relevant part of the current system state in new transactions as well. This enables other participants to validate incoming transactions without having to download the whole blockchain initially. Following this idea use cases can be supported that require scalable blockchain technology but not necessarily an indefinite and complete transaction history.",

Security features inherent in blockchain make it resistant to attack, but they do not make it immune, and blockchain security risks do exists. This paper details the associated risks and concerns of the blockchain. We explore relevant standards and regulations related to blockchain and survey and analyze 38 blockchain incidents to determine the root cause to provide a view of the most frequent vulnerabilities exploited. The paper reviews six of these 38 incidents in greater detail. The selection is made by choosing incidents with the most frequent root cause. In the review of the incidents, the paper details what happened and why and aims to address what could have been done to mitigate the attack. The paper concludes with a recommendation on a framework to reduce cyber security risks when using blockchain technologies.",

            "abstract": "The real estate world finds itself at a tipping point of a transition: a dramatic and irreversible shift in (real estate) systems in society. This paper is a State of the art of Disruption, Blockchain and Real Estate in the Netherlands and international.,The following questions were asked to all those involved: What do you think is the essence of Blockchain for real estate? What is the most current situation with respect to Blockchain and real estate from your perspective? Which publications are important from your perspective? What do you expect with respect to the impact of Blockchain on real estate for (social) real estate? What are questions for the future for real estate and Blockchain? In addition, interviews, exploratory conversations and correspondence took place, and the content was peer reviewed.,Changes in value concepts affect the valuation of real estate and the thinking about it. The orientation of changing users and owners of real estate affects innovativeness, values and flexibility in managing that property. Orientation on disruption must be seen as proof that the real estate world is able to actually innovate the accumulated assets and consolidate this. The financial and real estate markets are markets that exaggerate through irrational behaviour. Fear of \u201ceat or be eaten\u201d determines people\u2019s behaviour. Financial and thus real estate markets are always unstable and must always be regulated by people and organizations.,The question that remains is whether it is important to look at disruptive innovations in existing markets or newcomers in the real estate market and Blockchain. The question is whether Blockchain is only a technological disruption, or a real game changer, and whether the entire value chain of the real estate market will embrace it. No two disruptions are the same. Trust in Blockchain is a prerequisite for guiding the predictable form of that disruption where start-up companies use new technology to offer cheaper and inferior alternatives to real estate in the market. You could also talk about anti-fragile value: \u201cSome things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile\u201d (Taleb, 2012), in other words: attention to disruption and Blockchain creates a viable real estate economy.,The true meaning of the Blockchain technology for real estate still needs to be investigated. The author is still curious to understand and clarify the value of Blockchain for real estate processes. Doubt continues to exist and is therefore a feeding ground for further research, because we do not know what we have not seen.,Looking at the impact of Blockchain on real estate, a number of conclusions can be drawn. First of all, the relationship between Blockchain and real estate has not yet been proven in practice. It is expected to develop further in the form of registering transaction processes and the DNA passport of a real estate object. Secondly, completeness and transparency are the basic ingredients for trust in the system. Third, real estate wants to remain viable. For this reason, taking the offense is necessary for real estate and management to connect with social demand. Behaviour also leads to new earnings models of the social and economic spin-off of disruptive real estate. If the Dutch real estate sector embraces Blockchain and is able to realize innovations, there are opportunities for real estate entrepreneurs to exploit the disruptive character to provide those new services.,The way in which disruption, Blockchain and real estate will develop in the coming years are not the only obvious characteristics of a particular era but also its social impact and user behaviour. This also applies to how this real estate transition can best be tracked, guided and utilized in society at the international, national and regional level. Disruptive organizations clearly respond to the viability of the (built) environment and therefore determine competitive strength. This affects the current and future valuation of real estate.",

We identify the five key elements of a blockchain, show the embodiments of these elements, and examine how these elements come together to yield important properties in selected systems. To facilitate comparing the many variations of blockchains, we also describe the four crucial roles of common blockchain participants. Our historical exploration highlights the 1979 work of David Chaum, whose vault system embodies many of the elements of blockchains.",

It is difficult to find out which attributes of blockchains are important for a given use case (e.g. immutable, trustless, anonymous) and to decide which elements of an architecture should employ blockchain technologies. Current approaches generally only give a hint on whether blockchain technology makes sense for a given use case or not. This paper proposes a more fine-grained approach to decide which elements of an application architecture could benefit from the use of blockchain technology. We illustrate the first outline of our approach which identifies participants, their trust relations and interactions to derive a hybrid architecture (i.e. an architecture embedding blockchain technology in existing software systems or creating new systems using blockchain only in certain parts).",

Finally, a discussion of its long\u2010term implications will follow through a more philosophical and conceptual dialogue. Throughout the paper, criticisms will be raised to address concerns regarding blockchain's widespread use.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology for sharing transactional data and computation without using a central trusted third party. It is an architectural choice to use a blockchain instead of traditional databases or protocols, and this creates trade-offs between non-functional requirements such as performance, cost, and security. However, little is known about predicting the behaviour of blockchain-based systems. This paper shows the feasibility of using architectural performance modelling and simulation tools to predict the latency of blockchain-based systems. We use established tools and techniques, but explore new blockchain-specific issues such as the configuration of the number of confirmation blocks and inter-block times. We report on a lab-based experimental study using an incident management system, showing predictions of median system level response time with a relative error mostly under 10%. We discuss how the approach can be used to support architectural decision-making, during the design of blockchain-based systems.",

This study aims to examine how blockchains are applied to the financial sector and how to respond to the Korean conditions. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThis paper investigates the movements of the financial sector and related services using the blockchain in the current market. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nFirst, as a result of examining domestic and foreign cases, it can be seen that the areas where blockchains are most actively applied in the financial sector are expanding into settlement, remittance, securities and smart contracts. Also, in Korea, many of the authentication procedures based on the equipment possessed by the consumers are used so that introduction of the blockchain in the authentication part is prominent. Second, the move to introduce a closed (private) distributed ledger that does not go through the central bank is accelerating in payments between banks. Third, domestic financial institutions also need joint action by financial institutions through a blockchain consortium to apply blockchain technology to the financial sector. Fourth, consumer needs and technological developments are changing. At the same time, as the opportunity to infringe on the information held by individuals has expanded, the need for blockchain technology is strongly emerging because of the efforts of the organizations to defend it. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThis paper contributes to understanding the changes in the financial sector using the blockchain.",

Majorly, blockchain's automated data verification capabilities, in particular, are able to resolve many of the trust issues regarding pulling data from disparate sources. Applications of the technology in healthcare shows promise for solving issues such as its used in EHR distribution of data and nationwide interoperability. The use of blockchain in healthcare is expected to reinvent the ecosystem in limitless ways to benefit the patient and advancements in treatments, outcomes, security and costs. In effect, blockchain technology has the potential to transform healthcare delivery, placing patient at the center of the healthcare ecosystems and the capability to increase the security, privacy, and interoperability of healthcare data. It\u2019s envisaged that this technology is expected to provide a new model for health information exchanges (HIE) by making electronic medical records more efficient, disintermediated, and secure. One of blockchain technology\u2019s core offerings that make it a no-brainer for supply chains across industries is its immutable, time-stamped, tamper-proof ledger, accessible by its all or pre-approved participants. In this review paper we\u2019re to step through how blockchain aid in the providing efficiency, security and privacy to management of patient care.",

This book has had an enormous impact on the evolution of blockchain in the world. Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft Corporation In this revelatory book, Don and Alex Tapscott bring us a brilliantly researched, highly readable, and essential book about the technology driving the future of the economy. Blockchain is the ingeniously simple, revolutionary protocol that allows transactions to be simultaneously anonymous and secure by maintaining a tamperproof public ledger of value. Though its best known as the technology that drives bitcoin and other digital currencies, it also has the potential to go far beyond currency, to record virtually everything of value to humankind, from birth and death certificates to insurance claims, land titles, and even votes. As with major paradigm shifts that preceded it, blockchain technology will create winners and losers. This book shines a light on where it can lead us in the next decade and beyond.",

As consensus is impossible in the general case, it seems that these blockchain systems require messages are delivered fast and no participant mines faster than the crowd. To date, no experimental settings have however been proposed to demonstrate this hypothesis. In this paper, we identify conditions under which these blockchain systems fail to ensure consensus and present a reproducible execution on our Ethereum private chain. To this end, we introduce the Blockchain Anomaly, the impossibility for the blockchain to guarantee that a committed transaction is not abortable. This anomaly may translate into dramatic consequences for the user of proof-of-work blockchains. Named after the infamous Paxos anomaly, this anomaly makes dependent transactions, like \u201cBob sends money to Carole after he received money from Alice\u201d impossible and may lead to double spending. We also explain how the anomaly differs from a 51-percent attack and how one could avoid it by adapting the Ethereum implementation or by exploiting smart contracts.",

The blockchain allows the participants of a distributed system to agree on a common view of the system, to track changes in the system, in a reliable way. In the distributed systems community, agreement techniques have been known long before cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (where the term blockchain is borrowed) emerged. Various concepts and protocols exist, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This book introduces the basic techniques when building fault-tolerant distributed systems, in a scientific way. We will present different protocols and algorithms that allow for fault-tolerant operation, and we will discuss practical systems that implement these techniques.",

The purpose of this paper is to study the actual cases of Blockchain applied in Korea in 2017, so that a vision of business model innovation of financial institutions can be drawn. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe financial institutions in Korea are in the technology verification stage to introduce Blockchain technology. Since there is an insufficient amount of actual measurement data, case study method was adopted. The authors interviewed ICT officers of major banks in Korea. The purpose of the interview was to understand the relationship between Blockchain and business models of financial institutions, and the effects and challenges that Blockchain has on the business model of financial institutions. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nFrom the perspective of financial institutions, the emergence of Blockchain does not just have technical significance \u2013 emergence of highly efficient database system \u2013 but has the possibility that if the business model of existing financial intermediaries disappears or get reduced, the financial services relying on them can disappear altogether, or some of them can be replaced, and financial transaction patterns of consumers can be changed. As a case studies researched for this paper, it was discovered that the distributed characteristic of Blockchain cannot be applied when actually developing financial services.",

We propose an innovative new reputation system that is based on blockchain technologies which aims to solve many unanswered questions in today's current generation reputation systems. We then consider the limitations of such a system, before using simulations and analyses to demonstrate methods of overcoming these limitations. We conclude by suggesting areas for future studies, and summarizing our findings.",

            "abstract": "Social businesses are increasingly gaining relevance as alternatives to traditional businesses. Nonetheless, such organizations face specific problems. The emerging blockchain technology may represent an opportunity to solve several problems of social businesses and an alternative to established technologies. However, evidence about the potential of blockchain in social businesses is missing. We bridge this gap by designing, developing, and evaluating a blockchain-based crowdlending platform of a social business, following the design science research approach. The evaluation and comparison to a non-blockchain solution allows us to generate generalizable knowledge and derive implications for both research and practice. Our research shows that blockchain enables otherwise unsustainable social business models, mainly by replacing intermediaries and requires changes in software engineering practices. Further, our findings illustrate that blockchain raises challenges and uncertainties and opens promising avenues for further",

            "abstract": "Blockchain and Internet of things are the most promising and upcoming technologies. Blockchain is a distributed, peer to peer database forming a chain between multiple blocks of data. The internet of things works on a similar paradigm where multiple devices are connected to the internet forming a network of networks. Combined together they offer solutions for various problems, especially in the field of healthcare where quick reporting of data or results is of utmost importance. Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain. Overall this will surely benefit patients and doctors alike by creating a safe and transparent environment along with quick response to a patient's need.",

            "abstract": "The terminology around blockchain technology is notoriously confusing, with disputes over whether a blockchain is the same as a distributed ledger, or whether an appcoin is the same as a protocol token. In this article, I examine the difficulties the rapidly shifting, contested vocabulary poses for regulators seeking to understand, govern, and potentially use blockchain technology, and offer suggestions for how to fight through the haze of unclear language. \nIn Part I, I provide examples of the fluctuating, contested language in the blockchain technology space, and describe the forces at play in shaping the language. In Part II, I lay out the problems the language raises for regulators, including challenges in identifying the facts about the technology, distinguishing among the many variations of the technology, and communicating clearly about the technology, as well as increasing the chances of regulatory capture, inconsistent regulation across jurisdictions and subject domains, and \u201cperverse innovation.\u201d \nIn Part III, I closely analyze the use of the term \u201cimmutable\u201d in blockchain discourse, to illuminate the confusion a single term can cause for regulators (and the public at large). I argue that the widespread use of the term \u201cimmutable\u201d as a defining feature of blockchain technology is misleading, given that (i) real world events have demonstrated that the unchangeable nature of a blockchain record is always limited by the decisions of its human governors to change it, and (ii) the source of a blockchain record\u2019s \u201cimmutability\u201d is disputed, meaning that it is unclear whether any particular variation of the technology may be fairly described as creating an \u201cimmutable\u201d record. This is problematic as regulators have already begun to craft legislation describing the records created by blockchain technology as immutable, and are making decisions to use the technology in large part because of its \u201cimmutability.\u201d \nIn Part IV, I suggest ways regulators can become better educated about blockchain technology, as is essential for them to responsibly govern or use the technology. I also recommend that regulators take a highly critical approach that (i) seeks to separate hype from reality; (ii) is sensitive to how incentives may shape the way blockchain technology is portrayed by industry and those sponsored by industry, and how misleading terminology appears in publications of the highest prestige levels; (iii) includes diverse perspectives from proponents and critics of the technology, multiple disciplines, and from across the gender, race, geographic, and economic development spectrums; (iv) takes nothing, including descriptions of the technology itself, at face value, but deeply interrogates and scrutinizes the technology and its stated capabilities; and (v) asks regulators to think for themselves about the technology and its benefits rather than succumbing to herd behavior. \nI am hopeful that these recommendations, coupled with awareness that blockchain vocabulary is treacherous, can help regulators to discover the facts about blockchain technology and respond to them appropriately.",

Modern databases rely on transaction history written on redo logs to allow for data restore. However, if redo logs are (maliciously) forged, data can actually be lost or altered. Due its strong data integrity guarantees, blockchain technology can be employed to ensure log integrity, but its current performance limitations hinder actual exploitations.In previous work, we proposed a layered blockchain-based architecture for distributed (federated) database redo logs: a fast first layer blockchain, anchored to a secure second layer blockchain, based on proof-of-work to achieve strong integrity. Here, we present an implementation and an experimental evaluation of a prototype of that architecture, which employs a total consensus algorithm on the first layer blockchain. Finally, to improve availability and scalability, we refine our solution by investigating, respectively, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus and a Distributed Hash Table solution to shard the first layer blockchain ledger among available nodes.",

Blockchain can solve the problem of trust among multiple participants. Blockchain is a decentralized, trustless, tamper-proof and traceable distributed database managed by multiple participants. A blockchain also called distributed ledger, is essentially an append-only data structure maintained by a set of nodes which do not fully trust each other. Nodes in the blockchain keep replicas of the blocks, each containing an ordered set of transactions modifying the states. All nodes agree on the transactions and their order. Traditional databases assume a trusted environment. Blockchain\u2019s key property is that it assumes nodes behave in arbitrary manner. Being able to tolerate Byzantine failure by consensus protocol, blockchain establishes a reliable trust between both parties of the transaction, and implements trusted data sharing and peer-to-peer value exchange without third-party intermediaries. The blockchain\u2019s consensus protocol must tolerate Byzantine failures. This is not the case in traditional distributed systems, in which they use the Paxos or Raft consensus protocol.

Blockchain's ability to detect integrity violations are particularly key in providing assured data provenance in cloud platform. The practical adoption of blockchain will largely hinge on consensus protocols meeting performance and security guarantees. In this paper, we present the design issues for consensus protocols for blockchain based cloud provenance. We present the blockchain based data provenance framework for cloud. We find that there are performance and security challenges in adopting proof-of-work consensus protocol within this framework. We present unique design challenges and opportunities in developing proof-of-stake for data provenance in cloud platform.",

It uses a consensus mechanism, digital signature and hash chains to realize the reliable storage of ledgers, and provide services such as traceability, integrity and no-repudiation for transactions in ledgers in a decentralized way. These services make blockchain have great application potentiality in the fields of healthcare, Fintech, computational law and so on. Before wide spreading its applications, blockchain must solve problems such as efficiency and privacy. Among these problems the privacy is an important one. Because blocks on blockchain are open, when transactions in blocks involve privacy data, these data can be leaked. Thus, certain security mechanisms must be built to protect privacy data. The core of these mechanisms is the appropriate key management schemes. However, blockchain is a developing technology, and few studies have been done on key management schemes for it. Because healthcare is a big application scenario of blockchain, in this paper, according to the features of health blockchain, we use body sensor network to design a lightweight backup and efficient recovery scheme for keys of health blockchain. Analyses show that the scheme has high security and performance, and it can be used to protect privacy messages on health blockchain effectively and to promote the application of health blockchain.",

Specifically, blockchain provides a method to enforce the agreement between a user and the physical property owner without using any trusted party, e.g., if a user pays the agreed money, the blockchain guarantees that he/she has access to the property. While a blockchain based system has many desirable features, it may leak privacy information of involved parties due to its openness to the public. To mitigate the privacy concern, we propose a privacy respecting approach for blockchain-based sharing economy applications, which leverages a zero-knowledge scheme. We also analyze the security features and performance of the proposed approach to demonstrate its effectiveness in these applications.",

Since its advent in 2008, blockchain as a concept has been used in various ways. The largest impact or application is seen as a multitude of cryptocurrencies that have sprung up. However, with time, it has become clear that blockchain as a technology is likely to have an impact much wider than just the cryptocurrency domain and much deeper than simple distributed ledger storage. This detailed survey intends to bring together all the key developments so far in terms of putting blockchain to practice. While the most common adoption of blockchain is in finance and banking domain, there are experiments being conducted by many big players in various other domains. This paper will explore the various domains where blockchain has had an impact and where future implementations may be expected.",

We offer Ushare, a user centric blockchain supported social media network that enables users to control, trace and claim ownership of every piece of content they share. Harnessing peer-to-peer capabilities of the blockchain technology allows a truly decentralized, secure, anonymous and traceable content distribution network. Ushare consists of four key components: the blockchain, a hash table with encrypted content shared by a user, a Turing complete relationship system to control the the maximum number of shares performed by user's circle members and a local personal certificate authority that manages the user's circles and encrypts data to be shared before it is broadcasted to the network.",

While blockchain is best known for payments and digital currency, one of the blockchain\u2019s \u201ckiller apps\u201d will be blockchain-based smart contracts. Blockchain-based smart contracts can be used to automate and execute \u201cifthen\u201d contractual relationships by coding these relationships onto the blockchain in order to automatically trigger their secure execution. The potential use cases are limitless; blockchain-based smart contracts can be used for everything from automobile leases, to voting, to recording of land titles. A threshold question for the wide-scale use of blockchain-based smart contracts is whether such smart contracts are legally enforceable. This Article argues that existing laws, specifically the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (\u201cESIGN\u201d) and state laws modeled on the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act (\u201cUETA\u201d), render blockchain-based smart contracts enforceable and therefore immediately usable. With the enforceability of blockchain-based smart contracts established, this Article examines potential applications in the insurance and energy industries, in order to demonstrate the utility of such contracts. In the insurance industry, blockchain-based smart contracts can enable the automation of simple life insurance policies, thus reducing costs of administration, and provide a platform for new insurance products such as blockchain-based parametric insurance contracts. Within the energy industry, blockchain-based smart contracts can further enable the adoption of microgrids and technology such as smart meters, which can expand *Alan Cohn is Of Counsel at Steptoe & Johnson LLP and Adjunct Professor, Georgetown University Law Center; he is also an advisor to several blockchain technology companies.

Rather than viewing blockchain as a novel technology, we should think it as an innovation for managing digital society, which provides fundamental principles to support democratically distributed applications. Based on the design and application of the Energy Internet, this paper analyzes the core architecture of the initial blockchain technology, and combines the security of the public chain with the efficiency of the private chain, solving the poor efficiency problem of the initial blockchain by using the high efficiency of private chain. At the same time, it inherits the security and non-tampering of initial blockchain. This paper designs a new hybrid blockchain storaging mode that is Block Static Storage(BSS, internal structure is N+X hybrid blockchain, following can be referred to as N+X HBC),for purpose that improving the overall efficiency of the Internet running, achieving decentralized supervision, and provoding a credible, safe and efficient performance of the Energy Internet in the storage of its massive data, as well as a huge business system.",

The symposium offers philosophical scholarship on a new topic, blockchain technology, from a variety of perspectives. The philosophical themes discussed include mathematical models of reality, signification, and the sociopolitical institutions that structure human life and interaction. The symposium also investigates the metaphilosophical theme of how to create a philosophy of anything, specifically a new topic such as blockchain technology. Repeated themes are identified, in all areas of philosophical inquiry (ontology, epistemology, and axiology), and conceptual resources are elaborated to contribute to a philosophical understanding of blockchain technology. Thus, philosophy as a metaphilosophical approach is shown to be able to provide an understanding of the conceptual, theoretical, and foundational dimensions of novelty and emergence in the world, with a particular focus on blockchain technology.",

Currently, Blockchain operates like information isolated island, they cannot obtain external data or execute transactions on their own. Motivated by recent studies [1-3] on blockchain's multiChain framework, we investigate the cross-chain communication. We introduces blockchain router, which empowers blockchains to connect and communicate cross chains. By establishing an economic model, blockchain router enables different blockchains in the network communicate with each other same like Internet network. In the network of blockchain router, some blockchain plays the role of a router which, according to the communication protocol, analyzes and transmits communication requests, dynamically maintaining a topology structure of the blockchain network.",

            "abstract": "Recently, blockchains have been gathering a lot of interest. Many applications can benefit from the advantages of blockchains. Nevertheless, applications with more restricted privacy or participation requirements cannot rely on public blockchains. First, the whole blockchain can be downloaded at any time, thus making the data available to the public. Second, anyone can deploy a node, join the blockchain network and take part in the consensus building process. Private and consortium blockchains promise to combine the advantages of blockchains with stricter requirements on the participating entities. This is also the reason for the comparably small number of nodes that store and extend those blockchains. However, by targeting specific nodes, an attacker can influence how consensuses are reached and possibly even halt the blockchain operation. To provide additional security to the blockchain nodes, ChainGuard utilizes SDN functionalities to filter network traffic, thus implementing a firewall for blockchain applications. ChainGuard communicates with the blockchain nodes it guards to determine which origin of the traffic is legitimate. Packets from illegitimate sources are intercepted and thus cannot have an effect on the blockchain. As is shown with experiments, ChainGuard provides access control functionality and can effectively mitigate flooding attacks from several sources at once.",

            "abstract": "The mining and metals industry is a critical component of the global economy. However, many operational and commercial practices remain inefficient and antiquated, leading to critical data omissions, security vulnerabilities, and even corruption. Mining supply chain faces several challenges like traceability, transparency, interoperability between supplier platforms and so on. Traditional systems are inefficient and hence this paper explores the use of an emerging digital technology named blockchain. The blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that keeps a record of every transaction securely and reliably without the need of third parties that reduces the exposure of the data to hackers. Blockchain technology improves productivity by replacing the standard contract with smart contracts. This paper outlines several key applications of blockchain for the mining industry.",

Comparing blockchain to the current best practice technology in these fields reveals several barriers to successful commercial implementation: Blockchain technology involves costly redundancies and irreversibility, faces serious scaling problems and significant barriers to complying with regulations, and is a security liability unless secured with its own freely trading currency. A survey of the state of the blockchain industry shows that in eight years since blockchain technology was invented, it has had no commercial applications other than digital cash. The paper concludes that a blockchain is a peculiar engineering design whose only advantage is in removing third party intermediation to allow for the creation of digital cash, and is unlikely to offer economic advantages for any commercial problem other than the one it was specifically engineered to solve.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces a concept of autonomous blockchain based negotiation to select the most convenient electric vehicle charging station. The enabling blockchain technologies are well known fundament of cryptocurrencies, but offer many other possible applications areas, such as automated trusted machine-to-machine transactions, including auctions, bidding and payments. Compared to traditional centralized approaches, such a solution does not require any central entities and can be fully automated, including the payment for the energy. Based on e.g. the planned route, car battery status, real-time traffic information and drivers' preferences, a car could request charging bids from various charging stations along the route, by executing blockchain based smart contracts related to these charging stations. It would then select the most appropriate one based on offered prices, but other input parameters could be also taken into account, e.g. waiting times, estimated charging duration and alike. The smart contract execution could be extended to reservation and payment, too. In the paper we briefly present blockchain technologies, with the focus on Ethereum, and explain the role of smart contracts. We outline the architecture of a simple system for autonomous selection for electric vehicle charging station and provide a UML model to depict the activities of the actors involved in these operations and to clarify the role and the requirements of various blockchain related entities. The aim of our research paper is to outline a possible use-case for a blockchain prototype implementation. The implementation, which is not presented here, will serve for investigation of practical aspects of smart node development and operation, like transaction performance measurements, practical system requirement evaluations and comparison of reliability of various Ethereum clients. By our research we hope to support the investigation of novel applications and blending Internet of things with blockchain technologies, and in particular for elaboration of possible new use cases in the domain of electrical energy and mobility.",

The blockchain is a distributed, immutable digital record system that is shared among many independent parties and can be updated only by their consensus. If unbiased and incorruptible blockchain-based information systems become prevalent repositories of our records, trusting other humans with constructing and maintaining key records to define the resources at our disposal could become unnecessary. In principle, blockchain could provide a decentralized information infrastructure that no one fully controls, thereby no one has absolute power and no one can distort past or current records. The full potential let alone implications of blockchain is still unknown. The panel explores blockchain challenges and opportunities from the IS research perspective.",

Current literature supports the Libertarian viewpoint by focusing on the ability of Bitcoin to bypass central authority and provide anonymity; rarely is there an examination of blockchain technology's capacity for decentralised transparency and auditability in support of a Socialist model. This paper conducts a review of the blockchain, Libertarianism, and Socialist philosophies. It then explores Socialist models of public ownership and looks at the unique cooperative properties of blockchain that make the technology ideal for supporting Socialist societies. In summary, this paper argues that blockchain technologies are not just a Libertarian tool, they also enhance Socialist forms of governance.",

            "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in the transformative power of not only crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, but also the technology underlying them\u2014namely blockchain. To the uninitiated, a blockchain is a sophisticated, distributed online ledger that has the potential, according to Goldman Sachs, to \u201cchange \u2018everything.\u2019\u201d From making businesses more efficient to recording property deeds to engendering the growth of \u2018smart\u2019 contracts, blockchain technology is now being investigated by a huge range of organizations and is attracting billions in venture funding. Even the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is investigating blockchain technology to \u201ccreate an unhackable messaging system.\u201d However, the legal literature has largely ignored the rise of blockchain technology outside of its finance, securities, and copyright implications. This Article seeks to address this omission by analyzing the potential impact of blockchain technology on advancing the cybersecurity of firms across an array of sectors and industries with a particular focus on certificate authorities and the critical infrastructure context. Moreover, we examine the rise of blockchains through the lens of the literature on polycentric governance to ascertain what lessons this research holds to build trust in distributed systems and ultimately promote cyber peace.",

            "abstract": "\u201cBlockchain\u201d is the word on the street these days, with every significant financial institution, from Goldman Sachs to Nasdaq, experimenting with this new technology. Many say that this remarkable innovation could radically transform our financial system, eliminating the costs and inefficiencies that plague our existing financial infrastructures, such as payment, settlement, and clearing systems. Venture capital investments are pouring into blockchain startups, which are scrambling to disrupt the \u201cquadrillion\u201d dollar markets represented by existing financial market infrastructures. A debate rages over whether public, \u201cpermissionless\u201d blockchains (like Bitcoin\u2019s) or private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchains (like those being designed at many large banks) are more desirable.Amidst this flurry of innovation and investment, this paper enquires into the suitability of the Bitcoin blockchain to serve as the backbone of financial market infrastructure, and evaluates whether it is robust enough to serve as the foundation of major payment, settlement, clearing, or trading systems. Positing a scenario in which the Bitcoin blockchain does serve as the technology enabling significant financial market infrastructures, this paper highlights the vital importance of functioning financial market infrastructure to global financial stability, and describes relevant principles that global financial regulators have adopted to help maintain this stability, focusing particularly on governance, risk management, and operational risk.The paper then moves to explicate the operational risks generated by the most fundamental features of Bitcoin: its status as decentralized, open-source software. Illuminating the inevitable operational risks of software, such as its vulnerability to bugs and hacking (as well as Bitcoin\u2019s unique 51% Attack vulnerability), uneven adoption of new releases, and its opaque nature to all except coders, the paper argues that these technology risks are exacerbated by the governance risks generated by Bitcoin\u2019s ambiguous governance structure. The paper then teases out the operational risks spawned by decentralized, open-source governance, including that no one is responsible for resolving a crisis with the software; no one can legitimately serve as \u201cthe voice\u201d of the software; code maintenance and repair may be delayed or imperfect because not enough time is devoted to the code by volunteer software developers (or, if the coders are paid by private companies, the code development may be influenced by conflicts of interest); consensus on important changes to the code may be difficult or impossible to achieve, leading to splits in the blockchain; and the software developers who \u201crun\u201d the Bitcoin blockchain seem to have backgrounds in software coding rather than in policy-making or risk-management for financial market infrastructure.The paper concludes that these operational risks, generated by Bitcoin\u2019s most fundamental, presumably inalterable, structures, significantly undermine the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s suitability to serve as financial market infrastructure.",

The properties given by the Bitcoin blockchain and its derivatives are a natural solution to some of the problems with PKI - in particular, certificate transparency and elimination of single points of failure. Recently-proposed blockchain PKI designs are built as public ledgers linking identity with public key, giving no provision of privacy. We consider the suitability of a blockchain-based PKI for contexts in which PKI is required, but in which linking of identity with public key is undesirable; specifically, we show that blockchain can be used to construct a privacy-aware PKI while simultaneously eliminating some of the problems encountered in conventional PKI.",

Furthermore it provides a plurality of such resources, each with a distinct state and operating code but able to interact through a message-passing framework with others.

            "abstract": "Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require \"smart-contracts\" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.",

            "abstract": "When Satoshi Nakamoto first set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in January 2009, he was simultaneously introducing two radical and untested concepts. The first is the \"bitcoin\", a decentralized peer-to-peer online currency that maintains a value without any back ing, intrinsic value or central issuer. So far, the \"bitcoin\" as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of the pu blic attention, both in terms of the political aspects of a currency without a central bank and its extreme upwar d and downward volatility in price. However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi's g rand experiment: the concept of a proof of work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of t ransactions. Bitcoin as an application can be described as a first-to-file system: if one entity has 50 BTC, and simultaneo usly sends the same 50 BTC to A and to B, only the transaction that gets confirmed first will process. T here is no intrinsic way of determining from two transactions which came earlier, and for decades this stymied t he development of decentralized digital currency. Satoshi's blockchain was the first credible decentr alized solution. And now, attention is rapidly starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin's technolo gy, and how the blockchain concept can be used for more than just money.",

Blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts-scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.",

Using this application, people would be able to take loans on the blockchains. That means they can essentially lock up certain assets and borrow other cryptocurrencies and then pay back later after a certain amount of time.",

            "abstract": "The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed. We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners' revenue is larger than their fair share. The attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the attackers, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency. Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any coalition size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by a coalition that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a coalition of any size can compromise the system.",

            "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the feature to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new security problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make contracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 336 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.",

            "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and 250 similar alt-coins, embody at their core a blockchain protocol --- a mechanism for a distributed network of computational nodes to periodically agree on a set of new transactions. Designing a secure blockchain protocol relies on an open challenge in security, that of designing a highly-scalable agreement protocol open to manipulation by byzantine or arbitrarily malicious nodes. Bitcoin's blockchain agreement protocol exhibits security, but does not scale: it processes 3--7 transactions per second at present, irrespective of the available computation capacity at hand. In this paper, we propose a new distributed agreement protocol for permission-less blockchains called ELASTICO. ELASTICO scales transaction rates almost linearly with available computation for mining: the more the computation power in the network, the higher the number of transaction blocks selected per unit time. ELASTICO is efficient in its network messages and tolerates byzantine adversaries of up to one-fourth of the total computational power. Technically, ELASTICO uniformly partitions or parallelizes the mining network (securely) into smaller committees, each of which processes a disjoint set of transactions (or \"shards\"). While sharding is common in non-byzantine settings, ELASTICO is the first candidate for a secure sharding protocol with presence of byzantine adversaries. Our scalability experiments on Amazon EC2 with up to $1, 600$ nodes confirm ELASTICO's theoretical scaling properties.",

            "abstract": "Smart contract, a term which was originally coined to refer to the automation of legal contracts in general, has recently seen much interest due to the advent of blockchain technology. Recently, the term is popularly used to refer to low-level code scripts running on a blockchain platform. Our study focuses exclusively on this subset of smart contracts. Such smart contracts have increasingly been gaining ground, finding numerous important applications (e.g., crowdfunding) in the real world. Despite the increasing popularity, smart contract development still remains somewhat a mystery to many developers largely due to its special design and applications. Are there any differences between smart contract development and traditional software development? What kind of challenges are faced by developers during smart contract development? Questions like these are important but have not been explored by researchers yet. In this paper, we performed an exploratory study to understand the current state and potential challenges developers are facing in developing smart contracts on blockchains, with a focus on Ethereum (the most popular public blockchain platform for smart contracts). Toward this end, we conducted this study in two phases. In the first phase, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 developers from GitHub and industry professionals who are working on smart contracts. In the second phase, we performed a survey on 232 practitioners to validate the findings from the interviews. Our interview and survey results revealed several major challenges developers are facing during smart contract development: (1) there is no effective way to guarantee the security of smart contract code; (2) existing tools for development are still very basic; (3) the programming languages and the virtual machines still have a number of limitations; (4) performance problems are hard to handle under resource constrained running environment; and (5) online resources (including advanced/updated documents and community support) are still limited. Our study suggests several directions that researchers and practitioners can work on to help improve developers\u2019 experience on developing high-quality smart contracts.",

The main feature of this novel cryptocurrency is the tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for storing transactions. The tangle naturally succeeds the blockchain as its next evolutionary step, and offers features that are required to establish a machineto-machine micropayment system. An essential contribution of this paper is a family of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. These algorithms select attachment sites on the tangle for a transaction that has just arrived.",

NFTs are tradeable rights to digital assets (images, music, videos, virtual creations) where ownership is recorded in smart contracts on a blockchain. Given the NFT market emerged out of cryptocurrencies, we explore if NFT pricing is related to cryptocurrency pricing. A spillover index shows only limited volatility transmission effects between cryptocurrencies and NFTs. But wavelet coherence analysis indicates co-movement between the two sets of markets. This suggests that cryptocurrency pricing behaviours might be of some benefit in understanding NFT pricing patterns. However, the low volatility transmissions also indicate that NFTs can potentially be considered as a low-correlation asset class distinct from cryptocurrencies.",

With the advancement of various AI and machine learning technologies the evolution toward improved decision making as well as data-driven intelligent manufacturing has already been evident. However, several emerging issues, including the poisoning attacks, performance, and inadequate data resources, etc., have to be resolved. Recent research works studied the problem lightly, which often leads to unreliable performance, inefficiency, and privacy leakage. In this article, we developed a decentralized paradigm for big data-driven cognitive computing (D2C), using federated learning and blockchain jointly. Federated learning can solve the problem of \u201cdata island\u201d with privacy protection and efficient processing while blockchain provides incentive mechanism, fully decentralized fashion, and robust against poisoning attacks. Using blockchain-enabled federated learning help quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections. Extensive evaluation and assessment findings demonstrate D2C's effectiveness relative to existing leading designs and models.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance and trading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms. In this paper, we first describe BLOCKBENCH, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BLOCKBENCH via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BLOCKBENCH measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BLOCKBENCH to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the blockchain's software stack. We have released BLOCKBENCH for public use.",

            "abstract": "Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.",

Unlike traditional schemes, which transport electricity over long distances and through complex electricity transportation meshes, our proposed model achieves demand response by providing incentives to discharging PHEVs to balance local electricity demand out of their own self-interests. However, since transaction security and privacy protection issues present serious challenges, we explore a promising consortium blockchain technology to improve transaction security without reliance on a trusted third party. A localized P2P Electricity Trading system with COnsortium blockchaiN (PETCON) method is proposed to illustrate detailed operations of localized P2P electricity trading. Moreover, the electricity pricing and the amount of traded electricity among PHEVs are solved by an iterative double auction mechanism to maximize social welfare in this electricity trading. Security analysis shows that our proposed PETCON improves transaction security and privacy protection. Numerical results based on a real map of Texas indicate that the double auction mechanism can achieve social welfare maximization while protecting privacy of the PHEVs.",

We observe bots engage in what we call priority gas auctions (PGAs), competitively bidding up transaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering, i.e., early block position and execution, for their transactions. PGAs present an interesting and complex new continuous-time, partial-information, game-theoretic model that we formalize and study. We release an interactive web portal, frontrun.me, to provide the community with real-time data on PGAs.We additionally show that high fees paid for priority transaction ordering poses a systemic risk to consensus-layer security. We explain that such fees are just one form of a general phenomenon in DEXes and beyond\u2014what we call miner extractable value (MEV)\u2014that poses concrete, measurable, consensus-layer security risks. We show empirically that MEV poses a realistic threat to Ethereum today.Our work highlights the large, complex risks created by transaction-ordering dependencies in smart contracts and the ways in which traditional forms of financial-market exploitation are adapting to and penetrating blockchain economies.",

Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems. We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts. TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources. We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results include definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's \"gas\" fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications. We plan to launch TC soon as an online public service.",

From an abstract perspective, a blockchain is a distributed ledger capable of maintaining an immutable log of transactions happening in a network. In recent years, this technology has attracted significant scientific interest in research areas beyond the financial sector, one of them being the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, the blockchain is seen as the missing link toward building a truly decentralized, trustless, and secure environment for the IoT and, in this survey, we aim to shape a coherent and comprehensive picture of the current state-of-the-art efforts in this direction. We start with fundamental working principles of blockchains and how blockchain-based systems achieve the characteristics of decentralization, security, and auditability. From there, we build our narrative on the challenges posed by the current centralized IoT models, followed by recent advances made both in industry and research to solve these challenges and effectively use blockchains to provide a decentralized, secure medium for the IoT.",

Its data is not transparent, easy been tampered with, and incredible. The existing blockchain traceability system is not closely combined with the requirements of agricultural produce traceability, and the management and query of large-scale traceability data are inefficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a consortium blockchain scheme based on the Hyperledger Fabric framework which ensures traceability credible and promotes transaction efficiency by designing the system architecture and the chain operation method in the view of the agricultural produce traceability and consortium blockchain to meet the needs of agricultural produce traceability. The results show that the blockchain traceability system based on our scheme optimizes the transaction process of large-scale traceability data, covering the whole life cycle of agricultural products, and has certain practicability.",

However, one issue holding them back is their limited transaction throughput, especially compared to established solutions such as distributed database systems. In this paper, we re-architect a modern permissioned blockchain system, Hyperledger Fabric, to increase transaction throughput from 3,000 to 20,000 transactions per second. We focus on performance bottlenecks beyond the consensus mechanism, and we propose architectural changes that reduce computation and I/O overhead during transaction ordering and validation to greatly improve throughput. Notably, our optimizations are fully plug-and-play and do not require any interface changes to Hyperledger Fabric.",

We develop a game-theoretic model to explain the factors leading to the emergence of transactions fees, as well as to explain the strategic behavior of miners and users. Our model highlights the role played by mining rewards, transaction fees, price, and waiting time, discusses welfare issues, and examines how microstructure features such as exogenous structural constraints influence the dynamics of user participation on the blockchain. We provide empirical evidence on the model's predictions and discuss implications for bitcoin's evolution.",

While the first generation of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost exclusively used for cryptocurrency, the second generation (i.e., Blockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum, is an open and decentralized platform enabling a new paradigm of computing\u2014Decentralized Applications (DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future research directions.",

Here, we demonstrate a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption estimate into carbon emissions, using the localization of IP addresses. We determine the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO2. This means that the emissions produced by Bitcoin sit between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka, which is comparable to the level of Kansas City. With this article, we aim to gauge the external costs of Bitcoin and inform the broader debate on the costs and benefits of cryptocurrencies.",

            "abstract": "Blockchains like Bitcoin and Namecoin and their respective P2P networks have seen significant adoption in the past few years and show promise as naming systems with no trusted parties. Users can register human meaningful names and securely associate data with them, and only the owner of the particular private keys that registered them can write or update the name-value pair. In theory, many decentralized systems can be built using these blockchain networks, such as new, decentralized versions of DNS and PKI. As the technology is relatively new and evolving rapidly, however, little production data or experience is available to guide design tradeoffs. \n \nIn this paper, we describe our experiences operating a large deployment of a decentralized PKI service built on top of the Namecoin blockchain. We present various challenges pertaining to network reliability, throughput, and security that we needed to overcome while registering and updating over 33,000 entries and 200,000 transactions on the Namecoin blockchain. Further, we discuss how our experience informed the design of a new blockchain-based naming and storage system called Blockstack. We detail why we switched from the Namecoin network to the Bitcoin network for the new system, and present operational lessons from this migration. Blockstack is released as open source software and currently powers a production PKI system for 55,000 users.",

Bitcoin relies on proof-of-work mining to secure consensus which is problematic; mining requires a massive expenditure of energy, confirmation of transactions is slow, and security is difficult to quantify. We propose a solution to the blockchain consensus problem that does not require mining by adapting an existing solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem.",

            "abstract": "The core technical component of blockchains is consensus: how to reach agreement among a distributed network of nodes. A plethora of blockchain consensus protocols have been proposed---ranging from new designs, to novel modifications and extensions of consensus protocols from the classical distributed systems literature. The inherent complexity of consensus protocols and their rapid and dramatic evolution makes it hard to contextualize the design landscape. We address this challenge by conducting a systematization of knowledge of blockchain consensus protocols. After first discussing key themes in classical consensus protocols, we describe: (i) protocols based on proof-of-work; (ii) proof-of-X protocols that replace proof-of-work with more energy-efficient alternatives; and (iii) hybrid protocols that are compositions or variations of classical consensus protocols. This survey is guided by a systematization framework we develop, to highlight the various building blocks of blockchain consensus design, along with a discussion on their security and performance properties. We identify research gaps and insights for the community to consider in future research endeavours.",
