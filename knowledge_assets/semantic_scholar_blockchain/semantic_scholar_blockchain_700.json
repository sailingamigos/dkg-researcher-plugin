            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has penetrated deeply into our lives and the number of IoT devices per person is expected to increase substantially over the next few years. Due to the characteristics of IoT devices (i.e., low power and low battery), usage of these devices in critical applications requires sophisticated security measures. Researchers from academia and industry now increasingly exploit the concept of blockchains to achieve security in IoT applications. The basic idea of the blockchain is that the data generated by users or devices in the past are verified for correctness and cannot be tampered once it is updated on the blockchain. Even though the blockchain supports integrity and non-repudiation to some extent, confidentiality and privacy of the data or the devices are not preserved. The content of the data can be seen by anyone in the network for verification and mining purposes. In order to address these privacy issues, we propose a new privacy-preserving blockchain architecture for IoT applications based on attribute-based encryption (ABE) techniques. Security, privacy, and numerical analyses are presented to validate the proposed model.",

The main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other domains are its inherent security mechanisms and immunity to different attacks. A blockchain relies on a consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of the consensus methods which are currently used for the blockchain of different cryptocurrencies require high computational power and thus are not apt for resource-constrained systems. \nIn this article, we discuss and survey the various blockchain based consensus methods that are applicable to resource constrained IoT devices and networks. A typical IoT network consists of several devices which have limited computational and communications capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot perform intensive computations and are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we discuss the possible measures that can be taken to reduce the computational power and convergence time for the underlying consensus methods. We also talk about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain like private blockchain and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT networks. Furthermore, we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented and explore the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain based IoT network. Some of the open research challenges are also put forward.",

Together, these issues have contributed to systematically distorted perceptions regarding the benefits and risks of treatments. While these issues have been well documented and widely discussed within the profession, legislative intervention has seen limited success. Recently, a method was described for using a blockchain to prove the existence of documents describing pre-specified endpoints in clinical trials. Here, we extend the idea by using smart contracts - code, and data, that resides at a specific address in a blockchain, and whose execution is cryptographically validated by the network - to demonstrate how trust in clinical trials can be enforced and data manipulation eliminated. We show that blockchain smart contracts provide a novel technological solution to the data manipulation problem, by acting as trusted administrators and providing an immutable record of trial history.",

A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, open record of all cryptographic data exchanges. One key characteristic of the blockchain is its decentralized nature. Unlike records or accounts maintained by department, college, university, government agencies and other institutions, the blockchain does not require an intermediary to complete education records or alter records. Our solution incorporating the advanced features of blockchain allows education providers to issue official certificates that supply proof of completion or achievement. The proposed framework could also provide the corresponding functions for the after-college education and many other further usages.",

Previous research has contributed to this gap but often lacks a comprehensive understanding of tokens and their design as well as of the growing and rapidly-changing complexity in token landscape. This has crucial implications for assessing tokens' value and utility. Applying a structured, scientific approach towards blockchain tokens, we provide a comprehensive token classification and a decision-aid on token design. This is based on a literature review and an empirical study to cover this research gap. Our work offers a novel contribution in an emerging field within the Blockchain research domain and proposes structured analytical tools which can be used by both practitioners and researchers.",

Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions are getting integrated to all kinds of services, making products significantly more \"smarter\". The centerpiece of these technologies is \"data\". IoT device vendors should be able keep up with the increased throughput and come up with new business models. On the other hand, AI/ML solutions will produce better results if training data is diverse and plentiful. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based, decentralized and trustless data marketplace where IoT device vendors and AI/ML solution providers may interact and collaborate. By facilitating a transparent data exchange platform, access to consented data will be democratized and the variety of services targeting end-users will increase. Proposed data marketplace is implemented as a smart contract on Ethereum blockchain and Swarm is used as the distributed storage platform.",

Objective This study aims to explore the role of blockchain in supporting clinical trials data management and develop a proof-of-concept implementation of a patient-facing and researcher-facing system. Methods Blockchain-based Smart Contracts were built using the Ethereum platform. Results We described BlockTrial, a system that uses a Web-based interface to allow users to run trials-related Smart Contracts on an Ethereum network. Functions allow patients to grant researchers access to their data and allow researchers to submit queries for data that are stored off chain. As a type of distributed ledger, the system generates a durable and transparent log of these and other transactions. BlockTrial could be used to increase the trustworthiness of data collected during clinical research with benefits to researchers, regulators, and drug companies alike. In addition, the system could empower patients to become more active and fully informed partners in research. Conclusions Blockchain technology presents an opportunity to address some of the common threats to the integrity of data collected in clinical trials and ensure that the analysis of these data comply with prespecified plans. Further technical work is needed to add additional functions. Policies must be developed to determine the optimal models for participation in the system by its various stakeholders.",

However, the current performance of blockchain is poor, which becomes a major constraint of its applications. Additionally, different blockchain systems lack standard performance monitoring approach which can automatically adapt to different systems and provide detailed and real-time performance information. To solve this problem, we propose overall performance metrics and detailed performance metrics for the users to know the exact performance in different stages of the blockchain. Then we propose a performance monitoring framework with a log-based method. It has advantages of lower overhead, more details, and better scalability than the previous performance monitoring approaches. Finally we implement the framework to monitor four well-known blockchain systems, using a set of 1,000 open-source smart contracts. The experimental results show that our framework can make detailed and real-time performance monitoring of blockchain systems. We also provide some suggestions for the future development of blockchain systems.",

This paper studies Ethereum transactions and it analyzes two most popular Ethereum clients, Geth and Parity, on a private blockchain to obtain the better understanding of the effect of different clients on Ethereum performance. The results show that the transactions are 89.8 percent on average faster in Parity client in comparison with Geth client, using the same system configuration.",

This paper argues that we need to look beyond the currency applications and investigate the potential use of the blockchain technology in governmental tasks such as digital ID management and secure document handling. The paper discusses the use of blockchain technology as a platform for various applications in e-Government and furthermore as an emerging support infrastructure by showing that blockchain technology demonstrates a potential for authenticating many types of persistent documents.",

The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze various critical success factors (CSFs) that can facilitate success of blockchain-based cloud services. Further, this paper aims to analyze and understand mutual interactions among these CSFs.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn this paper, 19 CSFs have been identified through literature review and expert opinions. The hierarchical framework developed using total interpretive structural modeling has revealed the inter-dependencies among these CSFs. The methodology employed in this study provides a mechanism to conduct an exploratory study by identifying the factors and analyzing their interactions through the development of a hierarchical framework. This research further categorizes CSFs into multiple clusters based on their driving power and dependence power.\n\n\nFindings\nThis paper has identified 19 CSFs, namely, user engagement, industry collaboration, rich ecosystem, blockchain technology standardization, regulatory clarity, cost efficiency, energy efficiency (wasted resources), handling blockchain bloat, miner incentives, business case alignment to blockchain capability, sidechains development, blockchain talent pool availability, leadership readiness for a decentralized consensus based technology, technology investment and maturity, trust on blockchain networks, integration with other cloud services, robust and mature smart contracts platform, blockchain security and user control on data (privacy). Further, driver and dependent variables have been identified.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nFuture research can discover and detail the sub-factors behind the 19 CSFs identified in this paper. Additionally, more work can be done to extend the current structural model for blockchain-based services to a more functional form.\n\n\nPractical implications\nIt provides a comprehensive list of CSFs that are relevant for development of blockchain-based cloud services. This will help industry leaders to strategically focus on the main drivers that will ensure that businesses get maximum benefit of this disruptive technology.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study makes a significant contribution in the literature of blockchain-based cloud services, which captures the perspective of different stakeholders. This study is one of the first (if not the first) systematic research on adoption of blockchain-based services. It creates the foundation to carry out further research in this area.\n",

Unlike existing Blockchain schemes, our access model can authorise different levels of granularity of authorisation, whilst maintaining compatibility with the underlying Blockchain data structure. Furthermore, the authorisation, encryption, and decryption algorithms proposed in the GAA-FQ scheme dispense with the need to use a public key infrastructure (PKI) and hence improve the computation performance needed to support more granular and distributed, yet authorised, EMR data queries. We validated the computation performance and transmission efficiency for GAA-FQ using a simulation of GAA-FQ against an access control scheme for EMRs called ESPAC as our baseline that was not designed using a Blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, GAA- FQ is the first Blockchain-oriented access authorisation scheme with granular access control, supporting flexible data queries, that has been proposed for secure EMR information management.",

Blockchains and smart contracts have received increasing and booming attention in recent years, also in academic circles. We carry out a systematic mapping study of all peer-reviewed technology-oriented research in smart contracts. Our interest is twofold, namely to provide a survey of the scientific literature and to identify academic research trends and uptake. We only focus on peer-reviewed scientific publications, in order to identify how academic researchers have taken up smart contract technologies and established scientific outputs. We obtained all research papers from the main scientific databases, and using the systematic mapping method arrived at 188 relevant papers. We classified these papers into six categories, namely, security, privacy, software engineering, application, performance & scalability and other smart contract related topics. We found that the majority of the papers falls into the applications (about 64%) and software engineering (21%) categories. Compared to our 2017 survey [1], we observe that the number of relevant articles has increased about eightfold and shifted considerably towards applications of smart contracts.",

            "abstract": "In recent times, Bitcoin has gained special attention both from industry and academia. The underlying technology that enables Bitcoin (or more generally crypto-currency) is called blockchain. At the core of the blockchain technology is a data structure that keeps record of the transactions in the network. The special feature that distinguishes it from existing technology is its immutability of the stored records. To achieve immutability, it uses consensus and cryptographic mechanisms. As the data is stored in distributed nodes this technology is also termed as \"Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)\". As many researchers and practitioners are joining the hype of blockchain, some of them are raising the question about the fundamental difference between blockchain and traditional database and its real value or potential. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of both technologies based on a survey of the research literature where blockchain solutions are applied to various scenarios. Based on this analysis, we further develop a decision tree diagram that will help both practitioners and researchers to choose the appropriate technology for their use cases. Using our proposed decision tree we evaluate a sample of the existing works to see to what extent the blockchain solutions have been used appropriately in the relevant problem domains.",

            "abstract": "The emerging blockchain protocols provide a decentralized architecture that is suitable of supporting Internet of Things (IoT) interactions. However, keeping a local copy of the blockchain ledger is infeasible for low-power and memory-constrained devices. For this reason, they are equipped with lightweight software implementations that only download the useful data structures, e.g., state of accounts, from the blockchain network, when they are updated. In this paper, we consider and analyze a novel scheme, implemented by the nodes of the blockchain network, which aggregates the blockchain data in periodic updates and further reduces the communication cost of the connected IoT devices. We show that the aggregation period should be selected based on the channel quality, the offered rate, and the statistics of updates of the useful data structures. The results, obtained for the Ethereum protocol, illustrate the benefits of the aggregation scheme in terms of a reduced duty cycle of the device, particularly for low signal-to-noise ratios, and the overall reduction of the amount of information transmitted in downlink from the wireless base station to the IoT device. A potential application of the proposed scheme is to let the IoT device request more information than actually needed, hence increasing its privacy, while keeping the communication cost constant. In the conclusion, this paper is the first to provide rigorous guidelines for the design of lightweight blockchain protocols with wireless connectivity.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain is a new distributed and decentralized technology, and gradually attracts worldwide attention, but it is vulnerable to quantum attacks that would solve elliptic curve digital logarithm problem, which is mainly used for transaction authentication in blockchain. The key needed for authentication comes from the wallet. To ensure that the size of the wallet is fixed and easy to manage, deterministic wallets are required to be used. But if existing anti-quantum signature schemes, such as lattice-based signature are used directly in blockchain to solve the problem, it would have made the wallet bloat. In this paper, we present a novel anti-quantum transaction authentication scheme in the blockchain. In order to construct lightweight nondeterministic wallets, the key point is that public and private keys are generated from a set of master public and private key(Seed Key). We leverage on Bonsai Trees technology and propose a new authentication method which can extend a lattice space to multiple lattice spaces accompanied by the corresponding key. Every signature of a transaction uses a lattice space so as to ensure the randomness and the security of the master private key. And we give the complete security proof and analysis. This paper provides the theoretical support for the application of blockchain in the post quantum age.",

In general, blockchain blocks are open and the transactions in them are public. If some privacy data are involved in these transactions, they will be leaked. Owing to healthcare system involving a great deal of privacy data, certain security mechanisms must be built to protect these privacy data in health blockchain. Furthermore, because the core of security mechanisms is the key management schemes, the appropriate key management schemes should be designed before blockchains can be used in healthcare system. Here, according to the features of health blockchain, the authors use a body sensor network to design a lightweight backup and efficient recovery scheme for keys of health blockchain. The authors\u2019 analyses show that the scheme has high security and performance, and it can be used to protect privacy messages on health blockchain effectively and to promote the application of health blockchain.",

However, following the principles of the blockchain, the number of transactions required to update ledgers poses serious issues for vehicles as these may consume the maximum available energy. To resolve this, an efficient model is presented in this letter, which is capable of handling the energy demands of the blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles by optimally controlling the number of transactions through distributed clustering. Numerical results suggest that the proposed approach is 40.16% better in terms of energy conservation and 82.06% better in terms of the number of transactions required to share the entire blockchain data compared with the traditional blockchain.",

For the use case of a documentary letter of credit we describe the status quo of the process, identify areas of improvement, implement a Blockchain solution, and compare both workflows. The prototype illustrates that the process, as of today paper-based and with high manual effort, can be significantly improved. Our research reveals that a tamper-proof process history for improved auditability, automation of manual process steps and the decentralized nature of the system can be major advantages of a Blockchain solution for crossorganizational workflow management. Further, our research provides insights how Blockchain technology can be used for business process management in general.",

The novel deep learning and transfer learning techniques are turning any data about the person into medical data transforming simple facial pictures and videos into powerful sources of data for predictive analytics. Presently, the patients do not have control over the access privileges to their medical records and remain unaware of the true value of the data they have. In this paper, we provide an overview of the next-generation artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies and present innovative solutions that may be used to accelerate the biomedical research and enable patients with new tools to control and profit from their personal data as well with the incentives to undergo constant health monitoring. We introduce new concepts to appraise and evaluate personal records, including the combination-, time- and relationship-value of the data. We also present a roadmap for a blockchain-enabled decentralized personal health data ecosystem to enable novel approaches for drug discovery, biomarker development, and preventative healthcare. A secure and transparent distributed personal data marketplace utilizing blockchain and deep learning technologies may be able to resolve the challenges faced by the regulators and return the control over personal data including medical records back to the individuals.",

However, the leverage of both technologies for structural health monitoring (SHM) to enable transparent information sharing among involved parties and autonomous decision making has not yet been achieved. Therefore, this study combines IoT with blockchain-based smart contracts for SHM of underground structures to define a novel, efficient, scalable, and secure distributed network for enhancing operational safety. In this blockchain-IoT network, the characteristics of locally centralized and globally decentralized distribution have been activated by dividing them into core and edge networks. This division enhances the efficiency and scalability of the system. The proposed system was effective in simulation for autonomous monitoring and control of structures. After proper design, the decentralized blockchain networks may effectively be deployed for transparent and efficient information sharing, smart contracts-based autonomous decision making, and data security in SHM.",

This ingenious distributed peer-to-peer design attracted several businesses and solicited several communities beyond the financial market. There are also multiple use cases built around its ecosystem. However, this backbone introduced a lot of speculation and has been criticized by several researchers. Moreover, the lack of legislations perceived a lot of attention. In this paper, we are concerned in analyzing blockchain networks and their development, focusing on their security challenges. We took a holistic approach to cover the involved mechanisms and the limitations of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger networks. We expose also numerous possible attacks and assess some countermeasures to dissuade vulnerabilities on the network. For occasion, we simulated the majority and the re-entrancy attacks. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate Blockchain security summarizing its current state. Thoroughly showing threatening flaws, we are not concerned with favoring any particular blockchain network.",

The blockchain is a singly linked list which consists of a number of transactions. The blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger which consists of a number of blocks organized in the form of a chain. A block in blockchain consists of two parts data and hash pointer. The first block in the blockchain is known as genesis block. The transactions and data in the block are secured by cryptography. The data inside a block in blockchain can be anything like bank transactions, backup data etc., which are recorded chronologically and publicly. The Hash pointer of a block is a unique code generated by a hash function like SHA256, SHA-3 etc., the hash function used in bitcoin blockchain. A block consists of a public key and a private key, using hash function digital signature is generated to the block. This is how the data inside the blockchain is so secured.

Respective use cases have been examined in already existing scientific papers, Master Theses, industry white papers and blogs of industry experts. The paper also contains a description of blockchain main technological aspects and working principles, which allows making the assessment of the presented use cases. For each use case respective companies or organisations are added that are applying or testing the given solution. Due to research limitations the paper should not be considered an exhaustive blockchain use case description. The paper also provides short introduction into a feasibility analysis of specific blockchain use case. The authors describe the basic steps of potential idea evaluation with regards to blockchain main aspects. It helps understand the necessity for development of a detailed blockchain feasibility model.",

It is featured by decentralization, trustworthiness, data sharing, security, etc. It has been widely used in digital currency, smart contract, credit encryption and other fields. With the development of the Internet technology, online education, a novel education mode, has been greatly popularized. However, this education mode still faces many problems in course credibility, credit and certificate certification, stu-dent privacy, and course sharing. Through literature review and case analysis, this paper discusses the basic technical principles and application features of blockchain technology, and proposes a solution to the problems of online educa-tion based on blockchain technology. The blockchain technology can store learn-ing records in a trusted, distributed manner, provide credible digital certificates, realize learning resource sharing with smart contract, and protect intellectual property through data encryption. The research shows that the integration of blockchain technology is a promising trend in the development of online educa-tion.",

The security of blockchain is always the focus of people's attention, and it is also the main reason why the blockchain has not been widely used all over the world. Many researches use mathematical derivation method to analyse the 51%- Attacks influence of blockchain, which is very stiff and difficult to understand. In this paper, we propose a method to simulate blockchain's process and discover the rule between attacking method, attacking power and security of blockchain. We take 51%-Attacks as an example and use Java to simulate the running process. By adjusting the value of attacking power, we can get most states of blockchain and analyze the probability that honest state becomes attacking state. We use various forms to analyze and show the experimental result, which verify our method is correct and feasible. This method can also be implemented as a middleware software of blockchain to detect the security of blockchain.",

At the same time, blockchain technology promises to mitigate these issues by introducing certainty into economic transactions. This paper discusses the findings of a Design Science Research project involving the construction and evaluation of an information technology artifact in collaboration with Maersk, a leading international shipping company, where central documents in shipping, such as the Bill of Lading, are turned into a smart contract on blockchain. Based on our insights from the project, we provide first evidence for preliminary design principles for applications that aim to mitigate the transactional risk and uncertainty in decentralized environments using blockchain. Both the artifact and the first evidence for emerging design principles are novel, contributing to the discourse on the implications that the advent of blockchain technology poses for governing economic activity.",

            "abstract": "Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum execute payment transactions securely, but their performance is limited by the need for global consensus. Payment networks overcome this limitation through off-chain transactions. Instead of writing to the blockchain for each transaction, they only settle the final payment balances with the underlying blockchain. When executing off-chain transactions in current payment networks, parties must access the blockchain within bounded time to detect misbehaving parties that deviate from the protocol. This opens a window for attacks in which a malicious party can steal funds by deliberately delaying other parties' blockchain access and prevents parties from using payment networks when disconnected from the blockchain. We present Teechain, the first layer-two payment network that executes off-chain transactions asynchronously with respect to the underlying blockchain. To prevent parties from misbehaving, Teechain uses treasuries, protected by hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs), to establish off-chain payment channels between parties. Treasuries maintain collateral funds and can exchange transactions efficiently and securely, without interacting with the underlying blockchain. To mitigate against treasury failures and to avoid having to trust all TEEs, Teechain replicates the state of treasuries using committee chains, a new variant of chain replication with threshold secret sharing. Teechain achieves at least a 33X higher transaction throughput than the state-of-the-art Lightning payment network. A 30-machine Teechain deployment can handle over 1 million Bitcoin transactions per second.",

In this work, we leverage Blockchain as a platform to facilitate trustworthy data provenance collection, verification, and management. The developed system utilizes smart contracts and open provenance model (OPM) to record immutable data trails. We show that our proposed framework can securely capture and validate provenance data that prevents any malicious modification to the captured data as long as the majority of the participants are honest.",

In this paper, we present a classification and taxonomy of different blockchain development platforms and simulators along with their consensus protocols, the types of supported blockchain networks and programming languages. We also assess the performance of a blockchain application for deployment at the UAE University (UAEU) versus increasing number of nodes, blocks and block size, on top of experimental network latencies and bandwidth between the nodes. Our results show that a large-scale deployment of blockchain at UAEU is feasible.",

In addition, the development of blockchain is also growing rapidly since it was first popularized in Bitcoin. Security issues on this IoT can be solved using blockchain. One way that can be done is to make secure communication between IoT devices. In this study, an IoT system will be created without and using blockchain which will then be compared between the two. The communication protocol used in IoT systems without blockchain is MQTT. Meanwhile, the blockchain platform used is Ethereum along with a smart contract. Both of these IoT systems will be analyzed for their security level by simulating attacks and observing their security aspects. The test results show that the IoT system based on blockchain technology has a higher level of security than the IoT system without blockchain technology.",

Each member of the network has access to the latest copy of encrypted ledger so that they can validate a new transaction. Blockchain ledger is a collection of all Bitcoin transactions executed in the past. Basically, it's a distributed database which maintains a continuously growing tamper proof data structure blocks which holds batches of individual transactions. The completed blocks are added in a linear and chronological order. Each block contains a timestamp and information link which points to a previous block. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer permission-less network which allows every user to connect to the network and send new transaction to verify and create new blocks. Satoshi Nakamoto described design of Bitcoin digital currency in his research paper posted to cryptography listserv in 2008. Nakamoto's suggestion has solved long pending problem of cryptographers and laid the foundation stone for digital currency. This paper explains the concept, characteristics, need of Blockchain and how Bitcoin works. It attempts to highlights role of Blockchain in shaping the future of banking, financial institutions and adoption of Internet of Things(IoT).",

Furthermore, it is also providing efficiency gains on top of old existing structures by removing the need for actively intermediated data-synchronization and concurrency control. Due to this dual effect, blockchain technology has the potential to impact all sectors and layers of society, in a multitude of combined ways. While there is a lot of hype around the concept of blockchains, the phenomenon itself has remained ambiguous and misconceptions have emerged about the capabilities and the potential of blockchain technology. Drawing from ETLA\u2019s participation in blockchain research in 2014\u20132016, this paper aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding on blockchain technology, its true possibilities, and its potential larger societal implications. It offers a holistic view of the key concepts and the basic principles, and the tools and the framework to understand the ongoing discussion, to critically evaluate different viewpoints, and to delve deeper in a constructed manner",

            "abstract": "We study the strategic considerations of miners participating in the bitcoin's protocol. We formulate and study the stochastic game that underlies these strategic considerations. The miners collectively build a tree of blocks, and they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in the path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games, we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small, their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer. However, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the expected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain-based crowdfunding is an emerging economic phenomenon and a state-of-the-art strategy to finance ventures. It bears similarity to conventional crowdfunding, but has its own unique characteristics. Therefore the success factors that affect the outcome of traditional crowdfunding may have a different impact on blockchain-based crowdfunding. Despite that the number of blockchain-based crowdfunding campaigns has increased drastically in the past few years, there is a lack of good understanding of what the success factors are for them in comparison to the ones for conventional crowdfunding. Such understanding is crucial for companies to design their blockchain-based fundraising initiatives properly and facilitate potential investors to seek main signals and drivers of outstanding projects. Furthermore it could help regulators and market participants to understand how the existing regulatory framework applies to blockchain-based crowdfunding. Due to specific characteristics of blockchain-based crowdfunding, regulatory frameworks may require potential re-interpretation of requirements to allow an effective application of regulations. To fill this knowledge gaps, we have reviewed a set of relevant literature on success factors for conventional and blockchain-based crowdfunding. The result of this literature review sheds light on the directions for future research and development. The contribution of our work is a better understanding of the distinctions and similarities of blockchain-based crowdfunding compared to traditional crowdfunding.",

The properties afforded by the Bitcoin blockchain are a natural solution to some of the problems with PKI - in particular, certificate transparency and elimination of single points-offailure. Proposed blockchain-based PKI designs are built as public ledgers linking identity with public key, providing no privacy. We consider cases requiring privacy-aware PKIs, which do not link identity with public key. We show that blockchain technology can be used to construct a privacy-aware PKI while eliminating some of the problems of conventional PKI, and present PB-PKI, a privacy-aware blockchain-based PKI.",

Although, blockchain technology has been used to address various challenges, to our knowledge none of the previous work focused on using blockchain to develop a secure and immutable scientific data provenance management framework that automatically verifies the provenance records. In this work, we leverage blockchain as a platform to facilitate trustworthy data provenance collection, verification, and management. The developed system utilizes smart contracts and open provenance model (OPM) to record immutable data trails. We show that our proposed framework can efficiently and securely capture and validate provenance data, and prevent any malicious modification to the captured data as long as the majority of the participants are honest.",

If properly engineered, the blockchain technology offers a disruptive solution to the problem of security and privacy in the Internet of Things environment, providing a new computational layer where data can be safely processed and analyzed, remaining private. The blockchain can also enable micro-payment functionality between digitally-enhanced devices, through ultra-light cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. The implementation of such features is expected to ensure a more efficient allocation of resources at global level, however it may also lead to undesirable consequences \u2013 such as a hyper-tokenization of society and a potentially dystopian concentration of power on big global platforms. Therefore, overall benefits and drawbacks of the blockchain deployment must necessarily take account of specific contexts of use, finding a balance between need for innovation, economic development and social sustainability.",

The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process instance is maintained on the Ethereum blockchain, and the workflow routing is performed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The compiler supports a wide array of BPMN constructs, including user, script and service tasks, parallel and exclusive gateways, subprocesses, multi-instance activities and event handlers. The target audience of this demonstration includes researchers in the area of business process management and blockchain technology.",

            "abstract": "Since the inception of the Bitcoin technology, its underlying data structure--the blockchain--has garnered much attention due to properties such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability. These properties make blockchains suitable for apps that require disintermediation through trustless exchange, consistent and incorruptible transaction records, and operational models beyond cryptocurrency. In particular, blockchain and its smart contract capabilities have the potential to address healthcare interoperability issues, such as enabling effective interactions between users and medical applications, delivering patient data securely to a variety of organizations and devices, and improving the overall efficiency of medical practice workflow. Despite the interest in using blockchain for healthcare interoperability, however, little information is available on the concrete architectural styles and patterns for applying blockchain to healthcare apps. This paper provides an initial step in filling this gap by showing: (1) the features and implementation challenges in healthcare interoperability, (2) an end-to-end case study of a blockchain-based healthcare app we are developing, and (3) how applying foundational software patterns can help address common interoperability challenges faced by blockchain-based healthcare apps.",

In addition, global value chains are increasingly disaggregated, making it difficult for consumers to enforce breaches of sustainability representations. Blockchain, as an immutable and digital record keeping system, is a tool that can deal with this growing complexity in global value chains. Documents verifying sustainability that were once in the private domain and stored in paper copy can now be made accessible in a secure and transparent blockchain platform. Despite a growing interest in the potential of blockchain to transform businesses, there are few concrete examples or scholarly literature showing how blockchain is operationalized in practice. Using a \u201cconceptual framework analysis\u201d approach, we develop an Evidence, Verifiability, and Enforceability (EVE) framework to illustrate how blockchain can enhance sustainability by providing information to consumers on the origin of products, assurances as to the veracity of the information, and a mechanism to enforce representations through the blockchain smart contract function. However, there need to be safeguards put in place for blockchain technology to meet its promise and we discuss some of these challenges.",

One of the difficulties blockchain researchers are facing is a lack of ways to verify behaviors of large scale blockchain networks. In this demonstration, we present SimBlock, a blockchain network simulator. It simulates the peer-to-peer network of a public blockchain, e.g., Bitcoin, which consists of thousands of nodes, as well as parameters related to a blockchain and its network are flexibly configurable. SimBlock can also visualize nodes\u2019 behavior and block propagation. By giving some example studies, such as exploring better neighbor selection strategies and assessing the influence of relay networks, we show that SimBlock can facilitate blockchain network research.",

More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the \"Blockchain revolution\" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account.\n This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.",

From the foundation of Bitcoin to the now predominant smart contract, blockchain technology promises to induce a shift in thought about digital transactions in many fields, such as energy, healthcare, Internet of Things, cybersecurity, financial services and the supply chain. Despite blockchain technology offers many cryptography advantages such as immutability, digital signature and hashing; it has suffered from several critical cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we build upon the previous studies on vulnerabilities and investigates over 60 real cybersecurity incidents that have been happening on the blockchain networks between 2009 and 2019. We categorise those incidents against the key cybersecurity vulnerabilities in blockchain technologies; and have developed a taxonomy that captures five types of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities based on five main players in blockchain. The outcome of this research prompted concerns and research direction in developing countermeasures to alleviate these risks.",

We make traceability of assets in the permissioned blockchain be defined and be expressed as a hidden Markov model. There exists no dishonest increase and decrease of assets in this model. The condition is called balance. As we encrypt this model with fully homomorphic encryption and apply the zero knowledge proof of plaintext knowledge, we show that the trace-ability and balance of the permissioned blockchain are able to be proved in zero knowledge to the permissionless blockchain with concealing the asset allocation of the permissioned blockchain.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain has recently emerged as an important tool that can enable critical distributed applications without requiring centralized trust. For example, public blockchains have been used to enable many different cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, existing public blockchains and smart contracts deployed on them may disclose sensitive information. Although there is some ongoing work that leverage advanced cryptography to address some of these sensitive information leakage issues, they require significant changes to existing and popular blockchains such as Ethereum and are usually computationally expensive. On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efficient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly. Given these observations, one natural question that arise is, can we leverage both public and private blockchain infrastructures to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and accountable applications? In this work, we try to address this challenge in the context of digital auctions. Mainly, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain architecture that combines private and public blockchains to allow sensitive bids to be opened on a private blockchain so that only the auctioneer can learn the bids, and no one else. At the same time, we leverage public blockchains to make the auction winner announcement, and payments accountable. Furthermore, using smart contracts deployed on public blockchain, we show how to incentivize truthful behavior among the auction participants. Our extensive empirical results show that this architecture is more efficient in terms of run time and monetary cost compared to pure public blockchain based auction implementations.",

Thus, the development of blockchain in mobile applications is restricted. In this paper, we, for the first time, consider the edge computing as the network enabler for mobile blockchain. In particular, we study optimal pricing-based edge computing resource management to support mobile blockchain applications where the mining process can be offloaded to an Edge computing Service Provider (ESP). We adopt a two-stage Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profit of the ESP and the individual utilities of different miners. In Stage~I, the ESP sets the price of edge computing services. In Stage~II, the miners decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed prices. We apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in each stage for uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. Further, the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg game are validated for both pricing schemes. At last, the performance evaluation shows that the ESP intends to set the maximum possible value as optimal price for profit maximization under uniform pricing. In addition, the discriminatory pricing helps the ESP to encourage higher total service demand from miners and achieve greater profit correspondingly.",

Consequently, blockchains and existing technologies do not integrate well in a unified framework. This integration is necessary to work around some of the blockchains constraints, such as scalability of transactions and ergonomics. Indeed, blockchains are not suitable for huge data storage, but there are distributed data storage solutions that can be used in a decentralized blockchain application. Regarding ergonomics, the use of blockchain technology should be in the background and transparent for users that may not know how to set up and secure a blockchain-based application.We propose an architecture aiming to easily link existing decentralized technologies and blockchains. We then discuss the impact of this architecture for the video game industry. As a result, we propose an original data representation of blockchain gaming assets in order to improve data exchanges in this industry.",

Our aim is to examine the way blockchain technologies can bring about - and justify - new models of governance . To do so, w e draw on\u00a0 the philosophical works of Hobbes , Rousseau , and Rawls , analyzing blockchain governance in terms of contrasting\u00a0 social contract theories .\u00a0 We begin by comparing the justifications of blockchain governance offered by members of the blockchain developers \u2019 community with the justifications of governance presented with in social contract theories . We then\u00a0 examine\u00a0 the extent to which the model of governance offered by blockchain technologies\u00a0 reflect s key governance themes and assumptions located within social contract theories , focusing on the notions of sovereignty, the initial situation, decentralization and distributive justice .",

            "abstract": "The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool which proves to be useful in a number of application scenarios. A number of large industrial players, such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and NEC, are currently investing in exploiting the blockchain in order to enrich their portfolio of products. A number of researchers and practitioners speculate that the blockchain technology can change the way we see a number of online applications today. Although it is still early to tell for sure, it is expected that the blockchain will stimulate considerable changes to a large number of products and will positively impact the digital experience of many individuals around the globe. In this tutorial, we overview, detail, and analyze the security provisions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain-effectively capturing recently reported attacks and threats in the system. Our contributions go beyond the mere analysis of reported vulnerabilities of Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of countermeasures to deter threats on the system-some of which have already been incorporated in the system. Recall that Bitcoin has been forked multiple times in order to fine-tune the consensus (i.e., the block generation time and the hash function), and the network parameters (e.g., the size of blocks). As such, the results reported in this tutorial are not only restricted to Bitcoin, but equally apply to a number of \"altcoins\" which are basically clones/forks of the Bitcoin source code. Given the increasing number of alternative blockchain proposals, this tutorial extracts the basic security lessons learnt from the Bitcoin system with the aim to foster better designs and analysis of next-generation secure blockchain currencies and technologies.",

However, this integration has also led to critical challenges in energy management, such as congestion pricing and non-optimality of dispatch. To address these challenges, deregulation and decentralization of electricity market is one of the effective solutions. Although various deregulation schemes have been proposed in recent years, there still remain some serious challenges in achieving resilient management of real-time energy deregulation especially in the presence of disasters. To counter this issue, in this paper, we propose a model for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactive microgrid where prosumers (Producer/ Consumer) can trade local generation with each other via a smart management system. Furthermore, in our proposed model, the energy trading is executed in a decentralized manner by leveraging Blockchain technologies. Among different Blockchain technologies, we adopt the Ethereum Blockchain in our work. The auction models for energy trading are proposed by incorporating a smart contract that is the essential component of the Blockchain. In our simulations, the proposed P2P energy trading model is evaluated.",

Our Delphi study sets out to explore the impact of blockchain in payments, which represents a major cornerstone of banking and the cradle of this technology. The results, grouped around four areas of thoughts, indicate that blockchain allows the offering of new services and renders some of the current ones obsolete. This consequently impacts the financial structure of firms in the payments industry and further generates great potential for new BMs while making some existing ones obsolete. Eventually, new players, which are better able to leverage the potential of blockchain, will give a strong impulse to this development.

            "abstract": "Blockchain is of rising importance as a technology for engineering applications in cross-organizational settings, avoiding reliance on central trusted third-parties. The use of blockchain, instead of traditional databases or services, is an architectural choice in the development of a software system. Architecture impacts the non-functional qualities of systems, creating design trade-offs between these qualities. The costs of execution and storage are important non-functional qualities, but as yet little is known about them for blockchain-based systems. How expensive is it to use blockchains compared to conventional execution and storage infrastructure? We investigate this question using business process execution as a lens. Specifically, we compare the cost for computation and storage of business process execution on blockchain vs. a popular cloud service. Besides monetary cost, blockchains like Ethereum limit the complexity of new blocks by capping costs through network-defined limits. For applications using such blockchains, the limit per block, thus, translates into an upper bound on throughput scalability. First, we implement and measure the cost of business process execution on blockchain and cloud services for a business process model from a large-scale industrial dataset and an example from literature. We observe two orders of magnitude difference in this cost. Second, we illustrate how cost models can be used to project the impact of different workload assumptions. Finally, we discuss throughput scalability limits as well as trade-offs between cost and other non-functional qualities in the design of blockchain-based systems.",

The regulation harmonises personal data protection across the European Union and aims to return the ownership of personal data to the individual. This thesis, therefore, addresses the question how this new technology that is characterised by decentralisation, immutability and truly digitised values will be affected by the strict privacy regulation and vice versa. The aim of this work is to clarify whether blockchains can comply with the new regulation on the one hand and to identify how blockchain could support its compliance, on the other hand. \n\nThe questions are validated through an extensive literature review and are further investigated by using a Delphi study that asks a panel of 25 renowned experts to find opportunities, limitations and general suggestions about both topics. In addition, a framework is proposed to support the assessment of privacy and related risks of blockchains. \n\nAs a result, it becomes apparent that blockchains can become more privacy friendly and comply with the regulation if an active dialogue between blockchain developers and regulatory authorities helps to strengthen their mutual understanding and work. With the support of this work and the blockchain Privacy Impact Assessment canvas a foundation for the necessary next steps is laid to overcome the challenges of defining a data controller or deleting personal data within a blockchain.",

            "abstract": "While the intersection of blockchains and the Internet of Things (IoT) have received considerable research interest lately, Nakamoto-style blockchains possess a number of qualities that make them poorly suited for many IoT scenarios. Specifically, they require high network connectivity and are power-intensive. This is a drawback in IoT environments where battery-constrained nodes form an unreliable ad hoc network such as in digital agriculture. In this paper we present Vegvisir, a partition-tolerant blockchain for use in power-constrained IoT environments with limited network connectivity. It is a permissioned, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-structured blockchain that can be used to create a shared, tamperproof data repository that keeps track of data provenance. We discuss the use cases, architecture, and challenges of such a blockchain.",

As a decentralized and distributed data management solution, blockchain has restored the definition of trust by the embedded cryptography and consensus mechanism, thus providing security, anonymity and data integrity without the need of any third party. But there still exists some technical challenges and limitations in blockchain. This paper has conducted a systematic research on current blockchain application in cybersecurity. In order to solve the security issues, the paper analyzes the advantages that blockchain has brought to cybersecurity and summarizes current research and application of blockchain in cybersecurity related areas. Through in-depth analysis and summary of the existing work, the paper summarizes four major security issues of blockchain and performs a more granular analysis of each problem. Adopting an attribute-based encryption method, the paper also puts forward an enhanced access control strategy.",

When the number of IoT devices in health care system is increased exponentially, the privacy and security issues of patients are becoming a concern. In order to protect personal and device-generated information, we propose to use blockchain-based smart contracts for managing patients' information and medical devices. In detail, using blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, we create a remote healthcare system including healthcare provider (such as hospital), healthcare professionals (doctors) and patients. Health condition of patients is measured by sensors and such information is written into blockchain automatically. In addition, we propose a processing mechanism to store the medical device information efficiently and sparingly in accordance with health situation of patient. Concretely, we filter the data from sensors before deciding whether to write data into blockchain or not. Doing so we can reduce the size of blockchain as well as save amount of coins for transaction efficiently. However, the abnormal data from sensors will be written to blockchain immediately and trigger an emergency contact to doctor and hospital for on-time treatment. We have verified the proposed smart contract on Ethereum test environment called TESTRPC and implemented the system on an experimental environment with real devices. This system works well at small scale.",

A blockchain is updated via the consensus protocol that ensures a linear, unambiguous ordering of transactions. Blocks guarantee the integrity and consistency of the blockchain across a network of distributed nodes. Different blockchain applications use various consensus protocols for their working. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is one of them and it is a characteristic of a system that tolerates the class of failures known as the Byzantine Generals Problem. Hyperledger, Stellar, and Ripple are three blockchain application which uses BFT consensus. The best variant of BFT is Practical Byzantine Fault tolerance (PBFT). Hyperledger fabric with deterministic transactions can run on the top of PBFT. This paper focuses on a survey of various consensus mechanisms and makes a comparative study of Hyperledger fabric and Ethereum.

            "abstract": "Genomics data introduce a substantial computational burden as well as data privacy and ownership issues. Data sets generated by high-throughput sequencing platforms require immense amounts of computational resources to align to reference genomes and to call and annotate genomic variants. This problem is even more pronounced if reanalysis is needed for new versions of reference genomes, which may impose high loads to existing computational infrastructures. Additionally, after the compute-intensive analyses are completed, the results are either kept in centralized repositories with access control, or distributed among stakeholders using standard file transfer protocols. This imposes two main problems: (1) Centralized servers become gatekeepers of the data, essentially acting as an unnecessary mediator between the actual data owners and data users; and (2) servers may create single points of failure both in terms of service availability and data privacy. Therefore, there is a need for secure and decentralized platforms for data distribution with user-level data governance. A new technology, blockchain, may help ameliorate some of these problems. In broad terms, the blockchain technology enables decentralized, immutable, incorruptible public ledgers. In this Perspective, we aim to introduce current developments toward using blockchain to address several problems in omics, and to provide an outlook of possible future implications of the blockchain technology to life sciences.",

            "abstract": "As blockchain technologies mature and ecosystems over blockchain evolve, peers on blockchain networks often face situations in which they need to conduct voting for decision-making; as happened in the case of the DAO hard fork event on Ethereum. However, a natively built-in voting mechanism is not available on any of the existing blockchain platforms. Thus, the decision making either is delegated to a few network members who make such decisions offline or is dependent on third party online voting services. In both cases, peers directly or indirectly rely on trusted parties or centralized systems. This is against the basic decentralization principle of blockchain and exposes the election to frauds. To facilitate decision-making in a decentralized and secure manner, we propose a native blockchain voting protocol for peers to vote over their existing blockchain network without the need of any trusted or third party. Our protocol preserves end-to-end privacy and possesses desirable properties such as detectability and correctability against cheating. A reference implementation of our protocol on Hyperledger Fabric that demonstrates the validity and practical applicability of our protocol is also provided.",

Smart contracts are like classes that can be called by client applications outside the blockchain. Therefore it is possible to develop blockchain-oriented software (BOS) that implements part of the business logic in the blockchain by using smart contracts. Currently, there is no design standard to model BOS. Since modeling is an important part of designing a software, developers may struggle to plan their BOS. In this paper, we show three complementary modeling approaches based on well-known software engineering models and apply them to a BOS example. Our goal is to start the discussion on specialized blockchain modeling notations.",

            "abstract": "It is undeniable that artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain concepts are spreading at a phenomenal rate. Both technologies have distinct degree of technological complexity and multi-dimensional business implications. However, a common misunderstanding about blockchain concept, in particular, is that blockchain is decentralized and is not controlled by anyone. But the underlying development of a blockchain system is still attributed to a cluster of core developers. Take smart contract as an example, it is essentially a collection of codes (or functions) and data (or states) that are programmed and deployed on a blockchain (say, Ethereum) by different human programmers. It is thus, unfortunately, less likely to be free of loopholes and flaws. In this article, through a brief overview about how artificial intelligence could be used to deliver bug-free smart contract so as to achieve the goal of blockchain 2.0, we to emphasize that the blockchain implementation can be assisted or enhanced via various AI techniques. The alliance of AI and blockchain is expected to create numerous possibilities.",

This proposed architecture also introduces a new incentive mechanism for the creation of new blocks in the blockchain. The architecture is independent of any specific blockchain platforms and open to further extensions, hence potentially fits in with other electronic record systems that require protection against tampering and misuse.",

However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",
