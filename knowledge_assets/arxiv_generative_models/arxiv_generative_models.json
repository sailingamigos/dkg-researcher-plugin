                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Foundational vision-language models such as CLIP are becoming a new paradigm\nin vision, due to their excellent generalization abilities. However, adapting\nthese models for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalization\nremains a challenge. In literature, one branch of methods adapts CLIP by\nlearning prompts using visual information. While effective, most of these works\nrequire labeled data which is not practical, and often struggle to generalize\ntowards new datasets due to over-fitting on the source data. An alternative\napproach resorts to training-free methods by generating class descriptions from\nlarge language models (LLMs) and perform prompt ensembling. However, these\nmethods often generate class specific prompts that cannot be transferred to\nother classes, which incur higher costs by generating LLM descriptions for each\nclass separately. In this work, we propose to combine the strengths of these\nboth streams of methods by learning prompts using only text data derived from\nLLMs. As supervised training of prompts is not trivial due to absence of\nimages, we develop a training approach that allows prompts to extract rich\ncontextual knowledge from LLM data. Moreover, with LLM contextual data mapped\nwithin the learned prompts, it enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to new\nclasses and datasets potentially cutting the LLM prompt engineering cost. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns generalized\nprompts using text only data. We perform extensive evaluations on 4 benchmarks\nwhere our method improves over prior ensembling works while being competitive\nto those utilizing labeled images.

They are typically trained\nin-domain, forego large-scale 2D pre-training and outperform alternatives that\nfeaturize the posed RGB-D multiview images instead. The gap in performance\nbetween methods that consume posed images versus post-processed 3D point clouds\nhas fueled the belief that 2D and 3D perception require distinct model\narchitectures. In this paper, we challenge this view and propose ODIN\n(Omni-Dimensional INstance segmentation), a model that can segment and label\nboth 2D RGB images and 3D point clouds, using a transformer architecture that\nalternates between 2D within-view and 3D cross-view information fusion. Our\nmodel differentiates 2D and 3D feature operations through the positional\nencodings of the tokens involved, which capture pixel coordinates for 2D patch\ntokens and 3D coordinates for 3D feature tokens. ODIN achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on ScanNet200, Matterport3D and AI2THOR 3D instance segmentation\nbenchmarks, and competitive performance on ScanNet, S3DIS and COCO. It\noutperforms all previous works by a wide margin when the sensed 3D point cloud\nis used in place of the point cloud sampled from 3D mesh.

One major challenge is the mismatch\nbetween the noise predicted by a DDPM at each step and the desired clean image\nthat the metric function works well on. To address this problem, we propose\nCas-DM, a network architecture that cascades two network modules to effectively\napply metric functions to the diffusion model training.

The second cascaded module learns to predict the clean\nimage, thereby facilitating the metric function computation.

In this work, we study the problem of efficient\nand practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific\nmodels to enable newer capabilities. To this end, we propose CALM --\nComposition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention\nbetween models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.\nSalient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using'\nexisting LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing\nmodel weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and\n(iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings. We illustrate that augmenting\nPaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an\nabsolute improvement of up to 13\\% on tasks like translation into English and\narithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.

We perform high resolution simulations of the\ndynamical and non-linear (a)symmetron using the recently developed relativistic\nN-body code asevolution. By extensively testing the temporal and spatial\nconvergence of domain decompositioning and domain wall stability, we find\ncriteria and physical intuition for the convergence. We apply the resolution\ncriteria to run five high resolution, $1280^3$ grids and 500 Mpc/h boxsize,\nsimulations of the (a)symmetron and consider the behaviour of the scalar field\nand the domain walls in each scenario. We find the effect on the matter power\nspectra, the halo mass function and observables computed over the past\nlightcone of an observer such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and non-linear\nRees-Sciama effect (ISW-RS) and the lensing, compared to LCDM.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation and\nspread of toxic aggregates of tau protein. The progression of AD tau pathology\nis thought to be highly stereotyped, which is in part due to the fact that tau\ncan spread between regions via the white matter tracts that connect them.\nMathematically, this phenomenon has been described using models of \"network\ndiffusion\", where the rate of spread of tau between brain regions is\nproportional to its concentration gradient and the amount of white matter\nbetween them. Although these models can robustly predict the progression of\npathology in a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, an\nunder explored aspect of tau spreading is that it is governed not simply by\ndiffusion but also active transport along axonal microtubules. Spread can\ntherefore take on a directional bias, resulting in distinct patterns of\ndeposition, but current models struggle to capture this phenomenon. Recently,\nwe have developed a mathematical model of the axonal transport of toxic tau\nproteins that takes into account the effects tau exerts on the molecular\nmotors. Here we describe and implement a macroscopic version of this model,\nwhich we call the Network Transport Model (NTM). A key feature of this model is\nthat, while it predicts tau dynamics at a regional level, it is parameterized\nin terms of only microscopic processes such as aggregation and transport rates;\nthat is, differences in brain-wide tau progression can be explained by its\nmicroscopic properties. We provide numerical evidence that, as with the\ntwo-neuron model that the NTM extends, there are distinct and rich dynamics\nwith respect to the overall rate of spread and the staging of pathology when we\nsimulated the NTM on the hippocampal subnetwork. The theoretical insights\nprovided by the NTM have broad implications for understanding AD\npathophysiology more generally.",

The model accounts for\nphase transitions assumed to be at thermodynamical equilibrium and is based on\nan hydrodynamical Drift Flux Model (DFM) combined with a No Pressure Wave\napproximation of the momentum equation. The focus of this work is on the design\nof a robust discretization accounting for slanted and multibranch wells with\nthe ability to simulate both transient behavior such as well opening as well as\ncoupled simulations at the time scale of the reservoir. It is based on a\nstaggered finite volume scheme in space combined with a fully implicit Euler\ntime integration. The construction of consistent and stable numerical fluxes is\na key feature for a robust numerical method. It is achieved by combining a\nmonotone flux approximation for the phase superficial velocities with an upwind\napproximation of the phase molar fractions, density and enthalpy. In order to\nfacilitate the coupling of the well and reservoir models, the Newton\nlinearization accounts for the elimination of the hydrodynamical unknowns\nleading to Jacobian systems using the same primary unknowns than those of the\nreservoir model. The efficiency of our approach is investigated on both stand\nalone well test cases without and with cross flow, and on a fully coupled\nwell-reservoir simulation.",

                "abstract": "Learning 3D models of all animals on the Earth requires massively scaling up\nexisting solutions. With this ultimate goal in mind, we develop 3D-Fauna, an\napproach that learns a pan-category deformable 3D animal model for more than\n100 animal species jointly. One crucial bottleneck of modeling animals is the\nlimited availability of training data, which we overcome by simply learning\nfrom 2D Internet images. We show that prior category-specific attempts fail to\ngeneralize to rare species with limited training images. We address this\nchallenge by introducing the Semantic Bank of Skinned Models (SBSM), which\nautomatically discovers a small set of base animal shapes by combining\ngeometric inductive priors with semantic knowledge implicitly captured by an\noff-the-shelf self-supervised feature extractor. To train such a model, we also\ncontribute a new large-scale dataset of diverse animal species. At inference\ntime, given a single image of any quadruped animal, our model reconstructs an\narticulated 3D mesh in a feed-forward fashion within seconds.",

                "abstract": "Numerous developments in the recent literature show the promising potential\nof deep learning in obtaining numerical solutions to partial differential\nequations (PDEs) beyond the reach of current numerical solvers. However,\ndata-driven neural operators all suffer from the same problem: the data needed\nto train a network depends on classical numerical solvers such as finite\ndifference or finite element, among others. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach to generating synthetic functional training data that does not require\nsolving a PDE numerically. The way we do this is simple: we draw a large number\n$N$ of independent and identically distributed `random functions' $u_j$ from\nthe underlying solution space (e.g., $H_0^1(\\Omega)$) in which we know the\nsolution lies according to classical theory. We then plug each such random\ncandidate solution into the equation and get a corresponding right-hand side\nfunction $f_j$ for the equation, and consider $(f_j, u_j)_{j=1}^N$ as\nsupervised training data for learning the underlying inverse problem $f\n\\rightarrow u$. This `backwards' approach to generating training data only\nrequires derivative computations, in contrast to standard `forward' approaches,\nwhich require a numerical PDE solver, enabling us to generate a large number of\nsuch data points quickly and efficiently. While the idea is simple, we hope\nthat this method will expand the potential for developing neural PDE solvers\nthat do not depend on classical numerical solvers.",

We propose a\nnew model providing a pNG DM by introducing two Standard-Model-singlet complex\nscalars with the same charges of a dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. They are also\ncharged under a $U(1)$ global symmetry corresponding to their relative phase\nrotations, which is explicitly broken by a soft-breaking term in the scalar\npotential. The both $U(1)$ symmetries are spontaneously broken by their vacuum\nexpectation values, giving rise to one real pNG boson. We also introduce a\ndiscrete $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging the two scalars to stabilize the\npNG boson as DM. It is shown that this model reproduces the DM abundance\nconsistently with the current bound from the direct detection experiments. The\nmodel has a gauge kinetic mixing between the dark and $U(1)_Y$ gauge fields,\nwhich allows the dark gauge boson to decay even with a relatively light mass\nand prevents it from being an additional DM component. The Landau pole is\navoided thanks to the small gauge coupling constant. In addition, a DM pair\ndominantly annihilates into a pair of the dark gauge bosons if the gauge boson\nmass is lighter than the DM mass, and thus its cross section has significantly\ndifferent parameter dependence from other pNG DM models. We also calculate the\nDM-nucleon scattering cross section at the loop level. It turns out that it is\nnecessary to probe region covered by the neutrino fog in order to test this\nmodel.",

The signal decay curve was then\nquantified in terms of area under the curve ($AUC$) parameters. Denoised images\nwere assessed in terms of blind image quality metrics, and correlations between\ntheir derived parameters in parotid glands with radiotherapy dose levels. We\nassessed the method's ability to recover artificial pseudokernels which had\nbeen applied to denoised images. $AUC$ parameters were compared with the\napparent diffusion coefficient ($ADC$), biexponential, and triexponential model\nparameters, in terms of their correlations with dose, and their relative\ncontributions to the total variance of the dataset, obtained through singular\nvalue decomposition.

Remarkably, such a huge energy-deposition\nshould result in an almost complete envelope ejection and hence a strong sign\nof interaction, but the observed SNe with precursors show in fact typical\nproperties among the interacting SNe. More generally, the observed luminosity\nof $10^{40-42}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$ is shown to be challenging for a single SN\nprogenitor. To resolve these tensions, we propose a scenario where the\nprogenitor is in a binary system with a compact object (CO), and an outburst\nfrom the star leads to a super-Eddington accretion onto the CO. We show that\nfor sufficiently short separations, outbursts with moderate initial kinetic\nenergies of $10^{46}$--$10^{47}$ erg can be energized by the accreting CO so\nthat their radiative output can be consistent with the observed precursors. We\ndiscuss the implications of our model in relation to CO binaries detectable\nwith Gaia and gravitational wave detectors.",

                "abstract": "The auditory system of humanoid robots has gained increased attention in\nrecent years. This system typically acquires the surrounding sound field by\nmeans of a microphone array. Signals acquired by the array are then processed\nusing various methods. One of the widely applied methods is direction of\narrival estimation. The conventional direction of arrival estimation methods\nassume that the array is fixed at a given position during the estimation.\nHowever, this is not necessarily true for an array installed on a moving\nhumanoid robot. The array motion, if not accounted for appropriately, can\nintroduce a significant error in the estimated direction of arrival. The\ncurrent paper presents a signal model that takes the motion into account. Based\non this model, two processing methods are proposed. The first one compensates\nfor the motion of the robot. The second method is applicable to periodic\nsignals and utilizes the motion in order to enhance the performance to a level\nbeyond that of a stationary array. Numerical simulations and an experimental\nstudy are provided, demonstrating that the motion compensation method almost\neliminates the motion-related error. It is also demonstrated that by using the\nmotion-based enhancement method it is possible to improve the direction of\narrival estimation performance, as compared to that obtained when using a\nstationary array.",

However, their unique combination of graphical\nelements (e.g., bars, lines) and textual components (e.g., labels, legends)\nposes challenges for general-purpose multimodal models. While vision-language\nmodels trained on chart data excel in comprehension, they struggle with\ngeneralization and require task-specific fine-tuning. To address these\nchallenges, we propose ChartAssistant, a chart-based vision-language model for\nuniversal chart comprehension and reasoning.

It undergoes a two-stage training process, starting\nwith pre-training on chart-to-table parsing to align chart and text, followed\nby multitask instruction-following fine-tuning. This approach enables\nChartAssistant to achieve competitive performance across various chart tasks\nwithout task-specific fine-tuning.

Previous works\npropose the use of MDS codes to treat the responses from malicious workers as\nerrors and correct them using the error-correction properties of the code. This\ncomes at the expense of increasing the replication, i.e., the number of workers\neach partial gradient is computed by. In this work, we propose a way to reduce\nthe replication to $s+1$ instead of $2s+1$ in the presence of $s$ malicious\nworkers. Our method detects erroneous inputs from the malicious workers,\ntransforming them into erasures. This comes at the expense of $s$ additional\nlocal computations at the main node and additional rounds of light\ncommunication between the main node and the workers. We define a general\nframework and give fundamental limits for fractional repetition data\nallocations. Our scheme is optimal in terms of replication and local\ncomputation and incurs a communication cost that is asymptotically, in the size\nof the dataset, a multiplicative factor away from the derived bound. We\nfurthermore show how additional redundancy can be exploited to reduce the\nnumber of local computations and communication cost, or, alternatively,\ntolerate straggling workers.",

                "abstract": "Clinician must write a lengthy summary each time a patient is discharged from\nthe hospital. This task is time-consuming due to the sheer number of unique\nclinical concepts covered in the admission. Identifying and covering salient\nentities is vital for the summary to be clinically useful. We fine-tune\nopen-source LLMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Zephyr-7B-\\b{eta}) on the task and\nfind that they generate incomplete and unfaithful summaries. To increase entity\ncoverage, we train a smaller, encoder-only model to predict salient entities,\nwhich are treated as content-plans to guide the LLM. To encourage the LLM to\nfocus on specific mentions in the source notes, we propose SPEER:\nSentence-level Planning via Embedded Entity Retrieval. Specifically, we mark\neach salient entity span with special \"{{ }}\" boundary tags and instruct the\nLLM to retrieve marked spans before generating each sentence. Sentence-level\nplanning acts as a form of state tracking in that the model is explicitly\nrecording the entities it uses. We fine-tune Mistral and Zephyr variants on a\nlarge-scale, diverse dataset of ~167k in-patient hospital admissions and\nevaluate on 3 datasets. SPEER shows gains in both coverage and faithfulness\nmetrics over non-guided and guided baselines.",

Chest\nX-ray (CXR) imaging is a fundamental diagnostic tool, but traditional analysis\nrelies on time-intensive expert evaluation. Recently, deep learning has shown\nimmense potential for automating pneumonia detection from CXRs. This paper\nexplores applying neural networks to improve CXR-based pneumonia diagnosis. We\ndeveloped a novel model fusing Convolution Neural networks (CNN) and Vision\nTransformer networks via model-level ensembling. Our fusion architecture\ncombines a ResNet34 variant and a Multi-Axis Vision Transformer small model.\nBoth base models are initialized with ImageNet pre-trained weights. The output\nlayers are removed, and features are combined using a flattening layer before\nfinal classification. Experiments used the Kaggle pediatric pneumonia dataset\ncontaining 1,341 normal and 3,875 pneumonia CXR images. We compared our model\nagainst standalone ResNet34, Vision Transformer, and Swin Transformer Tiny\nbaseline models using identical training procedures. Extensive data\naugmentation, Adam optimization, learning rate warmup, and decay were employed.\nThe fusion model achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.87%, surpassing the\nbaselines. We also attained excellent sensitivity, specificity, kappa score,\nand positive predictive value. Confusion matrix analysis confirms fewer\nmisclassifications.

Due to the directional nature of\nproteins as polymers with distinct ends, forces have the potential to influence\nprotein conformational dynamics in a direction-dependent manner. In this study,\nwe employed force-probe molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the\nimpact of pulling a peptide through a confined environment versus pushing it in\nthe same direction. Our model involves a carbon nanotube and one of three\ndecapeptides with varying amino acid sequences. The simulations reveal that the\ndifference between pulling the C-terminus and pushing the N-terminus is\nrelatively minor when considering the conformational ensembles of the peptides.\nThe loading rate of the force probe and the amino acid sequence of the peptide\nplay a more important role. However, the application of force to the peptide\nsignificantly influences the relative motion of the peptides with respect to\nthe nanotube. Pulling the peptide results in a smoother translocation through\nthe nanotube compared to pushing, although the internal conformational dynamics\nof the peptide add complexity in either case. Our findings shed light on how\nshort peptides navigate confined spaces within the cellular environment,\nemphasizing the importance of force-probe simulation studies in understanding\nthese processes.",

Furthermore, we will formalize and\nunify the diverse solution approaches to increase generalization, and overcome\noverfitting in state-action value functions. We believe our study can provide a\ncompact systematic unified analysis for the current advancements in deep\nreinforcement learning, and help to construct robust deep neural policies with\nimproved generalization abilities.",

However,\nthe widely observed modality gap in the latent space of CLIP harms the\nperformance of zero-shot captioning by breaking the alignment between paired\nimage-text features. To address this issue, we conduct an analysis on the CLIP\nlatent space which leads to two findings. Firstly, we observe that the CLIP's\nvisual feature of image subregions can achieve closer proximity to the paired\ncaption due to the inherent information loss in text descriptions. In addition,\nwe show that the modality gap between a paired image-text can be empirically\nmodeled as a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Motivated by the findings, we\npropose a novel zero-shot image captioning framework with text-only training to\nreduce the modality gap. In particular, we introduce a subregion feature\naggregation to leverage local region information, which produces a compact\nvisual representation for matching text representation. Moreover, we\nincorporate a noise injection and CLIP reranking strategy to boost captioning\nperformance. We also extend our framework to build a zero-shot VQA pipeline,\ndemonstrating its generality. Through extensive experiments on common\ncaptioning and VQA datasets such as MSCOCO, Flickr30k and VQAV2, we show that\nour method achieves remarkable performance improvements.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "The globalization of the Integrated Circuit (IC) supply chain, driven by\ntime-to-market and cost considerations, has made ICs vulnerable to hardware\nTrojans (HTs). Against this threat, a promising approach is to use Machine\nLearning (ML)-based side-channel analysis, which has the advantage of being a\nnon-intrusive method, along with efficiently detecting HTs under golden\nchip-free settings. In this paper, we question the trustworthiness of ML-based\nHT detection via side-channel analysis. We introduce a HT obfuscation (HTO)\napproach to allow HTs to bypass this detection method. Rather than\ntheoretically misleading the model by simulated adversarial traces, a key\naspect of our approach is the design and implementation of adversarial noise as\npart of the circuitry, alongside the HT. We detail HTO methodologies for ASICs\nand FPGAs, and evaluate our approach using TrustHub benchmark. Interestingly,\nwe found that HTO can be implemented with only a single transistor for ASIC\ndesigns to generate adversarial power traces that can fool the defense with\n100% efficiency. We also efficiently implemented our approach on a Spartan 6\nXilinx FPGA using 2 different variants: (i) DSP slices-based, and (ii)\nring-oscillator-based design. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of\ncountermeasures like spectral domain analysis, and we show that an adaptive\nattacker can still design evasive HTOs by constraining the design with a\nspectral noise budget. In addition, while adversarial training (AT) offers\nhigher protection against evasive HTs, AT models suffer from a considerable\nutility loss, potentially rendering them unsuitable for such security\napplication. We believe this research represents a significant step in\nunderstanding and exploiting ML vulnerabilities in a hardware security context,\nand we make all resources and designs openly available online:\nhttps://dev.d18uu4lqwhbmka.amplifyapp.com",

Our analysis is carried with respect to the involved parameters\nincluding the halo total mass $M$ and the galaxy's lengthscale $a_0$.\nConcretly, we investigate the dark matter impact on the effective potential and\nthe photon sphere. In particular, we find that the lengthscale $a_0$ controles\nsuch potential values. Indeed, for low $a_0$ values, we find that the halo\ntotal mass $M$ decreases the potential values significantly while for high\n$a_0$ values such impact is diluted. Regarding the shadow aspects, we show that\nthe shadow size is much smaller for high values of $a_0$ while the opposite\neffect is observed when the halo total mass $M$ is increased. By comparing our\ncase to the slowly rotating case, we notice that the former exhibits a shadow\nshifted from its center to the left side. Finally, we compute the deflection\nangle in the weak-limit approximation and inspect the dark matter parameters\ninfluence.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "One of the primary impediments hindering the widespread acceptance of\nautonomous vehicles (AVs) among pedestrians is their limited comprehension of\nAVs. This study employs virtual reality (VR) to provide pedestrians with an\nimmersive environment for engaging with and comprehending AVs during unmarked\nmidblock multilane crossings. Diverse AV driving behaviors were modeled to\nexhibit negotiation behavior with a yellow signal indication or non-yielding\nbehavior with a blue signal indication. This paper aims to investigate the\nimpact of various factors, such as AV behavior and signaling, pedestrian past\nbehavior, etc., on pedestrians' perception change of AVs. Before and after the\nVR experiment, participants completed surveys assessing their perception of\nAVs, focusing on two main aspects: \"Attitude\" and \"System Effectiveness.\" The\nWilcoxon signed-rank test results demonstrated that both pedestrians' overall\nattitude score toward AVs and trust in the effectiveness of AV systems\nsignificantly increased following the VR experiment. Notably, individuals who\nexhibited a greater trust in the yellow signals were more inclined to display a\nhigher attitude score toward AVs and to augment their trust in the\neffectiveness of AV systems. This indicates that the design of the yellow\nsignal instills pedestrians with greater confidence in their interactions with\nAVs. Further, pedestrians who exhibit more aggressive crossing behavior are\nless likely to change their perception towards AVs as compared to those\npedestrians with more positive crossing behaviors. It is concluded that\nintegrating this paper's devised AV behavior and signaling within an immersive\nVR setting facilitated pedestrian engagement with AVs, thereby changing their\nperception of AVs.",

However, this advancement presents\nconsiderably greater challenges in detecting the authenticity of such content.\nExisting deepfake detection datasets and methods often fall short in\neffectively capturing the extensive range of emerging deepfakes and offering\nsatisfactory explanatory information for detection. To address the significant\nissue, this paper introduces a deepfake database (DFLIP-3K) for the development\nof convincing and explainable deepfake detection. It encompasses about 300K\ndiverse deepfake samples from approximately 3K generative models, which boasts\nthe largest number of deepfake models in the literature. Moreover, it collects\naround 190K linguistic footprints of these deepfakes. The two distinguished\nfeatures enable DFLIP-3K to develop a benchmark that promotes progress in\nlinguistic profiling of deepfakes, which includes three sub-tasks namely\ndeepfake detection, model identification, and prompt prediction. The deepfake\nmodel and prompt are two essential components of each deepfake, and thus\ndissecting them linguistically allows for an invaluable exploration of\ntrustworthy and interpretable evidence in deepfake detection, which we believe\nis the key for the next-generation deepfake detection.

                "abstract": "At present, experimental studies of the semileptonic $B-$ meson decays at\nBaBar, Belle and LHCb, especially for the observables associated with the $b\n\\rightarrow c$ transitions, show the deviation from the Standard Model (SM)\npredictions, consequently, providing a handy tool to probe the possible new\nphysics (NP). In this context, we have first revisited the impact of recently\nmeasurements of $R({D^{(*)}})$ and $R(\\Lambda_c)$ on the parametric space of\nthe NP scenarios. In addition, we have included the $R(J/\\psi)$ and the\n$R(X_c)$ data in the analysis and found that their influence on the best-fit\npoint and the parametric space is mild. Using the recent HFLAV data, after\nvalidating the well established sum rule of $R(\\Lambda_c)$, we derived the\nsimilar sum rule for $R(J/\\psi)$. Furthermore, we have modified the correlation\namong the different observables, giving us their interesting interdependence.\nFinally, to discriminate the various NP scenarios, we have plotted the\ndifferent angular observables and their ratios for $B \\to D^* \\tau\\nu_\\tau$\nagainst the transfer momentum square $\\left(q^2\\right)$, using the $1\\sigma$\nand $2\\sigma$ parametric space of considered NP scenarios. To see the clear\ninfluence of NP on the amplitude of the angular observables, we have also\ncalculated their numerical values in different $q^2$ bins and shown them\nthrough the bar plots. We hope their precise measurements will help to\ndiscriminate various NP scenarios.",

In\nthis work, we investigate its structural stability using an advanced\nsoft-sphere-discrete-element-model code, DEMBody, which is integrated with\nbonded-aggregate models to simulate highly irregular boulders. The asteroid\nbody is numerically constructed by tens of thousands particles, and then is\nslowly spin up until structural failure. Rubble piles with different\nmorphologies, grain size distributions and structures are investigated. We find\na 2016 HO3 shaped granular asteroid would undergo tensile failure at higher\ncohesive strengths as opposed to shear failure in lower strengths, regardless\nof its shape and constituent grain size ratio. Such a failure mode transition\nis consistent with the priority between the Maximum Tensile Stress criterion\ncriterion and the Drucker-Prager criterion. Therefore, previous works that\nsolely considered the Drucker-Prager failure criterion have underestimated the\nminimal cohesion strength required for fast-rotating asteroids. We predict that\nthe high spin rate of asteroid 2016 HO3 requires a surface cohesion over ~1 Pa\nand a bulk cohesion over ~10-20 Pa. Through comparing these strength conditions\nwith the latest data from asteroid missions, we suggest a higher likelihood of\na monolithic structure over a typical rubble pile structure. However, the\npossibility of the latter cannot be completely ruled out. In addition, the\nasteroid's surface could retain a loose regolith layer globally or only near\nits poles, which could be the target for sampling of Tianwen-2 mission.",

                "abstract": "Data heterogeneity, characterized by disparities in local data distribution\nacross clients, poses a significant challenge in federated learning.\nSubstantial efforts have been devoted to addressing the heterogeneity in local\nlabel distribution. As minority classes suffer from worse accuracy due to\noverfitting on local imbalanced data, prior methods often incorporate\nclass-balanced learning techniques during local training. Despite the improved\nmean accuracy across all classes, we observe that empty classes-referring to\ncategories absent from a client's data distribution-are still not well\nrecognized. This paper introduces FedED, a novel approach in heterogeneous\nfederated learning that integrates both empty-class distillation and logit\nsuppression simultaneously. Specifically, empty-class distillation leverages\nknowledge distillation during local training on each client to retain essential\ninformation related to empty classes from the global model. Moreover, logit\nsuppression directly penalizes network logits for non-label classes,\neffectively addressing misclassifications in minority classes that may be\nbiased toward majority classes. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of\nFedED, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets\nwith varying degrees of label distribution shift.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of image resolution variation for the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM). SAM, known for its zero-shot generalizability,\nexhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image\nsizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt\nstructure modifications, hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior\nknowledge. Besides, such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete\nretraining of the model, which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for\ndeployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we reformulate this issue as\na length extrapolation problem, where token sequence length varies while\nmaintaining a consistent patch size for images of different sizes. To this end,\nwe propose Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's\nadaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for\nstructure modifications. Firstly, we introduce a new scaling factor to ensure\nconsistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the token\nsequence length changes. Secondly, we present a bias-mode attention mask that\nallows each token to prioritize neighboring information, mitigating the impact\nof untrained distant information. Our BA-SAM demonstrates efficacy in two\nscenarios: zero-shot and fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation on diverse datasets,\nincluding DIS5K, DUTS, ISIC, COD10K, and COCO, reveals its ability to\nsignificantly mitigate performance degradation in the zero-shot setting and\nachieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning. Furthermore, we\npropose a generalized model and benchmark, showcasing BA-SAM's generalizability\nacross all four datasets simultaneously.",

Fortunately, the rapid advancement in neural networks,\nespecially neural operator learning mappings between function spaces, has\nintroduced novel approaches to tackle these challenges via data-driven\nmodeling. In this paper, we propose a Fourier neural operator-based\nfluid-structure interaction solver (FNO-based FSI solver) for efficient\nsimulation of FSI problems, where the solid solver based on the finite\ndifference method is seamlessly integrated with the Fourier neural operator to\npredict incompressible flow using the immersed boundary method. We analyze the\nperformance of the FNO-based FSI solver in the following three situations:\ntraining data with or without the steady state, training method with one-step\nlabel or multi-step labels, and prediction in interpolation or extrapolation.\nWe find that the best performance for interpolation is achieved by training the\noperator with multi-step labels using steady-state data.

These problems involve\ndetermining linear parameters that are specific to each dataset while ensuring\nthat the nonlinear parameters remain consistent across all datasets. A\nwell-established approach for solving such problems is the variable projection\nalgorithm introduced by Golub and LeVeque, which effectively reduces a\nseparable problem to its nonlinear component. However, this algorithm assumes\nthat the datasets have equal sizes and identical auxiliary model parameters.\nThis article is motivated by a real-world remote sensing application where\nthese assumptions do not apply. Consequently, we propose a generalized\nalgorithm that extends the original theory to overcome these limitations. The\nnew algorithm has been implemented and tested using both synthetic and real\nsatellite data for atmospheric carbon dioxide retrievals. It has also been\ncompared to conventional state-of-the-art solvers, and its advantages are\nthoroughly discussed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nalgorithm significantly outperforms all other methods in terms of computation\ntime, while maintaining comparable accuracy and stability.

The\nnetwork is trained on a data set that consists of randomly selected points in\nthe physical domain and its boundary. PINNs have been successfully applied to\nsolve various problems described by PDEs with boundary conditions. The loss\nfunction in traditional PINNs is based on the strong residuals of the PDEs.\nThis loss function in PINNs is generally not robust with respect to the true\nerror. The loss function in PINNs can be far from the true error, which makes\nthe training process more difficult. In particular, we do not know if the\ntraining process has already converged to the solution with the required\naccuracy. This is especially true if we do not know the exact solution, so we\ncannot estimate the true error during the training. This paper introduces a\ndifferent way of defining the loss function. It incorporates the residual and\nthe inverse of the Gram matrix, computed using the energy norm. We test our\nRPINN algorithm on two Laplace problems and one advection-diffusion problem in\ntwo spatial dimensions. We conclude that RPINN is a robust method. The proposed\nloss coincides well with the true error of the solution, as measured in the\nenergy norm.

To tackle this problem, the constraints are\nexpressed as differences of convex functions, enabling the application of the\nDCCP package. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the K-DDCCP\nalgorithm in solving binary classification problems. Overall, this work\ncontributes to the field of morphological neural networks by proposing an\nalgorithm that extends the capabilities of the SLMP model.",

                "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in Knowledge Graph\nCompletion (KGC) by modelling how entities and relations interact in recent\nyears. However, the explanation of the predicted facts has not caught the\nnecessary attention. Proper explanations for the results of GNN-based KGC\nmodels increase model transparency and help researchers develop more reliable\nmodels. Existing practices for explaining KGC tasks rely on\ninstance/subgraph-based approaches, while in some scenarios, paths can provide\nmore user-friendly and interpretable explanations. Nonetheless, the methods for\ngenerating path-based explanations for KGs have not been well-explored. To\naddress this gap, we propose Power-Link, the first path-based KGC explainer\nthat explores GNN-based models. We design a novel simplified graph-powering\ntechnique, which enables the generation of path-based explanations with a fully\nparallelisable and memory-efficient training scheme. We further introduce three\nnew metrics for quantitative evaluation of the explanations, together with a\nqualitative human evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Power-Link\noutperforms the SOTA baselines in interpretability, efficiency, and\nscalability.",

Patterned textures inspection, particularly in\nthe context of fabric defect detection, is indeed a widely encountered use\ncase. This task involves handling a diverse spectrum of colors and textile\ntypes, encompassing a wide range of fabrics. Given the extensive variability in\ncolors, textures, and defect types, fabric defect detection poses a complex and\nchallenging problem in the field of patterned textures inspection. In this\narticle, we propose a knowledge distillation-based approach tailored\nspecifically for addressing the challenge of unsupervised anomaly detection in\ntextures resembling fabrics. Our method aims to redefine the recently\nintroduced reverse distillation approach, which advocates for an\nencoder-decoder design to mitigate classifier bias and to prevent the student\nfrom reconstructing anomalies. In this study, we present a new reverse\ndistillation technique for the specific task of fabric defect detection. Our\napproach involves a meticulous design selection that strategically highlights\nhigh-level features. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach both in\nterms of performance and inference speed, we conducted a series of experiments\non multiple texture datasets, including MVTEC AD, AITEX, and TILDA, alongside\nconducting experiments on a dataset acquired from a textile manufacturing\nfacility. The main contributions of this paper are the following: a robust\ntexture anomaly detector utilizing a reverse knowledge-distillation technique\nsuitable for both anomaly detection and domain generalization and a novel\ndataset encompassing a diverse range of fabrics and defects.",

The buoys are designed to record and transmit the full time\nseries of surface acceleration at $52$ Hz. The buoy uses the cellular network\nto transfer data and position (up to $80$ km from the base station). This\nreduces costs and increases band-width. The low cost and low weight permits the\nbuoys be deployed easily, and in arrays in areas where satellite and wave\nmodels struggle to resolve wave and current interaction. The buoys are tested\nin a wave-flume, the open water and in the breaking waves of the surf. The\nconditions range from calm to significant wave heights exceeding $7$ m and\ncrashing breakers with accelerations exceeding $10$ g. The high sample rate\ncaptures the impulse of breaking waves, and allow them to be studied in detail.\nBreaking waves are measured and quantified in the open water. We measure\nbreaking waves in the surf and recover the trajectory of waves breaking in the\nfield to a higher degree than previously done. The time series of surface\nelevation, and accurate positioning, permits adjacent buoys to be correlated in\na coherent phase-resolved way.

PEGASUS allows the composition of new scenes by\nmerging the respective underlying Gaussian Splatting point cloud of an\nenvironment with one or multiple objects.

In alignment with the\nprotection of marine resources and sustainable fishing, this study proposes to\nadvance fish classification techniques that support identifying protected fish\nspecies using state-of-the-art machine learning. We use a custom modification\nof the MobileNet model to design a lightweight classifier called M-MobileNet\nthat is capable of running on limited hardware. As part of the study, we\ncompiled a labeled dataset of 37,462 images of fish found in the waters of the\nIndonesian archipelago. The proposed model is trained on the dataset to\nclassify images of the captured fish into their species and give\nrecommendations on whether they are consumable or not. Our modified MobileNet\nmodel uses only 50\\% of the top layer parameters with about 42% GTX 860M\nutility and achieves up to 97% accuracy in fish classification and determining\nits consumability. Given the limited computing capacity available on many\nfishing vessels, the proposed model provides a practical solution to on-site\nfish classification.

We find that if an impurity corresponds to varying a nonzero matrix\nelement of the lattice Hamiltonian, regardless the element represents hopping,\nchemical potential, pairing, etc, then the average topological marker is\nconserved. However, if there are many strong impurities and the average\ndistance between them is shorter than a correlation length, then the average\nmarker is no longer conserved. In addition, strong and dense impurities can be\nused to continuously interpolate between one topological phase and another.

Our analysis demonstrates that,\nconcerning the Hawking-Page phase transition, while a dominant kinetic path in\nthe phase space from the large SAdS black hole to the thermal AdS space is\npresent, there is no kinetic path for the inverse process.

In this paper, we systematically study\ntopological superconducting (TSC) phases in monolayer NbSe2 through mixing\non-site s-wave pairing (ps) with nearest-neighbor pairing (psA1) based on a\ntight-binding model. We observe rich phases with both fixed and sensitive Chern\nnumbers (CNs) depending on the chemical potential ({\\mu}) and out-of-plane\nmagnetic field (Vz). As the psA1 increases, the TSC phase manifests matching\nand mismatching features according to whether there is a bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence (BBC). Strikingly, the introduction of mixed wave pairing\nsignificantly reduces the critical Vz to form TSC phases compared with the pure\ns-wave paring. Moreover, the TSC phase can be modulated even at Vz=0 under\nappropriate {\\mu} and psA1, which is identified by the robust topological edge\nstates (TESs) of ribbons. Additionally, the mixed pairing influences the\nhybridization of bulk and edge states, resulting in a matching/mismatching BBC\nwith localized/oscillating TESs on the ribbon. Our finding is helpful for the\nrealization of TSC states in experiment, as well as designing and regulating\nTSC materials.",

Due to the dynamic nature of human behaviours, continual learning\npromises HAR systems that are tailored to users' needs.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "In this work, we introduce L3Cube-IndicNews, a multilingual text\nclassification corpus aimed at curating a high-quality dataset for Indian\nregional languages, with a specific focus on news headlines and articles. We\nhave centered our work on 10 prominent Indic languages, including Hindi,\nBengali, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada, Odia, Malayalam, and\nPunjabi. Each of these news datasets comprises 10 or more classes of news\narticles. L3Cube-IndicNews offers 3 distinct datasets tailored to handle\ndifferent document lengths that are classified as: Short Headlines\nClassification (SHC) dataset containing the news headline and news category,\nLong Document Classification (LDC) dataset containing the whole news article\nand the news category, and Long Paragraph Classification (LPC) containing\nsub-articles of the news and the news category. We maintain consistent labeling\nacross all 3 datasets for in-depth length-based analysis. We evaluate each of\nthese Indic language datasets using 4 different models including monolingual\nBERT, multilingual Indic Sentence BERT (IndicSBERT), and IndicBERT. This\nresearch contributes significantly to expanding the pool of available text\nclassification datasets and also makes it possible to develop topic\nclassification models for Indian regional languages. This also serves as an\nexcellent resource for cross-lingual analysis owing to the high overlap of\nlabels among languages. The datasets and models are shared publicly at\nhttps://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp",

                "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) integrate sensing, perception, drive\ncontrol, and several other critical tasks in autonomous vehicles, motivating\nresearch into techniques for assessing their safety. While there are several\napproaches for testing and analysing them in high-fidelity simulators, ADSs may\nstill encounter additional critical scenarios beyond those covered once they\nare deployed on real roads. An additional level of confidence can be\nestablished by monitoring and enforcing critical properties when the ADS is\nrunning. Existing work, however, is only able to monitor simple safety\nproperties (e.g., avoidance of collisions) and is limited to blunt enforcement\nmechanisms such as hitting the emergency brakes. In this work, we propose\nREDriver, a general and modular approach to runtime enforcement, in which users\ncan specify a broad range of properties (e.g., national traffic laws) in a\nspecification language based on signal temporal logic (STL). REDriver monitors\nthe planned trajectory of the ADS based on a quantitative semantics of STL, and\nuses a gradient-driven algorithm to repair the trajectory when a violation of\nthe specification is likely. We implemented REDriver for two versions of Apollo\n(i.e., a popular ADS), and subjected it to a benchmark of violations of Chinese\ntraffic laws. The results show that REDriver significantly improves Apollo's\nconformance to the specification with minimal overhead.",

Here we provide a comprehensive picture\nhow local dissipation due to effective chemical events manifests on large\nscales in active matter. We start from a microscopic model for a single\ncatalytic particle involving explicit solute molecules and show that it\nundergoes directed motion. Leveraging stochastic thermodynamics, we calculate\nthe average entropy production rate for interacting particles. We then show how\nthe model of active Brownian particles emerges in a certain limit and we\ndetermine the entropy production rate on the level of the hydrodynamic\nequations. Our results augment the model of active Brownian particles with\nrigorous expressions for the dissipation that cannot be inferred from their\nequations of motion, and we illustrate consequences for wall aggregation and\nmotility-induced phase separation.

Moreover, in regions\nof strong transverse gradients, the reflection of Alfv\\'en waves at the\ntransition region is greatly reduced, supporting results from recent studies.\nFinally, we investigated the efficiency of the loop structuring at absorbing\nenergy flux from externally driven waves and find that the loop is extremely\neffective at channelling wave energy flux to the loop apex in the corona; in\nsome cases, it can absorb over a third of the externally driven wave energy\nflux. Conclusions. These results may have important consequences in the context\nof decayless loop oscillations as they suggest that the oscillations are driven\nby acoustic waves outside of the existing loop structure.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains. Caused by\nfactors such as trends, seasonality, or irregular fluctuations, time series\noften exhibits non-stationary. It obstructs stable feature propagation through\ndeep layers, disrupts feature distributions, and complicates learning data\ndistribution changes. As a result, many existing models struggle to capture the\nunderlying patterns, leading to degraded forecasting performance. In this\nstudy, we tackle the challenge of non-stationarity in time series forecasting\nwith our proposed framework called U-Mixer. By combining Unet and Mixer,\nU-Mixer effectively captures local temporal dependencies between different\npatches and channels separately to avoid the influence of distribution\nvariations among channels, and merge low- and high-levels features to obtain\ncomprehensive data representations. The key contribution is a novel\nstationarity correction method, explicitly restoring data distribution by\nconstraining the difference in stationarity between the data before and after\nmodel processing to restore the non-stationarity information, while ensuring\nthe temporal dependencies are preserved. Through extensive experiments on\nvarious real-world time series datasets, U-Mixer demonstrates its effectiveness\nand robustness, and achieves 14.5\\% and 7.7\\% improvements over\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

                "abstract": "Integrating robot systems into manufacturing lines is a time-consuming\nprocess. In the era of digitalization, the research and development of new\ntechnologies is crucial for improving integration processes. Numerous\nchallenges, including the lack of standardization, as well as intricate\nstakeholder relationships, complicate the process of robotic systems\nintegration. This process typically consists of acquisition, integration, and\ndeployment of the robot systems. This thesis focuses on three areas that help\nautomate and simplify robotic systems integration. In the first area, related\nto acquisition, a constraint-based configurator is demonstrated that resolves\ncompatibility challenges between robot devices, and automates the configuration\nprocess. This reduces the risk of integrating incompatible devices and\ndecreases the need for experts during the configuration phase. In the second\narea, related to integration, the interoperable modeling format, Unified Robot\nDescription Format (URDF), is investigated, where a detailed analysis is\nperformed, revealing significant inconsistencies and critical improvements.\nThis format is widely used for kinematic modeling and 3D visualization of\nrobots, and its models can be reused across simulation tools. Improving this\nformat benefits a wide range of users, including robotics engineers,\nresearchers, and students. In the third area, related to deployment, Digital\nTwins (DTs) for robot systems are explored, as these improve efficiency and\nreduce downtime. A comprehensive literature review of DTs is conducted, and a\ncase study of modular robot systems is developed. This research can accelerate\nthe adoption of DTs in the robotics industry. These insights and approaches\nimprove the process of robotic systems integration, offering valuable\ncontributions that future research can build upon, ultimately driving\nefficiency, and reducing costs.",

                "abstract": "This work reports topological extraordinary properties of sound transmission\nthrough topological states in sonic crystals denominated Suzuki phase,\nconsisting of a rectangular lattice of vacancies created in a triangular\nlattice. These low-symmetry crystals exhibit unique properties due to the\nembedded lattice of vacancies. A generalized folding method explains the band\nstructure and the quasi-type-II Dirac point in the Suzuki phase, which is\nrelated to the underlying triangular lattice. In analogy to the acoustic valley\nHall effect, the Suzuki phase contains three types of topological edge states\non the four possible interfaces separating two Suzuki phase crystals with\ndistinct topological phases. The edge states have defined symmetries with\ninherent directionality, which affect the topological sound transmission and\nare different from chirality, valley vorticity or helicity. Particularly, the\nexistence of topological deaf bands is here reported. The propagation of\ntopological eigenmodes on the same interface is also different, which is\nquantified using the acoustic Shannon entropy, making the topological transport\ndependent on the frequency of the edge states. Based on the abundant\ntopological edge states of Suzuki phase crystals, a multifunctional device with\nacoustic diodes, multi-channel transmission, and selective acoustic\ntransmission can be designed. Numerical simulations and measurements\ndemonstrate the topological transmission. Our work extends the research\nplatform of acoustic topological states to lattices with low symmetry, which\nopens new avenues for enriching topological states with broad engineering\napplications.",

                "abstract": "Cloud computing is an attractive technology for providing computing resources\nover the Internet. Task scheduling is a critical issue in cloud computing,\nwhere an efficient task scheduling method can improve overall cloud\nperformance. Since cloud computing is a large-scale and geographically\ndistributed environment, traditional scheduling methods that allocate resources\nin a centralized manner are ineffective. Besides, traditional methods are\ndifficult to make rational decisions timely when the external environment\nchanges. This paper proposes a decentralized BDI (belief-desire-intention)\nagent-based scheduling framework for cloud computing. BDI agents have\nadvantages in modelling dynamic environments because BDI agents can update\ntheir beliefs, change desires, and trigger behaviours based on environmental\nchanges. Besides, to avoid communication stuck caused by environmental\nuncertainties, the asynchronous communication mode with a notify listener is\nemployed. The proposed framework covers both the task scheduling and\nrescheduling stages with the consideration of uncertain events that can\ninterrupt task executions. Two agent-based algorithms are proposed to implement\nthe task scheduling and rescheduling processes, and a novel recommendation\nmechanism is presented in the scheduling stage to reduce the impact of\ninformation synchronization delays. The proposed framework is implemented by\nJADEX and tested on CloudSim. The experimental results show that our framework\ncan minimize the task makespan, balance the resource utilization in a\nlarge-scale environment, and maximize the task success rate when uncertain\nevents occur.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Fog computing has become an attractive research topic in recent years. As an\nextension of the cloud, fog computing provides computing resources for Internet\nof Things (IoT) applications through communicative fog nodes located at the\nnetwork edge. Fog nodes assist cloud services in handling real-time and mobile\napplications by bringing the processing capability to where the data is\ngenerated. However, the introduction of fog nodes can increase scheduling\nopenness and uncertainty. The scheduling issues in fog computing need to\nconsider the geography, load balancing, and network latency between IoT\ndevices, fog nodes, as well as the parent cloud. Besides, the scheduling\nmethods also need to deal with the occurrence of uncertain events in real-time\nso as to ensure service reliability. This paper proposes an agent-based\nframework with a decentralized structure to construct the architecture of fog\ncomputing, while three agent-based algorithms are proposed to implement the\nscheduling, load balance, and rescheduling processes. The proposed framework is\nimplemented by JADE and evaluated on the iFogSim toolkit. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed scheduling framework can adaptively schedule tasks and\nresources for different service requests in fog computing and can also improve\nthe task success rate when uncertain events occur.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "This paper investigates a multiuser scheduling problem within an uplink\nmultiple-input multi-output (MIMO) status update network, consisting of a\nmulti-antenna base station (BS) and multiple single-antenna devices. The\npresence of multiple antennas at the BS introduces spatial degrees-of-freedom,\nenabling concurrent transmission of status updates from multiple devices in\neach time slot. Our objective is to optimize network-wide information\nfreshness, quantified by the age of information (AoI) metric, by determining\nhow the BS can best schedule device transmissions, while taking into account\nthe random arrival of status updates at the device side.To address this\ndecision-making problem, we model it as a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP) and establish that the evolution of belief states for different\ndevices is independent.We also prove that feasible belief states can be\ndescribed by finite-dimensional vectors. Building on these observations, we\ndevelop a dynamic scheduling (DS) policy to solve the POMDP, and then derive an\nupper bound of its AoI performance, which is used to optimize the parameter\nconfiguration. To gain more design insights, we investigate a symmetric\nnetwork, and put forth a fixed scheduling (FS) policy with lower computational\ncomplexity. An action space reduction strategy is applied to further reduce the\ncomputational complexity of both DS and FS policies. Our numerical results\nvalidate our analyses and indicate that the DS policy with the reduced action\nspace performs almost identically to the original DS policy, and both\noutperform the baseline policies.",

This makes the study of the\nearliest stages of protoplanetary disk formation crucially important. Here we\nfocus on dust growth and pebble formation in a protoplanetary disk that is\nstill accreting from a parental cloud core. Methods. We have developed an\noriginal three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics code, which computes the\ncollapse of rotating clouds and disk formation on nested meshes using a novel\nhybrid Coarray Fortran-OpenMP approach for distributed and shared memory\nparallelization. Dust dynamics and growth are also included in the simulations.\nResults. We found that the dust growth from $\\sim 1~\\mu$m to 1-10~mm already\noccurs in the initial few thousand years of disk evolution but the Stokes\nnumber hardly exceeds 0.1 because of higher disk densities and temperatures\ncompared to the minimum mass Solar nebular. The ratio of the dust-to-gas\nvertical scale heights remains rather modest, 0.2--0.5, which may be explained\nby the perturbing action of spiral arms that develop in the disk soon after its\nformation. The dust-to-gas mass ratio in the disk midplane is highly\nnonhomogeneous throughout the disk extent and is in general enhanced by a\nfactor of several compared to the fiducial 1:100 value. Low St hinders strong\ndust accumulation in the spiral arms compared to the rest of the disk and the\nnonsteady nature of the spirals is also an obstacle. The spatial distribution\nof pebbles in the disk midplane exhibits a highly nonhomogeneous and patchy\ncharacter. The total mass of pebbles in the disk increases with time and\nreaches a few tens of Earth masses after a few tens of thousand years of disk\nevolution. Abridged.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Factor Analysis based on multivariate $t$ distribution ($t$fa) is a useful\nrobust tool for extracting common factors on heavy-tailed or contaminated data.\nHowever, $t$fa is only applicable to vector data. When $t$fa is applied to\nmatrix data, it is common to first vectorize the matrix observations. This\nintroduces two challenges for $t$fa: (i) the inherent matrix structure of the\ndata is broken, and (ii) robustness may be lost, as vectorized matrix data\ntypically results in a high data dimension, which could easily lead to the\nbreakdown of $t$fa. To address these issues, starting from the intrinsic matrix\nstructure of matrix data, a novel robust factor analysis model, namely bilinear\nfactor analysis built on the matrix-variate $t$ distribution ($t$bfa), is\nproposed in this paper. The novelty is that it is capable to simultaneously\nextract common factors for both row and column variables of interest on\nheavy-tailed or contaminated matrix data. Two efficient algorithms for maximum\nlikelihood estimation of $t$bfa are developed. Closed-form expression for the\nFisher information matrix to calculate the accuracy of parameter estimates are\nderived. Empirical studies are conducted to understand the proposed $t$bfa\nmodel and compare with related competitors. The results demonstrate the\nsuperiority and practicality of $t$bfa. Importantly, $t$bfa exhibits a\nsignificantly higher breakdown point than $t$fa, making it more suitable for\nmatrix data.",

Our investigation revolves around two specific models, $f_1(Q)=Q+kQ^n$\nand $f_2(Q)=Q+k_1Q^2+k_2Q^3$, where we systematically vary the parameters $n$\nand $k_{1,2}$. Through an in-depth analysis encompassing the effective\npotential, massless, and massive modes, we elucidate how deviations from the\nconventional symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR)\ngravity impact the localization of fermionic fields. To ensure greater\nprecision, our methodology integrates probabilistic measures such as Shannon\nentropy and relative probability. Moreover, we gauge the stability of these\nmodels employing differential configurational entropy (DCE), revealing a\ncompelling correlation between the most stable configurations and the emergence\nof novel structures within the background scalar field. This work significantly\ncontributes to our understanding of the gravitational modifications' intricate\ninfluence on fermionic field localization within braneworld scenarios.

In this work, we examine the concept\nof hybrid stars - objects containing quark cores surrounded by nucleonic\nenvelopes - as models that account for these new data along with other\n(multimessenger) inferences. We employ a family of 81 nucleonic equations of\nstate (EoSs) based on covariant density functional with variable skewness and\nslope of symmetry energy at saturation density and a constant speed-of-sound\nEoS for quark matter. For each nucleonic EoS, a family of hybrid star EoS is\ngenerated by varying the transition density from nucleonic to quark matter, the\ndensity jump at the transition, and the speed-of-sound. These models are tested\nagainst the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EoS\nand PSR J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EoS. We\nthen examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of\nmasses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347\ndata favors EoS models which predict low-mass twin stars with masses $M\n\\lesssim 1.3\\,M_{\\odot}$ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition\ndensity is low. If combined with a large speed-of-sound in quark matter such\nmodels allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in the range\n$2.0$-$2.6\\,M_{\\odot}$.",

This approach has theoretical and\npractical implications; the theory applies even if the boundary operator is\nrank deficient, or near rank deficient. If desired, the pseudoinverse can be\nimplemented directly using standard tools like Matlab. We also introduce a new\nand simplified version of the semidiscrete approximation of the linear PDE\nsystem, which completely avoids taking the time derivative of the boundary\ndata. The stability results are valid for general, nondiagonal\nsummation-by-parts norms. Another key result is the extension of\nsummation-by-parts operators to multi-domains by means of carefully crafted\nembedding operators. No extra numerical boundary conditions are required at the\ngrid interfaces. The aforementioned pseudoinverse allows for a compact\nrepresentation of these multi-block operators, which preserves all relevant\nproperties of the single-block operators.

The late F-type host star has been hypothesized to be surrounded\nby a large structure of circumstellar material evaporated from the planet. We\nobtained two high-resolution spectral transit time series with CARMENES and\nextensively searched for absorption signals by the atomic species Na, H, Ca,\nand He using transmission spectroscopy, thereby covering the He I triplet with\nhigh resolution for the first time. We apply SYSREM for atomic line\ntransmission spectroscopy, introduce the technique of signal protection to\nimprove the results for individual absorption lines, and compare the outcomes\nto those of established methods. No transmission signals were detected and the\nmost stringent upper limits as of yet were derived for the individual\nindicators. Nonetheless, we found variation in the stellar Halpha and He I\nlines, the origin of which remains uncertain but is unlikely to be activity. To\nconstrain the enigmatic activity state of WASP-12, we analyzed XMM-Newton X-ray\ndata and found the star to be moderately active at most. We deduced an upper\nlimit for the X-ray luminosity and the irradiating X-ray and extreme\nultraviolet (XUV) flux of WASP-12 b. Based on the XUV flux upper limit and the\nlack of the He I signal, our hydrodynamic models slightly favor a moderately\nirradiated planet with a thermospheric temperature of <= 12,000 K, and a\nconservative upper limit of <= 4e12 g/s on the mass-loss rate.

We validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed strategy in simulation and by deploying it onto a\nphysical experiment with autonomous miniature race cars. Both the simulation\nand experimental results demonstrate that, using the feasible SQP method, a\nfeasible solution can be obtained with moderate additional computational effort\ncompared to strategies that resort to early termination without providing a\nfeasible solution.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "The formulation of quarkyonic matter consists of treating both quarks and\nnucleons as quasi-particles, where a cross-over transition occurs between the\ntwo phases. This work is based upon some of the early ideas of quark matter. It\ncan satisfy the different observational constraints on the neutron star (NS),\nsuch as its maximum mass and the canonical radius. In addition, we put an extra\ncomponent inside the NS known as Dark Matter (DM) because it is trapped due to\nits immense gravitational potential. In this work, we explore the impact of\nfermionic DM on the structure of the NS. The equation of state (EOS) is derived\nfor the NS with the quarkyonic matter by assuming that nucleons and quarks are\nin equilibrium, followed by the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism. The\nrecently modeled two parameterizations, such as G3 and IOPB-I, are taken to\ncalculate the various macroscopic properties of the NS. The three unknown\nparameters such as the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale\n($\\Lambda_{\\rm sc}$), and the DM Fermi momentum ($k_f^{\\rm DM}$) are varied to\nobtain the NS properties.

The traditional method of encoding each\npair of question and POI becomes inefficient when the number of candidates\nincreases, making it infeasible for real-world applications. To overcome this,\nwe propose treating the QA task as a dense vector retrieval problem, where we\nencode questions and POIs separately and retrieve the most relevant POIs for a\nquestion by utilizing embedding space similarity. We use pretrained language\nmodels (PLMs) to encode textual information, and train a location encoder to\ncapture spatial information of POIs. Experiments on a real-world tourism QA\ndataset demonstrate that our approach is effective, efficient, and outperforms\nprevious methods across all metrics. Enabled by the dense retrieval\narchitecture, we further build a global evaluation baseline, expanding the\nsearch space by 20 times compared to previous work.

To reduce this gap, we\npropose an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based SemCom\nsystem that is compatible with existing digital communication infrastructures.\nIn the considered system, the extracted semantics is quantized by scalar\nquantizers, transformed into OFDM signal, and then transmitted over the\nfrequency-selective channel. Moreover, we propose a semantic importance\nmeasurement method to build the relationship between target task and semantic\nfeatures. Based on semantic importance, we formulate a sub-carrier and bit\nallocation problem to maximize communication performance. However, the\noptimization objective function cannot be accurately characterized using a\nmathematical expression due to the neural network-based semantic codec. Given\nthe complex nature of the problem, we first propose a low-complexity\nsub-carrier allocation method that assigns sub-carriers with better channel\nconditions to more critical semantics. Then, we propose a deep reinforcement\nlearning-based bit allocation algorithm with dynamic action space.

Visually, they appear as bright patches of\ntypically 15 to 30 m across whose large reflectances and spectral slopes in the\nvisible substantiate the presence of sub-surface water ice. Using a new\nhigh-resolution photogrammetric shape model we determined the three-dimensional\nshape of these cavities whose depth ranges from 20 to 47 m. Spectral slopes\nwere interpreted with models combining water ice and refractory dark material\nand the water ice abundances in the cavities were found to amount to a few per\ncent. The determination of the lifetime of the icy cavities was strongly biased\nby the availability of appropriate and favourable observations, but we found\nevidences of values of up to two years. The icy cavities were found to be\nconnected to jets well documented in past studies. A thermal model allowed us\nto track their solar insolation over a large part of the orbit of the comet and\na transitory bright jet on 2015 July 18 was unambiguously linked to the brief\nillumination of the icy bottom of one of the three cavities. These cavities are\nlikely to be the first potential subsurface access points detected on a\ncometary nucleus and their lifetimes suggest that they reveal pristine\nsub-surface icy layers or pockets rather than recently recondensed water vapor.",

We first show that if one adds\nradiative, soft mass, and SUGRA corrections to the scalar potential,\nsupersymmetric hybrid inflation is still consistent with Planck 2018 and\nLiteBIRD 2023 despite an impression that it does not. Usually, in SUSY hybrid\ninflation with minimal K\\\"ahler potential, the gauge symmetry breaking scale\n$M$ turns out to be ${\\cal O}(10^{15})$ GeV, which causes proton decay rate\nproblem. In this study, we present a new parameter space where the proton decay\nrate problem can be avoided by achieving $M$ of the order of $10^{16}$ GeV with\n$M_{S}^{2}<$0 and $am_{3/2}>$0. In this scenario, one requires a soft SUSY\nbreaking scale $|M_{S}| \\gtrsim 10^{6}$ GeV. Moreover, the tensor to scalar\nratio $r$ is in the range $10^{-16}$ to $10^{-6}$, which is quite small. In\nthis case, modified swampland hold, but it difficult to satisfied\ntrans-Planckian censorship conjecture. For this reason, we also consider\nnon-minimal K\\\"ahler potential. We fixed spectral index $n_{S}=$0.9665 (central\nvalue) of Planck 2018 data and $M=2\\times 10^{16}$ GeV and present our\ncalculations. We show the canonical measure of primordial gravity waves $r$ for\n$M_{S}=$ 1 TeV, $m_{3/2}=$ 1 TeV, $\\kappa_{S}<0$ for $\\cal{N}=$1 and\n$\\cal{N}=$2, ranges from $10^{-5}$ to $0.01$ which can be observed in Planck,\nLiteBIRD and next-generation PRISM, PIXIE,CORE, CMB-S4 and CMB-HD experiments\nthat are gearing up to measure it. In addition to it, we present the parametric\nspace and benchmark points in a non-minimal case which is consistent with\nmodified swampland and trans-Planckian censorship conjectures.",

                "abstract": "Fake news is today a major threat to free and democratic making of public\nopinion. To curb their spread, all efforts by institutions and policy makers\nrely mainly on imposing restriction, prohibition and fact checking sites, which\nend up to an effective limitation of freedom of speech. This policy of\nprohibition, supported by a wide consensus, has been recently broken by the\ncontroversial policy applied by Elon Musk to regulate the social media X, with\na backlash accusing him of promoting hate speech. Here, notwithstanding these\ntwo policies, I explore another avenue denoted ``No ban, No spread - with\nSequestration\", which amounts at the same time preserving full freedom of\nspeech and neutralization of fake news impact. To investigate the feasibility\nof my proposal, I tackle the issue within the Galam model of opinion dynamics.\nIn addition to the basic ingredients of the model, I explore for the first time\nthe effect on the dynamics of opinion of a simultaneous activation of prejudice\ntie breaking and contrarian behavior. The results show that indeed most pieces\nof fake news do not propagate beyond small groups of people and thus pose no\nglobal threat. However, I have unveiled some peculiar sets of parameters for\nwhich fake news, even if initially shared by only a handful of agents, spreads\n``naturally\" to invade a whole community with no resistance. Based on these\nfindings, I am able to outline a path to neutralize such invasive fake news by\nblocking \"naturally\" its spread, effectively sequestering it in very small\nsocial networks of people. The scheme relies on reshaping the social geometry\nof the landscape in which fake news evolves. No prohibition is required with\nfake news left free to prosper but being sequestrated. Next challenging step\nwill be designing measures to implement the model's findings into the real\nworld of social media.",

Existing\nmethods mainly exploit the spatial information while ignoring the\ndiscriminative frequency information. To address this issue, this paper aims to\nreduce the modality discrepancy from the frequency domain perspective.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel Frequency Domain Nuances Mining (FDNM) method\nto explore the cross-modality frequency domain information, which mainly\nincludes an amplitude guided phase (AGP) module and an amplitude nuances mining\n(ANM) module. These two modules are mutually beneficial to jointly explore\nfrequency domain visible-infrared nuances, thereby effectively reducing the\nmodality discrepancy in the frequency domain. Besides, we propose a\ncenter-guided nuances mining loss to encourage the ANM module to preserve\ndiscriminative identity information while discovering diverse cross-modality\nnuances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the\npotential frequency information for VIReID research. Extensive experiments show\nthat the proposed FDNM has significant advantages in improving the performance\nof VIReID. Specifically, our method outperforms the second-best method by 5.2\\%\nin Rank-1 accuracy and 5.8\\% in mAP on the SYSU-MM01 dataset under the indoor\nsearch mode, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel marginal debiased\nnetwork (MDN) to learn debiased representations. More specifically, a marginal\nsoftmax loss (MSL) is designed by introducing the idea of margin penalty into\nthe fairness problem, which assigns a larger margin for bias-conflicting\nsamples (data without spurious correlations) than for bias-aligned ones, so as\nto deemphasize the spurious correlations and improve generalization on unbiased\ntest criteria. To determine the margins, our MDN is optimized through a meta\nlearning framework. We propose a meta equalized loss (MEL) to perceive the\nmodel fairness, and adaptively update the margin parameters by metaoptimization\nwhich requires the trained model guided by the optimal margins should minimize\nMEL computed on an unbiased meta-validation set. Extensive experiments on\nBiasedMNIST, Corrupted CIFAR-10, CelebA and UTK-Face datasets demonstrate that\nour MDN can achieve a remarkable performance on under-represented samples and\nobtain superior debiased results against the previous approaches.",

In all considered runs multiple PLTs emerge shortly\nafter the formation of the first protostar. The first PLT (PLT 1) in the\n$\\rho$-PDF is a stable feature with slope $q_1\\simeq -1.3$ which corresponds --\nunder the condition of preserved spherical symmetry -- to the outer envelope of\nthe protostellar object with density profile $\\rho\\propto l^{-2}$ in the\nclassical Larson-Penston collapse model, where $l$ is the radius. The second\nPLT (PLT 2) in the $\\rho$-PDF is stable in the pure-infall runs but fluctuates\nsignificantly in the runs with initial support against gravity as dozens of\nprotostars form and their mutual tidal forces change the density structure. Its\nmean slope, $\\langle q_2\\rangle\\simeq -2$, corresponds to a density profile of\n$\\rho\\propto l^{-3/2}$ which describes a core in free fall in the classical\nLarson-Penston collapse model or an attractor solution at scales with\ndominating protostellar gravity. PLT 1 and PLT 2 in the $N$-PDFs are generally\nconsistent with the observational data of Galactic low-mass star-forming\nregions from {\\it Herschel} data. In the runs with initial support against\ngravity a third PLT (PLT~3) in the $\\rho$-PDFs appears simultaneously with or\nafter the emergence of PLT 2. It is very shallow, with mean slope of $\\langle\nq_3\\rangle\\simeq -1$, and is associated with the formation of thin protostellar\naccretion disks.",

The strategy\nsets up generation objectives by grouping body joints of detailed skeletons in\nclose semantic proximity together and then replacing each of such joint group\nwith a single body-part node. Such an operation recursively abstracts a human\npose to coarser and coarser skeletons at multiple granularity levels. With\ngradually increasing the abstraction level, human motion becomes more and more\nconcise and stable, significantly benefiting the cross-modal motion synthesis\ntask. The whole text-driven human motion synthesis problem is then divided into\nmultiple abstraction levels and solved with a multi-stage generation framework\nwith a cascaded latent diffusion model: an initial generator first generates\nthe coarsest human motion guess from a given text description; then, a series\nof successive generators gradually enrich the motion details based on the\ntextual description and the previous synthesized results. Notably, we further\nintegrate GUESS with the proposed dynamic multi-condition fusion mechanism to\ndynamically balance the cooperative effects of the given textual condition and\nsynthesized coarse motion prompt in different generation stages. Extensive\nexperiments on large-scale datasets verify that GUESS outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by large margins in terms of accuracy, realisticness,\nand diversity.

The method builds on probabilistic\nmodelling of the image generative process, where the underlying common anatomy\nand geometric variations of the observed images are explicitly disentangled as\nlatent variables. Thus, groupwise registration is achieved through the solution\nto Bayesian inference. We propose a novel hierarchical variational\nauto-encoding architecture to realize the inference procedure of the latent\nvariables, where the registration parameters can be calculated in a\nmathematically interpretable fashion. Remarkably, this new paradigm can learn\ngroupwise registration in an unsupervised closed-loop self-reconstruction\nprocess, sparing the burden of designing complex intensity-based similarity\nmeasures. The computationally efficient disentangled architecture is also\ninherently scalable and flexible, allowing for groupwise registration on\nlarge-scale image groups with variable sizes. Furthermore, the inferred\nstructural representations from disentanglement learning are capable of\ncapturing the latent anatomy of the observations with visual semantics.\nExtensive experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework,\nincluding four datasets from cardiac, brain and abdominal medical images.

However, in\nthis study, we have made a noteworthy observation: although the electron-phonon\ncoupling alone is insufficient to account for the observed ARPES pattern, our\nanalysis reveals that when the instantaneous electron-phonon coupling occurring\nin selective phonon channel is enhanced by the coexistence of antiferromagnetic\nspin density wave and charge density wave phenomena, the amplified interaction\nbecomes comparable to the ARPES range.

The results of this study confirm the existence of a\nrelationship between flight delays and the global satisfaction of passengers\nwith airports. In addition, favorable evaluations regarding airports'\nfood/beverage concessions and Wi-Fi services, but not their retail options,\nhave a relevant moderating effect on that relationship. Furthermore,\ndissatisfaction arising from passengers' interaction with the airline can have\nnegative spillover effects on their satisfaction with the airport. We also\nfound evidence of blame-attribution behavior, in which only delays of internal\norigin, such as failures in flight management, are significant, indicating that\npassengers overlook weather-related flight delays.

The two high-level features will be effectively\ncombined through a late fusion strategy for better action recognition.\nExtensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 benchmarks consistently\nverify the effectiveness of our proposed EPP-Net, which outperforms the\nexisting action recognition methods.

                "abstract": "Multimodal alignment between language and vision is the fundamental topic in\ncurrent vision-language model research. Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), as a\nrepresentative method, integrates Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)\nand Image Caption (IC) into a unified framework, resulting in impressive\nresults. CLIP imposes a bidirectional constraints on global representation of\nentire images and sentences. Although IC conducts an unidirectional\nimage-to-text generation on local representation, it lacks any constraint on\nlocal text-to-image reconstruction, which limits the ability to understand\nimages at a fine-grained level when aligned with texts. To achieve multimodal\nalignment from both global and local perspectives, this paper proposes\nSymmetrizing Contrastive Captioners (SyCoCa), which introduces bidirectional\ninteractions on images and texts across the global and local representation\nlevels. Specifically, we expand a Text-Guided Masked Image Modeling (TG-MIM)\nhead based on ITC and IC heads. The improved SyCoCa can further leverage\ntextual cues to reconstruct contextual images and visual cues to predict\ntextual contents. When implementing bidirectional local interactions, the local\ncontents of images tend to be cluttered or unrelated to their textual\ndescriptions. Thus, we employ an attentive masking strategy to select effective\nimage patches for interaction. Extensive experiments on five vision-language\ntasks, including image-text retrieval, image-captioning, visual question\nanswering, and zero-shot/finetuned image classification, validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.",

This\nresults in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is\nespecially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance\nwhere reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical. This\nwork proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the\nconsistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach.\nUnlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our\nmethod employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the\nparagraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into\nindividual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on\npredefined criteria. To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic\nmetric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an\ninterpretable numeric score. Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further\npresent a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons\nwith explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing\nthese inconsistencies. Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis,\nwe show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large\nmargin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the\nconsistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual,\nand summarization consistency tasks.

Unlike traditional similar relationships, items with complementary\nrelationships may be purchased successively (such as iPhone and Airpods Pro),\nand they not only share relevance but also exhibit dissimilarity. Since the two\nattributes are opposites, modeling complementary relationships is challenging.\nPrevious attempts to exploit these relationships have either ignored or\noversimplified the dissimilarity attribute, resulting in ineffective modeling\nand an inability to balance the two attributes. Since Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) can capture the relevance and dissimilarity between nodes in the\nspectral domain, we can leverage spectral-based GNNs to effectively understand\nand model complementary relationships. In this study, we present a novel\napproach called Spectral-based Complementary Graph Neural Networks (SComGNN)\nthat utilizes the spectral properties of complementary item graphs. We make the\nfirst observation that complementary relationships consist of low-frequency and\nmid-frequency components, corresponding to the relevance and dissimilarity\nattributes, respectively. Based on this spectral observation, we design\nspectral graph convolutional networks with low-pass and mid-pass filters to\ncapture the low-frequency and mid-frequency components.

                "abstract": "Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are a class of molecules that have gained\nsignificant attention in the field of cancer research and therapy. ACPs are\nshort chains of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and they possess\nthe ability to selectively target and kill cancer cells. One of the key\nadvantages of ACPs is their ability to selectively target cancer cells while\nsparing healthy cells to a greater extent. This selectivity is often attributed\nto differences in the surface properties of cancer cells compared to normal\ncells. That is why ACPs are being investigated as potential candidates for\ncancer therapy. ACPs may be used alone or in combination with other treatment\nmodalities like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. While ACPs hold promise as\na novel approach to cancer treatment, there are challenges to overcome,\nincluding optimizing their stability, improving selectivity, and enhancing\ntheir delivery to cancer cells, continuous increasing in number of peptide\nsequences, developing a reliable and precise prediction model. In this work, we\npropose an efficient transformer-based framework to identify anticancer\npeptides for by performing accurate a reliable and precise prediction model.\nFor this purpose, four different transformer models, namely ESM, ProtBert,\nBioBERT, and SciBERT are employed to detect anticancer peptides from amino acid\nsequences. To demonstrate the contribution of the proposed framework, extensive\nexperiments are carried on widely-used datasets in the literature, two versions\nof AntiCp2, cACP-DeepGram, ACP-740. Experiment results show the usage of\nproposed model enhances classification accuracy when compared to the\nstate-of-the-art studies. The proposed framework, ESM, exhibits 96.45 of\naccuracy for AntiCp2 dataset, 97.66 of accuracy for cACP-DeepGram dataset, and\n88.51 of accuracy for ACP-740 dataset, thence determining new state-of-the-art.",

                "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed that solar coronal jets triggered by the\neruption of mini-filaments (MFs) conform to the famous magnetic-breakout\nmechanism. In such scenario, a breakout current sheet (BCS) and a flare current\nsheet (FCS) should be observed during the jets. With high spatial and temporal\nresolution data from the SDO, the NVST, the RHESSI, the Wind, and the GOES, we\npresent observational evidence of a BCS and a FCS formation during coronal jets\ndriven by a MF eruption occurring in the active region NOAA 11726 on 2013 April\n21. Magnetic field extrapolation show that the MF was enclosed by a fan-spine\nmagnetic structure. The MF was activated by flux cancellation under it, and\nthen slowly rose. A BCS formed when the magnetic fields wrapping the MF\nsqueezed to antidirectional external open fields. Simultaneously, one thin\nbright jet and two bidirectional jet-like structures were observed. As the MF\nerupted as a blowout jet, a FCS was formed when the two distended legs inside\nthe MF field came together. One end of the FCS connected the post-flare loops.\nThe peak temperature of BCS was calculated to be 2.5 MK. The length, width and\npeak temperature of FCS was calculated to be 4.35-4.93 Mm, 1.31-1.45 Mm, and\n2.5 MK, respectively. The magnetic reconnection rate associated with the FCS\nwas estimated to be from 0.266 to 0.333. This event also related to a type III\nradio burst, indicating its influence on interplanetary space. These\nobservations support the scenario of the breakout model as the trigger\nmechanism of coronal jets, and flux cancellation was the driver of this event.",

It is\none of the tools to diagnose quantum chaos and unravel the universal dynamics\ntherein. The definition of SFF in most literature only encapsulates the\ntwo-level correlation. In this manuscript, we extend the definition of SSF to\ninclude the high-order correlation. Specifically, we introduce the standard\ndeviation of energy levels to define correlation functions, from which the\ngeneralized spectral form factor (GSFF) can be obtained by Fourier transforms.\nGSFF provides a more comprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of chaotic\nsystems. Using random matrices as examples, we demonstrate new dynamics\nfeatures that are encoded in GSFF. Remarkably, the GSFF is complex, and both\nthe real and imaginary parts exhibit universal dynamics. For instance, in the\ntwo-level correlated case, the real part of GSFF shows a dip-ramp-plateau\nstructure akin to the conventional counterpart, and the imaginary part for\ndifferent system sizes converges in the long time limit. For the two-level\nGSFF, the closed analytical forms of the real part are obtained and consistent\nwith numerical results. The results of the imaginary part are obtained by\nnumerical calculation. Similar analyses are extended to three-level GSFF.",

Different from traditional schemes that require pilot-based\nhigh-frequency interactions between C&S systems, we introduce a third party\nnamed the radio map to provide the large-scale channel state information (CSI).\nWith large-scale CSI, we optimize the transmit power of C&S systems to maximize\nthe signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the radar detection,\nwhile meeting the ergodic rate requirement of the interfered user. Given the\nnon-convexity of both the objective and constraint, we employ the techniques of\nauxiliary-function-based scaling and fraction programming for simplification.\nSubsequently, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem.\nSimulation results collaborate our idea that the extrinsic information, i.e.,\npositions and surroundings, is effective to decouple C&S interference.",

                "abstract": "The system of Virtual Try-ON (VTON) allows a user to try a product virtually.\nIn general, a VTON system takes a clothing source and a person's image to\npredict the try-on output of the person in the given clothing. Although\nexisting methods perform well for simple poses, in case of bent or crossed arms\nposture or when there is a significant difference between the alignment of the\nsource clothing and the pose of the target person, these methods fail by\ngenerating inaccurate clothing deformations. In the VTON methods that employ\nThin Plate Spline (TPS) based clothing transformations, this mainly occurs for\ntwo reasons - (1)~the second-order smoothness constraint of TPS that restricts\nthe bending of the object plane. (2)~Overlaps among different clothing parts\n(e.g., sleeves and torso) can not be modeled by a single TPS transformation, as\nit assumes the clothing as a single planar object; therefore, disregards the\nindependence of movement of different clothing parts. To this end, we make two\nmajor contributions. Concerning the bending limitations of TPS, we propose a\nhuman AnaTomy-Aware Geometric (ATAG) transformation. Regarding the overlap\nissue, we propose a part-based warping approach that divides the clothing into\nindependently warpable parts to warp them separately and later combine them.\nExtensive analysis shows the efficacy of this approach.",

Similar to vector-type NSI, the presence of scalar-mediated neutrino NSI\ncan influence measurements of oscillation parameters in long-baseline neutrino\noscillation experiments, with a notable impact on CP measurement in the case of\nDUNE. Our study focuses on the effect of scalar NSI on neutrino oscillations,\nusing DUNE as an example. We introduce a model-independent parameterization\nprocedure that enables the examination of the impact of all non-zero scalar NSI\nparameters simultaneously. Subsequently, we convert DUNE's sensitivity to the\nNSI parameters into projected sensitivity concerning the parameters of a light\nscalar model.

From the set theoretic point of view a natural\nquestion arises as whether one can broaden the picture and specify a class of\nideals (instead of a single ideal) each of which would have the similar effect.\nAs a natural candidate, we focus on a special class of ideals, namely,\nnon-$snt$ ideals ($snt$ stands for ``strongly non translation invariant\") which\nproperly contains the class of translation invariant ideals ($\\varsupsetneq\nFin$) and happens to contain ideals generated by simple density functions as\nalso certain non-negative regular summability matrices (but not all) which can\nbe seen from \\cite{DG6}.

This discrepancy is corrected by training\nthe network with samples from the approximate noisy image distribution.\nExtensive experiments on real application data show significant qualitative and\nquantitative improvements in performance from adopting these procedures.\nFinally, our procedure can interact well with other control-based methods to\nfurther enhance the controllability of diffusion-based methods.",

                "abstract": "Ensembling is one approach that improves the performance of a neural network\nby combining a number of independent neural networks, usually by either\naveraging or summing up their individual outputs. We modify this ensembling\napproach by training the sub-networks concurrently instead of independently.\nThis concurrent training of sub-networks leads them to cooperate with each\nother, and we refer to them as \"cooperative ensemble\". Meanwhile, the\nmixture-of-experts approach improves a neural network performance by dividing\nup a given dataset to its sub-networks. It then uses a gating network that\nassigns a specialization to each of its sub-networks called \"experts\". We\nimprove on these aforementioned ways for combining a group of neural networks\nby using a k-Winners-Take-All (kWTA) activation function, that acts as the\ncombination method for the outputs of each sub-network in the ensemble. We\nrefer to this proposed model as \"kWTA ensemble neural networks\" (kWTA-ENN).\nWith the kWTA activation function, the losing neurons of the sub-networks are\ninhibited while the winning neurons are retained. This results in sub-networks\nhaving some form of specialization but also sharing knowledge with one another.\nWe compare our approach with the cooperative ensemble and mixture-of-experts,\nwhere we used a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer having 100\nneurons as the sub-network architecture. Our approach yields a better\nperformance compared to the baseline models, reaching the following test\naccuracies on benchmark datasets: 98.34% on MNIST, 88.06% on Fashion-MNIST,\n91.56% on KMNIST, and 95.97% on WDBC.",

An\nexplanation view consists of a set of graph patterns and a set of induced\nexplanation subgraphs. Given a database G of multiple graphs and a specific\nclass label l assigned by a GNN-based classifier M, it concisely describes the\nfraction of G that best explains why l is assigned by M.

(3)\nWe present two algorithms. The first one follows an explain-and-summarize\nstrategy that first generates high-quality explanation subgraphs which best\nexplain GNNs in terms of feature influence maximization, and then performs a\nsummarization step to generate patterns. We show that this strategy provides an\napproximation ratio of 1/2. Our second algorithm performs a single-pass to an\ninput node stream in batches to incrementally maintain explanation views,\nhaving an anytime quality guarantee of 1/4 approximation.

In combination with Planck\ndata, we measure $w=-1.34^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$, or a $2.2\\sigma$ difference with a\ncosmological constant. We use the cluster abundance to measure $\\sigma_8$ in\nfive redshift bins between 0.25 and 1.8, and we find the results to be\nconsistent with structure growth as predicted by the $\\Lambda$CDM model fit to\nPlanck primary CMB data.",

In order to investigate the gas and dust properties of C/2019\nY4 (ATLAS) during its disintegration, we obtained long-slit spectra at\n3600--8700$\\,{\\rm\\mathring{A}}$ and $BVRI$ multi-band images with the Xinglong\n2.16-Meter Telescope in April 2020. Our observations revealed that C/2019 Y4\n(ATLAS) exhibited strong emission bands of CN, C$_2$, C$_3$, and NH$_2$ which\nare superimposed on a dust scattering continuum, typical of cometary spectra in\nthe optical. The production rates of CN, C$_2$, and C$_3$ derived using the\nHaser model and the corresponding C$_2$/CN and C$_3$/CN ratios suggest that\nC/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is a ``typical'' Oort cloud comet under the A'Hearn\nclassification, although it appears less dusty as revealed by the $Af\\rho$\nquantities. Its dust-scattering reflectivity is slightly red, with a gradient\nof $\\sim$5% per $10^3\\,{\\rm\\mathring{A}}$. We model the reflectivity gradient\nin terms of porous dust and find that the red color is accounted for by porous\ndust.",

To address these gaps, we introduce ICE-GRT, utilizing Reinforcement\nLearning from Human Feedback (RLHF) grounded in Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO), demonstrating remarkable ability in in-domain scenarios without\ncompromising general task performance. Our exploration of ICE-GRT highlights\nits understanding and reasoning ability to not only generate robust answers but\nalso to provide detailed analyses of the reasons behind the answer. This\ncapability marks a significant progression beyond the scope of Supervised\nFine-Tuning models. The success of ICE-GRT is dependent on several crucial\nfactors, including Appropriate Data, Reward Size Scaling, KL-Control, Advantage\nNormalization, etc. The ICE-GRT model exhibits state-of-the-art performance in\ndomain-specific tasks and across 12 general Language tasks against equivalent\nsize and even larger size LLMs, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.\nWe provide a comprehensive analysis of the ICE-GRT, underscoring the\nsignificant advancements it brings to the field of LLM.",

Appl. Math.},~81, 190--207, 2021 of the spatiotemoral spread of\nepidemics is considered. This model consists of a system of three nonlinear\ncoupled parabolic Partial Differential Equations with respect to the space and\ntime dependent functions S,I and R. For the first time, a Coefficient Inverse\nProblem (CIP) for this system is posed. The so-called \\textquotedblleft\nconvexification\" numerical method for this inverse problem is constructed. The\npresence of the Carleman Weight Function (CWF) in the resulting regularization\nfunctional ensures the global convergence of the gradient descent method of the\nminimization of this functional to the true solution of the CIP, as long as the\nnoise level tends to zero. The CWF is the function, which is used as the weight\nin the Carleman estimate for the corresponding Partial Differential Operator.\nNumerical studies demonstrate an accurate reconstruction of unknown\ncoefficients as well as S,I,R functions inside of that city. As a by-product,\nuniqueness theorem for this CIP is proven. Since the minimal measured input\ndata are required, then the proposed methodology has a potential of a\nsignificant decrease of the cost of monitoring of epidemics.",

Moreover, the equivalence between the polygon\nrelation and subadditivity is established, in the sense that for all discrete\nor continuous multipartite states, the polygon relation holds if and only if\nthe underlying entropy is subadditive. As byproduct, the subadditivity of\nR\\'enyi and Tsallis entropies is proven for all bipartite Gaussian states.\nFinally, the difference between polygon relations and monogamy relations is\nclarified, and generalizations of our results are discussed.

Conventionally, trustworthy AI literature relies on the\nprobabilistic framework and calibration as prerequisites for trustworthiness.\nIn this work, we depart from this viewpoint by proposing a novel trust\nframework inspired by the philosophy literature on trust. We present a precise\nmathematical definition of trustworthiness, termed\n$\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness, specifically tailored for a subset of tasks\naimed at maximizing a utility function. We argue that a model's\n$\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness is contingent upon its ability to maximize Bayes\nutility within this task subset. Our first set of results challenges the\nprobabilistic framework by demonstrating its potential to favor less\ntrustworthy models and introduce the risk of misleading trustworthiness\nassessments. Within the context of $\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness, we prove that\nproperly-ranked models are inherently $\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthy. Furthermore,\nwe advocate for the adoption of the AUC metric as the preferred measure of\ntrustworthiness. By offering both theoretical guarantees and experimental\nvalidation, AUC enables robust evaluation of trustworthiness, thereby enhancing\nmodel selection and hyperparameter tuning to yield more trustworthy outcomes.",

                "abstract": "The current paradigm of training deep neural networks for classification\ntasks includes minimizing the empirical risk that pushes the training loss\nvalue towards zero, even after the training error has been vanished. In this\nterminal phase of training, it has been observed that the last-layer features\ncollapse to their class-means and these class-means converge to the vertices of\na simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). This phenomenon is termed as Neural\nCollapse (NC). To theoretically understand this phenomenon, recent works employ\na simplified unconstrained feature model to prove that NC emerges at the global\nsolutions of the training problem. However, when the training dataset is\nclass-imbalanced, some NC properties will no longer be true. For example, the\nclass-means geometry will skew away from the simplex ETF when the loss\nconverges. In this paper, we generalize NC to imbalanced regime for\ncross-entropy loss under the unconstrained ReLU feature model. We prove that,\nwhile the within-class features collapse property still holds in this setting,\nthe class-means will converge to a structure consisting of orthogonal vectors\nwith different lengths. Furthermore, we find that the classifier weights are\naligned to the scaled and centered class-means with scaling factors depend on\nthe number of training samples of each class, which generalizes NC in the\nclass-balanced setting.

Considering\nthe key role of the joint cascade of kinetic energy and helicity in rotating\nturbulence, the new SGS model is constrained by the fluxes of kinetic energy\nand helicity. Specifically, the new theory of dual channels of helicity flux is\ntaken into account. The modelling of the unclosed quantities is achieved by\nadopting a quasi-dynamic process that eliminates the need for test filtering\ncompared to the classic dynamic process, and the model coefficients are\ndynamically obtained through the SGS kinetic energy transport equation and\nconsidering the joint constraints of kinetic energy and helicity fluxes. As a\nresult, the model demonstrates a high correlation with DNS data in a priori\ntests. We refer to this new model as the quasi-dynamic joint-constraint model\n(QCM), which is introduced for both incompressible and compressible flows. To\nassess the effectiveness of the QCM, numerical experiments are conducted for\nthree typical cases: incompressible streamwise rotating channel flow, transonic\nstreamwise rotating annular pipe flow, and hypersonic transition flow at Mach 6\nover a rotating cone.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "It is often very tedious for human experts to design efficient algorithms.\nRecently, we have proposed a novel Algorithm Evolution using Large Language\nModel (AEL) framework for automatic algorithm design. AEL combines the power of\na large language model and the paradigm of evolutionary computation to design,\ncombine, and modify algorithms automatically. In this paper, we use AEL to\ndesign the guide algorithm for guided local search (GLS) to solve the\nwell-known traveling salesman problem (TSP). AEL automatically evolves elite\nGLS algorithms in two days, with minimal human effort and no model training.\nExperimental results on 1,000 TSP20-TSP100 instances and TSPLib instances show\nthat AEL-designed GLS outperforms state-of-the-art human-designed GLS with the\nsame iteration budget. It achieves a 0% gap on TSP20 and TSP50 and a 0.032% gap\non TSP100 in 1,000 iterations. Our findings mark the emergence of a new era in\nautomatic algorithm design.",

These measures of volatility serve as indicators of market\nexpectations for conditional volatility and are compared to elucidate their\ndifferences and similarities. The central finding of this study underscores a\nnotably high expected level of volatility, both on a daily and annual basis,\nacross all the methodologies employed. However, it's crucial to emphasize the\npotential challenges stemming from suboptimal liquidity in the Bitcoin options\nmarket. These liquidity constraints may lead to discrepancies in the computed\nvalues of implied volatility, particularly in scenarios involving extreme\nmoneyness or maturity.

Furthermore, we factorize the CTC output distribution\nand perform knowledge distillation on intermediate layers to reduce computation\nand improve recognition accuracy.

For a general Bayesian\ninference problem, we first show that the iteration of the common second-order\nnatural parameter (SONP) is separated from that of the common first-order\nnatural parameter (FONP). Hence, the convergence of the common SONP can be\nchecked independently. We show that with the initialization satisfying a\nspecific but large range, the common SONP is convergent regardless of the value\nof the damping factor. For the common FONP, we establish a sufficient condition\nof its convergence and prove that the convergence of the common FONP relies on\nthe spectral radius of a particular matrix related to the damping factor. We\ngive the range of the damping factor that guarantees the convergence in the\nworst case. Further, we determine the range of the damping factor for massive\nMIMO-OFDM channel estimation by using the specific properties of the\nmeasurement matrices.

In this work, we propose a novel task,\nText2MDT, to explore the automatic extraction of MDTs from medical texts such\nas medical guidelines and textbooks. We normalize the form of the MDT and\ncreate an annotated Text-to-MDT dataset in Chinese with the participation of\nmedical experts. We investigate two different methods for the Text2MDT tasks:\n(a) an end-to-end framework which only relies on a GPT style large language\nmodels (LLM) instruction tuning to generate all the node information and tree\nstructures. (b) The pipeline framework which decomposes the Text2MDT task to\nthree subtasks. Experiments on our Text2MDT dataset demonstrate that: (a) the\nend-to-end method basd on LLMs (7B parameters or larger) show promising\nresults, and successfully outperform the pipeline methods. (b) The\nchain-of-thought (COT) prompting method \\cite{Wei2022ChainOT} can improve the\nperformance of the fine-tuned LLMs on the Text2MDT test set. (c) the\nlightweight pipelined method based on encoder-based pretrained models can\nperform comparably with LLMs with model complexity two magnititudes smaller.\nOur Text2MDT dataset is open-sourced at\n\\url{https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/95414}, and the source codes are\nopen-sourced at \\url{https://github.com/michael-wzhu/text2dt}.",

                "abstract": "Limited by the encoder-decoder architecture, learning-based edge detectors\nusually have difficulty predicting edge maps that satisfy both correctness and\ncrispness. With the recent success of the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM),\nwe found it is especially suitable for accurate and crisp edge detection since\nthe denoising process is directly applied to the original image size.\nTherefore, we propose the first diffusion model for the task of general edge\ndetection, which we call DiffusionEdge. To avoid expensive computational\nresources while retaining the final performance, we apply DPM in the latent\nspace and enable the classic cross-entropy loss which is uncertainty-aware in\npixel level to directly optimize the parameters in latent space in a\ndistillation manner. We also adopt a decoupled architecture to speed up the\ndenoising process and propose a corresponding adaptive Fourier filter to adjust\nthe latent features of specific frequencies. With all the technical designs,\nDiffusionEdge can be stably trained with limited resources, predicting crisp\nand accurate edge maps with much fewer augmentation strategies. Extensive\nexperiments on four edge detection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of\nDiffusionEdge both in correctness and crispness.

To address this issue, we propose a novel backdoor attack method\nnamed Spy-Watermark, which remains effective when facing data collapse and\nbackdoor defense. Therein, we introduce a learnable watermark embedded in the\nlatent domain of images, serving as the trigger. Then, we search for a\nwatermark that can withstand collapse during image decoding, cooperating with\nseveral anti-collapse operations to further enhance the resilience of our\ntrigger against data corruption.

                "abstract": "Ring galaxies are rare in the Universe. A head-on or off-centre collision\nbetween an intruder galaxy and a disc galaxy leads to a collisional ring galaxy\n(CRG) when the intruder-to-target mass ratio (ITMR) is over 0.1 in Newtonian\ndynamics. Within the framework of Milgromian dynamics, the strong equivalence\nprinciple is violated due to the presence of an external field. When two\ngalaxies collide towards each other, the dynamical mass of the phantom dark\nhalo in a galaxy is suppressed by the external field induced by the other\ngalaxy. As a consequence of such suppression, the gravitational perturbation\nfor the target galaxy introduced by a collision is weakened. In this case, a\nminor collision may not be capable of generating a CRG. In this work, we\naddress this issue and perform a series of numerical simulations of collisions\nby tuning the values of ITMR. We find that the critical ITMR is 0.5 in MOND,\nwhich is much larger than that in Newtonian dynamics. The observed massive ring\ngalaxies, such as Arp 147, can be effectively interpreted by CRGs in MOND. This\ninterpretation does not necessitate the presence of dark matter halos for\neither the target or intruder galaxies. Moreover, for a larger inclination\nangle or a larger impact parameter, the off-centred ring structure is fainter.\nThe larger critical ITMR indicates that it is harder to form a CRG in Milgrom's\nModified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). To account for the observed ring structures\nof the NGC 922-like galaxies in MOND, it is necessary to invoke other scenarios\nthan a dry minor collision.",

In this Letter, we derive the near-optimal channel\nfidelity, a concise and optimization-free metric for arbitrary codes and noise.\nThe metric provides a narrow two-sided bound to the optimal code performance,\nand it can be evaluated with exactly the same input required by the KL\nconditions. We demonstrate the numerical advantage of the near-optimal channel\nfidelity through multiple qubit code and oscillator code examples. Compared to\nconventional optimization-based approaches, the reduced computational cost\nenables us to simulate systems with previously inaccessible sizes, such as\noscillators encoding hundreds of average excitations. Moreover, we analytically\nderive the near-optimal performance for the thermodynamic code and the\nGottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code.

Similarly, we evaluate band offset values using\nindependent unit (IU) and alternate slab junction (ASJ) models leading to\naccuracies of 0.45 eV and 0.22 eV respectively. During ASJ structure\ngeneration, we use Zur's algorithm along with a unified GNN force-field to\ntackle the conformation challenges of interface design. At present, we have 300\nsurface work functions calculated with DFT, from which we can compute 44850 IU\nband offsets as well as 250 directly calculated ASJ band offsets. Finally, as\nthe space of all possible heterojunctions is too large to simulate with DFT, we\ndevelop generalized GNN models to quickly predict band edges with an accuracy\nof 0.26 eV. We use such models to predict relevant quantities including\nionization potentials, electron affinities, and IU-based band offsets. We\nestablish simple rules using the above models to pre-screen potential\nsemiconductor devices from a vast pool of nearly 1.4 trillion candidate\ninterfaces.",

While\nrecent years have seen a flurry of work on applying various machine learning\ntechniques to the offline optimization problem, the majority of these work\nfocused on learning a surrogate of the unknown objective function and then\napplying existing optimization algorithms. While the idea of modeling the\nunknown objective function is intuitive and appealing, from the learning point\nof view it also makes it very difficult to tune the objective of the learner\naccording to the objective of optimization. Instead of learning and then\noptimizing the unknown objective function, in this paper we take on a less\nintuitive but more direct view that optimization can be thought of as a process\nof sampling from a generative model. To learn an effective generative model\nfrom the offline data examples, we consider the standard technique of\n``re-weighting\", and our main technical contribution is a probably\napproximately correct (PAC) lower bound on the natural optimization objective,\nwhich allows us to jointly learn a weight function and a score-based generative\nmodel. The robustly competitive performance of the proposed approach is\ndemonstrated via empirical studies using the standard offline optimization\nbenchmarks.",

However, such\npoint-based reconstruction may fail to make each predicted pixel/feature fully\npreserve its neighborhood context, impairing diffusion-based image synthesis.\nAs a powerful source of automatic supervisory signal, context has been well\nstudied for learning representations. Inspired by this, we for the first time\npropose ConPreDiff to improve diffusion-based image synthesis with context\nprediction. We explicitly reinforce each point to predict its neighborhood\ncontext (i.e., multi-stride features/tokens/pixels) with a context decoder at\nthe end of diffusion denoising blocks in training stage, and remove the decoder\nfor inference. In this way, each point can better reconstruct itself by\npreserving its semantic connections with neighborhood context. This new\nparadigm of ConPreDiff can generalize to arbitrary discrete and continuous\ndiffusion backbones without introducing extra parameters in sampling procedure.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on unconditional image generation,\ntext-to-image generation and image inpainting tasks.

We present a new\ninstance of shadowing on the outer disk around a very low mass star,\nZZ~Tau~IRS. Through the analysis of near-infrared (NIR) archival data at\n$\\lambda=1.6$~$\\mu$m acquired with the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space\nTelescope, we identified brightness asymmetries in the top and bottom halves of\nthe highly inclined outer disk, separated by a dark lane. The brighter sides in\nthe top and bottom halves are on the opposite sides, which we attributed to\nshadows cast by a misaligned inner disk. Radiative transfer modeling of the\nsystem with a misaligned angle of 15~deg between the inner and outer disks well\nreproduced the observations. Additionally, we found an elevated brightness\ntemperature of $^{12}$CO~(3-2) at $r\\sim30$~au on the brighter side in NIR\nwavelengths in the top half disk, which can be explained by the shadowing\neffect too. While the origin of the misaligned inner disk remains unclear,\nfuture monitoring observations to search for temporal variations in brightness\nasymmetries will likely provide useful clues.",

We scraped over 6.9M posts from\nincels.is and categorized a random sample into non-violent, explicitly violent,\nand implicitly violent content. Two human coders annotated 3,028 posts, which\nwe used to tune and evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models across different prompts\nand batch sizes regarding coding reliability. The best-performing GPT-4 model\nannotated an additional 30,000 posts for further analysis.\n  Our findings indicate an overall increase in violent speech overtime on\nincels.is, both at the community and individual level, particularly among more\nengaged users. While directed violent language decreases, non-directed violent\nlanguage increases, and self-harm content shows a decline, especially after 2.5\nyears of user activity. We find substantial agreement between both human coders\n(K = .65), while the best GPT-4 model yields good agreement with both human\ncoders (K = 0.54 for Human A and K = 0.62 for Human B).

Building upon previous\ninvestigations involving GMRT, VLA, and LOFAR data, our study focuses on two\nprominent extended radio relics at the north-west (NW) and south-east (SE) of\nthe cluster core.

Our temperature measurements hint the edges to be shock front\nedges.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Many biological processes display oscillatory behavior based on an\napproximately 24 hour internal timing system specific to each individual. One\nprocess of particular interest is gene expression, for which several circadian\ntranscriptomic studies have identified associations between gene expression\nduring a 24 hour period and an individual's health. A challenge with analyzing\ndata from these studies is that each individual's internal timing system is\noffset relative to the 24 hour day-night cycle, where day-night cycle time is\nrecorded for each collected sample. Laboratory procedures can accurately\ndetermine each individual's offset and determine the internal time of sample\ncollection. However, these laboratory procedures are labor-intensive and\nexpensive. In this paper, we propose a corrected score function framework to\nobtain a regression model of gene expression given internal time when the\noffset of each individual is too burdensome to determine. A feature of this\nframework is that it does not require the probability distribution generating\noffsets to be symmetric with a mean of zero. Simulation studies validate the\nuse of this corrected score function framework for cosinor regression, which is\nprevalent in circadian transcriptomic studies. Illustrations with three real\ncircadian transcriptomic data sets further demonstrate that the proposed\nframework consistently mitigates bias relative to using a score function that\ndoes not account for this offset.",

This\nbelief led to simplified models of BMs with restricted intralayer connections\nor layer-by-layer training of deep BMs. Recent developments in domain-specific\nhardware -- specifically probabilistic computers (p-computer) with\nprobabilistic bits (p-bit) -- may change established wisdom on the tractability\nof deep BMs. In this paper, we show that deep and unrestricted BMs can be\ntrained using p-computers generating hundreds of billions of Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) samples per second, on sparse networks developed originally for\nuse in D-Wave's annealers. To maximize the efficiency of learning the\np-computer, we introduce two families of Mean-Field Theory assisted learning\nalgorithms, or xMFTs (x = Naive and Hierarchical). The xMFTs are used to\nestimate the averages and correlations during the positive phase of the\ncontrastive divergence (CD) algorithm and our custom-designed p-computer is\nused to estimate the averages and correlations in the negative phase. A custom\nField-Programmable-Gate Array (FPGA) emulation of the p-computer architecture\ntakes up to 45 billion flips per second, allowing the implementation of CD-$n$\nwhere $n$ can be of the order of millions, unlike RBMs where $n$ is typically 1\nor 2. Experiments on the full MNIST dataset with the combined algorithm show\nthat the positive phase can be efficiently computed by xMFTs without much\ndegradation when the negative phase is computed by the p-computer. Our\nalgorithm can be used in other scalable Ising machines and its variants can be\nused to train BMs, previously thought to be intractable.",

One\nimportant challenge of this form of financing is the uncertainty in the quality\nof projects. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty for backers,\nplatforms share information regarding the decisions of earlier backers visiting\nthe project campaign pages. This allows backers not only to rely on their\nexpertise to identify project qualities but also to learn from the decisions of\ntheir fellow backers who might be more informed. Current studies on\nobservational learning (OL) in crowdfunding mainly focus on predicting the\nsuccess chances of projects, and there is a lack of understanding of how OL\naffects crowdfunding dynamics for backers, project creators and platforms. This\npaper aims to fill this gap by using a theoretical OL model involving two\nprojects competing for funding from backers who may have differentiated\nexpertness in identifying project quality. By introducing various performance\nmeasures for backers, creators and platforms and comparing these measures under\nOL to the case without learning, we provide a thorough analysis of how OL\nimpacts crowdfunding outcomes. We find that information sharing and OL always\nbenefit backers, especially when the early backers are experts. Regarding the\nimpact of OL on creators and platforms, our analysis reveals two understudied\nbut important aspects: the tightness of the competition for projects according\nto the availability of funding, and the quality difference among the proposed\nprojects. Additionally, we investigate how OL affects the quality decisions of\ncreators and show that OL increases the incentive for high-quality products,\nespecially in situations where funding is scarce.",

                "abstract": "While solving complex manipulation tasks, manipulation policies often need to\nlearn a set of diverse skills to accomplish these tasks. The set of skills is\noften quite multimodal - each one may have a quite distinct distribution of\nactions and states. Standard deep policy-learning algorithms often model\npolicies as deep neural networks with a single output head (deterministic or\nstochastic). This structure requires the network to learn to switch between\nmodes internally, which can lead to lower sample efficiency and poor\nperformance. In this paper we explore a simple structure which is conducive to\nskill learning required for so many of the manipulation tasks. Specifically, we\npropose a policy architecture that sequentially executes different action heads\nfor fixed durations, enabling the learning of primitive skills such as reaching\nand grasping. Our empirical evaluation on the Metaworld tasks reveals that this\nsimple structure outperforms standard policy learning methods, highlighting its\npotential for improved skill acquisition.",

The second demands the existence of a fiducial\nobserver to whom the Hubble parameter is isotropic. The last piece states that\nmatter and radiation behave as a perfect fluid.

We keep with the first\nof them and start to investigate the so-called intrinsically homogeneous and\nisotropic spacetimes. They emerge after the decoupling of the CMB with the\ngeometric frame of reference. Furthermore, a ``$\\Lambda$CDM-like\" effective\ntheory arises naturally in those backgrounds, together with some new density\nparameters relating to the local inhomogeneities, the internal energy density,\nand the local and global magnitudes of the Hubble anisotropy. All those\nproperties make this class of inhomogeneous models, which roughly speaking,\nkeeps \"1/3\" of the Cosmological Principle, worth investigating in applications\nto Cosmology, for it can accommodate the same ingredients of the standard\nmodel, as a geometric frame and a free-falling isotropic cosmic background\nradiation, and reduce to the latter when some observable parameters vanish.",

Current SSL methods leverage Data-Augmentations\n(DA) for generating positive samples and incorporate prior knowledge - an\nincorrect, or too weak DA will drastically reduce the quality of the learned\nrepresentation. GPS-SSL proposes instead to design a metric space where\nEuclidean distances become a meaningful proxy for semantic relationship. In\nthat space, it is now possible to generate positive samples from nearest\nneighbor sampling. Any prior knowledge can now be embedded into that metric\nspace independently from the employed DA. From its simplicity, GPS-SSL is\napplicable to any SSL method, e.g. SimCLR or BYOL. A key benefit of GPS-SSL is\nin reducing the pressure in tailoring strong DAs. For example GPS-SSL reaches\n85.58% on Cifar10 with weak DA while the baseline only reaches 37.51%. We\ntherefore move a step forward towards the goal of making SSL less reliant on\nDA. We also show that even when using strong DAs, GPS-SSL outperforms the\nbaselines on under-studied domains. We evaluate GPS-SSL along with multiple\nbaseline SSL methods on numerous downstream datasets from different domains\nwhen the models use strong or minimal data augmentations.

Additionally, we thoroughly address various experimental\nimperfections and showcase the robustness of our approach against atomic\nvibrations, fluctuations in pulse amplitude, and spontaneous emission of\nRydberg states.

However, high AUROC and AUPRO scores do not always reflect\nqualitative performance, which limits the validity of these metrics in\nreal-world applications. We argue that the artificial ceiling imposed by the\nlack of an adequate evaluation metric restrains progression of the field, and\nit is crucial that we revisit the evaluation metrics used to rate our\nalgorithms. In response, we introduce Per-IMage Overlap (PIMO), a novel metric\nthat addresses the shortcomings of AUROC and AUPRO. PIMO retains the\nrecall-based nature of the existing metrics but introduces two distinctions:\nthe assignment of curves (and respective area under the curve) is per-image,\nand its X-axis relies solely on normal images. Measuring recall per image\nsimplifies instance score indexing and is more robust to noisy annotations. As\nwe show, it also accelerates computation and enables the usage of statistical\ntests to compare models. By imposing low tolerance for false positives on\nnormal images, PIMO provides an enhanced model validation procedure and\nhighlights performance variations across datasets. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat PIMO offers practical advantages and nuanced performance insights that\nredefine anomaly detection benchmarks -- notably challenging the perception\nthat MVTec AD and VisA datasets have been solved by contemporary models.\nAvailable on GitHub: https://github.com/jpcbertoldo/aupimo.",

The corresponding\nnormalized version, namely Gini's index, denotes two times the area between the\negalitarian line and the Lorenz curve. Both are dispersion indices because they\nquantify how far a random variable and its independent copy are. Aiming to\nmeasure dispersion in the multivariate case, we define and study new Gini's\nindices. For the bivariate case we provide several results and we point out\nthat they are \"dependence-dispersion\" indices. Covariance representations are\nexhibited, with an interpretation also in terms of conditional distributions.\nFurther results, bounds and illustrative examples are discussed too.\nMultivariate extensions are defined, aiming to apply both indices in more\ngeneral settings. Then, we define efficiency Gini's indices for any\nsemi-coherent system and we discuss about their interpretation. Empirical\nversions are considered in order as well to apply multivariate Gini's indices\nto data.",

Under this framework, we offer efficient\nalgorithms to make inferences on treatment effects at both the cluster and\nindividual levels, applicable to user-specified covariate subgroups and two\ntypes of test data.

However, even the largest\nmodels struggle with compositional reasoning, generalization, fine-grained\nspatial and temporal reasoning, and counting. Visual reasoning with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as controllers can, in principle, address these\nlimitations by decomposing the task and solving subtasks by orchestrating a set\nof (visual) tools. Recently, these models achieved great performance on tasks\nsuch as compositional visual question answering, visual grounding, and video\ntemporal reasoning. Nevertheless, in their current form, these models heavily\nrely on human engineering of in-context examples in the prompt, which are often\ndataset- and task-specific and require significant labor by highly skilled\nprogrammers. In this work, we present a framework that mitigates these issues\nby introducing spatially and temporally abstract routines and by leveraging a\nsmall number of labeled examples to automatically generate in-context examples,\nthereby avoiding human-created in-context examples. On a number of visual\nreasoning tasks, we show that our framework leads to consistent gains in\nperformance, makes LLMs as controllers setup more robust, and removes the need\nfor human engineering of in-context examples.",

Opacity captures\nwhether a system's secret behavior (a subset of the system's behavior that is\nconsidered to be critical) can be kept from outside observers. Existing works\non opacity for control systems only provide a binary characterization of the\nsystem's security level by determining whether the system is opaque or not. In\nthis work, we introduce a quantifiable measure of opacity that considers the\nlikelihood of satisfying opacity for stochastic control systems modeled as\ngeneral Markov decision processes (gMDPs). We also propose verification methods\ntailored to the new notions of opacity for finite gMDPs by using value\niteration techniques. Then, a new notion called approximate opacity-preserving\nstochastic simulation relation is proposed, which captures the distance between\ntwo systems' behaviors in terms of preserving opacity. Based on this new system\nrelation, we show that one can verify opacity for stochastic control systems\nusing their abstractions (modeled as finite gMDPs).

Over the past three decades,\nthe BHP Mitsubishi Alliance Coal framework has been a cornerstone in Australian\ncoal mines for characterising waste dump materials. However, its reliance on\nsubjective human observations has introduced potential inaccuracies and\nsubjectivity into the process. In response to these limitations, this study\nproposes an innovative approach to classify coal spoil attributes by remotely\nacquiring images through phones/tablets. Automated image-based classification\nrelies on feature extraction and a substantial amount of data. Nevertheless,\nthe inherent complexity of geological factors contributing to the formation of\nboth rare and dominant materials leads to imbalanced data. Recognising the need\nfor classification mechanisms to overcome these challenges in spoil\nclassification, the study explores and compares the use of convolutional neural\nnetworks, hybrid deep learning, and traditional techniques. Among the twelve\nmodels evaluated in this study, the ResNet18-k nearest neighbour model emerges\nas a powerful tool in geotechnical characterisation.

In this work we study a popular algorithm,\ndirect preference optimization (DPO), and the mechanisms by which it reduces\ntoxicity. Namely, we first study how toxicity is represented and elicited in a\npre-trained language model, GPT2-medium. We then apply DPO with a carefully\ncrafted pairwise dataset to reduce toxicity. We examine how the resulting model\naverts toxic outputs, and find that capabilities learned from pre-training are\nnot removed, but rather bypassed.

Again, in the fully helical case, we find that there is a similarity in\npower law decay exponents in both 2.5D and 3D simulations. To understand this\nintriguing similarity, we investigate the possible quasi-two-dimensionalization\nof the 3D system. We perform Minkowski functional analysis and find that the\ncharacteristic length scales of a typical magnetic structure in the system are\nwidely different, suggesting the existence of local anisotropies. Finally, we\nprovide a quasi-two-dimensional hierarchical merger model which recovers the\nrelevant power law scalings.

We develop a\ncross-layer game-theoretic framework for strategic decision-making to enhance\ncyber-physical grid resiliency. The cyber-layer game guides the system operator\non how to defend against the botnet attacker as the first layer of defense,\nwhile the dynamic game strategy at the physical layer further counteracts the\nadversarial behavior in real time for improved physical resilience.

In this work we investigate the effects of\ndark energy on the internal structure of a neutron star composed of two phases,\nwhich leads us to wonder: Do stable neutron stars have a dark-energy core? To\naddress this question, we focus on the radial stability of stellar\nconfigurations composed by a dark-energy core -- described by a Chaplygin-type\nequation of state (EoS) -- and an ordinary-matter external layer which is\ndescribed by a polytropic EoS. We examine the impact of the rate of energy\ndensities at the phase-splitting surface, defined as $\\alpha= \\rho_{\\rm\ndis}^-/\\rho_{\\rm dis}^+$, on the radius, total gravitational mass and\noscillation spectrum. The resulting mass-radius diagrams are notably different\nfrom dark energy stars without a common-matter crust. Specifically, it is found\nthat both the mass and the radius of the maximum-mass configuration decrease as\n$\\alpha$ becomes smaller. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions for\nmass-radius relations consistently describe the observational measurements of\ndifferent massive millisecond pulsars as well as the central compact object\nwithin the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347. The analysis of the normal\noscillation modes reveals that there are two regions of instability on the\n$M(\\rho_c)$ curve when $\\alpha$ is small enough indicating that the usual\nstability criterion $dM/d\\rho_c>0$ still holds for rapid phase transitions.\nHowever, this is no longer true for the case of slow transitions.",

                "abstract": "When using resultants for elimination, one standard issue is that the\nresultant vanishes if the variety contains components of dimension larger than\nthe expected dimension. J. Canny proposed an elegant construction, generalized\ncharacteristic polynomial, to address this issue by symbolically perturbing the\nsystem before the resultant computation. Such perturbed resultant would\ntypically involve artefact components only loosely related to the geometry of\nthe variety of interest. For removing these components, J.M. Rojas proposed to\ntake the greatest common divisor of the results of two different perturbations.\nIn this paper, we investigate this construction, and show that the extra\ncomponents persistent under taking different perturbations must come either\nfrom singularities or from positive-dimensional fibers.",

This study\naddresses these questions by constructing a textual dataset based on the\nICD-10-CM code descriptions, widely used in US hospitals and containing many\nclinical terms, and their easily reproducible rephrasing. We then benchmarked\nexisting embedding models, either generalist or specialized in the clinical\ndomain, in a semantic search task where the goal was to correctly match the\nrephrased text to the original description. Our results showed that generalist\nmodels performed better than clinical models, suggesting that existing clinical\nspecialized models are more sensitive to small changes in input that confuse\nthem. The highlighted problem of specialized models may be due to the fact that\nthey have not been trained on sufficient data, and in particular on datasets\nthat are not diverse enough to have a reliable global language understanding,\nwhich is still necessary for accurate handling of medical documents.",

On the one hand, in the spirit of the\nLenard-Balescu relaxation for plasmas, we establish in a generic setting the\noutset of the slow thermalization of the tagged particle. On the other hand, we\nshow that a completely different phenomenology is also possible in some\ndegenerate regime: the slow dynamics of the tagged particle then remains\nconservative and the thermalization no longer holds in a strict sense. We\nprovide the first detailed description of this degenerate regime and of its\nmixing properties.

A\nfundamental question in quantum information theory is whether one can formulate\nan analogous second law characterizing the convertibility of resources for\nquantum information processing. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed,\nwhere quantum-resource convertibility is characterized by the optimal\nperformance of a variant of another fundamental task in quantum information\nprocessing, quantum hypothesis testing. The core of this formulation was to\nprove a lemma that identifies a quantity indicating the optimal performance of\nthis task -- the generalized quantum Stein's lemma -- to seek out a counterpart\nof the thermodynamic entropy in quantum information processing. However, in\n2023, a logical gap was found in the existing proof of the generalized quantum\nStein's lemma, throwing into question once again whether such a formulation is\npossible at all. In this work, we construct a proof of the generalized quantum\nStein's lemma by developing alternative techniques to circumvent the logical\ngap of the existing analysis. With our proof, we redeem the formulation of\nquantum resource theories equipped with the second law as desired. These\nresults affirmatively settle the fundamental question about the possibility of\nbridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.",

This complexity is quantified by the (properly\nregularized) fidelity susceptibility. Our exposition clearly showcases the\ncommon structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to\ndistinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic regimes. We\napply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and\ndemonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both\nfor finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\\to\\infty$.

In the era of high spatial-resolution multi-wavelength data,\nmapping the hot dust around Supermassive Black Holes is important for the\nefforts to achieve a complete picture of the dust role and distribution around\nthese compact objects.\n  In this work we propose a methodology to detect the hot dust emission in the\nproximity of Type 2 AGNs and measure its temperature using K-band spectra\n($\\lambda_c$ = 2.2\\,$\\mu$m).\n  To achieve this, we have developed NIRDust, a Python package for modeling\nK-band spectra, estimate the dust temperature and characterize the involved\nuncertainties. We tested synthetic and real spectra in order to check the\nperformance and suitability of the physical model over different types of data.\n  Our tests on synthetic spectra demonstrated that the obtained results are\ninfluenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the input spectra. However, we\naccurately characterized the uncertainties, which remained below $\\sim$150 K\nfor an average S/N per pixel exceeding 20.

This allows us to\nuse the rewriting logic tool Maude, combined with SMT solving, to provide sound\nand complete formal analyses for PITPNs. We develop and implement a new general\nfolding approach for symbolic reachability, so that Maude-with-SMT reachability\nanalysis terminates whenever the parametric state-class graph of the PITPN is\nfinite. Our work opens up the possibility of using the many formal analysis\ncapabilities of Maude -- including full LTL model checking, analysis with\nuser-defined analysis strategies, and even statistical model checking -- for\nsuch nets. We illustrate this by explaining how almost all formal analysis and\nparameter synthesis methods supported by the state-of-the-art PITPN tool Romeo\ncan be performed using Maude with SMT. In addition, we also support analysis\nand parameter synthesis from parametric initial markings, as well as full LTL\nmodel checking and analysis with user-defined execution strategies. Experiments\nshow that our methods outperform Romeo in many cases.",

                "abstract": "Defending from cyberattacks requires practitioners to operate on high-level\nadversary behavior. Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack\nincidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time. To\navoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify\nand defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal\nattack patterns. Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides\nstructured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past\ncyberattacks. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in\nprioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal\nattack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports. To this end, we propose\nChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from\ncyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks. To construct\nChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and\napply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and\nmachine learning techniques. We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports,\nwhere we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine\npattern categories. We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to\ntrick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack,\nfollowed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network. Based on\nthe observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about\ncybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with\nlimited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications. Moreover, we\nadvocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI\nand design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns.",

With this as motivation, this paper proposes a\nsafe control design approach that guarantees the robustness of nonlinear\nfeedback systems in the presence of matched or unmatched unmodelled system\ndynamics and external disturbances. Our approach couples control barrier\nfunctions (CBFs) with a new uncertainty/disturbance estimator to ensure robust\nsafety against input and state-dependent model uncertainties. We prove upper\nbounds on the estimator's error and estimated outputs. We use an uncertainty\nestimator-based composite feedback control law to adaptively improve robust\ncontrol performance under hard safety constraints by compensating for the\nmatched uncertainty. Then, we robustify existing CBF constraints with this\nuncertainty estimate and the estimation error bounds to ensure robust safety\nvia a quadratic program (CBF-QP). We also extend our method to higher-order\nCBFs (HOCBFs) to achieve safety under unmatched uncertainty, which causes\nrelative degree differences with respect to control input and disturbance. We\nassume the relative degree difference is at most one, resulting in a\nsecond-order cone (SOC) condition. The proposed robust HOCBFs method is\ndemonstrated in a simulation of an uncertain elastic actuator control problem.\nFinally, the efficacy of our method is experimentally demonstrated on a tracked\nrobot with slope-induced matched and unmatched perturbations.",

We describe the Balmer spectrum\nof finite $G$-spectra up to the ambiguity that is present in the finite group\ncase; in particular, we obtain a thick subcategory theorem when $G$ is abelian.\nBy verifying the bijectivity hypothesis for $\\mathsf{Sp}_G$, we prove a\nnilpotence theorem for all profinite groups.\n  Our study then moves to the realm of rational $G$-equivariant spectra. By\nexploiting the continuity of our model, we construct an equivalence between the\ncategory of rational $G$-spectra and the algebraic model of the second author\nand Sugrue, which improves their result to the symmetric monoidal and\n$\\infty$-categorical level. Furthermore, we prove that the telescope conjecture\nholds in this category.

Specifically for surfactants, GNNs can successfully predict\ncritical micelle concentration (CMC), a key surfactant property associated with\nmicellization. A key factor in the predictive ability of QSPR and GNN models is\nthe data available for training. Based on extensive literature search, we\ncreate the largest available CMC database with 429 molecules and the first\nlarge data collection for surface excess concentration ($\\Gamma$$_{m}$),\nanother surfactant property associated with foaming, with 164 molecules. Then,\nwe develop GNN models to predict the CMC and $\\Gamma$$_{m}$ and we explore\ndifferent learning approaches, i.e., single- and multi-task learning, as well\nas different training strategies, namely ensemble and transfer learning. We\nfind that a multi-task GNN with ensemble learning trained on all $\\Gamma$$_{m}$\nand CMC data performs best.

A popular approach to handling\nmissing data in these settings is through multiple imputation, which can be\nespecially effective when there is an auxiliary variable that is strongly\npredictive of and has a smaller amount of missing data than the variable of\ninterest. However, standard methods for multiple imputation of hierarchical\ntime series data can perform poorly when the auxiliary variable and the\nvariable of interest are have a nonlinear relationship. Performance of standard\nmultiple imputation methods can also suffer if the substantive analysis model\nof interest is uncongenial to the imputation model, which can be a common\noccurrence for social science data if the imputation phase is conducted\nindependently of the analysis phase. We propose a Bayesian method for multiple\nimputation of hierarchical nonlinear time series data that uses a sequential\ndecomposition of the joint distribution and incorporates smoothing splines to\naccount for nonlinear relationships between variables. We compare the proposed\nmethod with existing multiple imputation methods through a simulation study and\nan application to secondary school enrollment data.

                "abstract": "WISE J224607.6-052634.9 (W2246-0526) is a hot dust-obscured galaxy at $z$ =\n4.601, and the most luminous obscured quasar known to date. W2246-0526 harbors\na heavily obscured supermassive black hole that is most likely accreting above\nthe Eddington limit. We present observations with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in seven bands, including band 10, of the\nbrightest far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure emission lines of this galaxy:\n[OI]$_{63\\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\\mu m}$, [OI]$_{145\\mu m}$,\n[CII]$_{158\\mu m}$, [NII]$_{205\\mu m}$, [CI]$_{370\\mu m}$, and [CI]$_{609\\mu\nm}$. A comparison of the data to a large grid of Cloudy radiative transfer\nmodels reveals that a high hydrogen density ($n_{H}\\sim3\\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$)\nand extinction ($A_{V}\\sim300$ mag), together with extreme ionization\n($log(U)=-0.5$) and a high X-ray to UV ratio ($\\alpha_{ox}\\geq-0.8$) are\nrequired to reproduce the observed nuclear line ratios. The values of\n$\\alpha_{ox}$ and $U$ are among the largest found in the literature and imply\nthe existence of an X-ray-dominated region (XDR). In fact, this component\nexplains the a priori very surprising non-detection of the [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$\nemission line, which is actually suppressed, instead of boosted, in XDR\nenvironments. Interestingly, the best-fitted model implies higher X-ray\nemission and lower CO content than what is detected observationally, suggesting\nthe presence of a molecular gas component that should be further obscuring the\nX-ray emission over larger spatial scales than the central region that is being\nmodeled. These results highlight the need for multiline infrared observations\nto characterize the multiphase gas in high redshift quasars and, in particular,\nW2246-0526 serves as an extreme benchmark for comparisons of interstellar\nmedium conditions with other quasar populations at cosmic noon and beyond.",

                "abstract": "Background: Identifying and characterising the longitudinal patterns of\nmultimorbidity associated with stroke is needed to better understand patients'\nneeds and inform new models of care.\n  Methods: We used an unsupervised patient-oriented clustering approach to\nanalyse primary care electronic health records (EHR) of 30 common long-term\nconditions (LTC), in patients with stroke aged over 18, registered in 41\ngeneral practices in south London between 2005 and 2021.\n  Results: Of 849,968 registered patients, 9,847 (1.16%) had a record of\nstroke, 46.5% were female and median age at record was 65.0 year (IQR: 51.5 to\n77.0). The median number of LTCs in addition to stroke was 3 (IQR: from 2 to\n5). Patients were stratified in eight clusters. These clusters revealed\ncontrasted patterns of multimorbidity, socio-demographic characteristics (age,\ngender and ethnicity) and risk factors. Beside a core of 3 clusters associated\nwith conventional stroke risk-factors, minor clusters exhibited less common but\nrecurrent combinations of LTCs including mental health conditions, asthma,\nosteoarthritis and sickle cell anaemia. Importantly, complex profiles combining\nmental health conditions, infectious diseases and substance dependency emerged.\n  Conclusion: This patient-oriented approach to EHRs uncovers the heterogeneity\nof profiles of multimorbidity and socio-demographic characteristics associated\nwith stroke. It highlights the importance of conventional stroke risk factors\nas well as the association of mental health conditions in complex profiles of\nmultimorbidity displayed in a significant proportion of patients. These results\naddress the need for a better understanding of stroke-associated multimorbidity\nand complexity to inform more efficient and patient-oriented healthcare models.",

The incorporation of known symmetries (\"equivariance\") into neural\nnets has empirically improved the performance of learning pipelines, in domains\nranging from biology to computer vision. However, a rich yet separate line of\nlearning theoretic research has demonstrated that actually learning shallow,\nfully-connected (i.e. non-symmetric) networks has exponential complexity in the\ncorrelational statistical query (CSQ) model, a framework encompassing gradient\ndescent. In this work, we ask: are known problem symmetries sufficient to\nalleviate the fundamental hardness of learning neural nets with gradient\ndescent? We answer this question in the negative. In particular, we give lower\nbounds for shallow graph neural networks, convolutional networks, invariant\npolynomials, and frame-averaged networks for permutation subgroups, which all\nscale either superpolynomially or exponentially in the relevant input\ndimension. Therefore, in spite of the significant inductive bias imparted via\nsymmetry, actually learning the complete classes of functions represented by\nequivariant neural networks via gradient descent remains hard.",

                "abstract": "Motivated by the goals of dataset pruning and defect identification, a\ngrowing body of methods have been developed to score individual examples within\na dataset. These methods, which we call \"example difficulty scores\", are\ntypically used to rank or categorize examples, but the consistency of rankings\nbetween different training runs, scoring methods, and model architectures is\ngenerally unknown. To determine how example rankings vary due to these random\nand controlled effects, we systematically compare different formulations of\nscores over a range of runs and model architectures. We find that scores\nlargely share the following traits: they are noisy over individual runs of a\nmodel, strongly correlated with a single notion of difficulty, and reveal\nexamples that range from being highly sensitive to insensitive to the inductive\nbiases of certain model architectures. Drawing from statistical genetics, we\ndevelop a simple method for fingerprinting model architectures using a few\nsensitive examples.

Further, we\napply this result to show a dichotomy in the asymptotic behavior of extreme\neigenvalues of $W$-random graphs, which are pivotal in modeling complex\nnetworks and analyzing large-scale graph behavior. These graphs are generated\nusing a kernel $W$, termed as graphon, by connecting vertices $i$ and $j$ with\nprobability $W(U_i, U_j)$.

                "abstract": "We study orbits of semigroups of $\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, and demonstrate\nreciprocity obstructions: we show that certain such orbits avoid squares, but\nnot as a consequence of such obstructions on the Zariski closure, and not as a\nconsequence of congruence obstructions. This is in analogy to the reciprocity\nobstructions recently used to disprove the Apollonian local-global conjecture.\nWe give an example of such an orbit which is known exactly, and misses all\nsquares together with an explicit finite list of sporadic values: the\ncorresponding semigroup is not thin, but its Zariski closure does not miss\nsquares. We also demonstrate thin semigroups with reciprocity obstructions,\nincluding semigroups associated to continued fractions formed from finite\nalphabets. Zaremba's conjecture states that for continued fractions with\ncoefficients chosen from $\\{1,\\ldots,5\\}$, every positive integer appears as a\ndenominator. Bourgain and Kontorovich proposed a generalization of Zaremba's\nconjecture in the context of semigroups associated to finite alphabets. We\ndisprove their conjecture. In particular, we demonstrate classes of finite\ncontinued fraction expansions which never represent rationals with square\ndenominator, but not as a consequence of congruence obstructions, and for which\nthe limit set has Hausdorff dimension exceeding $1/2$. An example of such a\nclass is continued fractions of the form $[0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n,1,1,2]$,\nwhere the $a_i$ are chosen from the set $\\{4,8,12,\\ldots,128\\}$.

                "abstract": "As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) gain global adoption, their\nability to follow instructions in multiple languages becomes increasingly\ncrucial. One promising approach is cross-lingual transfer, where a model\nacquires specific functionality on some language by finetuning on another\nlanguage. In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction\ntuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages. We\nfirst show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities\nto other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only\n40 multilingual examples in an English tuning set substantially improve\nmultilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during\ntuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures\nexhibit comparable or superior performance in several languages compared to\nmonolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those\nlanguages. Finally, we find that increasing the number of languages in the\ninstruction tuning set from 1 to only 2, 3, or 4 increases cross-lingual\ngeneralization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual\ninstruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual\ninstruction-responses.",

The age of the Ursa Major moving group has been\nassessed from the ages of its members, including nuclear member Merak ($\\beta$\nUMa), an A1-type subgiant, by comparing effective temperature and luminosity\nconstraints to model stellar evolution tracks. Previous interferometric\nlimb-darkened angular-diameter measurements of $\\beta$ UMa in the near-infrared\n(CHARA Array, $1.149 \\pm 0.014$ mas) and mid-infrared (Keck Nuller, $1.08 \\pm\n0.07$ mas), together with the measured parallax and bolometric flux, have\nconstrained the effective temperature. This paper presents current VERITAS-SII\nobservation and analysis procedures to derive squared visibilities from\ncorrelation functions. We fit the resulting squared visibilities to find a\nlimb-darkened angular diameter of $1.07 \\pm 0.04 {\\rm (stat)} \\pm 0.05$ (sys)\nmas, using synthetic visibilities from a stellar atmosphere model that provides\na good match to the spectrum of $\\beta$ UMa in the optical wave band. The\nVERITAS-SII limb-darkened angular diameter yields an effective temperature of\n$9700\\pm200\\pm 200$ K, consistent with ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and an\nage of $390\\pm 29 \\pm 32 $ Myr, using MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks\n(MIST).

                "abstract": "We investigate the impact of confinement density (i.e the number of\nindividuals in a group per unit area of available space) on transitions from\npolarized to milling state, using groups of rummy-nose tetrafish (Hemigrammus\nrhodostomus) under controlled experimental conditions. We demonstrate for the\nfirst time a continuous state transition controlled by confinement density in a\ngroup of live animals. During this transition, the school exhibits a bistable\nstate, wherein both polarization and milling states coexist, with the group\nrandomly alternating between them. A simple two-state Markov process describes\nthe observed transition remarkably well. Importantly, the confinement density\ninfluences the statistics of this bistability, shaping the distribution of\ntransition times between states. Our findings suggest that confinement plays a\ncrucial role in state transitions for moving animal groups, and, more\ngenerally, they constitute a solid experimental benchmark for active matter\nmodels of macroscopic, self-propelled, confined agents.",

                "abstract": "The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a spaceborne lidar\ninstrument that collects near-global measurements of forest structure. While\nexpansive in scope, GEDI samples are spatially sparse and cover a small\nfraction of the land surface. Converting the sparse samples into spatially\ncomplete predictive maps is of practical importance for many ecological\nstudies. A complicating factor is that GEDI collects measurements over forested\nand non-forested land alike, with no automatic labeling of the land type. Such\nclassification is important, as it categorically influences the probability\ndistribution of the spatial process and the ecological interpretation of the\nobservations/predictions. We implement a spatial mixture model, separating the\nspatial domain into two latent classes. The latent classes are governed by a\nBernoulli spatial process and within each class the process is governed by a\nseparate spatial model. Model predictions take the form of scalar predictions\nas well as discrete labeling of the class membership. Inference is conducted\nthrough a Bayesian paradigm, yielding rich quantification of prediction and\nuncertainty. We demonstrate the method using GEDI data over Wollemi National\nPark. When compared to a single spatial model, the mixture model achieves much\nhigher posterior predictive densities on the true value. When compared to a\nrandom forest model, a common algorithmic approach in the remote sensing\ncommunity, the random forest achieves better absolute prediction accuracy for\nprediction locations far from observed training data locations, but at the\nexpense of location-specific assessments of uncertainty. The unsupervised\nbinary classifications of the mixture model appear broadly ecologically\ninterpretable as forest and non-forest when compared to optical imagery, but\nfurther comparison to ground-truth data is required.",

In recent years, graph neural networks have achieved\nremarkable performance in this problem by formulating multiple stocks as\ngraph-structured data. However, most of these approaches rely on artificially\ndefined factors to construct static stock graphs, which fail to capture the\nintrinsic interdependencies between stocks that rapidly evolve. In addition,\nthese methods often ignore the hierarchical features of the stocks and lose\ndistinctive information within. In this work, we propose a novel graph learning\napproach implemented without expert knowledge to address these issues. First,\nour approach automatically constructs dynamic stock graphs by entropy-driven\nedge generation from a signal processing perspective. Then, we further learn\ntask-optimal dependencies between stocks via a generalized graph diffusion\nprocess on constructed stock graphs. Last, a decoupled representation learning\nscheme is adopted to capture distinctive hierarchical intra-stock features.\nExperimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art\nbaselines on real-world datasets. Moreover, the ablation study and sensitivity\nstudy further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in modeling\nthe time-evolving inter-stock and intra-stock dynamics.",

We find a critical phase dominated by phase\nfluctuations of a $Z_{6}$ nematic order parameter and bounded by two\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, which displays only\nquasi-long-range nematic order. The electronic spectrum in the critical phase\ndisplays a thermal pseudogap-like behavior, whose properties depend on the\nanomalous critical exponent. We also show that an out-of-plane magnetic field\ninduces nematic phase fluctuations that suppress the two BKT transitions via a\nmechanism analogous to the Hall viscoelastic response of the lattice, giving\nrise to a putative nematic quantum critical point with emergent continuous\nsymmetry. Finally, we demonstrate that even in the case of an untwisted\nbilayer, a critical phase emerges when the nematic order parameter changes sign\nbetween the two layers, establishing an odd-parity nematic state.",

                "abstract": "A fundamental (and largely open) challenge in sequential decision-making is\ndealing with non-stationary environments, where exogenous environmental\nconditions change over time. Such problems are traditionally modeled as\nnon-stationary Markov decision processes (NSMDP). However, existing approaches\nfor decision-making in NSMDPs have two major shortcomings: first, they assume\nthat the updated environmental dynamics at the current time are known (although\nfuture dynamics can change); and second, planning is largely pessimistic, i.e.,\nthe agent acts ``safely'' to account for the non-stationary evolution of the\nenvironment. We argue that both these assumptions are invalid in practice --\nupdated environmental conditions are rarely known, and as the agent interacts\nwith the environment, it can learn about the updated dynamics and avoid being\npessimistic, at least in states whose dynamics it is confident about. We\npresent a heuristic search algorithm called \\textit{Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (ADA-MCTS)} that addresses these challenges. We show that the agent can\nlearn the updated dynamics of the environment over time and then act as it\nlearns, i.e., if the agent is in a region of the state space about which it has\nupdated knowledge, it can avoid being pessimistic. To quantify ``updated\nknowledge,'' we disintegrate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in the\nagent's updated belief and show how the agent can use these estimates for\ndecision-making. We compare the proposed approach with the multiple\nstate-of-the-art approaches in decision-making across multiple well-established\nopen-source problems and empirically show that our approach is faster and\nhighly adaptive without sacrificing safety.",

The first case leads to so-called ``blob models\" which\nhave received some attention recently as a tool to approximate non-linear\ndiffusion by particle systems. The hard-sphere model is similar to a classical\nmodel for congested crowd motion. We review well-posedness results for these\nmodels and discuss their relationship to classical continuum description of\naggregation-diffusion phenomena in the limit $\\delta\\to0$: the classical\nnonlinear drift diffusion equation and its incompressible counterpart.\n  In the second part of the paper, we discuss recent results on the emergence\nand evolution of sharp interfaces when a large population of particles is\nconsidered at appropriate space and time scales: At some intermediate time\nscale, phase separation occurs and a sharp interface appears which evolves\naccording to a Stefan free boundary problem (and the density function\neventually relaxes to a characteristic function - metastable steady state for\nthe original problem). At a larger time scale the attractive forces lead to\nsurface tension phenomena and the evolution of the sharp interface can be\ndescribed by a Hele-Shaw free boundary problem with surface tension. At that\nsame time scale, we will also discuss the emergence of contact angle conditions\nfor problems set in bounded domains.",

                "abstract": "Over the past century, an intense debate in statistical mechanics has been\nabout the correctness of Boltzmann's surface entropy versus Gibbs' volume\nentropy, for isolated systems. Both entropies make significantly different\npredictions for systems with few degrees of freedom. Even in the thermodynamic\nlimit, they can disagree-while Boltzmann entropy allows negative absolute\ntemperatures to exist, Gibbs entropy precludes such a possibility. Here, we\nshow that modifying Boltzmann's entropy via a relative energy tolerance\neliminates thermodynamic inconsistencies in several model systems with\nunbounded energy spectra by ensuring positive, finite temperatures.\nConcomitantly, the proposed entropy allows for negative temperatures in systems\nwith bounded spectra and closely matches canonical ensemble predictions. This\nwork conclusively remedies the prevalent deficiencies of the Gibbs and\nBoltzmann entropy formulations and paves the way for the use of the modified\nBoltzmann entropy in the microcanonical ensemble, allowing negative\ntemperatures to exist.",

Here we present an analysis of the kinematics of\nthe young Trifid nebula, based on velocity-resolved observations of the\nfar-infrared fine-structure lines of [C II] at 158 micron and [O I] at 63\nmicron. The distribution of the photodissociated regions (PDRs) surrounding the\nnebula is consistent with a shell-like structure created by the HII region\nexpanding with a velocity of 5 km/s. Comparison of ratios of [C II] and [O I]\n63 micron intensities for identical velocity components with PDR models\nindicate a density of 1e4 /cm^3. The red- and blue-shifted PDR shells with a\ncombined mass of 516 Msun have a kinetic energy of ~1e47 erg. This is\nconsistent with the thermal energy of the HII region as well as with the energy\ndeposited by the stellar wind luminosity from HD 169442A, an O7 V star, over\nthe 0.5 Myr lifetime of the star. The observed momentum of the PDR shell is\nlower than what theoretical calculations predict for the radial momentum due to\nthe shell being swept up by an expanding HII region, which suggests that\nsignificant mass loss has occurred in M20 due to the dispersal of the\nsurrounding gas by the advancing ionization front.",

                "abstract": "Controlling complex dynamical systems is generally associated with minimizing\ncertain control objectives with known dynamics under the variational calculus\nframework. For systems with unknown dynamics, an additional step of dynamics\nmodeling is required. However, any inaccuracy in dynamics modeling will lead to\nsub-optimality in the resulting control function. Another set of approaches for\ncontrolling unknown dynamical systems - reinforcement learning, folds the\ndynamics modeling into controller training via value function approximation or\npolicy gradient through extensively interacting with the environment, but it\nsuffers from low data efficiency. To address these, we introduce NODEC, a novel\nframework for controlling unknown dynamical systems, which combines dynamics\nmodelling and controller training using a coupled neural ODE model. Through an\nintriguing interplay between the two coupled neural networks, NODEC learns\nsystem dynamics as well as optimal controls that guides the unknown dynamical\nsystem towards target states. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and\ndata efficiency of NODEC for learning optimal control of unknown dynamical\nsystems.",

                "abstract": "The geodesic method has played a crucial role in understanding the circular\norbits generated by compact objects, culminating in the definition of the\nphoton sphere, which was later generalized to a photon surface in arbitrary\nspacetimes. This new formulation extends the concept of the photon sphere in a\nbroader sense, including dynamical spacetimes, as shown by the Vaidya solution.\nThe photon surface essentially defines the null geodesics, which are originally\ntangent to the temporal surface, and keeps them confined to this surface.\nHowever, this formalism does not cover all classes of particles, and to\novercome this limitation, a more comprehensive approach, denoted as the\n\"massive particle surface\", has been proposed that also accounts for charged\nmassive particles. Indeed, the photon surface concept is recovered when the\ncharge and mass of the particles are zero. In this work, we use these three\nformalisms to check the consistency of the results for the values of the radius\nof the photon sphere ($r_{ps}$) and the radius of the \"innermost stable\ncircular orbit\" (ISCO) ($r_{\\rm ISCO}$) for some gravitational models. In our\nresults, the first model is described by conformal gravity, with the\npeculiarity that $g_{00}\\neq-g_{11}^{-1}$. The second model, i.e. the Culetu\nsolution, is developed by coupling General Relativity with nonlinear\nelectrodynamics, which requires the consideration of the effective metric\n($g_{\\rm eff}^{\\mu\\nu}$) for geodesic approaches. Furthermore, we have also\nanalysed the expressions for $r_{ps}$ and $r_{\\rm ISCO}$ in a general static\nand spherically symmetric metric. Under these circumstances, we have found a\ndiscrepancy of $r_{ps}$ and $r_{\\rm ISCO}$ obtained by the massive particle\nsurface formalism as compared to the geodesic and photon surface formalisms.",

To this end, we employ a\nmany-objective genetic algorithm (MaOGA) algorithm inspired by the\nNon-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)-III, along with\nrobotic-disassembly-oriented constraints and objective functions derived from\ngeometrical and robot simulations using 3-dimensional (3D) geometrical\ninformation stored in a 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model of the target\nproduct. The MaOGA begins by generating a set of initial chromosomes based on a\ncontact and connection graph (CCG), rather than random chromosomes, to avoid\nfalling into a local minimum and yield repeatable convergence. The optimization\nimposes constraints on feasibility and stability as well as objective functions\nregarding difficulty, efficiency, prioritization, and allocability to generate\na sequence that satisfies many preferred conditions under mandatory\nrequirements for semi-automated robotic disassembly. The NSGA-III-inspired\nMaOGA also utilizes non-dominated sorting and niching with reference lines to\nfurther encourage steady and stable exploration and uniformly lower the overall\nevaluation values. Our sequence generation experiments for a complex product\n(36 parts) demonstrated that the proposed method can consistently produce\nfeasible and stable sequences with a 100% success rate, bringing the multiple\npreferred conditions closer to the optimal solution required for semi-automated\nrobotic disassembly operations.",

However, it remains unclear\nwhether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing. To\ninvestigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept\nsaliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining. Our findings\nreveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating\nadvanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed\nneurons with similar semantics. This demonstrates that models exhibit\npolysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual\nneurons. While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts,\nour results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved\nmodel \\textit{safety}. Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques\nto mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more\nrobust model editing.

The amount of experimental data about various properties of\nmolecules constantly grows, promoting data-driven approaches. However, the\napplicability of typical predictive machine learning techniques can be\nsubstantially limited by a lack of experimental data about a particular target.\nFor example, there are many known Thrombin inhibitors (acting as\nanticoagulants), but a very limited number of known Protein C inhibitors\n(coagulants). In this study, we present our approach to suggest new inhibitor\ncandidates by building an effective representation of chemical space. For this\naim, we developed a deep learning model -- autoencoder, trained on a large set\nof molecules in the SMILES format to map the chemical space. Further, we\napplied different sampling strategies to generate novel coagulant candidates.\nSymmetrically, we tested our approach on anticoagulant candidates, where we\nwere able to predict their inhibition towards Thrombin. We also compare our\napproach with MegaMolBART -- another deep learning generative model, but\nexploiting similar principles of navigation in a chemical space.",

                "abstract": "Network meta-analysis (NMA) combines evidence from multiple trials to compare\nthe effectiveness of a set of interventions. In public health research,\ninterventions are often complex, made up of multiple components or features.\nThis makes it difficult to define a common set of interventions on which to\nperform the analysis. One approach to this problem is component network\nmeta-analysis (CNMA) which uses a meta-regression framework to define each\nintervention as a subset of components whose individual effects combine\nadditively. In this paper, we are motivated by a systematic review of complex\ninterventions to prevent obesity in children. Due to considerable heterogeneity\nacross the trials, these interventions cannot be expressed as a subset of\ncomponents but instead are coded against a framework of characteristic\nfeatures. To analyse these data, we develop a bespoke CNMA-inspired model that\nallows us to identify the most important features of interventions. We define a\nmeta-regression model with covariates on three levels: intervention, study, and\nfollow-up time, as well as flexible interaction terms. By specifying different\nregression structures for trials with and without a control arm, we relax the\nassumption from previous CNMA models that a control arm is the absence of\nintervention components. Furthermore, we derive a correlation structure that\naccounts for trials with multiple intervention arms and multiple follow-up\ntimes. Although our model was developed for the specifics of the obesity data\nset, it has wider applicability to any set of complex interventions that can be\ncoded according to a set of shared features.",

The approach matched\nthe covariance of the clipped Gaussian process with the one for the stationary\nswitching process and the distribution of the latter was used as the so-called\nindependent interval approximation (IIA). The approach successfully assessed\nthe persistency exponent for many physically important processes but left an\nunanswered question when such an approach leads to a mathematically meaningful\nand proper exceedance distribution. Here we address this question by proposing\nan alternative matching of the expected values of the clipped Slepian process\nand the corresponding switched process initiated at the origin. The method has\nallowed resolving the mathematical correctness of the matching method for a\nlarge subclass of the Gaussian processes with monotonic covariance, for which\nwe provide a sufficient condition for the validity of the IIA. Within this\nclass, the IIA produces a valid distribution for the excursion time and is\nrepresented in an explicit stochastic form that connects directly to the\ncovariance of the underlying Gaussian process. We compare the excursion level\ndistributions as well as the corresponding persistency exponents obtained\nthrough the IIA method with numerically computed exact distributions, and the\nsimulated distribution for several important Gaussian models.

Random discrete\nstructures appear as fundamental objects of study in many scientific and\nmathematical fields including statistical physics, combinatorics, algorithms\nand complexity, social choice theory, coding theory, and statistics. While the\nmodels and properties of interest in these fields vary widely, much progress\nhas been made through the development of general tools applicable to large\nfamilies of models and properties all at once. Historically these tools\noriginated to solve or make progress on specific, difficult conjectures in the\nareas mentioned above. We will survey recent progress on some of these hard\nproblems and describe some challenges for the future.",

                "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is an important process in astrophysical environments,\nas it re-configures magnetic field topology and converts magnetic energy into\nthermal and kinetic energy. In extreme astrophysical systems, such as black\nhole coronae and pulsar magnetospheres, radiative cooling modifies the energy\npartition by radiating away internal energy, which can lead to the radiative\ncollapse of the layer. In this paper, we perform 2D & 3D simulations to model\nthe MARZ (Magnetic Reconnection on Z) experiments, which are designed to access\ncooling rates in the laboratory necessary to investigate reconnection in a\npreviously unexplored radiatively-cooled regime. These simulations are\nperformed in GORGON, an Eulerian resistive magnetohydrodynamic code, which\nmodels the experimental geometry comprising two exploding wire arrays driven by\n20 MA of current on the Z machine (Sandia National Laboratories). Radiative\nlosses are implemented using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium tables\ncomputed using the atomic code Spk, and we probe the effects of radiation\ntransport by implementing both a local radiation loss model and P$_{1/3}$\nmulti-group radiation transport. The load produces highly collisional,\nsuper-Alfv\\'enic $(M_{A} \\approx 1.5)$, supersonic $(M_S \\approx 4-5)$ plasma\nflows which generate a reconnection layer ($L/{\\delta} \\approx 100, S_L \\approx\n400$). The reconnection layer undergoes radiative collapse when the radiative\nlosses exceed Ohmic and compressional heating ${\\tau}_{cool}^{-1}/{\\tau}_A^{-1}\n\\approx 100$; this generates a cold strongly compressed current sheet, leading\nto an accelerated reconnection rate, consistent with theoretical predictions.\nFinally, the current sheet is unstable to the plasmoid instability, but the\nmagnetic islands are extinguished by strong radiative cooling before ejection\nfrom the layer.",

It finds that LSTM outperforms the traditional statistical methods in\nthe case of fBm and fOU processes; however, it has limited accuracy on lfsm\nprocesses. The research also delves into the implications of training length\nand valuation sequence length on the LSTM's performance. The methodology is\napplied by estimating the Hurst parameter in Li-ion battery degradation data\nand obtaining confidence bounds for the estimation. The study concludes that\nwhile deep learning methods show promise in parameter estimation of fractional\nprocesses, their effectiveness is contingent on the process type and the\nquality of training data.",

Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental\nhealth problem affecting low, middle, and high-income countries. In the past\nfew years, the research community has explored IoT-enabled machine learning\napplications for outdoor air pollution prediction. The general objective of\nthis paper is to systematically review applications of machine learning and\nInternet of Things (IoT) for outdoor air pollution prediction and the\ncombination of monitoring sensors and input features used. Two research\nquestions were formulated for this review. 1086 publications were collected in\nthe initial PRISMA stage. After the screening and eligibility phases, 37 papers\nwere selected for inclusion. A cost-based analysis was conducted on the\nfindings to highlight high-cost monitoring, low-cost IoT and hybrid enabled\nprediction. Three methods of prediction were identified: time series,\nfeature-based and spatio-temporal. This review's findings identify major\nlimitations in applications found in the literature, namely lack of coverage,\nlack of diversity of data and lack of inclusion of context-specific features.\nThis review proposes directions for future research and underlines practical\nimplications in healthcare, urban planning, global synergy and smart cities.",

In\nthis work, we focus on hyperbolic conservation laws and replace numerical\nfluxes in the numerical schemes by neural operator. For this, we construct\nlosses that are motivated by numerical schemes for conservation laws and\napproximate numerical flux by FNO. Through experiments, we show that our\nmethodology has advantages of both numerical schemes and FNO by comparing with\noriginal methods. For instance, we demonstrate our method gains robustness,\nresolution invariance property, and feasibility of a data-driven method.

Especially when faced with\nfactual questions, LLM cannot only rely on knowledge stored in parameters to\nguarantee truthful and correct answers. Augmenting these models with the\nability to search on external information sources, such as the web, is a\npromising approach to ground knowledge to retrieve information. However,\nsearching in a large collection of documents introduces additional\ncomputational/time costs. An optimal behavior would be to query external\nresources only when the LLM is not confident about answers. In this paper, we\npropose a new LLM able to self-estimate if it is able to answer directly or\nneeds to request an external tool. We investigate a supervised approach by\nintroducing a hallucination masking mechanism in which labels are generated\nusing a close book question-answering task. In addition, we propose to leverage\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to train our model on a small amount\nof data.

We first derive two different lower\nbounds to the compression ratio that depend on the number of states of the\nlossless encoder. Both bounds are asymptotically achievable by conceptually\nsimple coding schemes. We then show that when the number of states of the\nlossless encoder is large enough in terms of the reconstruction block-length,\nthe performance can be improved, sometimes significantly so.

This ability is essential for humans to identify\nthe same object while moving and to learn from vision efficiently. It is\nintriguing to design models that have a similar ability. In this paper, we\nconsider a novel problem of learning compositional scene representations from\nmultiple unspecified (i.e., unknown and unrelated) viewpoints without using any\nsupervision and propose a deep generative model which separates latent\nrepresentations into a viewpoint-independent part and a viewpoint-dependent\npart to solve this problem.

                "abstract": "We devise an autonomous quantum thermal machine consisting of three\npairwise-interacting qubits, two of which are locally coupled to separate\nclassical reservoirs. The machine operates autonomously, as it requires no\ntime-coherent control, external driving or quantum bath engineering, and is\ninstead propelled by a chemical potential bias between the reservoirs. Under\nideal conditions, we show that this out-of-equilibrium system can\ndeterministically generate a maximally entangled steady-state between two of\nthe qubits, or in fact, any desired pure two-qubit entangled state, emerging as\na dark state of the system. The entanglement production is also robust, such\nthat nearly-maximally-entangled states can be generated well-away from the\nideal regime of operation. Furthermore, we show that our machine architecture\ncan be generalised to a configuration with $2n-1$ qubits, in which only a\npotential bias and two-body interactions are sufficient to generate genuine\nmultipartite maximally entangled steady states in the form of a W state of $n$\nqubits.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have permeated various disciplinary\ndomains, ranging from bioinformatics to financial analytics, where their\napplication has become an indispensable facet of contemporary scientific\nresearch endeavors. However, the inherent limitations of traditional neural\nnetworks arise due to their relatively fixed network structures and activation\nfunctions. 1, The type of activation function is single and relatively fixed,\nwhich leads to poor \"unit representation ability\" of the network, and it is\noften used to solve simple problems with very complex networks; 2, the network\nstructure is not adaptive, it is easy to cause network structure redundant or\ninsufficient. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a novel\nneural network called X-Net. By utilizing our designed Alternating\nBackpropagation mechanism, X-Net dynamically selects appropriate activation\nfunctions based on derivative information during training to enhance the\nnetwork's representation capability for specific tasks. Simultaneously, it\naccurately adjusts the network structure at the neuron level to accommodate\ntasks of varying complexities and reduce computational costs. Through a series\nof experiments, we demonstrate the dual advantages of X-Net in terms of\nreducing model size and improving representation power. Specifically, in terms\nof the number of parameters, X-Net is only 3$\\%$ of baselines on average, and\nonly 1.4$\\%$ under some tasks. In terms of representation ability, X-Net can\nachieve an average $R^2$=0.985 on the fitting task by only optimizing the\nactivation function without introducing any parameters. Finally, we also tested\nthe ability of X-Net to help scientific discovery on data from multiple\ndisciplines such as society, energy, environment, and aerospace, and achieved\nconcise and good results.",

Here we study the\nabsorption, and superradiant amplification, of a monochromatic planar wave in a\ncharged, massive scalar field impinging on the electrically-charged\nAy\\'on-Beato-Garc\\'ia (ABG) RBH. Comparisons are drawn with absorption and\nsuperradiance for the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (RN) black hole in linear\nelectrodynamics. We find that, in a certain parameter regime, the ABG\nabsorption cross section is negative, due to superradiance, and moreover it is\nunbounded from below as the momentum of the wave approaches zero; this\nphenomenon of ``unbounded superradiance'' is absent in the RN case. We show how\nthe parameter space can be divided into regions, using the bounded/unbounded\nand absorption/amplification boundaries. After introducing a high-frequency\napproximation based on particle trajectories, we calculate the absorption cross\nsection numerically, via the partial-wave expansion, as function of wave\nfrequency, and we present a gallery of results. The cross section of the ABG\nRBH is found to be larger (smaller) than in the RN case when the field charge\nhas the same (opposite) sign as the black hole charge. We show that it is\npossible to find ``mimics'': situations in which the cross sections of both\nblack holes are very similar.

The Sinkhorn\ndivergence is then exploited to optimize the source model parameters. As a\nresult of using the cross-band information, the BSS performance is improved.\nBut the number of parameters to be estimated also increases significantly, and\nso is the computational complexity. To reduce the algorithm complexity, we\napply the Kronecker product to decompose the modeling matrix into the product\nof a number of matrices of much smaller dimensionality.

We first investigate the enumerators for\nthe joint distribution of descents, big ascents and successions over all\npermutations in the symmetric group. As an generalization a result of\nDiaconis-Evans-Graham (Adv. in Appl. Math., 61 (2014), 102--124), we show that\ntwo triple set-valued statistics of permutations are equidistributed on\nsymmetric groups. We then introduce the definition of proper left-to-right\nminimum. We discover that the joint distribution of the succession and proper\nleft-to-right minimum statistics over permutations is a symmetric distribution.\nIn the final part, we discuss the relationship between the fix and cyc\n(p,q)-Eulerian polynomials and the joint distribution of succession and several\nEulerian-type statistics.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "In recent years, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has gradually become\nmainstream in various computer vision tasks, and the robustness of the model\nhas received increasing attention. However, existing large models tend to\nprioritize performance during training, potentially neglecting the robustness,\nwhich may lead to serious security concerns. In this paper, we establish a new\nchallenge: exploring how to use a small number of additional parameters for\nadversarial finetuning to quickly and effectively enhance the adversarial\nrobustness of a standardly trained model. To address this challenge, we develop\nthe novel LNLoRA module, incorporating a learnable layer normalization before\nthe conventional LoRA module, which helps mitigate magnitude differences in\nparameters between the adversarial and standard training paradigms.\n  Furthermore, we propose the FullLoRA-AT framework by integrating the\nlearnable LNLoRA modules into all key components of ViT-based models while\nkeeping the pretrained model frozen, which can significantly improve the model\nrobustness via adversarial finetuning in a parameter-efficient manner.\n  Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed FullLoRA-AT framework. It achieves comparable\nrobustness with full finetuning while only requiring about 5% of the learnable\nparameters. This also effectively addresses concerns regarding extra model\nstorage space and enormous training time caused by adversarial finetuning.",

In the semantic segmentation task, the attention mechanism is\napplied in various methods, including the case of both Convolution Neural\nNetworks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) as backbones. However, we observe\nthat the attention mechanism is vulnerable to patch-based adversarial attacks.\nThrough the analysis of the effective receptive field, we attribute it to the\nfact that the wide receptive field brought by global attention may lead to the\nspread of the adversarial patch. To address this issue, in this paper, we\npropose a Robust Attention Mechanism (RAM) to improve the robustness of the\nsemantic segmentation model, which can notably relieve the vulnerability\nagainst patch-based attacks. Compared to the vallina attention mechanism, RAM\nintroduces two novel modules called Max Attention Suppression and Random\nAttention Dropout, both of which aim to refine the attention matrix and limit\nthe influence of a single adversarial patch on the semantic segmentation\nresults of other positions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our RAM to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation models against\nvarious patch-based attack methods under different attack settings.",

One effective\nsolution to address the limitation is few-shot generative model adaption.\nHowever, the type of approaches typically rely on a large-scale pre-trained\nmodel, serving as a source domain, to facilitate information transfer to the\ntarget domain. In this paper, we propose a method called Information Transfer\nfrom the Built Geodesic Surface (ITBGS), which contains two module: Feature\nAugmentation on Geodesic Surface (FAGS); Interpolation and Regularization\n(I\\&R). With the FAGS module, a pseudo-source domain is created by projecting\nimage features from the training dataset into the Pre-Shape Space, subsequently\ngenerating new features on the Geodesic surface. Thus, no pre-trained models is\nneeded for the adaption process during the training of generative models with\nFAGS. I\\&R module are introduced for supervising the interpolated images and\nregularizing their relative distances, respectively, to further enhance the\nquality of generated images. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments,\nwe demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves optimal or\ncomparable results across a diverse range of semantically distinct datasets,\neven in extremely few-shot scenarios.",

Such\nmergers are predicted to originate in the vicinity of massive black holes\n(MBHs). Especially, GW190814, due to its secondary mass and mass ratio being\nbeyond the expectations of isolated stellar evolution theories, is a promising\nevent that has happened in an active galactic nucleus(AGN) disk. In this model,\na compact object resides in the vicinity of a merging BBH. Here we report\nmultiple pieces of evidence pointing to the fact that GW190814 is a BBH merging\nnear a compact object. The orbital motion of BBHs around the third body\nproduces a line-of-sight acceleration (LSA) and induces a varying Doppler\nshift. Using a waveform template that considers LSA, we perform Bayesian\ninference on a few BBH events with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the\ngravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC). Compared to the model for isolated\nBBH mergers, we obtain significantly higher network signal-to-noise ratios for\nGW190814 by that with the LSA and constrain the LSA to $a =\n0.0014^{+0.0014}_{-0.0022} ~c~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In addition, the logarithmic\nBayes factor for the LSA case over the isolated case is $16.6$, which means the\nLSA model is significantly preferred by the GW data.

However, a large number\nof antennas deployed in massive MIMO-ISAC raises critical challenges in\nacquiring both accurate channel state information and target parameter\ninformation. To overcome these two challenges with a unified framework, we\nfirst analyze their underlying system models and then propose a novel\ntensor-based approach that addresses both the channel estimation and target\nsensing problems. Specifically, by parameterizing the high-dimensional\ncommunication channel exploiting a small number of physical parameters, we\nassociate the channel state information with the sensing parameters of targets\nin terms of angular, delay, and Doppler dimensions. Then, we propose a shared\ntraining pattern adopting the same time-frequency resources such that both the\nchannel estimation and target parameter estimation can be formulated as a\ncanonical polyadic decomposition problem with a similar mathematical\nexpression. On this basis, we first investigate the uniqueness condition of the\ntensor factorization and the maximum number of resolvable targets by utilizing\nthe specific Vandermonde",

We use a surface density of $320 M_{\\odot} pc^{-2}$,\nrepresentative of the inner 4.0 kpc CMZ of the Milky Way and typical luminous\ngalaxies. Filamentary molecular clouds are formed dynamically via shocks within\na narrow range of velocity dispersions in the CNM of 5 - 10 km/s with a\npreferred value at 8 km/s. Cluster sink particles appear in filaments which\nexceed their critical line mass, occurring optimally for velocity dispersions\nof 8 km/s. Tracking the evolution of magnetic fields, we find that they lead to\ndouble the dense star forming gas than in purely hydro runs.

These models with robust and aligned\nsemantic representations learned from billions of internet image-text pairs and\ncan be applied to various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, in\nsome fine-grained domains like medical imaging and remote sensing, the\nperformance of multi-modal foundation models often leaves much to be desired.\nConsequently, many researchers have begun to explore few-shot adaptation\nmethods for these models, gradually deriving three main technical approaches:\n1) prompt-based methods, 2) adapter-based methods, and 3) external\nknowledge-based methods. Nevertheless, this rapidly developing field has\nproduced numerous results without a comprehensive survey to systematically\norganize the research progress. Therefore, in this survey, we introduce and\nanalyze the research advancements in few-shot adaptation methods for\nmulti-modal models, summarizing commonly used datasets and experimental setups,\nand comparing the results of different methods. In addition, due to the lack of\nreliable theoretical support for existing methods, we derive the few-shot\nadaptation generalization error bound for multi-modal models. The theorem\nreveals that the generalization error of multi-modal foundation models is\nconstrained by three factors: domain gap, model capacity, and sample size.\nBased on this, we propose three possible solutions from the following aspects:\n1) adaptive domain generalization, 2) adaptive model selection, and 3) adaptive\nknowledge utilization.",

Following these works, to\novercome the limitation of evaluating LLMs using static benchmarks, we propose\nto explore competitive games as an evaluation for LLMs to incorporate\nmulti-players and dynamicise the environment. By varying the game history\nrevealed to LLMs-based players, we find that most of LLMs are rational in that\nthey play strategies that can increase their payoffs, but not as rational as\nindicated by Nash Equilibria (NEs). Moreover, when game history are available,\ncertain types of LLMs, such as GPT-4, can converge faster to the NE strategies,\nwhich suggests higher rationality level in comparison to other models. In the\nmeantime, certain types of LLMs can win more often when game history are\navailable, and we argue that the winning rate reflects the reasoning ability\nwith respect to the strategies of other players.

However, existing models usually ignore spatial and\ntemporal information, which might lead to mesh and image misalignment and\ntemporal discontinuity. For this reason, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal\nAlignment Fusion (STAF) model. As a video-based model, it leverages coherence\nclues from human motion by an attention-based Temporal Coherence Fusion Module\n(TCFM). As for spatial mesh-alignment evidence, we extract fine-grained local\ninformation through predicted mesh projection on the feature maps. Based on the\nspatial features, we further introduce a multi-stage adjacent Spatial Alignment\nFusion Module (SAFM) to enhance the feature representation of the target frame.\nIn addition to the above, we propose an Average Pooling Module (APM) to allow\nthe model to focus on the entire input sequence rather than just the target\nframe. This method can remarkably improve the smoothness of recovery results\nfrom video. Extensive experiments on 3DPW, MPII3D, and H36M demonstrate the\nsuperiority of STAF. We achieve a state-of-the-art trade-off between precision\nand smoothness. Our code and more video results are on the project page\nhttps://yw0208.github.io/staf/",

These methods are designed for human vision rather than\nhigh-level vision models; 2. These methods are not efficient enough to serve as\npre-processing on resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes a novel lightweight AFD module to boost the performance of\npre-trained image classification models when facing compressed images. First, a\nFDE-Net is devised to generate the spatial-wise FDM in the DCT domain. Next,\nthe estimated FDM is transmitted to the FE-Net to generate the mapping\nrelationship between degraded features and corresponding high-quality features.\nA simple but effective RepConv block equipped with structural\nre-parameterization is utilized in FE-Net, which enriches feature\nrepresentation in the training phase while maintaining efficiency in the\ndeployment phase. After training on limited compressed images, the AFD-Module\ncan serve as a \"plug-and-play\" model for pre-trained classification models to\nimprove their performance on compressed images. Experiments demonstrate that\nour proposed AFD module can comprehensively improve the accuracy of the\npre-trained classification models and significantly outperform the existing\nmethods.",

                "abstract": "Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based solutions are\nwell-established for limited feedback schemes in frequency division duplex\n(FDD) systems. In recent years, data-aided solutions have been shown to achieve\nhigher performance, enabled by the adaptivity of the feedback scheme to the\npropagation environment of the base station (BS) cell. In particular, a\nversatile limited feedback scheme utilizing Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) was\nrecently introduced. The scheme supports multi-user communications, exhibits\nlow complexity, supports parallelization, and offers significant flexibility\nconcerning various system parameters. Conceptually, a GMM captures environment\nknowledge and is subsequently transferred to the mobile terminals (MTs) for\nonline inference of feedback information. Afterward, the BS designs precoders\nusing either directional information or a generative modeling-based approach. A\nmajor shortcoming of recent works is that the assessed system performance is\nonly evaluated through synthetic simulation data that is generally unable to\nfully characterize the features of real-world environments. It raises the\nquestion of how the GMM-based feedback scheme performs on real-world\nmeasurement data, especially compared to the well-established DFT-based\nsolution. Our experiments reveal that the GMM-based feedback scheme\ntremendously improves the system performance measured in terms of sum-rate,\nallowing to deploy systems with fewer pilots or feedback bits.",

                "abstract": "We introduce the RHDLPP, a flux-limited multigroup radiation hydrodynamics\nnumerical code designed for simulating laser-produced plasmas in diverse\nenvironments. The code bifurcates into two packages: RHDLPP-LTP for\nlow-temperature plasmas generated by moderate-intensity nanosecond lasers, and\nRHDLPP-HTP for high-temperature, high-density plasmas formed by high-intensity\nlaser pulses. The core radiation hydrodynamic equations are resolved in the\nEulerian frame, employing an operator-split method. This method decomposes the\nsolution into two substeps: first, the explicit resolution of the hyperbolic\nsubsystems integrating radiation and fluid dynamics, and second, the implicit\ntreatment of the parabolic part comprising stiff radiation diffusion, heat\nconduction, and energy exchange. Laser propagation and energy deposition are\nmodeled through a hybrid approach, combining geometrical optics ray-tracing in\nsub-critical plasma regions with a one-dimensional solution of the Helmholtz\nwave equation in super-critical areas. The thermodynamic states are ascertained\nusing an equation of state, based on either the real gas approximation or the\nquotidian equation of state (QEOS). Additionally, RHDLPP includes\nRHDLPP-SpeIma3D, a three-dimensional spectral simulation post-processing\nmodule, for generating both temporally-spatially resolved and time-integrated\nspectra and imaging, facilitating direct comparisons with experimental data.\nThe paper showcases a series of verification tests to establish the code's\naccuracy and efficiency, followed by application cases, including simulations\nof laser-produced aluminum (Al) plasmas, pre-pulse-induced target deformation\nof tin (Sn) microdroplets relevant to extreme ultraviolet lithography light\nsources, and varied imaging and spectroscopic simulations.",

The connected $k$-partition polytope of $G$, denoted by $P(G,k)$, is\ndefined as the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all connected\n$k$-subpartitions of $G$. Many applications arising in off-shore oil-drilling,\nforest planning, image processing, cluster analysis, political districting,\npolice patrolling, and biology are modeled in terms of finding connected\n(sub)partitions of a graph.

In recent years, we have focused on the\nadvancement of numerical algorithms based on the fermionic hierarchical\nequations of motion (HEOM) theory. Being in-principle exact, this approach\nallows for the precise characterization of many-body correlations,\nnon-Markovian memory, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. These\nefforts now lead to the establishment of a new computer program, HEOM for\nQUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel, version 2 (HEOM-QUICK2), which, to\nthe best of our knowledge, is currently the only general-purpose simulator for\nfermionic many-body OQS. Compared with version 1, the HEOM-QUICK2 program\nfeatures more efficient solvers for stationary states, more accurate treatment\nof non-Markovian memory, and improved numerical stability for long-time\ndissipative dynamics. Integrated with quantum chemistry software, HEOM-QUICK2\nhas become a valuable theoretical tool for the precise simulation of realistic\nmany-body OQS, particularly the single atomic or molecular junctions.\nFurthermore, the unprecedented precision achieved by HEOM-QUICK2 enables\naccurate simulation of low-energy spin excitations and coherent spin\nrelaxation. The unique usefulness of HEOM-QUICK2 is demonstrated through\nseveral examples of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems under\nnon-equilibrium conditions.

                "abstract": "We present a theoretical study of the medium modifications on the $p_{\\rm T}$\nbalance ($x_{\\rm J}$) of dijets in Xe+Xe collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.44$\nTeV. The initial production of dijets is carried out by the POWHEG+PYTHIA8\nprescription, which matches the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD matrix elements\nwith the parton shower (PS) effect. The in-medium evolution in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions is described by the SHELL model with a transport approach. The\ntheoretical results of the dijet $x_{\\rm J}$ in Xe+Xe collisions exhibit more\nimbalanced distributions than that in p+p, consistent with the recently\nreported ATLAS data. By utilizing the Interleaved Flavor Neutralisation, an\ninfrared-and-collinear-safe jet flavor algorithm, to identify the flavor of the\nreconstructed jets, we classify dijets processes into three categories:\ngluon-gluon ($gg$), quark-gluon ($qg$) and quark-quark ($qq$), and investigate\nthe respective medium modification patterns and fraction changes of the $gg$,\n$qg$, and $qq$ components of the dijet sample in Xe+Xe collisions. It is shown\nthat the $qg$ component plays a key role in the increased imbalance of the\ndijet $x_{\\rm J}$, and especially the $q_1g_2$ (quark-jet-leading) dijets\nexperience more significant asymmetric energy loss than the $g_1q_2$\n(gluon-jet-leading) dijets as traversing the QGP. By comparing the $\\Delta\n\\langle x_{\\rm J}\\rangle$ of inclusive, $c\\bar{c}$ and $b\\bar{b}$ dijets in\nXe+Xe collisions, we observe $\\Delta \\langle x_{\\rm J} \\rangle_{\\rm\nincl.}>\\Delta \\langle x_{\\rm J} \\rangle_{\\rm c\\bar{c}}>\\Delta \\langle x_{\\rm J}\n\\rangle_{\\rm b\\bar{b}}$. Moreover, $\\rho_{\\rm Xe, Pb}$, the ratios of nuclear\nmodification factors of dijets in Xe+Xe to that in Pb+Pb, are calcualted, which\nindicates that the yield suppression of dijets in Pb+Pb is more pronounced than\nthat in Xe+Xe due to the larger radius of the lead nucleus.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available\nsource code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.\nHowever, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within\na specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing\nAPIs. Instead, LLMs often invent, or \"hallucinate\", non-existent APIs or\nproduce variants of already existing code. Although the API information is\navailable to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion\ntechniques from including all relevant context into the prompt. This paper\npresents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds\nthe predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable\nAPI references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable\ncontext information in the prompt. The approach exploits the observation that\nLLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails\nto correctly refer to already existing APIs. De-Hallucinator automatically\nidentifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to\nthe model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt. Our\nevaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in\nopen-source Python projects. We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves\nthe predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the\nmodel only with the code before the cursor. In particular, the approach\nimproves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of\ncorrectly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.",

In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging\nthree distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge\nrule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language\nmodel (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification\n(cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from\nstudent discourse, was investigated.

The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three\napproaches' performance for automated detection and support of students'\nchallenge moments in collaborative learning activities. It argues that,\nalthough LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to\nissues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of\nlearning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity\nevaluation, privacy and confabulation.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Online contextual reasoning and association across consecutive video frames\nare critical to perceive instances in visual tracking. However, most current\ntop-performing trackers persistently lean on sparse temporal relationships\nbetween reference and search frames via an offline mode. Consequently, they can\nonly interact independently within each image-pair and establish limited\ntemporal correlations. To alleviate the above problem, we propose a simple,\nflexible and effective video-level tracking pipeline, named \\textbf{ODTrack},\nwhich densely associates the contextual relationships of video frames in an\nonline token propagation manner. ODTrack receives video frames of arbitrary\nlength to capture the spatio-temporal trajectory relationships of an instance,\nand compresses the discrimination features (localization information) of a\ntarget into a token sequence to achieve frame-to-frame association. This new\nsolution brings the following benefits: 1) the purified token sequences can\nserve as prompts for the inference in the next video frame, whereby past\ninformation is leveraged to guide future inference; 2) the complex online\nupdate strategies are effectively avoided by the iterative propagation of token\nsequences, and thus we can achieve more efficient model representation and\ncomputation. ODTrack achieves a new \\textit{SOTA} performance on seven\nbenchmarks, while running at real-time speed. Code and models are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack}.",

However, Coordinated Inhautentic Behaviour (CIB),\ndefined as orchestrated efforts by entities to deceive or mislead users about\ntheir identity and intentions, has emerged as a tactic to exploit the online\ndiscourse. In this study, we quantify the efficacy of CIB tactics by defining a\ngeneral framework for evaluating the influence of a subset of nodes in a\ndirected tree. We design two algorithms that provide optimal and greedy\npost-hoc placement strategies that lead to maximising the configuration\ninfluence. We then consider cascades from information spreading on Twitter to\ncompare the observed behaviour with our algorithms. The results show that,\naccording to our model, coordinated accounts are quite inefficient in terms of\ntheir network influence, thus suggesting that they may play a less pivotal role\nthan expected. Moreover, the causes of these poor results may be found in two\nseparate aspects: a bad placement strategy and a scarcity of resources.",

For this purpose, an original\nmodel has been developed, based on particle interaction forces exponentially\ndecreasing with distance . This model allows for accurate simulation of\ncollisions with the coefficient of restitution anywhere between zero and one.\nThe implementation is notably simple as it employs readily available high order\nODE solvers with time step adaptivity, resolving the moments of collision in a\nnatural way. For the modeling of the freezing and thawing processes, two\napproaches have been utilized: The phase field approach has been compared to\nthe more simple solution of the heat equation in a heterogeneous medium, with\nphase transitions focusing based on temperature. The phase field approach\nconsiders the effects of surface tension leading to premelting, whereas the\nsimplified model assumes that surface tension is neglected. The formulation of\nboth models contains novel components tailored for the given situation. Their\nnumerical solution has been implemented using an efficient hybrid parallel\nalgorithm based on the finite volume method and the Runge-Kutta-Merson solver\nwith adaptive time stepping. Qualitative comparison of the results of both\nphase transition modeling approaches is performed and the influence of surface\ntension is analyzed. Numerical stability, accuracy, and computational costs are\nalso discussed.",

However, the amplitude from such a source is very weak and current\ngravitational-wave interferometers have yet to witness such a signal. The lack\nof detections has provided upper limits on the size of the involved\ndeformations, which are continually being constrained. With expected\nimprovements in detector sensitivities and analysis techniques, there is good\nreason to anticipate an observation in the future. This review concerns the\ncurrent state of the theory of neutron-star mountains. These exotic objects\nhost the extreme regimes of modern physics, which are related to how they\nsustain mountains. We summarise various mechanisms that may give rise to\nasymmetries, including crustal strains built up during the evolutionary history\nof the neutron star, the magnetic field distorting the star's shape and\naccretion episodes gradually constructing a mountain. Moving beyond the simple\nrotating model, we also discuss how precession affects the dynamics and\nmodifies the gravitational-wave signal. We describe the prospects for detection\nand the challenges moving forward.",

We reinvestigate the representative but debated chiral CDW of\nTiSe$_{2}$ using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations. Our STM data reveal unambiguously the chiral\ndistortion of the topmost Se layer in domains of opposite chirality, which are\ninterfaced with a novel domain wall. DFT calculations find the atomic structure\nof the chiral CDW, which has a $C2$ symmetry with the inversion and reflection\nsymmetry broken. The chirality is determined by the helicity of Se-Ti bond\ndistortions and their translation between neighboring layers. The present\nstructure reproduces well the STM images with lower energy than the prevailing\nnon-chiral $P\\bar{3}c1$ structure model.

                "abstract": "E-commerce platforms usually present an ordered list, mixed with several\norganic items and an advertisement, in response to each user's page view\nrequest. This list, the outcome of ad auction and allocation processes,\ndirectly impacts the platform's ad revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV).\nSpecifically, the ad auction determines which ad is displayed and the\ncorresponding payment, while the ad allocation decides the display positions of\nthe advertisement and organic items. The prevalent methods of segregating the\nad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad\nauction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual\ndisplay position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad\nallocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad's payment to determine the\ndisplay position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC)\nfor the advertisement. For instance, in the auction stage employing the\ntraditional Generalized Second Price (GSP) , even if the winning ad increases\nits bid, its payment remains unchanged. This implies that the advertisement\ncannot secure a better position and thus loses the opportunity to achieve\nhigher utility in the subsequent ad allocation stage.

The quantum fields modeling the\nHawking radiation have a scale and are consistently inherited from a conformal\nparent theory; their symmetries are thus compatible with those of curved\nbackgrounds. We demonstrate explicitly that the existence of islands is\nsensitive to the choice of CFT used to model the Hawking radiation.

This paper\nintroduces AIGCBench, a pioneering comprehensive and scalable benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate a variety of video generation tasks, with a primary focus\non Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. AIGCBench tackles the limitations of\nexisting benchmarks, which suffer from a lack of diverse datasets, by including\na varied and open-domain image-text dataset that evaluates different\nstate-of-the-art algorithms under equivalent conditions. We employ a novel text\ncombiner and GPT-4 to create rich text prompts, which are then used to generate\nimages via advanced Text-to-Image models. To establish a unified evaluation\nframework for video generation tasks, our benchmark includes 11 metrics\nspanning four dimensions to assess algorithm performance. These dimensions are\ncontrol-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video\nquality. These metrics are both reference video-dependent and video-free,\nensuring a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The evaluation standard proposed\ncorrelates well with human judgment, providing insights into the strengths and\nweaknesses of current I2V algorithms. The findings from our extensive\nexperiments aim to stimulate further research and development in the I2V field.\nAIGCBench represents a significant step toward creating standardized benchmarks\nfor the broader AIGC landscape, proposing an adaptable and equitable framework\nfor future assessments of video generation tasks.",

Recent work suggested a co-learning strategy to\nimprove the quality of the generated target pseudo-labels using robust\npretrained networks such as Swin-B. However, since the generated pseudo-labels\ndepend on the source model, they may be noisy due to domain shift. In this\npaper, we view SFDA from the perspective of label noise learning and learn to\nde-confuse the pseudo-labels.

Estimating the noise transition\nmatrix enables a better true class-posterior estimation results with better\nprediction accuracy.

Despite\nadvantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive\nredundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and\ncompact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated\ninformation blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images\n(WSIs) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic\ndata, leading to an ``intra-modal redundancy\" issue.

We introduce two new stacking approaches for\nDDML: short-stacking exploits the cross-fitting step of DDML to substantially\nreduce the computational burden and pooled stacking enforces common stacking\nweights over cross-fitting folds. Using calibrated simulation studies and two\napplications estimating gender gaps in citations and wages, we show that DDML\nwith stacking is more robust to partially unknown functional forms than common\nalternative approaches based on single pre-selected learners.

While the amodal segmentation task is to predict the\ncomplete mask of partially occluded objects, it is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive to annotate the pixel-level ground truth amodal masks.\nBox-level supervised amodal segmentation addresses this challenge by relying\nsolely on ground truth bounding boxes and instance classes as supervision,\nthereby alleviating the need for exhaustive pixel-level annotations.\nNevertheless, current box-level methodologies encounter limitations in\ngenerating low-resolution masks and imprecise boundaries, failing to meet the\ndemands of practical real-world applications. We present a novel solution to\ntackle this problem by introducing a directed expansion approach from visible\nmasks to corresponding amodal masks. Our approach involves a hybrid end-to-end\nnetwork based on the overlapping region - the area where different instances\nintersect. Diverse segmentation strategies are applied for overlapping regions\nand non-overlapping regions according to distinct characteristics. To guide the\nexpansion of visible masks, we introduce an elaborately-designed connectivity\nloss for overlapping regions, which leverages correlations with visible masks\nand facilitates accurate amodal segmentation.

A failure of the cellular GBS, fully or partially, during natural or\nman-made disasters creates a communication gap in the disaster-affected areas.\nIn such situations, public safety communication (PSC) can significantly save\nthe national infrastructure, property, and lives. Throughout emergencies, the\nPSC can provide mission-critical communication and video transmission services\nin the affected area. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations\n(UAV-BSs) are particularly suitable for PSC services as they are flexible,\nmobile, and easily deployable. This manuscript considers a multi-UAV-assisted\nPSC network with an observational UAV receiving videos from the affected area's\nground users (AGUs) and transmitting them to the nearby GBS via a relay UAV.\nThe objective of the proposed study is to maximize the average utility of the\nvideo streams generated by the AGUs upon reaching the GBS. This is achieved by\noptimizing the positions of the observational and relay UAVs, as well as the\ndistribution of communication resources, such as bandwidth, and transmit power,\nwhile satisfying the system-designed constraints, such as transmission rate,\nrate outage probability, transmit power budget, and available bandwidth. To\nthis end, a joint UAVs placement and resource allocation problem is\nmathematically formulated. The proposed problem poses a significant challenge\nfor a solution. Considering the block coordinate descent and successive convex\napproximation techniques, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed.\nFinally, simulation results are provided which show that our proposed approach\noutperforms the existing methods.",

The assumptions of mass action, chemostatic conditions and\nstationarity in stochastic feeding dynamics lead to Holling type II functional\nresponses, whose use is widespread in macroscopic models of population\ndynamics. However, to be useful for parameter inference, stochastic population\nmodels need to be identifiable, this meaning that model parameters can be\nuniquely inferred from a large number of model observations. In this\ncontribution we study parameter identifiability in a multi-resource\nconsumer-resource model, for which we can obtain the steady-state and\nout-of-equilibrium probability distributions of predator's abundances by\nanalytically solving the master equation. Based on these analytical results, we\ncan conduct in silico experiments by tracking the abundance of consumers that\nare either searching for or handling prey, data then used for maximum\nlikelihood parameter estimation. We show that, when model observations are\nrecorded out of equilibrium, feeding parameters are truly identifiable, whereas\nif sampling is done at stationarity, only ratios of rates can be inferred from\ndata. We discuss the implications of our results when inferring parameters of\ngeneral dynamical models.",

                "abstract": "The primary objective of this work is to construct spaces that are\n\"pseudocompact but not countably compact,\" abbreviated as PNC, while endowing\nthem with additional properties. First, motivated by an old problem of van\nDouwen, we construct from CH a locally compact and locally countable first\ncountable PNC space with countable spread. A space is deemed \"densely countably\ncompact\", denoted as DCC for brevity, if it possesses a dense, countable\ncompact subspace. Moreover, a space qualifies as \"densely relatively countably\ncompact\", abbreviated as DRC, if it contains a dense subset $D$ such that every\ninfinite subset of $D$ has an accumulation point in $X$. A countably compact\nspace is DCC, a DCC space is DRC, and a DRC space is evidently pseudocompact.\nThe Tychonoff plank is a DCC space but is not countably compact. A $\\Psi$-space\nbelongs to the class of DRC spaces but is not DCC. Lastly, if $p\\in {\\omega}^*$\nis not a P-point, then $T(p)$, representing the type of $p$ in ${\\omega}^*$,\nconstitutes a pseudocompact subspace of ${\\omega}^*$ that is not \\DRC. When\nconsidering a topological property denoted as $Q$, we define a space $X$ as\n\"hereditarily $Q$\" if every regular closed subspace of $X$ also possesses\nproperty $Q$. The Tychonoff plank and the $\\Psi$-spaces are not hereditary\nexamples. However, the aforementioned space $T(p)$ is a hereditary example,\nalbeit not being first countable.\n  In this paper we want to find (first countable) examples which separates\nthese properties hereditarily. We have obtained the following result.\n  (1) There is a DCC space $X$ such that no $H\\in RC(X)^+$ is countably\ncompact.\n  (2) If CH holds, then there is a DRC space $Y$ such that no $H\\in RC(Y)^+$ is\nDCC.\n  (3) If CH holds, then there is a first countable pseudocompact space $Z$ such\nthat no $H\\in RC(Z)^+$ is DRC.",

                "abstract": "Anomaly detection on attributed networks aims to find the nodes whose\nbehaviors are significantly different from other majority nodes. Generally,\nnetwork data contains information about relationships between entities, and the\nanomaly is usually embodied in these relationships. Therefore, how to\ncomprehensively model complex interaction patterns in networks is still a major\nfocus. It can be observed that anomalies in networks violate the homophily\nassumption. However, most existing studies only considered this phenomenon\nobliquely rather than explicitly. Besides, the node representation of normal\nentities can be perturbed easily by the noise relationships introduced by\nanomalous nodes. To address the above issues, we present a novel contrastive\nlearning framework for anomaly detection on attributed networks,\n\\textbf{SCALA}, aiming to improve the embedding quality of the network and\nprovide a new measurement of qualifying the anomaly score for each node by\nintroducing sparsification into the conventional method.

In this work, we shed light on the\nprevalence of non-atomic arbitrage on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the\nEthereum blockchain. Importantly, non-atomic arbitrage exploits price\ndifferences between DEXes on the Ethereum blockchain as well as exchanges\noutside the Ethereum blockchain (i.e., centralized exchanges or DEXes on other\nblockchains). Thus, non-atomic arbitrage is a type of MEV that involves actions\non and off the Ethereum blockchain.\n  In our study of non-atomic arbitrage, we uncover that more than a fourth of\nthe volume on Ethereum's biggest five DEXes from the merge until 31 October\n2023 can likely be attributed to this type of MEV.

Such a setting is characteristic of several practical QKD\nprotocols. Due to non-orthogonality, the receiver is not able to discriminate\nunambiguously between the signals. To understand the fundamental limits that\nthis imposes, the quantity of interest is the maximum mutual information\nbetween the transmitter (Alice) and the receiver, whether legitimate (Bob) or\nan eavesdropper (Eve). To find the optimal measurement we use a framework based\non operator algebra and general results derived from singular value\ndecomposition, achieving optimal solutions for von Neumann measurements and\npositive operator-valued measures (POVMs). The formal proof and quantitative\nanalysis elaborated for two signals allow one to conclude that optimal von\nNeumann measurements are uniquely defined and provide a higher information gain\ncompared to POVMs. Interestingly, collective measurements not only do not\nprovide additional information gain with respect to individual ones, but also\nsuffer from a gain reduction in the case of POVMs.",

In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V\nas a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to\ncomplete tasks on any given website. We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent\nthat harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting\non the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark. In addition to\nstandard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online\nevaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live\nwebsites. We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents - it\ncan successfully complete 50% of the tasks on live websites if we manually\nground its textual plans into actions on the websites. This substantially\noutperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2)\nspecifically fine-tuned for web agents. However, grounding still remains a\nmajor challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting\nturns out not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy we\ndevelop in this paper leverages both the HTML text and visuals.

The number of mobile\ndevices has increased exponentially and data traffic has almost doubled every\nyear. Undoubtedly, the rate of growth will continue to be rapid with the\nexplosive increase in demands for data rates, latency, massive connectivity,\nnetwork reliability, and energy efficiency. In order to manage this level of\ngrowth and meet these requirements, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile\ncommunications network is envisioned as a revolutionary advancement combining\nvarious improvements to previous mobile generation networks and new\ntechnologies, including the use of millimeter wavebands (mm-wave), massive\nmultiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) multi-beam antennas, network\ndensification, dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission, and new\nwaveforms with mixed numerologies. New revolutionary features including\nterahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks\n(NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G\nnetworks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key\ntechnologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and\nbeyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates\nsignificant interference that needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, it is\nessential to design effective interference management schemes to mitigate\nsevere and sometimes unpredictable interference in mobile networks. In this\npaper, we provide a comprehensive review of interference management in 5G and\nBeyond networks and discuss its future evolution. We start with a unified\nclassification and a detailed explanation of the different types of\ninterference and continue by presenting our taxonomy of existing interference\nmanagement approaches. Then, after explaining interference measurement reports\nand signaling, we provide for each type of interference identified, an in-depth\nliterature review and technical discussion of appropriate management schemes.\nWe finish by discussing the main interference challenges that will be\nencountered in future 6G networks and by presenting insights on the suggested\nnew interference management approaches, including useful guidelines for an\nAI-based solution. This review will provide a first-hand guide to the industry\nin determining the most relevant technology for interference management, and\nwill also allow for consideration of future challenges and research directions.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Striking a balance between precision and efficiency presents a prominent\nchallenge in the bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection. Although previous\ncamera-based BEV methods achieved remarkable performance by incorporating\nlong-term temporal information, most of them still face the problem of low\nefficiency. One potential solution is knowledge distillation. Existing\ndistillation methods only focus on reconstructing spatial features, while\noverlooking temporal knowledge. To this end, we propose TempDistiller, a\nTemporal knowledge Distiller, to acquire long-term memory from a teacher\ndetector when provided with a limited number of frames. Specifically, a\nreconstruction target is formulated by integrating long-term temporal knowledge\nthrough self-attention operation applied to feature teachers. Subsequently,\nnovel features are generated for masked student features via a generator.\nUltimately, we utilize this reconstruction target to reconstruct the student\nfeatures. In addition, we also explore temporal relational knowledge when\ninputting full frames for the student model. We verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed method on the nuScenes benchmark. The experimental results show our\nmethod obtain an enhancement of +1.6 mAP and +1.1 NDS compared to the baseline,\na speed improvement of approximately 6 FPS after compressing temporal\nknowledge, and the most accurate velocity estimation.",

                "abstract": "In this paper we propose a minimal model for free reeds taking into account\nthe significant phenomena. This free reed model may be used to build models of\nfree reed instruments which permit numerical simulations. Several definitions\nfor the section by which the airflow passes through the reed are reviewed and a\nnew one is proposed which takes into account the entire escape area under the\nreed and the reed thickness. To derive this section, it is necessary to\ndistinguish the neutral section (the only section of the reed which always\nkeeps its length constant while moving) from the upstream or downstream\nsections. A minimal configuration is chosen to permit the instabilities of both\n(-,+) and (+,-) reeds on the basis of a linear analysis of instabilities\nconditions. This configuration is used to illustrate, with temporal\nsimulations, the minimal model for both kinds of reeds and to discuss the model\nassumptions. Some clues are given about the influence, on the playing frequency\nand on the dynamic of the sound, of two main parameters of the geometrical\nmodel: the size of the volume and the level of the excitation. It is shown that\nthe playing frequency of a (+,-) reed can vary in a large range according to\nthe size of the volume upstream of the reed; that the playing frequency is\nnearly independent of the excitation but that the dynamic of the sound\nincreases with the excitation level. Some clues are also proposed to determine\nthe nature of the bifurcation for free reeds: it seems that free reeds may\npresent inverse bifurcations. The influence of the reed thickness is also\nstudied for configurations where the reed length or the reed width vary to keep\nthe mass constant. This study shows that the reed thickness can have a great\ninfluence on the sound magnitude, the playing frequency and the magnitude of\nthe reed displacement which justifies its introduction in the reed model.This\narticle has been published in Acta Acustica united with Acustica, Vol. 93\n(2007), p. 122-144.",

For an example of the liner advection, we\nconsider the $O(n)$ model in the steady shear. Our scaling analysis reveals\nthat the model can undergo the continuous symmetry breaking even in $d=2$ and,\nmoreover, predicts the upper critical dimension $d_{\\rm up}=2$. These results\nare fully consistent with a recent numerical simulation of the $O(2)$ model,\nwhere the authors reported a continuous symmetry breaking characterized by the\nmean-field critical exponents in $d=2$. For an example of the non-linear\nadvection, we consider Toner and Tu model, which was introduced to explain the\npolar-ordered flocks observed, for instance, in the Vicsek model in $d=2$. Our\nsimple scaling argument reproduces the previous results by the dynamical\nrenormalization theory. We furthermore discuss the effects of the additional\nnon-linear terms discovered by the recent re-analysis of the hydrodynamic\nequation of the polar-ordered flocks. Our scaling argument predicts that the\nadditional non-linear terms modify the scaling exponents and, in particular,\nrecover the isotropic scaling behavior reported in the previous numerical\nsimulation of the Vicsek model.",

Existing studies solely relied on pure visual networks, while in\nthis paper we solved FSCIL by leveraging the Vision-Language model (e.g., CLIP)\nand propose a simple yet effective framework, named Learning Prompt with\nDistribution-based Feature Replay (LP-DiF). We observe that simply using CLIP\nfor zero-shot evaluation can substantially outperform the most influential\nmethods. Then, prompt tuning technique is involved to further improve its\nadaptation ability, allowing the model to continually capture specific\nknowledge from each session. To prevent the learnable prompt from forgetting\nold knowledge in the new session, we propose a pseudo-feature replay approach.\nSpecifically, we preserve the old knowledge of each class by maintaining a\nfeature-level Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, which is\nestimated by the image features of training images and synthesized features\ngenerated from a VAE. When progressing to a new session, pseudo-features are\nsampled from old-class distributions combined with training images of the\ncurrent session to optimize the prompt, thus enabling the model to learn new\nknowledge while retaining old knowledge.

This study examines the ever-changing field of EVCI and the\ncritical role of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in mitigating the problems\nwith grid management that result from unorganized EV charging and intermittency\nin DER. Also, the possibility of energy sharing in electrical distribution\nsystems for microgrids and EVCI on various energy-sharing methods and\nalgorithms are discussed in detail.

The ability to arbitrarily engineer their resonant frequencies is\ncrucial for exploring novel physics in synthetic frequency dimensions and\npractical applications like nonlinear optical parametric processes and\ndispersion-engineered frequency comb generation. Photonic crystal ring (PhCR)\nresonators are a versatile tool for such arbitrary frequency engineering, by\ncontrollably creating mode splitting at selected resonances. To date, these\nPhCRs have mostly been demonstrated in isotropic photonic materials, while such\nengineering could be significantly more complicated in anisotropic platforms\nthat often offer more fruitful optical properties. Here, we realize the\nspectral engineering of chip-scale optical microresonators in the anisotropic\nlithium niobate (LN) crystal by a gradient design that precisely compensates\nfor variations in both refractive index and perturbation strength. We\nexperimentally demonstrate controllable frequency splitting at single and\nmultiple selected resonances in LN PhCR resonators with different sizes, while\nmaintaining high Q-factors up to 1 million. Moreover, we experimentally\nconstruct a sharp boundary in the synthetic frequency dimension based on an\nactively modulated x-cut LN gradient-PhCR, opening up new paths toward the\narbitrary control of electro-optic comb spectral shapes and exploration of\nnovel physics in the frequency degree of freedom.",

Also prior works in the area of\nmedical question summarisation have been limited to the English language. This\nwork introduces the task of multimodal medical question summarization for\ncodemixed input in a low-resource setting. To address this gap, we introduce\nthe Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization MMCQS dataset, which\ncombines Hindi-English codemixed medical queries with visual aids. This\nintegration enriches the representation of a patient's medical condition,\nproviding a more comprehensive perspective. We also propose a framework named\nMedSumm that leverages the power of LLMs and VLMs for this task. By utilizing\nour MMCQS dataset, we demonstrate the value of integrating visual information\nfrom images to improve the creation of medically detailed summaries. This\nmultimodal strategy not only improves healthcare decision-making but also\npromotes a deeper comprehension of patient queries, paving the way for future\nexploration in personalized and responsive medical care.

In this Letter, we present a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis of the effects of both temporally\nuncorrelated and correlated quantum noises on entanglement generation and\ninformation protection. This investigation reveals that entanglement within the\nsystem follows $q^{-1/3}$ scaling for both types of quantum noises, where $q$\nrepresents the noise probability. The scaling arises from the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuation with effective length scale $L_{\\text{eff}}\n\\sim q^{-1}$. Moreover, the timescales of information protection are explored\nand shown to follow $q^{-1/2}$ and $q^{-2/3}$ scaling for temporally\nuncorrelated and correlated noises, respectively. The former scaling can be\ninterpreted as a Hayden-Preskill protocol, while the latter is a direct\nconsequence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. We conduct extensive numerical\nsimulations using stabilizer formalism to support the theoretical\nunderstanding. This Letter not only contributes to a deeper understanding of\nthe interplay between quantum noises and measurement-induced phase transition\nbut also provides a new perspective to understand the effects of Markovian and\nnon-Markovian noises on quantum computation.",

It is\ninteresting to find the scalable conditions in minimizing the equal-time\nsecond-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ for each magnon with respect to\n$N$. In particular, the simultaneous blockade is optimized when (i) the\ndetuning between the qubit (magnon) and the probing (driving field) field is\n$\\sqrt{N}$ times the magnon-qubit coupling strength, (ii) the probing intensity\nis $3\\sqrt{N}$ times the driving intensity, and (iii) the relative phase\nbetween probing and driving fields is $2/(3\\sqrt{N}$) times the ratio of the\nsystem decay rate to the magnon-qubit coupling strength.

                "abstract": "For long wavelength gravitational wave (GW), it is easy to diffract when it\nis lensed by celestial objects. Traditional diffractive integral formula has\nignored large angle diffraction, which is adopted in most of cases. However, in\nsome special cases (e. g. a GW source lensed by its companion in a binary\nsystem, where the lens is very close to the source), large angle diffraction\ncould be important. Our previous works have proposed a new general diffractive\nintegral formula which has including large angle diffraction case. In this\npaper, we have investigated how much difference between this general\ndiffractive formula and traditional diffractive integral formula could be under\nthese special cases with different parameters. We find that the module of\namplification factor for general diffractive formula could become smaller than\nthat of traditional diffractive integral basically with a factor\n$r_F\\simeq0.674$ when the distance between lens and sources is $D_{\\rm LS}=1$\nAU and lens mass $M_{\\rm L}=1M_\\odot$. Their difference is so significant that\nit is detectable. Furthermore, we find that the proportionality factor $r_F$ is\ngradually increasing from 0.5 to 1 with increasing $D_{\\rm LS}$ and it is\ndecreasing with increasing $M_{\\rm L}$. As long as $D_{\\rm LS}\\lesssim3$ AU\n(with $M_{\\rm L}=1M_\\odot$) or $M_{\\rm L}\\gtrsim0.1M_\\odot$ (with $D_{\\rm\nLS}=1$ AU ), the difference between new and traditional formulas is enough\nsignificant to be detectable. It is promising to test this new general\ndiffractive formula by next-generation GW detectors in the future GW detection.",

                "abstract": "Spatio-temporal video grounding (or STVG) task aims at locating a\nspatio-temporal tube for a specific instance given a text query. Despite\nadvancements, current methods easily suffer the distractors or heavy object\nappearance variations in videos due to insufficient object information from the\ntext, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we propose a novel framework,\ncontext-guided STVG (CG-STVG), which mines discriminative instance context for\nobject in videos and applies it as a supplementary guidance for target\nlocalization. The key of CG-STVG lies in two specially designed modules,\nincluding instance context generation (ICG), which focuses on discovering\nvisual context information (in both appearance and motion) of the instance, and\ninstance context refinement (ICR), which aims to improve the instance context\nfrom ICG by eliminating irrelevant or even harmful information from the\ncontext. During grounding, ICG, together with ICR, are deployed at each\ndecoding stage of a Transformer architecture for instance context learning.\nParticularly, instance context learned from one decoding stage is fed to the\nnext stage, and leveraged as a guidance containing rich and discriminative\nobject feature to enhance the target-awareness in decoding feature, which\nconversely benefits generating better new instance context for improving\nlocalization finally. Compared to existing methods, CG-STVG enjoys object\ninformation in text query and guidance from mined instance visual context for\nmore accurate target localization. In our experiments on three benchmarks,\nincluding HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG, CG-STVG sets new state-of-the-arts in\nm_tIoU and m_vIoU on all of them, showing its efficacy.

In general, the key to\nachieving accurate UAV-satellite image matching lies in extracting visual\nfeatures that are robust against viewpoint changes, scale variations, and\nrotations. Current works have shown that part matching is crucial for UAV\nvisual geo-localization since part-level representations can capture image\ndetails and help to understand the semantic information of scenes. However, the\nimportance of preserving semantic characteristics in part-level representations\nis not well discussed. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based adaptive\nsemantic aggregation method that regards parts as the most representative\nsemantics in an image. Correlations of image patches to different parts are\nlearned in terms of the transformer's feature map. Then our method decomposes\npart-level features into an adaptive sum of all patch features.

A\nHeaviside composite function is a composite of a Heaviside function (i.e., the\nindicator function of either the open $( \\, 0,\\infty )$ or closed $[ \\,\n0,\\infty \\, )$ interval) with a possibly nondifferentiable function.\nModeling-wise, we show how Heaviside composite optimization provides a unified\nformulation for learning the optimal multi-class classification and\nmulti-action treatment rules, subject to rule-dependent constraints stipulating\na variety of domain restrictions. A Heaviside composite function has an\nequivalent discrete formulation %in terms of integer variables, and the\nresulting optimization problem can in principle be solved by integer\nprogramming (IP) methods. Nevertheless, for constrained learning problems with\nlarge data sets, %of modest or large sizes, a straightforward application of\noff-the-shelf IP solvers is usually ineffective in achieving global optimality.\nTo alleviate such a computational burden, our major contribution is the\nproposal of the PIP method by leveraging the effectiveness of state-of-the-art\nIP solvers for problems of modest sizes. We provide the theoretical advantage\nof the PIP method with the connection to continuous optimization and show that\nthe computed solution is locally optimal for a broad class of Heaviside\ncomposite optimization problems.

However, existing\nEMT-based FS methods suffer from several limitations, such as a single mode of\nmultitask generation, conducting the same generic evolutionary search for all\ntasks, relying on implicit transfer mechanisms through sole solution encodings,\nand employing single-objective transformation, which result in inadequate\nknowledge acquisition, exploitation, and transfer. To this end, this paper\ndevelops a novel EMT framework for multiobjective high-dimensional feature\nselection problems, namely MO-FSEMT. In particular, multiple auxiliary tasks\nare constructed by distinct formulation methods to provide diverse search\nspaces and information representations and then simultaneously addressed with\nthe original task through a multi-slover-based multitask optimization scheme.\nEach task has an independent population with task-specific representations and\nis solved using separate evolutionary solvers with different biases and search\npreferences. A task-specific knowledge transfer mechanism is designed to\nleverage the advantage information of each task, enabling the discovery and\neffective transmission of high-quality solutions during the search process.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our MO-FSEMT framework can\nachieve overall superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art FS\nmethods on 26 datasets.

To address\nthis challenge, a novel method utilizing only two dipole magnets is presented\nin this article. By adjusting the magnet strengths, the electron beams can be\nguided along different angular directions towards a specific position as deep\nas 20 cm inside a water phantom, creating a maximum dose over the target region\nand significantly reducing the entrance dose Supported by Monte Carlo\nsimulations, such a beam delivery approach contains two major advantages over\nprevious methods: first, it is insensitive to beam energy spread, releasing the\nconstraints on accelerator performance, and second, the dose peak position can\nbe accurately controlled in both lateral and longitudinal directions. In\naddition, we also show that a flattop dose peak can be generated by the\nweighted sum of VHEE beams focusing at different positions.

Using multi-modal data, whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical\ninformation, can improve the performance of deep learning models in the\ndiagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. However, clinical information is\nnot easy to collect in clinical practice due to privacy concerns, limited\nresources, lack of interoperability, etc. Although patient selection can ensure\nthe training set to have multi-modal data for model development, missing\nmodality of clinical information can appear during test. This normally leads to\nperformance degradation, which limits the use of multi-modal models in the\nclinic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional distillation\nframework consisting of a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch. The\nsingle-modal branch acquires the complete multi-modal knowledge from the\nmulti-modal branch, while the multi-modal learns the robust features of WSI\nfrom the single-modal.

                "abstract": "Despite the recent progress in deep neural networks (DNNs), it remains\nchallenging to explain the predictions made by DNNs. Existing explanation\nmethods for DNNs mainly focus on post-hoc explanations where another\nexplanatory model is employed to provide explanations. The fact that post-hoc\nmethods can fail to reveal the actual original reasoning process of DNNs raises\nthe need to build DNNs with built-in interpretability. Motivated by this, many\nself-explaining neural networks have been proposed to generate not only\naccurate predictions but also clear and intuitive insights into why a\nparticular decision was made. However, existing self-explaining networks are\nlimited in providing distribution-free uncertainty quantification for the two\nsimultaneously generated prediction outcomes (i.e., a sample's final prediction\nand its corresponding explanations for interpreting that prediction).\nImportantly, they also fail to establish a connection between the confidence\nvalues assigned to the generated explanations in the interpretation layer and\nthose allocated to the final predictions in the ultimate prediction layer. To\ntackle the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we design a novel\nuncertainty modeling framework for self-explaining networks, which not only\ndemonstrates strong distribution-free uncertainty modeling performance for the\ngenerated explanations in the interpretation layer but also excels in producing\nefficient and effective prediction sets for the final predictions based on the\ninformative high-level basis explanations. We perform the theoretical analysis\nfor the proposed framework. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the\neffectiveness of the proposed uncertainty framework.",

A limitation on its solution by numerics is posed by the sign\nproblem, which constrains the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo techniques\nat sufficiently low temperatures and large lattice sizes, where a potential\nsignature of polarized superfluidity would be unambiguous. By using a recently\nexplored argument that the sign problem may be used instead to infer quantum\ncritical behavior, we explore the regime where partial polarization occurs in\nthe phase diagram, further showing that the average sign $\\langle {\\cal\nS}\\rangle$ of quantum Monte Carlo weights tracks the criticality between\nbalanced (or fully polarized) and polarized phases.

                "abstract": "Quantization is of significance for compressing the over-parameterized deep\nneural models and deploying them on resource-limited devices. Fixed-precision\nquantization suffers from performance drop due to the limited numerical\nrepresentation ability. Conversely, mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is\nadvocated to compress the model effectively by allocating heterogeneous\nbit-width for layers. MPQ is typically organized into a searching-retraining\ntwo-stage process. Previous works only focus on determining the optimal\nbit-width configuration in the first stage efficiently, while ignoring the\nconsiderable time costs in the second stage. However, retraining always\nconsumes hundreds of GPU-hours on the cutting-edge GPUs, thus hindering\ndeployment efficiency significantly. In this paper, we devise a one-shot\ntraining-searching paradigm for mixed-precision model compression.\nSpecifically, in the first stage, all potential bit-width configurations are\ncoupled and thus optimized simultaneously within a set of shared weights.\nHowever, our observations reveal a previously unseen and severe bit-width\ninterference phenomenon among highly coupled weights during optimization,\nleading to considerable performance degradation under a high compression ratio.\nTo tackle this problem, we first design a bit-width scheduler to dynamically\nfreeze the most turbulent bit-width of layers during training, to ensure the\nrest bit-widths converged properly. Then, taking inspiration from information\ntheory, we present an information distortion mitigation technique to align the\nbehaviour of the bad-performing bit-widths to the well-performing ones.",

These\nthree relations consist of the standard and two redshift-evolutionary\n$L_X$-$L_{UV}$ relations which are constructed respectively by considering a\nredshift dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars and using the\nstatistical tool called copula. By employing the PAge approximation for a\ncosmological-model-independent description of the cosmic background evolution\nand dividing the quasar data into the low-redshift and high-redshift parts, we\nfind that the constraints on the PAge parameters from the low-redshift and\nhigh-redshift data, which are obtained with the redshift-evolutionary\nrelations, are consistent with each other, while they are not when the standard\nrelation is considered. If the data are used to constrain the coefficients of\nthe relations and the PAge parameters simultaneously, then the observations\nsupport the redshift-evolutionary relations at more than $3\\sigma$. The Akaike\nand Bayes information criteria indicate that there is strong evidence against\nthe standard relation and mild evidence against the redshift-evolutionary\nrelation constructed by considering a redshift dependent correction to the\nluminosities of quasars.

By employing a\ncompact 7B-parameter LLaMA-2 model and focusing exclusively on a curated set of\nastronomy corpus -- comprising abstracts, introductions, and conclusions -- we\nachieve notable improvements in specialized topic comprehension. While general\nLLMs like GPT-4 outperform in broader question-answering scenarios due to\nsuperior reasoning capabilities, our findings suggest that continual\npre-training with limited resources can still enhance model performance on\nspecialized topics. Additionally, we present an extension of AstroLLaMA: the\nfine-tuning of the 7B LLaMA model on a domain-specific conversational dataset,\nculminating in the release of the chat-enabled AstroLLaMA for community use.\nComprehensive quantitative benchmarking is currently in progress and will be\ndetailed in an upcoming full paper.

The double\ncone model is defined by three non-dimensional geometric parameters: fore- and\naft-cone angles ($\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$), and ratio of the conical slant\nlengths ($\\Lambda$). Previous studies of oscillations have been qualitative in\nnature, and mostly restricted to a special case of the cone model with fixed\n$\\theta_1 = 0^\\circ$ and $\\theta_2 = 90^\\circ$ (referred to as the\nspike-cylinder model), where $\\Lambda$ becomes the sole governing parameter. In\nthe present effort we investigate the self-sustained flow oscillations in the\n$\\theta_1$-$\\Lambda$ parameter space for fixed $\\theta_2 = 90^\\circ$ using\ntime-resolved schlieren visualization. The experiments reveal two distinct\nsub-types of oscillations, characterized by the motion (or lack thereof) of the\nseparation point on the fore-cone surface. The global time scale associated\nwith flow oscillation is extracted using spectral proper orthogonal\ndecomposition. The non-dimensional frequency (Strouhal number) of oscillation\nis seen to exhibit distinct scaling for the two oscillation sub-types. The\nrelationship observed between the local flow properties, instability of the\nshear layer, and geometric constraints on the flow suggests that an\naeroacoustic feedback mechanism sustains the oscillations. Based on this\ninsight, a simple model with no empiricism is developed for the Strouhal\nnumber. The model predictions are found to match well with experimental\nmeasurements. The model provides helpful physical insight into the nature of\nthe self-sustained flow oscillations over a double cone at high-speeds.",

                "abstract": "Zermelo navigation is not only a fundamental tool in Finsler geometry but\nalso a fundamental approach to the geometrization of dynamics in physics. In\nthis paper, we consider the Zermelo navigation problem on optical Riemannian\nspace and, via Zermelo/Randers/spacetime triangle, explore the generation of\nnew spacetimes from pre-existing ones. Whether the Randers metric has\nreversible geodesics corresponds to the presence of time-reversal symmetry in\nthe generated spacetime. In cases where the Randers metric has reversible\ngeodesics, we utilize a radial vector field to generate new static spacetimes\nfrom existing ones. For example, we can generate Schwarzschild, Rindler, de\nSitter, and Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes from flat spacetime. In fact,\nthe Zermelo navigation method allows for the derivation of a variety of static\nspacetimes from flat spacetime. For multi-parameter spacetimes, they can be\ngenerated through various navigation paths. However, for some spacetimes, not\nall navigation paths may exist. In the second scenario, when the Randers metric\ndoes not have reversible geodesics, we employ a rotational vector field to\ntransform non-flat static metrics into slowly rotating spacetimes.\nAlternatively, using a mixed vector field, we generate slowly rotating\nspacetimes starting from flat spacetime.

Despite the recent success\nof large vision language models in many multi-modal tasks, complex situation\nreasoning over videos involving multiple human-object interaction events still\nremains challenging. In contrast, humans can easily tackle it by using a series\nof episode memories as anchors to quickly locate question-related key moments\nfor reasoning. To mimic this effective reasoning strategy, we propose the\nGlance-Focus model. One simple way is to apply an action detection model to\npredict a set of actions as key memories. However, these actions within a\nclosed set vocabulary are hard to generalize to various video domains. Instead\nof that, we train an Encoder-Decoder to generate a set of dynamic event\nmemories at the glancing stage. Apart from using supervised bipartite matching\nto obtain the event memories, we further design an unsupervised memory\ngeneration method to get rid of dependence on event annotations. Next, at the\nfocusing stage, these event memories act as a bridge to establish the\ncorrelation between the questions with high-level event concepts and low-level\nlengthy video content. Given the question, the model first focuses on the\ngenerated key event memory, then focuses on the most relevant moment for\nreasoning through our designed multi-level cross-attention mechanism. We\nconduct extensive experiments on four Multi-Event VideoQA benchmarks including\nSTAR, EgoTaskQA, AGQA, and NExT-QA. Our proposed model achieves\nstate-of-the-art results, surpassing current large models in various\nchallenging reasoning tasks.

We first propose the adaptively\nexplore-then-deferred-acceptance (AETDA) algorithm for responsiveness setting\nand derive an $O(N\\min\\left\\{N,K\\right\\}C\\log T/\\Delta^2)$ upper bound for\nplayer-optimal stable regret while demonstrating its guarantee of incentive\ncompatibility, where $N$ represents the number of players, $K$ is the number of\narms, $T$ denotes the time horizon, $C$ is arms' total capacities and $\\Delta$\nsignifies the minimum preference gap among players. This result is a\nsignificant improvement over \\citet{wang2022bandit}. And to the best of our\nknowledge, it constitutes the first player-optimal guarantee in matching\nmarkets that offers such robust assurances. We also consider broader\n\\textit{substitutable} preferences, one of the most general conditions to\nensure the existence of a stable matching and cover responsiveness. We devise\nan online DA (ODA) algorithm and establish an $O(NK\\log T/\\Delta^2)$\nplayer-pessimal stable regret bound for this setting.",

Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant\nincrease in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes\nis notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings,\nwhich are not directly conveyed through the overt text and imagery. In light of\nthis, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest\ndue to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In\nresponse to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity\nof various LMMs (e.g. GPT-4V) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of\nsocial abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme\nbenchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes\nsuch as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing\nGOAT-Bench, we delve into the ability of LMMs to accurately assess hatefulness,\nmisogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content. Our extensive\nexperiments across a range of LMMs reveal that current models still exhibit a\ndeficiency in safety awareness, showing insensitivity to various forms of\nimplicit abuse. We posit that this shortfall represents a critical impediment\nto the realization of safe artificial intelligence.

                "abstract": "Table structure recognition (TSR) aims at extracting tables in images into\nmachine-understandable formats. Recent methods solve this problem by predicting\nthe adjacency relations of detected cell boxes or learning to directly generate\nthe corresponding markup sequences from the table images. However, existing\napproaches either count on additional heuristic rules to recover the table\nstructures, or face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies within\ntables, resulting in increased complexity. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative paradigm. We model TSR as a logical location regression problem and\npropose a new TSR framework called LORE, standing for LOgical location\nREgression network, which for the first time regresses logical location as well\nas spatial location of table cells in a unified network. Our proposed LORE is\nconceptually simpler, easier to train, and more accurate than other paradigms\nof TSR. Moreover, inspired by the persuasive success of pre-trained models on a\nnumber of computer vision and natural language processing tasks, we propose two\npre-training tasks to enrich the spatial and logical representations at the\nfeature level of LORE, resulting in an upgraded version called LORE++. The\nincorporation of pre-training in LORE++ has proven to enjoy significant\nadvantages, leading to a substantial enhancement in terms of accuracy,\ngeneralization, and few-shot capability compared to its predecessor.\nExperiments on standard benchmarks against methods of previous paradigms\ndemonstrate the superiority of LORE++, which highlights the potential and\npromising prospect of the logical location regression paradigm for TSR.",

We divide all objects\nin our sample into bulge, disk and halo components.

For the bulge and halo objects, we calculate\ntheir velocity dispersions and use the spherical and projected Jeans equation\nto obtain the circular velocities. Our findings indicate a nearly isotropic\nnature for the M31 bulge, while the halo exhibits tangential anisotropy. The\nresults show that the rotation curve remains constant at $\\sim$220 km s$^{-1}$\nup to radius $\\sim$25 kpc and gradually decreases to $\\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$\nfurther out.

                "abstract": "We study the efficiency of fair allocations using the well-studied price of\nfairness concept, which quantitatively measures the worst-case efficiency loss\nwhen imposing fairness constraints. Previous works provided partial results on\nthe price of fairness with well-known fairness notions such as envy-freeness up\nto one good (EF1) and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX). In this paper, we\ngive a complete characterization for the price of envy-freeness in various\nsettings. In particular, we first consider the two-agent case under the\nindivisible-goods setting and present tight ratios for the price of EF1 (for\nscaled utility) and EFX (for unscaled utility), which resolve questions left\nopen in the literature. Next, we consider the mixed goods setting which\nconcerns a mixture of both divisible and indivisible goods. We focus on\nenvy-freeness for mixed goods (EFM), which generalizes both envy-freeness and\nEF1, as well as its strengthening called envy-freeness up to any good for mixed\ngoods (EFXM), which generalizes envy-freeness and EFX. To this end, we settle\nthe price of EFM and EFXM by providing a complete picture of tight bounds for\ntwo agents and asymptotically tight bounds for $n$ agents, for both scaled and\nunscaled utilities.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "While significant advancements have been made in video question answering\n(VideoQA), the potential benefits of enhancing model generalization through\ntailored difficulty scheduling have been largely overlooked in existing\nresearch. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by incorporating VideoQA into a\ncurriculum learning (CL) framework that progressively trains models from\nsimpler to more complex data. Recognizing that conventional self-paced CL\nmethods rely on training loss for difficulty measurement, which might not\naccurately reflect the intricacies of video-question pairs, we introduce the\nconcept of uncertainty-aware CL. Here, uncertainty serves as the guiding\nprinciple for dynamically adjusting the difficulty. Furthermore, we address the\nchallenge posed by uncertainty by presenting a probabilistic modeling approach\nfor VideoQA. Specifically, we conceptualize VideoQA as a stochastic computation\ngraph, where the hidden representations are treated as stochastic variables.\nThis yields two distinct types of uncertainty: one related to the inherent\nuncertainty in the data and another pertaining to the model's confidence. In\npractice, we seamlessly integrate the VideoQA model into our framework and\nconduct comprehensive experiments. The findings affirm that our approach not\nonly achieves enhanced performance but also effectively quantifies uncertainty\nin the context of VideoQA.",

On top of these challenges, it is often necessary to learn\ngeneralizable values and policies across a parametric space of games, e.g., for\ngame parameter inference when information is incomplete. To address these\nchallenges, we propose in this paper a Pontryagin-mode neural operator that\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) on safety performance across games\nwith parametric state constraints. Our key contribution is the introduction of\na costate loss defined on the discrepancy between forward and backward costate\nrollouts, which are computationally cheap. We show that the discontinuity of\ncostate dynamics (in the presence of state constraints) effectively enables the\nlearning of discontinuous values, without requiring manually supervised data as\nsuggested by the current SOTA.

                "abstract": "Real-time safety metrics are important for the automated driving system (ADS)\nto assess the risk of driving situations and to assist the decision-making.\nAlthough a number of real-time safety metrics have been proposed in the\nliterature, systematic performance evaluation of these safety metrics has been\nlacking. As different behavioral assumptions are adopted in different safety\nmetrics, it is difficult to compare the safety metrics and evaluate their\nperformance. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we propose an\nevaluation framework utilizing logged vehicle trajectory data, in that vehicle\ntrajectories for both subject vehicle (SV) and background vehicles (BVs) are\nobtained and the prediction errors caused by behavioral assumptions can be\neliminated. Specifically, we examine whether the SV is in a collision\nunavoidable situation at each moment, given all near-future trajectories of\nBVs. In this way, we level the ground for a fair comparison of different safety\nmetrics, as a good safety metric should always alarm in advance to the\ncollision unavoidable moment. When trajectory data from a large number of trips\nare available, we can systematically evaluate and compare different metrics'\nstatistical performance. In the case study, three representative real-time\nsafety metrics, including the time-to-collision (TTC), the PEGASUS Criticality\nMetric (PCM), and the Model Predictive Instantaneous Safety Metric (MPrISM),\nare evaluated using a large-scale simulated trajectory dataset. The proposed\nevaluation framework is important for researchers, practitioners, and\nregulators to characterize different metrics, and to select appropriate metrics\nfor different applications. Moreover, by conducting failure analysis on moments\nwhen a safety metric failed, we can identify its potential weaknesses which are\nvaluable for its potential refinements and improvements.",

In\nthis study, we have designed a three-stage model using representation learning\nto integrate pixel-level and slice-level annotations for distinguishing thyroid\ntumors. This structure includes a pathology structure recognition method to\npredict structures related to thyroid tumors, an encoder-decoder network to\nextract pixel-level annotation information by learning the feature\nrepresentations of image blocks, and an attention-based learning mechanism for\nthe final classification task. This mechanism learns the importance of\ndifferent image blocks in a pathological region, globally considering the\ninformation from each block. In the third stage, all information from the image\nblocks in a region is aggregated using attention mechanisms, followed by\nclassification to determine the category of the region. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method can predict microscopic structures more\naccurately. After color-coding, the method achieves results on unstained\npathology slides that approximate the quality of Hematoxylin and eosin\nstaining, reducing the need for stained pathology slides.

The results suggest that even when a single\ndeparture frequency is assumed for nearby bubbles, its effect on the nucleation\nsite being considered is to cause aperiodicity and intermittency in bubble\ndeparture quantities. The effects of pressure field phase angle, degree of\nsuperheat, and choice of force balance model on the bubble departure quantities\nare examined. The phase angle of the pressure fluctuation at the instant of\nbubble nucleation is shown to play a major role in determining bubble departure\ndiameter and growth time.

A hybrid\nneural network model was proposed, which accurately predicted daily nitrate\nconcentration and its trends using six water quality parameters. We conducted a\n105-day aquaculture experiment, during which we collected 450 samples from five\nsets of RAS to train our model (C-L-A model) which incorporates Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and self-Attention.\nFurthermore, we obtained 90 samples from a standalone RAS as the testing data\nto evaluate the performance of the model in practical applications. The\nexperimental results proved that the C-L-A model accurately predicted nitrate\nconcentration in RAS and maintained good performance even with a reduced\nproportion of training data. We recommend using water quality parameters from\nthe past 7 days to forecast future nitrate concentration, as this timeframe\nallows the model to achieve maximum generalization capability. Additionally, we\ncompared the performance of the C-L-A model with three basic neural network\nmodels (CNN, LSTM, self-Attention) as well as three hybrid neural network\nmodels (CNN-LSTM, CNN-Attention, LSTM-Attention). The results demonstrated that\nthe C-L-A model (R2=0.956) significantly outperformed the other neural network\nmodels (R2=0.901-0.927). Our study suggests that the utilization of neural\nnetwork models, specifically the C-L-A model, could potentially assist the RAS\nindustry in conserving resources for daily nitrate monitoring.",

                "abstract": "In the quest to model neuronal function amidst gaps in physiological data, a\npromising strategy is to develop a normative theory that interprets neuronal\nphysiology as optimizing a computational objective. This study extends the\ncurrent normative models, which primarily optimize prediction, by\nconceptualizing neurons as optimal feedback controllers. We posit that neurons,\nespecially those beyond early sensory areas, act as controllers, steering their\nenvironment towards a specific desired state through their output. This\nenvironment comprises both synaptically interlinked neurons and external motor\nsensory feedback loops, enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their\ncontrol via synaptic feedback. Utilizing the novel Direct Data-Driven Control\n(DD-DC) framework, we model neurons as biologically feasible controllers which\nimplicitly identify loop dynamics, infer latent states and optimize control.\nOur DD-DC neuron model explains various neurophysiological phenomena: the shift\nfrom potentiation to depression in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)\nwith its asymmetry, the duration and adaptive nature of feedforward and\nfeedback neuronal filters, the imprecision in spike generation under constant\nstimulation, and the characteristic operational variability and noise in the\nbrain. Our model presents a significant departure from the traditional,\nfeedforward, instant-response McCulloch-Pitts-Rosenblatt neuron, offering a\nnovel and biologically-informed fundamental unit for constructing neural\nnetworks.",

Magnetic braking (MB) plays an\nimportant role in influencing the orbital evolution of binary systems with a\nlow-mass ($\\lt 1-2~M_{\\odot}$) donor star. At present, there exist several\ndifferent MB descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the formation of PSR\nJ1012+5307 as a probe to test the plausible MB model. Employing a detailed\nstellar evolution model by the MESA code, we find that the Convection And\nRotation Boosted MB and the 'Intermediate' MB models can reproduce the WD mass,\nWD radius, WD surface gravity, neutron-star mass, and orbital period observed\nin PSR J1012+5307. However, our simulated WD has higher effective temperature\nthan the observation. Other three MB mechanisms including the standard MB model\nare too weak to account for the observed orbital period in a Hubble time. A\nlong cooling timescale caused by H-shell flashes of the WD may alleviate the\ndiscrepancy between the simulated effective temperature and the observed value.",

We find that\nthorough end-to-end system-level testing of a complex mobile manipulation\nsystem can serve as a reality-check for state-of-the-art methods in robotics.\nThis effectively grounds robotics research efforts in real world needs and\nchallenges, which we deem highly useful for the advancement of the field. To\nthis end, we share our key insights and takeaways to inspire and accelerate\nsimilar system-level research projects.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Speaker representation learning is critical for modern voice recognition\nsystems. While supervised learning techniques require extensive labeled data,\nunsupervised methodologies can leverage vast unlabeled corpora, offering a\nscalable solution. This paper introduces self-supervised reflective learning\n(SSRL), a novel paradigm that streamlines existing iterative unsupervised\nframeworks. SSRL integrates self-supervised knowledge distillation with online\nclustering to refine pseudo labels and train the model without iterative\nbottlenecks. Specifically, a teacher model continually refines pseudo labels\nthrough online clustering, providing dynamic supervision signals to train the\nstudent model. The student model undergoes noisy student training with input\nand model noise to boost its modeling capacity. The teacher model is updated\nvia an exponential moving average of the student, acting as an ensemble of past\niterations. Further, a pseudo label queue retains historical labels for\nconsistency, and noisy label modeling directs learning towards clean samples.\nExperiments on VoxCeleb show SSRL's superiority over current iterative\napproaches, surpassing the performance of a 5-round method in just a single\ntraining round. Ablation studies validate the contributions of key components\nlike noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues. Moreover, consistent\nimprovements in pseudo labeling and the convergence of cluster counts\ndemonstrate SSRL's effectiveness in deciphering unlabeled data. This work marks\nan important advancement in efficient and accurate speaker representation\nlearning through the novel reflective learning paradigm.",

Nonetheless,\nthere have been limited studies on the highlighted information. Objective: We\ncarried out the first large-scale exploratory study on the information\nhighlighted in SO answers in our recent study. To extend our previous study, we\ndevelop approaches to automatically recommend highlighted content with\nformatting styles using neural network architectures initially designed for the\nNamed Entity Recognition task. Method: In this paper, we studied 31,169,429\nanswers of Stack Overflow. For training recommendation models, we choose CNN\nand BERT models for each type of formatting (i.e., Bold, Italic, Code, and\nHeading) using the information highlighting dataset we collected from SO\nanswers. Results: Our models based on CNN architecture achieve precision\nranging from 0.71 to 0.82. The trained model for automatic code content\nhighlighting achieves a recall of 0.73 and an F1 score of 0.71, outperforming\nthe trained models for other formatting styles. The BERT models have even lower\nrecalls and F1 scores than the CNN models. Our analysis of failure cases\nindicates that the majority of the failure cases are missing identification\n(i.e., the model misses the content that is supposed to be highlighted) due to\nthe models tend to learn the frequently highlighted words while struggling to\nlearn less frequent words. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that it is possible\nto develop recommendation models for highlighting information for answers with\ndifferent formatting styles on Stack Overflow.",

                "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved promising results on a variety of\nComputer Vision tasks, however their quadratic complexity in the number of\ninput tokens has limited their application specially in resource-constrained\nsettings. Previous approaches that employ gradual token reduction to address\nthis challenge assume that token redundancy in one layer implies redundancy in\nall the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is\noften not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful\nin later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token\npropagation controller (TPC) that incorporates two different\ntoken-distributions, i.e., pause probability and restart probability to control\nthe reduction and reuse of tokens respectively, which results in more efficient\ntoken utilization. To improve the estimates of token distributions, we propose\na smoothing mechanism that acts as a regularizer and helps remove noisy\noutliers. Furthermore, to improve the training-stability of our proposed TPC,\nwe introduce a model stabilizer that is able to implicitly encode local image\nstructures and minimize accuracy fluctuations during model training. We present\nextensive experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset using DeiT, LV-ViT\nand Swin models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For\nexample, compared to baseline models, our proposed method improves the\ninference speed of the DeiT-S by 250% while increasing the classification\naccuracy by 1.0%.",

                "title": "Quota Trees",
                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "We introduce the notion of quota trees in directed graphs. Given a\nnonnegative integer ``quota'' for each vertex of a directed multigraph $G$, a\nquota tree is an immersed rooted tree which hits each vertex of $G$ the\nprescribed number of times. When the quotas are all one, the tree is actually\nembedded and we recover the usual notion of a spanning arborescence (directed\nspanning tree). The usual algorithms which produce spanning arborescences with\nvarious properties typically have (sometimes more complicated) ``quota''\nanalogues.\n  Our original motivation for studying quota trees was the problem of\ncharacterizing the sizes of the Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes in a\nconnected deterministic finite-state automaton recognizing a given regular\nlanguage. We show that the obstruction to realizing a given set of M-N class\nsizes is precisely the existence of a suitable quota tree.\n  In this paper we develop the basic theory of quota trees. We give necessary\nand sufficient conditions for the existence of a quota tree (or forest) over a\ngiven directed graph with specified quotas, solving the M-N class size problem\nas a special case. We discuss some potential applications of quota trees and\nforests, and connect them to the $k$ lightest paths problem. We give two proofs\nof the main theorem: one based on an algorithmic loop invariant, and one based\non direct enumeration of quota trees. For the latter, we use Lagrange inversion\nto derive a formula which vastly generalizes both the matrix-tree theorem and\nCayley's formula for counting labeled trees. We give an efficient algorithm to\nsample uniformly from the set of forests with given quotas, as well as a\ngeneralization of Edmonds' algorithm for computing a minimum-weight quota\nforest.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "DSLR cameras can achieve multiple zoom levels via shifting lens distances or\nswapping lens types. However, these techniques are not possible on smartphone\ndevices due to space constraints. Most smartphone manufacturers adopt a hybrid\nzoom system: commonly a Wide (W) camera at a low zoom level and a Telephoto (T)\ncamera at a high zoom level. To simulate zoom levels between W and T, these\nsystems crop and digitally upsample images from W, leading to significant\ndetail loss. In this paper, we propose an efficient system for hybrid zoom\nsuper-resolution on mobile devices, which captures a synchronous pair of W and\nT shots and leverages machine learning models to align and transfer details\nfrom T to W. We further develop an adaptive blending method that accounts for\ndepth-of-field mismatches, scene occlusion, flow uncertainty, and alignment\nerrors. To minimize the domain gap, we design a dual-phone camera rig to\ncapture real-world inputs and ground-truths for supervised training. Our method\ngenerates a 12-megapixel image in 500ms on a mobile platform and compares\nfavorably against state-of-the-art methods under extensive evaluation on\nreal-world scenarios.",

                "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used in always-on safety-critical\napplications deployed on hardware accelerators (NN-HAs) employing various\nmemory technologies. Reliable continuous operation of NN is essential for\nsafety-critical applications. During online operation, NNs are susceptible to\nsingle and multiple permanent and soft errors due to factors such as radiation,\naging, and thermal effects. Explicit NN-HA testing methods cannot detect\ntransient faults during inference, are unsuitable for always-on applications,\nand require extensive test vector generation and storage. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose the \\emph{uncertainty fingerprint} approach representing the\nonline fault status of NN. Furthermore, we propose a dual head NN topology\nspecifically designed to produce uncertainty fingerprints and the primary\nprediction of the NN in \\emph{a single shot}. During the online operation, by\nmatching the uncertainty fingerprint, we can concurrently self-test NNs with up\nto $100\\%$ coverage with a low false positive rate while maintaining a similar\nperformance of the primary task. Compared to existing works, memory overhead is\nreduced by up to $243.7$ MB, multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation is reduced\nby up to $10000\\times$, and false-positive rates are reduced by up to $89\\%$.",

As such, this paper exhaustively investigates image-guided\nmodels, specifically targeting reference-based sketch colorization, which aims\nto colorize sketch images using reference color images. We investigate three\ncritical aspects of reference-based diffusion models: the shortcomings compared\nto text-based counterparts, the training strategies, and the capability in\nzero-shot, sequential text-based manipulation. We introduce two variations of\nan image-guided latent diffusion model using different image tokens from the\npre-trained CLIP image encoder, and we propose corresponding manipulation\nmethods to adjust their results sequentially using weighted text inputs.

                "abstract": "The notions of Hausdorff and Fourier dimensions are ubiquitous in harmonic\nanalysis and geometric measure theory. It is known that any hypersurface in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ has Hausdorff dimension $d$. However, the Fourier dimension\ndepends on the finer geometric properties of the hypersurface. For instance,\nthe Fourier dimension of a hyperplane is 0, and the Fourier dimension of a\nhypersurface with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature is $d$. Recently, Harris has\nshown that the Euclidean light cone in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ has Fourier dimension\n$d-1$, which leads one to conjecture that the Fourier dimension of a\nhypersurface equals the number of non-vanishing principal curvatures. We prove\nthis conjecture for all $d$-dimensional cones and cylinders in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ generated by hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with\nnon-vanishing Gaussian curvature.

                "abstract": "We present a comparative study of the molecular gas in two galaxies from the\nLEGUS sample: barred spiral NGC 1313 and flocculent spiral NGC 7793. These two\ngalaxies have similar masses, metallicities, and star formation rates, but NGC\n1313 is forming significantly more massive star clusters than NGC 7793,\nespecially young massive clusters (<10 Myr, >10^4 Msol). Using ALMA CO(2-1)\nobservations of the two galaxies with the same sensitivities and resolutions of\n13 pc, we directly compare the molecular gas in these two similar galaxies to\ndetermine the physical conditions responsible for their large disparity in\ncluster formation. By fitting size-linewidth relations for the clouds in each\ngalaxy, we find that NGC 1313 has a higher intercept than NGC 7793, implying\nthat its clouds have higher kinetic energies at a given size scale. NGC 1313\nalso has more clouds near virial equilibrium than NGC 7793, which may be\nconnected to its higher rate of massive cluster formation. However, these\nvirially bound clouds do not show a stronger correlation with young clusters\nthan that of the general cloud population. We find surprisingly small\ndifferences between the distributions of molecular cloud populations in the two\ngalaxies, though the largest of those differences are that NGC 1313 has higher\nsurface densities and lower free-fall times.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Multi-label image classification presents a challenging task in many domains,\nincluding computer vision and medical imaging. Recent advancements have\nintroduced graph-based and transformer-based methods to improve performance and\ncapture label dependencies. However, these methods often include complex\nmodules that entail heavy computation and lack interpretability. In this paper,\nwe propose Probabilistic Multi-label Contrastive Learning (ProbMCL), a novel\nframework to address these challenges in multi-label image classification\ntasks. Our simple yet effective approach employs supervised contrastive\nlearning, in which samples that share enough labels with an anchor image based\non a decision threshold are introduced as a positive set. This structure\ncaptures label dependencies by pulling positive pair embeddings together and\npushing away negative samples that fall below the threshold. We enhance\nrepresentation learning by incorporating a mixture density network into\ncontrastive learning and generating Gaussian mixture distributions to explore\nthe epistemic uncertainty of the feature encoder. We validate the effectiveness\nof our framework through experimentation with datasets from the computer vision\nand medical imaging domains. Our method outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art methods while achieving a low computational footprint on both\ndatasets. Visualization analyses also demonstrate that ProbMCL-learned\nclassifiers maintain a meaningful semantic topology.",

Through numerical simulations, a broad cavity\nmode with a Purcell factor of 23 enhancing both exciton and biexciton\ntransitions, and exceptional collection efficiency of 92.4% into an objective\nwith numerical aperture of 0.7 are achieved. Furthermore, our design\ndemonstrates direct coupling efficiency over 90% into a single-mode fiber over\nthe entire telecom C-band.

                "abstract": "Visual obstacle discovery is a key step towards autonomous navigation of\nindoor mobile robots. Successful solutions have many applications in multiple\nscenes. One of the exceptions is the reflective ground. In this case, the\nreflections on the floor resemble the true world, which confuses the obstacle\ndiscovery and leaves navigation unsuccessful. We argue that the key to this\nproblem lies in obtaining discriminative features for reflections and\nobstacles. Note that obstacle and reflection can be separated by the ground\nplane in 3D space. With this observation, we firstly introduce a\npre-calibration based ground detection scheme that uses robot motion to predict\nthe ground plane. Due to the immunity of robot motion to reflection, this\nscheme avoids failed ground detection caused by reflection. Given the detected\nground, we design a ground-pixel parallax to describe the location of a pixel\nrelative to the ground. Based on this, a unified appearance-geometry feature\nrepresentation is proposed to describe objects inside rectangular boxes.\nEventually, based on segmenting by detection framework, an appearance-geometry\nfusion regressor is designed to utilize the proposed feature to discover the\nobstacles. It also prevents our model from concentrating too much on parts of\nobstacles instead of whole obstacles. For evaluation, we introduce a new\ndataset for Obstacle on Reflective Ground (ORG), which comprises 15 scenes with\nvarious ground reflections, a total of more than 200 image sequences and 3400\nRGB images. The pixel-wise annotations of ground and obstacle provide a\ncomparison to our method and other methods. By reducing the misdetection of the\nreflection, the proposed approach outperforms others.

However, the rigorous proof for the\nexistence and convergence of the boundary layer solutions to the proposed model\nstill remains open. This paper shows that the model with physical boundary\nconditions proposed in \\cite{tuval2005bacterial} in one dimension can generate\nboundary layer solution as the oxygen diffusion rate $\\varepsilon>0$ is small.\nSpecifically, we show that the solution of the model with $\\varepsilon>0$ will\nconverge to the solution with $\\varepsilon=0$ (outer-layer solution) plus the\nboundary layer profiles (inner-layer solution) with a sharp transition near the\nboundary as $ \\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$. There are two major difficulties in\nour analysis. First, the global well-posedness of the model is hard to prove\nsince the Dirichlet boundary condition can not contribute to the gradient\nestimates needed for the cross-diffusion structure in the model. Resorting to\nthe technique of taking anti-derivative, we remove the cross-diffusion\nstructure such that the Dirichlet boundary condition can facilitate the needed\nestimates. Second, the outer-layer profile of bacterial density is required to\nbe degenerate at the boundary as $ t \\rightarrow 0 ^{+}$, which makes the\ntraditional cancellation technique incapable. Here we employ the Hardy\ninequality and delicate weighted energy estimates to overcome this obstacle and\nderive the requisite uniform-in-$\\varepsilon$ estimates allowing us to pass the\nlimit $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ to achieve our results.",

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was used in this study as a\nmodel system since it exhibits a wide array of unique chemical, optical, and\nelectrical properties that make it a prospective material for advanced\nelectronics. To better understand the stability and surface chemistry of h-BN\nduring plasma-assisted processing, we used polycrystalline Cu foils with\nsingle-layer h-BN, grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and tracked in\nreal-time the plasma-induced reduction of the underlying Cu oxide using APXPS\nequipped with 22 kHz 75 W discharge plasma source operating at 13 Pa. Residual\ngas analysis (RGA) mass-spectra were concurrently collected during plasma-XPS\nto track reaction products formed during plasma exposure. A clear reduction of\nCuxO is seen, while an h-BN layer remains intact, suggesting H radical species\ncan attack the exposed and h-BN-covered Cu oxide patches and partially reduce\nthe underlying substrate. In addition to the demonstration and discussion of\nplasma-XPS capabilities, our results indicate the h-BN encapsulated metallic Cu\ninterface might be repaired without significantly damaging the overlaying h-BN,\nwhich is of practical importance for the development of h-BN encapsulated\ndevices and interfaces",

                "abstract": "In response to the global climate crisis, governments worldwide are\nintroducing legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to help\nmitigate environmental catastrophes. One method to encourage emission\nreductions is to incentivize carbon capturing and carbon reducing projects\nwhile simultaneously penalising excess GHG output. Firms that invest in carbon\ncapturing projects or reduce their emissions can receive offset credits (OCs)\nin return. These OCs can be used for regulatory purposes to offset their excess\nemissions in a compliance period. OCs may also be traded between firms. Thus,\nfirms have the choice between investing in projects to generate OCs or to trade\nOCs. In this work, we present a novel market framework and characterise the\noptimal behaviour of GHG OC market participants in both single-player and\ntwo-player settings. We analyse both a single-period and multi-period setting.\nAs the market model does not elicit a closed form solution, we develop a\nnumerical methodology to estimate players' optimal behaviours in accordance to\nthe Nash equilibria. Our findings indicate the actions players take are\ndependent on the scale of their project opportunities as well as their fellow\nmarket participants. We demonstrate the importance of behaving optimally via\nsimulations in order to offset emission penalties and the importance of\ninvesting in GHG reducing or capturing projects from a financial perspective.",

Researchers\nproposed sound and complete algorithms to compute identifiable causal queries\nat a given level of the hierarchy using the causal structure and data from the\nlower levels of the hierarchy. However, most of these algorithms assume that we\ncan accurately estimate the probability distribution of the data, which is an\nimpractical assumption for high-dimensional variables such as images. On the\nother hand, modern generative deep learning architectures can be trained to\nlearn how to accurately sample from such high-dimensional distributions.\nEspecially with the recent rise of foundation models for images, it is\ndesirable to leverage pre-trained models to answer causal queries with such\nhigh-dimensional data. To address this, we propose a sequential training\nalgorithm that, given the causal structure and a pre-trained conditional\ngenerative model, can train a deep causal generative model, which utilizes the\npre-trained model and can provably sample from identifiable interventional and\ncounterfactual distributions. Our algorithm, called Modular-DCM, uses\nadversarial training to learn the network weights, and to the best of our\nknowledge, is the first algorithm that can make use of pre-trained models and\nprovably sample from any identifiable causal query in the presence of latent\nconfounders with high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the utility of our\nalgorithm using semi-synthetic and real-world datasets containing images as\nvariables in the causal structure.",

We present a unified treatment of all of\nthese problems using an approach which converts linear-quadratic problems to\nmatrix-valued linear-linear problems with a positivity constraint. This is done\nthrough a system representation where the joint state/input covariance (the\nouter product in the deterministic case) matrix is the fundamental object. LQ\nproblems then become infinite-dimensional semidefinite programs, and the key\ntool used is that of linear-conic duality. Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs)\nemerge naturally as conal constraints on dual problems. Riccati equations\ncharacterize extrema of these special LMIs, and therefore provide solutions to\nthe dual problems. The state-feedback structure of all optimal signals in these\nproblems emerge out of alignment (complementary slackness) conditions between\nprimal and dual problems. Perhaps the new insight gained from this approach is\nthat first LMIs, and then second, Riccati equations arise naturally in dual,\nrather than primal problems. Furthermore, while traditional LQ problems are set\nup in $L^2$ spaces of signals, their equivalent covariance-representation\nproblems are most naturally set up in $L^1$ spaces of matrix-valued signals.",

We consider a probe scalar field\nin a BTZ-geometry with a Dirichlet brickwall and demonstrate that as the wall\napproaches the event horizon, the corresponding poles in the retarded\ncorrelator become dense and yield an effective branch-cut. The associated\ndiscontinuity of the correlator carries the information of the black hole\nquasi-normal modes. We further demonstrate that a non-vanishing angular\nmomentum non-perturbatively enhances the pole-condensing. We hypothesize that\nit is also related to quantum chaotic features of the corresponding spectral\nform factor, which has been observed earlier. Finally we discuss the underlying\nalgebraic justification of this approximate thermalization in terms of the\ntrace of the algebra.",

                "abstract": "Twenty-two extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXTs) have now been\ndiscovered from two decades of Chandra data (analyzing ~259 Ms of data), with\n17 associated with distant galaxies (>100 Mpc). Different mechanisms and\nprogenitors have been proposed to explain their properties; nevertheless, after\nanalyzing their timing, spectral parameters, host-galaxy properties, luminosity\nfunction, and volumetric rates, their nature remains uncertain. We interpret a\nsub-sample of nine FXTs that show a plateau or a fast-rise light curve within\nthe framework of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger magnetar model. We fit\ntheir light curves and derive magnetar (magnetic field and initial rotational\nperiod) and ejecta (ejecta mass and opacity) parameters. This model predicts\ntwo zones: an orientation-dependent free zone (where the magnetar spin-down\nX-ray photons escape freely to the observer) and a trapped zone (where the\nX-ray photons are initially obscured and only escape freely once the ejecta\nmaterial becomes optically thin). We argue that six FXTs show properties\nconsistent with the free zone and three FXTs with the trapped zone. This\nsub-sample of FXTs has a similar distribution of magnetic fields and initial\nrotation periods to those inferred for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs),\nsuggesting a possible association. We compare the predicted ejecta emission fed\nby the magnetar emission (called merger-nova) to the optical and near-infrared\nupper limits of two FXTs, XRT 141001 and XRT 210423 where contemporaneous\noptical observations are available. The non-detections place lower limits on\nthe redshifts of XRT 141001 and XRT 210423 of z>1.5 and >0.1, respectively. If\nthe magnetar remnants lose energy via gravitational waves, it should be\npossible to detect similar objects with the current advanced LIGO detectors out\nto a redshift z<0.03, while future GW detectors will be able to detect them out\nto z=0.5.",

                "abstract": "Multi-cloud systems facilitate a cost-efficient and\ngeographically-distributed deployment of microservice-based applications by\ntemporary leasing virtual nodes with diverse pricing models. To preserve the\ncost-efficiency of multi-cloud deployments, it is essential to redeploy\nmicroservices onto the available nodes according to a dynamic resource\nconfiguration, which is often performed to better accommodate workload\nvariations. However, this approach leads to frequent service disruption since\napplications are continuously shutdown and redeployed in order to apply the new\nresource assignment. To overcome this issue, we propose a re-orchestration\nscheme that migrates microservice at runtime based on a rolling update\nscheduling logic. Specifically, we propose an integer linear optimization\nproblem that minimizes the cost associated to multi-cloud virtual nodes and\nthat ensures that delay-sensitive microservices are co-located on the same\nregional cluster. The resulting rescheduling order guarantees no service\ndisruption by repacking microservices between the available nodes without the\nneed to turn off the outdated microservice instance before redeploying the\nupdated version. In addition, we propose a two-step heuristic scheme that\neffectively approximates the optimal solution at the expense of close-to-zero\nservice disruption and QoS violation probability. Results show that proposed\nschemes achieve better performance in terms of cost mitigation, low service\ndisruption and low QoS violation probability compared to baseline schemes\nreplicating Kubernetes scheduler functionalities.",

A direct simulation of strain gage\nbonding behavior with two steel plates is infeasible due to the unique\nconstruction of strain gages. Therefore, an indirect simulation method,\ncomparing local alternatives to a widely accepted adhesive, Loctite 496, was\nemployed in this study. Two potential replacements, Loctite 401 and Tekbond\n793, were tested and matched against the benchmark adhesive, with a focus on\nthe key mechanical properties: Proportional Shear Strain (PSS), Proportional\nShear Stress (PSSt), and Apparent Shear Modulus (G*). Loctite 401 exhibited the\nhighest G*, suggesting its potential use in strain gage installations if G* is\nconsidered most important. However, Tekbond 793 demonstrated superior PSS,\nMaximum Shear Stress (MSSt), and Rupture Shear Stress (RSSt) performance,\ndisplaying linear behavior even without an accelerator. Surface preparation\nconsiderations were also discussed, noting that hand abrading results in double\nthe surface roughness than using an orbital sander. The study further\nidentified two main regions concerning failure modes related to Ra, with values\nbelow 0.31 {\\mu}m causing significant variations in observed mechanical\nproperties, pointing towards factors beyond adhesive layer thickness affecting\nbond properties.

                "abstract": "Does Donald Trump speak differently from other presidents? If so, in what\nways? Are these differences confined to any single medium of communication? To\ninvestigate these questions, this paper introduces a novel metric of uniqueness\nbased on large language models, develops a new lexicon for divisive speech, and\npresents a framework for comparing the lexical features of political opponents.\nApplying these tools to a variety of corpora of presidential speeches, we find\nconsiderable evidence that Trump's speech patterns diverge from those of all\nmajor party nominees for the presidency in recent history. Some notable\nfindings include Trump's employment of particularly divisive and antagonistic\nlanguage targeting of his political opponents and his patterns of repetition\nfor emphasis. Furthermore, Trump is significantly more distinctive than his\nfellow Republicans, whose uniqueness values are comparably closer to those of\nthe Democrats. These differences hold across a variety of measurement\nstrategies, arise on both the campaign trail and in official presidential\naddresses, and do not appear to be an artifact of secular time trends.",

A major obstacle to the scalability\nof algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic\ncomplexity of $O(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible\npairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most\nnetworks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is\nonly $O(N)$.

Our algorithm relies on\na stochastic second neighbor search that produces the best edge candidates with\nhigh probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. In practice,\nour algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster\nthan the quadratic baseline, allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables\nthe reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of\nnodes and edges.",

                "abstract": "This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban street scenes\nfrom monocular videos. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked\nvehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of\ndynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow\ntraining and rendering speed, coupled with the critical need for high precision\nin tracked vehicle poses. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene\nrepresentation that tackles all these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic\nurban street is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic\nlogits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or\nthe background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each\nobject point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a\ndynamic spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit\nrepresentation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which\nin turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 133 FPS\n(1066$\\times$1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and\nWaymo Open datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. Furthermore, the\nproposed representation delivers performance on par with that achieved using\nprecise ground-truth poses, despite relying only on poses from an off-the-shelf\ntracker.

In this paper, we\ndelve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the\nneed for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new\nfine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a\nsupervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism,\nwhere the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself.\nMore specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous\niterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses\nfrom those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively\nelevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full\npotential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we\nprove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method\nis achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution.\nEmpirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the\nHuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our\nresults show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a\nvariety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct\npreference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data.\nThis sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of\nhuman-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents.",

In this work, we propose to use tiny neural networks (NNs) to learn\nthe relationship between angle difference-of-arrival (ADoA) measurements and\nlocations of a receiver in an indoor environment. To relieve training data\ncollection efforts, we resort to a self-supervised approach by bootstrapping\nthe training of our neural network through location estimates obtained from a\nstate-of-the-art localization algorithm. We evaluate our scheme via mmWave\nmeasurements from indoor 60-GHz double-directional channel sounding. We process\nthe measurements to yield dominant multipath components, use the corresponding\nangles to compute ADoA values, and finally obtain location fixes. Results show\nthat the tiny NN achieves sub-meter errors in 74\\% of the cases, thus\nperforming as good as or even better than the state-of-the-art algorithm, with\nsignificantly lower computational complexity.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Molecular property optimization (MPO) problems are inherently challenging\nsince they are formulated over discrete, unstructured spaces and the labeling\nprocess involves expensive simulations or experiments, which fundamentally\nlimits the amount of available data. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful\nand popular framework for efficient optimization of noisy, black-box objective\nfunctions (e.g., measured property values), thus is a potentially attractive\nframework for MPO. To apply BO to MPO problems, one must select a structured\nmolecular representation that enables construction of a probabilistic surrogate\nmodel. Many molecular representations have been developed, however, they are\nall high-dimensional, which introduces important challenges in the BO process\n-- mainly because the curse of dimensionality makes it difficult to define and\nperform inference over a suitable class of surrogate models. This challenge has\nbeen recently addressed by learning a lower-dimensional encoding of a SMILE or\ngraph representation of a molecule in an unsupervised manner and then\nperforming BO in the encoded space. In this work, we show that such methods\nhave a tendency to \"get stuck,\" which we hypothesize occurs since the mapping\nfrom the encoded space to property values is not necessarily well-modeled by a\nGaussian process. We argue for an alternative approach that combines numerical\nmolecular descriptors with a sparse axis-aligned Gaussian process model, which\nis capable of rapidly identifying sparse subspaces that are most relevant to\nmodeling the unknown property function. We demonstrate that our proposed method\nsubstantially outperforms existing MPO methods on a variety of benchmark and\nreal-world problems. Specifically, we show that our method can routinely find\nnear-optimal molecules out of a set of more than $>100$k alternatives within\n100 or fewer expensive queries.",

We investigate in\ndetail the production of $W$-boson pair at $e^+e^-$ colliders and calculate the\nmixed QCD-EW corrections at the next-to-next-to-leading order. By employing the\nmethod of differential equations, we analytically compute the two-loop master\nintegrals for the mixed QCD-EW corrections to $e^+e^- \\rightarrow W^+W^-$. By\nutilizing the Magnus transformation, we derive a canonical set of master\nintegrals for each integral family. This canonical basis fulfills a system of\ndifferential equations where the dependence on the dimensional regulator,\n$\\epsilon$, is linearly factorized from the kinematics. Finally, these\ncanonical master integrals are given as Taylor series in $\\epsilon$ up to\n$\\epsilon^4$, with coefficients written as combinations of Goncharov\npolylogarithms up to weight four. Upon applying our analytic expressions of\nthese master integrals to the phenomenological analysis on $W$-pair production,\nwe find that the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha\\alpha_s)$ corrections hold substantial\nsignificance in the $\\alpha(0)$ scheme, especially in the vicinity of the\ntop-pair resonance ($\\sqrt{s} = 2\\, m_t$) induced by top-loop integrals.\nHowever, these corrections can be heavily suppressed by adopting the $G_{\\mu}$\nscheme.",

                "abstract": "We propose a model of a twisted accretion disc around a Kerr black hole\ninteracting with a secondary black hole of a smaller mass on an inclined\neccentric orbit. We use parameters of the system, which may be appropriate for\nthe so-called 'precessing massive' model of OJ 287. We calculate expressions\nfor torque exerted on the disc by the secondary and a contribution of the\nsecondary to the apsidal precession of disc elements by a double averaging\nprocedure over the periods of the secondary and the disc elements. These\nexpressions are used at all scales of interest, including the ones inside the\nbinary orbit. We calculate numerically the evolution of the disc tilt and twist\nassuming a flat initial configuration. We consider the disc aspect ratio\n$h/r=10^{-3}$, a rather large viscosity parameter $\\alpha=0.1$ and several\nvalues of the primary rotational parameter, $\\chi$. We find that, after a few\nperiods of Lense-Thirring precession of the orbit, the disc relaxes to a\nquasi-stationary configuration in the precessing frame with a non-trivial\ndistribution of the disc inclination angle, $\\beta$, over the radial scale. We\npropose an analytic model for this configuration. We show that the presence of\nthe twisted disc leads to multiple crossings of the disc by the secondary per\none orbital period, with time periods between the crossings being different\nfrom the flat disc model. Our results should be taken into account in the\nmodelling of OJ 287. They can also be applied to similar sources.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write\nhuman-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate\ngenerating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of\nhallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these\npowerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.\nThe journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily\nrelies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI\nsystems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of\nonline text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive\nlanguage fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information\nfrom the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or\nmodifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes\nhugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive\napplications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports,\netc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed\nto mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023),\nCoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we\nintroduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various\nparameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and\nretriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches\nspecifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we\nanalyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing\na solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related\nphenomena within the realm of LLMs.",

The collective excitation spectrum, using Bogoliubov-de-Gennes\ntheory, reveals the existence of a diverse range of phases in the SO and Rabi\n($k_L-\\Omega$) coupling plane. Based on eigenvalue of the excitation spectrum,\nwe categorize the $k_L-\\Omega$ plane into three distinct regions. In region I,\na stable mode with phonon-like excitations is observed. In region IIa, single\nand multi-band instabilities are noted with a gapped mode, while multi-band\ninstability accompanied by a gapless mode between low-lying and first excited\nstates is realized in region IIb, which also provides evidence of unstable\navoided crossing between low-lying and first excited modes The gap between\nlow-lying and first-excited states increases upon increasing the Rabi coupling\nwhile decreases upon increase of SO coupling. Using eigenvector analysis, we\nconfirm the presence of the spin-dipole mode in the spin-like modes in Region\nII. We corroborate the nature of the collective excitation through real-time\ndynamical evolution of the ground state perturbed with the quench of the trap\nusing the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii model. This analysis suggests the\npresence of dynamical instability leading to the disappearance of the $0$-th\ncomponent of the condensate. In Region III, mainly encompassing $\\Omega \\sim 0$\nand finite $k_L$, we observe phonon-like excitations in both the first excited\nand the low-lying state. The eigenvectors in this region reveal alternative in-\nand out-of-phase behaviours of the spin components. Numerical analysis reveals\nthe presence of a super stripe phase for small Rabi coupling in this region,\nwherein the eigenvector indicates the presence of more complicated\nspin-like-density mixed modes.",

                "abstract": "In this paper, we validate the performance of the a sensor fusion-based\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework\nfor Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS\nreceiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used. The detection\nframework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing\nthe predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two\nconsecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift. For this\npurpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the\naccelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) neural network. The second strategy employs a Random-Forest\nsupervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing\nbetween left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor.\nIn experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong\nturn are simulated. These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection\nattacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives\ninjected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to\ndetect legitimate GNSS signals. Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised\nthroughout the spoofing attack. To test the effectiveness of the detection\nframework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road\nstructures. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various\nsophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting\nattacks. Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy\nof the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding\nAVs against GNSS spoofing threats.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Manual delineation of tumor regions from magnetic resonance (MR) images is\ntime-consuming, requires an expert, and is prone to human error. In recent\nyears, deep learning models have been the go-to approach for the segmentation\nof brain tumors. U-Net and its' variants for semantic segmentation of medical\nimages have achieved good results in the literature. However, U-Net and its'\nvariants tend to over-segment tumor regions and may not accurately segment the\ntumor edges. The edges of the tumor are as important as the tumor regions for\naccurate diagnosis, surgical precision, and treatment planning. In the proposed\nwork, the authors aim to extract edges from the ground truth using a\nderivative-like filter followed by edge reconstruction to obtain an edge ground\ntruth in addition to the brain tumor ground truth. Utilizing both ground\ntruths, the author studies several U-Net and its' variant architectures with\nand without tumor edges ground truth as a target along with the tumor ground\ntruth for brain tumor segmentation. The author used the BraTS2020 benchmark\ndataset to perform the study and the results are tabulated for the dice and\nHausdorff95 metrics. The mean and median metrics are calculated for the whole\ntumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET) regions. Compared to the\nbaseline U-Net and its variants, the models that learned edges along with the\ntumor regions performed well in core tumor regions in both training and\nvalidation datasets. The improved performance of edge-trained models trained on\nbaseline models like U-Net and V-Net achieved performance similar to baseline\nstate-of-the-art models like Swin U-Net and hybrid MR-U-Net. The edge-target\ntrained models are capable of generating edge maps that can be useful for\ntreatment planning. Additionally, for further explainability of the results,\nthe activation map generated by the hybrid MR-U-Net has been studied.",

The ``only if'' part follows from the properties of\nthe so-called layered wheels due to Sintiari and Trotignon.\n  Alecu, Chudnovsky, Spirkl and the author recently proved the conjecture in\ntwo special cases: (a) when $t=4$; and (b) when $H=cone (F)$ for some forest\n$F$; that is, $H$ is obtained from $F$ by adding a universal vertex. Our first\nresult is a common strengthening: for an integer $t\\geq 4$ and graphs $F$ and\n$H$, (even-hole, $cone(cone (F))$, $H$, $K_t$)-free graphs have bounded\ntreewidth if and only if $F$ is a forest and $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph.\n  For general $t\\geq 4$, we push the current state of the art further than (b)\nby settling the conjecture for the smallest choices of $H$ that are not coned\nforests. This follows from our second result: we prove the conjecture when $H$\nis a crystal; that is, a graph obtained from several coned double stars by\ngluing them together along the middle edges of the double stars.\n  We also propose another conjecture motivated by the following observation:\nexcept for complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs, all the constructions\nof graphs with unbounded treewidth which have been discovered so far are\n$2$-degenerate. Specifically, we conjecture that for every $t\\geq 1$, every\ngraph of sufficiently large treewidth has an induced subgraph of treewidth $t$\nwhich is either complete, complete bipartite, or $2$-degenerate. This\nconjecture is the first to predict a grid-type theorem for induced subgraphs,\nand what makes it even more relevant is somewhat serendipitous: if true, it\nwould imply our former conjecture by reducing it to (a).",

But to what\nextent is generative AI already in use in the public sector? Our survey of 938\npublic service professionals within the UK (covering education, health, social\nwork and emergency services) seeks to answer this question. We find that use of\ngenerative AI systems is already widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of\ngenerative AI usage within their area of work, while 22% actively use a\ngenerative AI system. Public sector professionals were positive about both\ncurrent use of the technology and its potential to enhance their efficiency and\nreduce bureaucratic workload in the future. For example, those working in the\nNHS thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop from 50% to 30% if\ngenerative AI was properly exploited, an equivalent of one day per week (an\nenormous potential impact). Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%)\naround generative AI outputs, and a low fear of replacement (16%). While\nrespondents were optimistic overall, areas of concern included feeling like the\nUK is missing out on opportunities to use AI to improve public services (76%),\nand only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on\ngenerative AI usage in their workplaces. In other words, it is clear that\ngenerative AI is already transforming the public sector, but uptake is\nhappening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines.

                "abstract": "Computing reduced-order models using non-intrusive methods is particularly\nattractive for systems that are simulated using black-box solvers. However,\nobtaining accurate data-driven models can be challenging, especially if the\nunderlying systems exhibit large-amplitude transient growth. Although these\nsystems may evolve near a low-dimensional subspace that can be easily\nidentified using standard techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\n(POD), computing accurate models often requires projecting the state onto this\nsubspace via a non-orthogonal projection. While appropriate oblique projection\noperators can be computed using intrusive techniques that leverage the form of\nthe underlying governing equations, purely data-driven methods currently tend\nto achieve dimensionality reduction via orthogonal projections, and this can\nlead to models with poor predictive accuracy. In this paper, we address this\nissue by introducing a non-intrusive framework designed to simultaneously\nidentify oblique projection operators and reduced-order dynamics. In\nparticular, given training trajectories and assuming reduced-order dynamics of\npolynomial form, we fit a reduced-order model by solving an optimization\nproblem over the product manifold of a Grassmann manifold, a Stiefel manifold,\nand several linear spaces (as many as the tensors that define the low-order\ndynamics). Furthermore, we show that the gradient of the cost function with\nrespect to the optimization parameters can be conveniently written in\nclosed-form, so that there is no need for automatic differentiation. We compare\nour formulation with state-of-the-art methods on three examples: a\nthree-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, the complex\nGinzburg-Landau (CGL) equation, and a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at\nReynolds number Re = 8300.",

                "abstract": "The AdS/CFT correspondence is an explicit realization of the holographic\nprinciple relating a theory of gravity in a volume of space to a lower\ndimensional quantum field theory on its boundary. By exploiting elements of\nquantum error correction, qubit toy models of this correspondence have been\nconstructed for which the bulk logical operators are representable by operators\nacting on the boundary. Given a boundary subregion, wedges in the volume space\nare used to enclose the bulk qubits for which logical operators are\nreconstructable on that boundary subregion. In this thesis a number of\ndifferent wedges, such as the causal wedge, greedy entanglement wedge and\nminimum entanglement wedge, are examined. More specifically, Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of boundary erasure are performed with various toy models to study\nthe differences between wedges and the effect on these wedge by the type of the\nmodel, non-uniform boundaries and stacking of models. It has been found that\nthe minimum entanglement wedge is the best approximate for the true geometric\nwedge. This is illustrated by an example toy model for which an operator beyond\nthe greedy entanglement wedge was also reconstructed. In addition, by\ncalculating the entropy of these subregions, the viability of a mutual\ninformation wedge is rejected. Only for particular connected boundary\nsubregions was the inclusion of the central tensor by the geometric wedge\nassociated to a rise in mutual information.",

                "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in\nunderstanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication.\nHowever, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands\nduring training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge\nis further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating\nfrequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new\nknowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many\napplications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address\ndeficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in\nefficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end,\nrecent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for\nLLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains\nwhile preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we\nfirst define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive\nreview of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and\ncognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that\nclassifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external\nknowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive\nempirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches.\nAdditionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can\nprovide a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within\nLLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing,\noutlining its broad and impactful implications.",

                "abstract": "Large scale analytics engines have become a core dependency for modern\ndata-driven enterprises to derive business insights and drive actions. These\nengines support a large number of analytic jobs processing huge volumes of data\non a daily basis, and workloads are often inundated with overlapping\ncomputations across multiple jobs. Reusing common computation is crucial for\nefficient cluster resource utilization and reducing job execution time.\nDetecting common computation is the first and key step for reducing this\ncomputational redundancy. However, detecting equivalence on large-scale\nanalytics engines requires efficient and scalable solutions that are fully\nautomated. In addition, to maximize computation reuse, equivalence needs to be\ndetected at the semantic level instead of just the syntactic level (i.e., the\nability to detect semantic equivalence of seemingly different-looking queries).\nUnfortunately, existing solutions fall short of satisfying these requirements.\n  In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing\nGEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for\nefficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale. GEqO\nintroduces two machine-learning-based filters that quickly prune out\nnonequivalent subexpressions and employs a semi-supervised learning feedback\nloop to iteratively improve its model with an intelligent sampling mechanism.\nFurther, with its novel database-agnostic featurization method, GEqO can\ntransfer the learning from one workload and database to another. Our extensive\nempirical evaluation shows that, on TPC-DS-like queries, GEqO yields\nsignificant performance gains-up to 200x faster than automated verifiers-and\nfinds up to 2x more equivalences than optimizer and signature-based equivalence\ndetection approaches.",

We also integrate a residual vector\nquantization (RVQ) mechanism for effective multilevel communication. In the\nsecond stage, a noise reduction block (NRB) based on Swin Transformer is\nintroduced, coupled with the multilevel codebook from the first stage, serving\nas a high-quality semantic knowledge base (SKB) for generative feature\nrestoration. Experimental results highlight MOC-RVQ's superior performance over\nmethods like BPG or JPEG, even without channel error correction coding.",

                "abstract": "Motivated by the studies of neural networks (e.g.,the neural tangent kernel\ntheory), we perform a study on the large-dimensional behavior of kernel ridge\nregression (KRR) where the sample size $n \\asymp d^{\\gamma}$ for some $\\gamma >\n0$. Given an RKHS $\\mathcal{H}$ associated with an inner product kernel defined\non the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d}$, we suppose that the true function $f_{\\rho}^{*}\n\\in [\\mathcal{H}]^{s}$, the interpolation space of $\\mathcal{H}$ with source\ncondition $s>0$. We first determined the exact order (both upper and lower\nbound) of the generalization error of kernel ridge regression for the optimally\nchosen regularization parameter $\\lambda$. We then further showed that when\n$0<s\\le1$, KRR is minimax optimal; and when $s>1$, KRR is not minimax optimal\n(a.k.a. he saturation effect). Our results illustrate that the curves of rate\nvarying along $\\gamma$ exhibit the periodic plateau behavior and the multiple\ndescent behavior and show how the curves evolve with $s>0$. Interestingly, our\nwork provides a unified viewpoint of several recent works on kernel regression\nin the large-dimensional setting, which correspond to $s=0$ and $s=1$\nrespectively.",

We propose a class of objective functions based on the variational\nrepresentation of the $f$-divergence, from which we extract a list of five\nposterior probability estimators leveraging well-known $f$-divergences. In\naddition, driven by the challenge of improving the state-of-the-art approach,\nwe propose a bottom-up method that leads us to the formulation of a new\nobjective function (and posterior probability estimator) corresponding to a\nnovel $f$-divergence referred to as shifted log (SL). First, we theoretically\nprove the convergence property of the posterior probability estimators. Then,\nwe numerically test the set of proposed objective functions in three\napplication scenarios: toy examples, image data sets, and signal\ndetection/decoding problems.

Under high magnetic fields there are high\nelectro-mechanical forces, and thus concern for mechanical damage. Due to large\nscreening currents and composite structure of the tape, the mechanical design\nof these magnets is not straightforward. In addition, many contemporary designs\nuse insulated winding. In this work we develop a novel two-dimensional\naxisymmetric finite element tool programmed in MATLAB that assumes the\ndisplacement field within linear elastic range. The stack of pancakes and a\nlarge number of REBCO tape turns are approximated as an an-isotropic bulk\nhollow cylinder. Our results agree with uni-axial stress experiments in\nliterature, validating the bulk approximation. Here, we study the following\nconfiguration. The current is first ramp up to below the critical current and\nwe calculate the screening currents and the forces that they cause using the\nMEMEP model. As a case study, 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet, is taken and\nsimulated numerically. We have done complete mechanical analysis of the magnet\nby including the axial and shear mechanical quantities for each pancake unlike\nprevious work where only radial and circumferential quantities are focused.\nEffect on mechanical quantities without screening current is also calculated\nand compared. It is shown that including screening current induced field\nstrongly affect the mechanical quantities, specially the shear stress. The\nlatter might be the critical quantity for certain magnet configurations.\nAdditionally, in order to overcome high stresses, a stiff over banding of\ndifferent material is considered and numerically modelled which significantly\nreduces the mechanical stresses.

Recent work, however, strongly suggests that\nthis assumption may fail to hold in Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), a\nquintessential family of concept-based interpretable architectures. In this\npaper, we investigate whether CBMs correctly capture the degree of conditional\nindependence across concepts when such concepts are localised both spatially,\nby having their values entirely defined by a fixed subset of features, and\nsemantically, by having their values correlated with only a fixed subset of\npredefined concepts. To understand locality, we analyse how changes to features\noutside of a concept's spatial or semantic locality impact concept predictions.\nOur results suggest that even in well-defined scenarios where the presence of a\nconcept is localised to a fixed feature subspace, or whose semantics are\ncorrelated to a small subset of other concepts, CBMs fail to learn this\nlocality.

We propose a\nnew algorithm titled Adaptively Quantized Gradient Descent (\\texttt{AQGD}), and\nprove that above a certain finite threshold bit-rate, \\texttt{AQGD} guarantees\nexponentially fast convergence to the globally optimal policy, with \\textit{no\ndeterioration of the exponent relative to the unquantized setting}. More\ngenerally, our approach reveals the benefits of adaptive quantization in\npreserving fast linear convergence rates, and, as such, may be of independent\ninterest to the literature on compressed optimization.",

We\nadded interactive quizzes to The Rust Programming Language, the official\ntextbook for learning Rust. Over 13 months, 62,526 readers answered questions\n1,140,202 times. First, we analyze the trajectories of readers. We find that\nmany readers drop-out of the book early when faced with difficult language\nconcepts like Rust's ownership types. Second, we use classical test theory and\nitem response theory to analyze the characteristics of quiz questions. We find\nthat better questions are more conceptual in nature, such as asking why a\nprogram does not compile vs. whether a program compiles. Third, we performed 12\ninterventions into the book to help readers with difficult questions. We find\nthat on average, interventions improved quiz scores on the targeted questions\nby +20%. Fourth, we show that our technique can likely generalize to languages\nwith smaller user bases by simulating our statistical inferences on small N.\nThese results demonstrate that quizzes are a simple and useful technique for\nunderstanding language learning at all scales.",

                "abstract": "The recent innovations and breakthroughs in diffusion models have\nsignificantly expanded the possibilities of generating high-quality videos for\nthe given prompts. Most existing works tackle the single-scene scenario with\nonly one video event occurring in a single background. Extending to generate\nmulti-scene videos nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to nicely\nmanage the logic in between while preserving the consistent visual appearance\nof key content across video scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework, namely VideoDrafter, for content-consistent multi-scene video\ngeneration. Technically, VideoDrafter leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to\nconvert the input prompt into comprehensive multi-scene script that benefits\nfrom the logical knowledge learnt by LLM. The script for each scene includes a\nprompt describing the event, the foreground/background entities, as well as\ncamera movement. VideoDrafter identifies the common entities throughout the\nscript and asks LLM to detail each entity. The resultant entity description is\nthen fed into a text-to-image model to generate a reference image for each\nentity. Finally, VideoDrafter outputs a multi-scene video by generating each\nscene video via a diffusion process that takes the reference images, the\ndescriptive prompt of the event and camera movement into account. The diffusion\nmodel incorporates the reference images as the condition and alignment to\nstrengthen the content consistency of multi-scene videos. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that VideoDrafter outperforms the SOTA video generation models in\nterms of visual quality, content consistency, and user preference.",

                "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the parameter estimation performance of three\nwell-known sinusoidal models for speech and audio. The first one is the\nstandard Sinusoidal Model (SM), which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT). The second is the Exponentially Damped Sinusoidal Model (EDSM) which has\nbeen proposed in the last decade, and utilizes a subspace method for parameter\nestimation, and finally the extended adaptive Quasi-Harmonic Model (eaQHM),\nwhich has been recently proposed for AM-FM decomposition, and estimates the\nsignal parameters using Least Squares on a set of basis function that are\nadaptive to the local characteristics of the signal. The parameter estimation\nof each model is briefly described and its performance is compared to the\nothers in terms of signal reconstruction accuracy versus window size on a\nvariety of synthetic signals and versus the number of sinusoids on real\nsignals. The latter include highly non stationary signals, such as singing\nvoices and guitar solos. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are\npresented via synthetic signals and then the application on real signals is\ndiscussed. Conclusively, eaQHM outperforms EDS in medium-to-large window size\nanalysis, whereas EDSM yields higher reconstruction values for smaller analysis\nwindow sizes. Thus, a future research direction appears to be the merge of\nadaptivity of the eaQHM and parameter estimation robustness of the EDSM in a\nnew paradigm for high-quality analysis and resynthesis of general audio\nsignals.",

We address these limitations in a\nlongitudinal, quasi-experimental study of 165 deplatforming events targeted at\n101 influencers. We collect deplatforming events from Reddit posts and then\nmanually curate the data, ensuring the correctness of a large dataset of\ndeplatforming events. Then, we link these events to Google Trends and Wikipedia\npage views, platform-agnostic measures of online attention that capture the\ngeneral public's interest in specific influencers. Through a\ndifference-in-differences approach, we find that deplatforming reduces online\nattention toward influencers. After 12 months, we estimate that online\nattention toward deplatformed influencers is reduced by -63% (95% CI\n[-75%,-46%]) on Google and by -43% (95% CI [-57%,-24%]) on Wikipedia. Further,\nas we study over a hundred deplatforming events, we can analyze in which cases\ndeplatforming is more or less impactful, revealing nuances about the\nintervention.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a couple\nof co-evolving representation spaces, rather than a single or static space, and\npropose a co-contrastive learning for the sequential interaction network. In\nCSINCERE, we formulate a Cross-Space Aggregation for message-passing across\nrepresentation spaces of different Riemannian geometries, and design a Neural\nCurvature Estimator based on Ricci curvatures for modeling the space evolvement\nover time. Thereafter, we present a Reweighed Co-Contrast between the temporal\nviews of the sequential network, so that the couple of Riemannian spaces\ninteract with each other for the interaction prediction without labels.\nEmpirical results on 5 public datasets show the superiority of CSINCERE over\nthe state-of-the-art methods.",

Unlike criminals\nassociated with common crimes such as robbery, theft or street crime, insurgent\ngangs are trained in sophisticated arms and strategise against the government\nto weaken its resolve. They are constantly on the move, operating over large\nareas causing damage to national properties and terrorizing ordinary citizens.\nDifferent from the more commonly addressed problem of modeling crime-events,\nour context requires that an approach be formulated to model the movement of\ninsurgent gangs, which is more valuable to the police forces in preempting\ntheir activities and nabbing them. This paper evolved as a collaborative work\nwith the Indian police to help augment their tactics with a systematic method,\nby integrating past data on observed gang-locations with the expert knowledge\nof the police officers. A methodological challenge in modeling the movement of\ninsurgent gangs is that the data on their locations is incomplete, since they\nare observable only at some irregularly separated time-points. Based on a\nweighted kernel density formulation for temporal data, we analytically derive\nthe closed form of the likelihood, conditional on incomplete past observed\ndata. Building on the current tactics used by the police, we device an approach\nfor constructing an expert-prior on gang-locations, along with a sequential\nBayesian procedure for estimation and prediction.

Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are\nthought to be the dominant source of interplanetary dust particles (IDP) in the\nouter solar system due to both collisions between KBOs, and their continual\nbombardment by interstellar dust particles (ISD).\n  Continued measurements through 55 au show higher than model-predicted dust\nfluxes as New Horizons approaches the putative outer edge of the Kuiper Belt\n(KB). We discuss potential explanations for the growing deviation: radiation\npressure stretches the dust distribution to further heliocentric distances than\nits parent body distribution; icy dust grains undergo photo-sputtering that\nrapidly increases their response to radiation pressure forces and pushes them\nfurther away from the sun; and the distribution of KBOs may extend much further\nthan existing observations suggest.

To fully exploit this potential, the interrelated\nproblems of modelling radiative transport and the dynamical structure of the\naccretion flow must, however, be solved. This task is challenging both from a\ntheoretical and observational point of view and is further complicated by a\nlack of direct correspondence between the properties of emission emerging from\nthe neutron star and observed far away from it. In general, a mixture of\nemission from both poles of the neutron star viewed from different angles is\nindeed observed at some or even all phases of the pulse cycle. It is essential,\ntherefore, to reconstruct the contributions of each pole to the observed flux\nin order to test and refine models describing the formation of the spectra and\npulse profiles of X-ray pulsars. In this paper we propose a novel data-driven\napproach to address this problem using the pulse-to-pulse variability in the\nobserved flux, and demonstrate its application to RXTE observations of the\nbright persistent X-ray pulsar Cen X-3. We then discuss the comparison of our\nresults with previous work attempting to solve the same problem and how they\ncan be qualitatively interpreted in the framework of a toy model describing\nemission from the poles of a neutron star.",

                "abstract": "We study the emission of dust grains within the Orion Bar - a well-known,\nhighly far-UV (FUV)-irradiated PDR. The Orion Bar because of its edge-on\ngeometry provides an exceptional benchmark for characterizing dust evolution\nand the associated driving processes under varying physical conditions. Our\ngoal is to constrain the local properties of dust by comparing its emission to\nmodels. Taking advantage of the recent JWST PDRs4All data, we follow the dust\nemission as traced by JWST NIRCam (at 3.35 and 4.8 micron) and MIRI (at 7.7,\n11.3, 15.0, and 25.5 micron), along with NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic\nobservations. First, we constrain the minimum size and hydrogen content of\ncarbon nano-grains from a comparison between the observed dust emission spectra\nand the predictions of the THEMIS dust model coupled to the numerical code\nDustEM. Using this dust model, we then perform 3D radiative transfer\nsimulations of dust emission with the SOC code and compare to data obtained\nalong well chosen profiles across the Orion Bar. The JWST data allows us, for\nthe first time, to spatially resolve the steep variation of dust emission at\nthe illuminated edge of the Orion Bar PDR. By considering a dust model with\ncarbonaceous nano-grains and submicronic coated silicate grains, we derive\nunprecedented constraints on the properties of across the Orion Bar. To explain\nthe observed emission profiles with our simulations, we find that the\nnano-grains must be strongly depleted with an abundance (relative to the gas)\n15 times less than in the diffuse ISM. The NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic\nobservations reveal variations in the hydrogenation of the carbon nano-grains.\nThe lowest hydrogenation levels are found in the vicinity of the illuminating\nstars suggesting photo-processing while more hydrogenated nano-grains are found\nin the cold and dense molecular region, potentially indicative of larger\ngrains.",

To provide sufficient learning support, modern MTL uses annotated\ndata with full, or sufficiently large overlap across tasks, i.e., each input\nsample is annotated for all, or most of the tasks. However, collecting such\nannotations is prohibitive in many real applications, and cannot benefit from\ndatasets available for individual tasks. In this work, we challenge this setup\nand show that MTL can be successful with classification tasks with little, or\nnon-overlapping annotations, or when there is big discrepancy in the size of\nlabeled data per task. We explore task-relatedness for co-annotation and\nco-training, and propose a novel approach, where knowledge exchange is enabled\nbetween the tasks via distribution matching. To demonstrate the general\napplicability of our method, we conducted diverse case studies in the domains\nof affective computing, face recognition, species recognition, and shopping\nitem classification using nine datasets. Our large-scale study of affective\ntasks for basic expression recognition and facial action unit detection\nillustrates that our approach is network agnostic and brings large performance\nimprovements compared to the state-of-the-art in both tasks and across all\nstudied databases. In all case studies, we show that co-training via\ntask-relatedness is advantageous and prevents negative transfer (which occurs\nwhen MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task\nmodel).",

Experimental result shows that LLMs are prone to exhibit position\nbias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or\nspecific positional cues within the input. Existing works on mitigating\nposition bias require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples,\nwhich is unpractical in reality. In this work, we propose a zero-shot position\ndebiasing (ZOE) framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs. ZOE leverages\nunsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing, thus without any\nexternal knowledge or datasets. To improve the quality of unsupervised\nresponses, we propose a master-slave alignment (MSA) module to prune these\nresponses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks show that ZOE\nconsistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating four types of position\nbiases. Besides, ZOE achieves this by sacrificing only a small performance on\nbiased samples, which is simple and effective.",

                "abstract": "As more IoT applications gradually move towards the cloud-edge collaborative\nmode, the containerized scheduling of workflows extends from the cloud to the\nedge. However, given the high delay of the communication network, loose\ncoupling of structure, and resource heterogeneity between cloud and edge,\nworkflow containerization scheduling in the cloud-edge scenarios faces the\ndifficulty of resource coordination and application collaboration management.\nTo address these two issues, we propose a KubeEdge-Cloud-Edge-Scheduling scheme\nnamed KCES, a workflow containerization scheduling scheme for the KubeEdge\ncloud-edge framework. The KCES includes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine\nfor KubeEdge and workflow scheduling strategies for task horizontal roaming and\nvertical offloading. Considering the scheduling optimization of cloud-edge\nworkflows, this paper proposes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling model and\ncloud-edge node model and designs a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine to\nmaximize cloud-edge resource utilization under the constraint of workflow task\ndelay. A cloud-edge resource hybrid management technology is used to design the\ncloud-edge resource evaluation and resource allocation algorithms to achieve\ncloud-edge resource collaboration. Based on the ideas of distributed functional\nroles and the hierarchical division of computing power, the horizontal roaming\namong the edges and vertical offloading strategies between the cloud and edges\nfor workflow tasks are designed to realize the cloud-edge application\ncollaboration. Through a customized IoT application workflow instance,\nexperimental results show that KCES is superior to the baseline in total\nworkflow duration, average workflow duration, and resource usage and has the\ncapabilities of horizontal roaming and vertical offloading for workflow tasks.",

                "abstract": "Crowd counting has gained significant popularity due to its practical\napplications. However, mainstream counting methods ignore precise individual\nlocalization and suffer from annotation noise because of counting from\nestimating density maps. Additionally, they also struggle with high-density\nimages.To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end model called\nFine-Grained Extraction Network (FGENet). Different from methods estimating\ndensity maps, FGENet directly learns the original coordinate points that\nrepresent the precise localization of individuals.This study designs a fusion\nmodule, named Fine-Grained Feature Pyramid(FGFP), that is used to fuse feature\nmaps extracted by the backbone of FGENet. The fused features are then passed to\nboth regression and classification heads, where the former provides predicted\npoint coordinates for a given image, and the latter determines the confidence\nlevel for each predicted point being an individual. At the end, FGENet\nestablishes correspondences between prediction points and ground truth points\nby employing the Hungarian algorithm. For training FGENet, we design a robust\nloss function, named Three-Task Combination (TTC), to mitigate the impact of\nannotation noise. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used crowd\ncounting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nFGENet. Notably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of 3.14 points in\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) on the ShanghaiTech Part A dataset, showcasing its\nsuperiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Different\nfrom the previous studies which failed to fully consider the spin-orbit\ncoupling effect, we find that the AFM-ZZ ground state in FePS3 is stabilized by\ncompeting ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic third\nnearest-neighbor exchange interactions, and combining single-ion anisotropy.\nWhereas, the often ignored nearest-neighbor biquadratic exchange is responsible\nfor the in-plane AFM-ZZ ground state in NiPS3. We additionally calculate\nspin-wave spectrum of AFM-ZZ structure in the two monolayers based on the exact\nspin Hamiltonian, which can be directly verified by the experimental\ninvestigation. Our work provides a theoretical framework for the origin of\nAFM-ZZ ground state in two-dimensional materials.",

                "abstract": "Skin lesions are classified in benign or malignant. Among the malignant,\nmelanoma is a very aggressive cancer and the major cause of deaths. So, early\ndiagnosis of skin cancer is very desired. In the last few years, there is a\ngrowing interest in computer aided diagnostic (CAD) using most image and\nclinical data of the lesion. These sources of information present limitations\ndue to their inability to provide information of the molecular structure of the\nlesion. NIR spectroscopy may provide an alternative source of information to\nautomated CAD of skin lesions. The most commonly used techniques and\nclassification algorithms used in spectroscopy are Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and Support\nVector Machines (SVM). Nonetheless, there is a growing interest in applying the\nmodern techniques of machine and deep learning (MDL) to spectroscopy. One of\nthe main limitations to apply MDL to spectroscopy is the lack of public\ndatasets. Since there is no public dataset of NIR spectral data to skin\nlesions, as far as we know, an effort has been made and a new dataset named\nNIR-SC-UFES, has been collected, annotated and analyzed generating the\ngold-standard for classification of NIR spectral data to skin cancer. Next, the\nmachine learning algorithms XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, 1D-convolutional\nneural network (1D-CNN) were investigated to classify cancer and non-cancer\nskin lesions. Experimental results indicate the best performance obtained by\nLightGBM with pre-processing using standard normal variate (SNV), feature\nextraction providing values of 0.839 for balanced accuracy, 0.851 for recall,\n0.852 for precision, and 0.850 for F-score. The obtained results indicate the\nfirst steps in CAD of skin lesions aiming the automated triage of patients with\nskin lesions in vivo using NIR spectral data.",

In this paper, we propose a more general,\ntheoretically sound, targeted attack that resorts to the minimization of a\nJacobian-induced MAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, taking into account the\neffort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of\nthe input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting\nthe Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a\nNon-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm provides an\noptimal solution to a linearized version of the adversarial example problem\noriginally introduced by Szegedy et al. \\cite{szegedy2013intriguing}. The\nexperiments we carried out confirm the generality of the proposed attack which\nis proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes.\nNoticeably, the JMA attack is also effective in a multi-label classification\nscenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the\nlabels in a complex multilabel classification scenario with 20 labels, a\ncapability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a\nfurther advantage, the JMA attack usually requires very few iterations, thus\nresulting more efficient than existing methods.",

As a remedy, recent works\nproposed deep learning-based approaches as alternatives to ELA. In these works,\ne.g., point-cloud transformers were used to characterize an optimization\nproblem's fitness landscape.

To this end,\nrecent studies have attempted to explore the multi-modal knowledge of\nvision-language pre-training (VLP) models by knowledge distillation, allowing\nto recognize unseen labels in an open-vocabulary manner. However, experimental\nevidence shows that knowledge distillation is suboptimal and provides limited\nperformance gain in unseen label prediction. In this paper, a novel query-based\nknowledge sharing paradigm is proposed to explore the multi-modal knowledge\nfrom the pretrained VLP model for open-vocabulary multi-label classification.\nSpecifically, a set of learnable label-agnostic query tokens is trained to\nextract critical vision knowledge from the input image, and further shared\nacross all labels, allowing them to select tokens of interest as visual clues\nfor recognition. Besides, we propose an effective prompt pool for robust label\nembedding, and reformulate the standard ranking learning into a form of\nclassification to allow the magnitude of feature vectors for matching, which\nboth significantly benefit label recognition.

Numerical reproduction of this process is therefore\nessential for developing robust solar models. Our goal is to assess\nplasmoid-mediated reconnection across various numerical resistivity models in\norder to investigate how plasmoid numbers and reconnection rates depend on the\nLundquist number. We used the Bifrost code to drive magnetic reconnection in a\n2D coronal fan-spine topology, carrying out a parametric study of several\nexperiments with different numerical resolution and resistivity models. We\nemployed three anomalous resistivity models: (1) the original hyper-diffusion\nfrom Bifrost, (2) a resistivity proportional to current density, and (3) a\nresistivity quadratically proportional to electron drift velocity. For\ncomparisons, experiments with uniform resistivity were also run.\nPlasmoid-mediated reconnection is obtained in most of the experiments. With\nuniform resistivity, increasing the resolution reveals higher plasmoid\nfrequency with weaker scaling to the Lundquist number, obtaining 7.9-12\nplasmoids per minute for $S_L\\in[1.8 \\times 10^4, 2.6\\times 10^5]$ with a\nscaling of $S_L^{0.210}$ in the highest-resolution resistivity cases,\ntranscending into Petschek reconnection in the high-$S_L$ limit and\nSweet-Parker reconnection in the low-$S_L$ limit. Anomalous resistivity leads\nto similar results even with lower resolution. The drift-velocity-dependent\nresistivity excellently reproduces Petschek reconnection for any Lundquist\nnumber, and similar results are seen with resistivity proportional to\ncurrent-density. Among the different resistivity models applied on the given\nnumerical resolution, the hyper-diffusion model reproduced plasmoid\ncharacteristics in closest resemblance to those obtained with uniform\nresistivity at a significantly higher resolution.",

                "abstract": "Simulating high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in complex\nscenes has consistently presented a significant research challenge. The\ndevelopment of a microwave-domain surface scattering model and its\nreversibility are poised to play a pivotal role in enhancing the authenticity\nof SAR image simulations and facilitating the reconstruction of target\nparameters. Drawing inspiration from the field of computer graphics, this paper\nproposes a surface microwave rendering model that comprehensively considers\nboth Specular and Diffuse contributions. The model is analytically represented\nby the coherent spatially varying bidirectional scattering distribution\nfunction (CSVBSDF) based on the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and the\nperturbation method (SPM). And SAR imaging is achieved through the synergistic\ncombination of ray tracing and fast mapping projection techniques. Furthermore,\na differentiable ray tracing (DRT) engine based on SAR images was constructed\nfor CSVBSDF surface scattering parameter learning. Within this SAR image\nsimulation engine, the use of differentiable reverse ray tracing enables the\nrapid estimation of parameter gradients from SAR images. The effectiveness of\nthis approach has been validated through simulations and comparisons with real\nSAR images. By learning the surface scattering parameters, substantial\nenhancements in SAR image simulation performance under various observation\nconditions have been demonstrated.",

A crucial step\nof FL, that of aggregating local models to produce the global one, shares many\nsimilarities with public decision-making, and elections in particular.

In this\npaper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic\nvoting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based\nelections. Our theoretical analysis establishes that FedQV is a truthful\nmechanism in which bidding according to one's true valuation is a dominant\nstrategy that achieves a convergence rate that matches those of\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our empirical analysis using multiple\nreal-world datasets validates the superior performance of FedQV against\npoisoning attacks.

                "abstract": "We describe a new general method for segmentation in MRI scans using\nTopological Data Analysis (TDA), offering several advantages over traditional\nmachine learning approaches. It works in three steps, first identifying the\nwhole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a\ndistinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the\nvarious components of the segmentation. Although convoking classical ideas of\nTDA, such an algorithm has never been proposed separately from deep learning\nmethods. To achieve this, our approach takes into account, in addition to the\nhomology of the image, the localization of representative cycles, a piece of\ninformation that seems never to have been exploited in this context. In\nparticular, it offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for\nlarge annotated data sets. TDA also provides a more interpretable and stable\nframework for segmentation by explicitly mapping topological features to\nsegmentation components. By adapting the geometric object to be detected, the\nalgorithm can be adjusted to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We\ncarefully study the examples of glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a\nsphere is to be detected, as well as myocardium in cardiac MRI, involving a\ncylinder, and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are\ncircles.

It has potential applications in future storage systems, such as DNA\nstorage and racetrack memory. When decoding marker codes, perfect channel state\ninformation (CSI), i.e., insertion and deletion probabilities, are required to\ndetect insertion and deletion errors. Sometimes, the perfect CSI is not easy to\nobtain or the accurate channel model is unknown. Therefore, it is deserved to\ndevelop detecting algorithms for marker code without the knowledge of perfect\nCSI. In this paper, we propose two CSI-agnostic detecting algorithms for marker\ncode based on deep learning. The first one is a model-driven deep learning\nmethod, which deep unfolds the original iterative detecting algorithm of marker\ncode. In this method, CSI become weights in neural networks and these weights\ncan be learned from training data. The second one is a data-driven method which\nis an end-to-end system based on the deep bidirectional gated recurrent unit\nnetwork. Simulation results show that error performances of the proposed\nmethods are significantly better than that of the original detection algorithm\nwith CSI uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed data-driven method exhibits\nbetter error performances than other methods for unknown channel models.",

Objective:\nWe aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality\ndefects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this\nrequirement. Method: We replicate a controlled experiment in which 25\nparticipants from industry and university generate domain models from four\nnatural language requirements containing different quality defects. We evaluate\nthe resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis.\nResults: Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive\nvoice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models. The use of\nambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the\nresulting domain models. Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect\nassociations in domain models. Conclusion: Despite being equally advised\nagainst by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows\nthat the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on\nsoftware engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of\nattention.

We\nshow how to apply this framework in search games over both discrete and\ncontinuous, as well as bounded and unbounded spaces.

In contrast to\ntraditional methods like the Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI), HAAQI-Net\nutilizes a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) with attention. It\ntakes an assessed music sample and a hearing loss pattern as input, generating\na predicted HAAQI score. The model employs the pre-trained Bidirectional\nEncoder representation from Audio Transformers (BEATs) for acoustic feature\nextraction. Comparing predicted scores with ground truth, HAAQI-Net achieves a\nLongitudinal Concordance Correlation (LCC) of 0.9257, Spearman's Rank\nCorrelation Coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9394, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of\n0.0080. Notably, this high performance comes with a substantial reduction in\ninference time: from 62.52 seconds (by HAAQI) to 2.71 seconds (by HAAQI-Net),\nserving as an efficient music quality assessment model for hearing aid users.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Neural implicit fields, such as the neural signed distance field (SDF) of a\nshape, have emerged as a powerful representation for many applications, e.g.,\nencoding a 3D shape and performing collision detection. Typically, implicit\nfields are encoded by Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) with positional encoding\n(PE) to capture high-frequency geometric details. However, a notable side\neffect of such PE-equipped MLPs is the noisy artifacts present in the learned\nimplicit fields. While increasing the sampling rate could in general mitigate\nthese artifacts, in this paper we aim to explain this adverse phenomenon\nthrough the lens of Fourier analysis. We devise a tool to determine the\nappropriate sampling rate for learning an accurate neural implicit field\nwithout undesirable side effects. Specifically, we propose a simple yet\neffective method to estimate the intrinsic frequency of a given network with\nrandomized weights based on the Fourier analysis of the network's responses. It\nis observed that a PE-equipped MLP has an intrinsic frequency much higher than\nthe highest frequency component in the PE layer. Sampling against this\nintrinsic frequency following the Nyquist-Sannon sampling theorem allows us to\ndetermine an appropriate training sampling rate. We empirically show in the\nsetting of SDF fitting that this recommended sampling rate is sufficient to\nsecure accurate fitting results, while further increasing the sampling rate\nwould not further noticeably reduce the fitting error. Training PE-equipped\nMLPs simply with our sampling strategy leads to performances superior to the\nexisting methods.",

Spiker+ is tested on two benchmark datasets, the MNIST and the Spiking\nHeidelberg Digits (SHD). On the MNIST, it demonstrates competitive performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators. It outperforms them in terms of\nresource allocation, with a requirement of 7,612 logic cells and 18 Block RAMs\n(BRAMs), which makes it fit in very small FPGA, and power consumption, draining\nonly 180mW for a complete inference on an input image. The latency is\ncomparable to the ones observed in the state-of-the-art, with 780us/img. To the\nauthors' knowledge, Spiker+ is the first SNN accelerator tested on the SHD. In\nthis case, the accelerator requires 18,268 logic cells and 51 BRAM, with an\noverall power consumption of 430mW and a latency of 54 us for a complete\ninference on input data.

                "abstract": "In recent years, the amalgamation of satellite communications and aerial\nplatforms into space-air-ground integrated network (SAGINs) has emerged as an\nindispensable area of research for future communications due to the global\ncoverage capacity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the flexible\nDeployment of aerial platforms. This paper presents a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL)-based approach for the joint optimization of offloading and\nresource allocation in hybrid cloud and multi-access edge computing (MEC)\nscenarios within SAGINs. The proposed system considers the presence of multiple\nsatellites, clouds and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The multiple tasks from\nground users are modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). With the goal of\nreducing energy consumption and latency in MEC, we propose a novel multi-agent\nalgorithm based on DRL that optimizes both the offloading strategy and the\nallocation of resources in the MEC infrastructure within SAGIN. A hybrid action\nalgorithm is utilized to address the challenge of hybrid continuous and\ndiscrete action space in the proposed problems, and a decision-assisted DRL\nmethod is adopted to reduce the impact of unavailable actions in the training\nprocess of DRL. Through extensive simulations, the results demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed learning-based scheme, the proposed approach\nconsistently outperforms benchmark schemes, highlighting its superior\nperformance and potential for practical applications.",

                "abstract": "Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) offers a promising solution for large-scale\nsolar energy utilization as Thermal Energy Storage (TES) enables electricity\ngeneration independently of daily solar fluctuations, shifting to high-priced\nelectricity intervals. The development of dispatch planning tools is mandatory\nto account for uncertainties associated with solar irradiation and electricity\nprice forecasts as well as limited storage capacity. This study proposes the\nStochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program (SMILP) to maximize expected profit\nwithin a specified scenario space. The SMILP scenario space is generated by\ndifferent Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function percentiles of the\npotential solar energy to accumulate in storage and the expected profit is\nestimated using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. SMILP exhibits\nrobust performance, however, its computational time poses a challenge. Thus,\nthree heuristic solutions are developed which run a set of deterministic\noptimizations on different historical weather profiles to generate candidate\ndispatching plans (DPs). The candidate DP with the best average performance on\nall profiles is then selected. The new methods were applied to a case study for\na 115 MW CST plant in South Australia. When the historical database has a\nlimited set of historical weather profiles, the SMILP achieves 6% to 9% higher\nprofit than the closest benchmark when the DP is applied to novel weather\nconditions. With a large historical weather data, the performance of SMILP and\nHeuristic-2 becomes nearly identical because the SMILP can only utilize a\nlimited number of trajectories for optimization without becoming\ncomputationally infeasible. In this case, Heuristic-2 emerges a practical\nalternative, since it provides similar average profit in a reasonable time\n(saving about 7 hours in computing time).",

                "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel generative task: joint scene graph - image\ngeneration. While previous works have explored image generation conditioned on\nscene graphs or layouts, our task is distinctive and important as it involves\ngenerating scene graphs themselves unconditionally from noise, enabling\nefficient and interpretable control for image generation. Our task is\nchallenging, requiring the generation of plausible scene graphs with\nheterogeneous attributes for nodes (objects) and edges (relations among\nobjects), including continuous object bounding boxes and discrete object and\nrelation categories. We introduce a novel diffusion model, DiffuseSG, that\njointly models the adjacency matrix along with heterogeneous node and edge\nattributes. We explore various types of encodings for the categorical data,\nrelaxing it into a continuous space. With a graph transformer being the\ndenoiser, DiffuseSG successively denoises the scene graph representation in a\ncontinuous space and discretizes the final representation to generate the clean\nscene graph. Additionally, we introduce an IoU regularization to enhance the\nempirical performance. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods in\nscene graph generation on the Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets, both on\nstandard and newly introduced metrics that better capture the problem\ncomplexity. Moreover, we demonstrate the additional benefits of our model in\ntwo downstream applications: 1) excelling in a series of scene graph completion\ntasks, and 2) improving scene graph detection models by using extra training\nsamples generated from DiffuseSG.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Recently, text-to-image (T2I) synthesis has undergone significant\nadvancements, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM)\nand their enhancement in Large Vision Models (LVM), greatly enhancing the\ninstruction-following capabilities of traditional T2I models. Nevertheless,\nprevious methods focus on improving generation quality but introduce unsafe\nfactors into prompts. We explore that appending specific camera descriptions to\nprompts can enhance safety performance. Consequently, we propose a simple and\nsafe prompt engineering method (SSP) to improve image generation quality by\nproviding optimal camera descriptions. Specifically, we create a dataset from\nmulti-datasets as original prompts. To select the optimal camera, we design an\noptimal camera matching approach and implement a classifier for original\nprompts capable of automatically matching. Appending camera descriptions to\noriginal prompts generates optimized prompts for further LVM image generation.\nExperiments demonstrate that SSP improves semantic consistency by an average of\n16% compared to others and safety metrics by 48.9%.",

                "abstract": "Compared to the generations up to 4G, whose main focus was on broadband and\ncoverage aspects, 5G has expanded the scope of wireless cellular systems\ntowards embracing two new types of connectivity: massive machine-type\ncommunication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC).\nThis paper will discuss the possible evolution of these two types of\nconnectivity within the umbrella of 6G wireless systems. The paper consists of\nthree parts. The first part deals with the connectivity for a massive number of\ndevices. While mMTC research in 5G was predominantly focused on the problem of\nuncoordinated access in the uplink for a large number of devices, the traffic\npatterns in 6G may become more symmetric, leading to closed-loop massive\nconnectivity. One of the drivers for this is distributed learning/inference.\nThe second part of the paper will discuss the evolution of wireless\nconnectivity for critical services. While latency and reliability are tightly\ncoupled in 5G, 6G will support a variety of safety critical control\napplications with different types of timing requirements, as evidenced by the\nemergence of metrics related to information freshness and information value.\nAdditionally, ensuring ultra-high reliability for safety critical control\napplications requires modeling and estimation of the tail statistics of the\nwireless channel, queue length, and delay. The fulfillment of these stringent\nrequirements calls for the development of novel AI-based techniques,\nincorporating optimization theory, explainable AI, generative AI and digital\ntwins. The third part will analyze the coexistence of massive connectivity and\ncritical services. We will consider scenarios in which a massive number of\ndevices need to support traffic patterns of mixed criticality. This will be\nfollowed by a discussion about the management of wireless resources shared by\nservices with different criticality.",

                "abstract": "Tree-based models have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks,\nincluding time series forecasting. They are increasingly in demand and widely\naccepted because of their comparatively high level of interpretability.\nHowever, many of them suffer from the overfitting problem, which limits their\napplication in real-world decision-making. This problem becomes even more\nsevere in online-forecasting settings where time series observations are\nincrementally acquired, and the distributions from which they are drawn may\nkeep changing over time. In this context, we propose a novel method for the\nonline selection of tree-based models using the TreeSHAP explainability method\nin the task of time series forecasting. We start with an arbitrary set of\ndifferent tree-based models. Then, we outline a performance-based ranking with\na coherent design to make TreeSHAP able to specialize the tree-based\nforecasters across different regions in the input time series. In this\nframework, adequate model selection is performed online, adaptively following\ndrift detection in the time series. In addition, explainability is supported on\nthree levels, namely online input importance, model selection, and model output\nexplanation.

                "abstract": "The physics of driven collective modes in quantum materials underpin a number\nof striking non-equilibrium functional responses, which include enhanced\nmagnetism, ferroelectricity and superconductivity. However, the coherent\ncoupling between multiple modes at once are difficult to capture by single-pump\nprobe (one-dimensional) spectroscopy, and often remain poorly understood. One\nexample is phonon-mediated amplification of Josephson plasmons in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, in which at least three normal modes of the solid are\ncoherently mixed as a source of enhanced superconductivity. Here, we go beyond\nprevious pump-probe experiments in this system and acquire two-dimensional\nfrequency maps using pairs of mutually delayed, carrier envelope phase stable\nmid-infrared pump pulses, combined with measurements of the time-modulated\nsecond-order nonlinear optical susceptibility. We find that the driven\nzone-center phonons amplify coherent pairs of opposite-momentum Josephson\nplasma polaritons, generating a squeezed state of interlayer phase\nfluctuations. The squeezed state is a potentially important ingredient in the\nmicroscopic physics of photo-induced superconductivity in this and other\nmaterials.",

                "abstract": "One of the major challenges in particle physics and cosmology is\nunderstanding why there is an asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the\nUniverse. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is thermal leptogenesis,\nwhich involves the addition of at least two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to\nthe standard model. Another possible explanation is baryogenesis through the\nhypermagnetic fields which involves the ${\\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly and helical\nhypermagnetic fields in the early Universe. In this paper, after reviewing the\nthermal leptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly, we\ninvestigate the simplest model that combines these two scenarios and explore\nthe parameter space for optimal results. Our results show that the combined\nscenario permits a specific region of parameter space that is not covered by\neither one separately. In fact, the minimum required mass scale of the RHN and\nstrength of initial hypermagnetic helicity are reduced by one order of\nmagnitude in our model. Moreover, we find that in the combined scenario,\nleptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly can either\namplify or reduce the effect of each other, i.e., the generated asymmetry,\ndepending on the sign of the helical hypermagnetic fields. Finally, we show the\nsurprising result that a drastic amplification can occur even when the initial\nabundance of RHN is its equilibrium value for leptogenesis.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Face recognition systems have raised concerns due to their vulnerability to\ndifferent presentation attacks, and system security has become an increasingly\ncritical concern. Although many face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods perform well\nin intra-dataset scenarios, their generalization remains a challenge. To\naddress this issue, some methods adopt domain adversarial training (DAT) to\nextract domain-invariant features. However, the competition between the encoder\nand the domain discriminator can cause the network to be difficult to train and\nconverge. In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial attack (DAA) method to\nmitigate the training instability problem by adding perturbations to the input\nimages, which makes them indistinguishable across domains and enables domain\nalignment. Moreover, since models trained on limited data and types of attacks\ncannot generalize well to unknown attacks, we propose a dual perceptual and\ngenerative knowledge distillation framework for face anti-spoofing that\nutilizes pre-trained face-related models containing rich face priors.\nSpecifically, we adopt two different face-related models as teachers to\ntransfer knowledge to the target student model. The pre-trained teacher models\nare not from the task of face anti-spoofing but from perceptual and generative\ntasks, respectively, which implicitly augment the data. By combining both DAA\nand dual-teacher knowledge distillation, we develop a dual teacher knowledge\ndistillation with domain alignment framework (DTDA) for face anti-spoofing. The\nadvantage of our proposed method has been verified through extensive ablation\nstudies and comparison with state-of-the-art methods on public datasets across\nmultiple protocols.",

                "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has achieved near-atomic level resolution\nof biomolecules by reconstructing 2D micrographs. However, the resolution and\naccuracy of the reconstructed particles are significantly reduced due to the\nextremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and complex noise structure of\ncryo-EM images. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion model with\npost-processing framework to effectively denoise and restore single particle\ncryo-EM images. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) denoising\nmethods by effectively removing structural noise that has not been addressed\nbefore. Additionally, more accurate and high-resolution three-dimensional\nreconstruction structures can be obtained from denoised cryo-EM images.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Aims. We studied the manifestation of decayless oscillations in 3D\nsimulations of coronal loops, driven by random motions. Methods. Using the\nPLUTO code, we ran magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a straight\ngravitationally stratified flux tube, with its footpoints embedded in\nchromospheric plasma. We consider transverse waves drivers with a horizontally\npolarised red noise power-law spectrum. Results. Our broadband drivers lead to\nthe excitation of standing waves with frequencies equal to the fundamental\nstanding kink mode and its harmonics. These standing kink oscillations have\nnon-decaying amplitudes, and spectra that depend on the characteristics of the\nloops, with the latter amplifying the resonant frequencies from the drivers. We\nthus report for the first time in 3D simulations the manifestation of decayless\noscillations from broadband drivers. The spatial and temporal evolution of our\noscillation spectra reveals the manifestation of a half harmonic, which\nexhibits half the frequency of the identified fundamental mode with a similar\nspatial profile. Our results suggest that this mode is related to the presence\nof the transition region in our model and could be interpreted as being the\nequivalent to the fundamental mode of standing sound waves driven on pipes\nclosed at one end. Conclusions. The potential existence of this half harmonic\nhas important implications for coronal seismology, since misinterpreting it for\nthe fundamental mode of the system can lead to false estimations of the average\nkink speed profile along oscillating loops. Finally, its detection could\npotentially give us a tool for distinguishing between different excitation and\ndriving mechanisms of decayless oscillations in observations.",

Moreover, although the IRS-aided Asy scheme\nconsistently achieves the highest sum throughput, the IRS-aided TDMA scheme is\nmore appealing in scenarios with substantial cross-link interference and\nlimited IRS elements, while the IRS-aided Syn scheme is preferable in low\ncross-link interference scenarios.",

In this study, a\ntrajectory image-based deep learning method is proposed to predict ALTs for the\naircraft entering the research airspace that covers the Terminal Maneuvering\nArea (TMA). Specifically, the trajectories of all airborne arrival aircraft\nwithin the temporal capture window are used to generate an image with the\ntarget aircraft trajectory labeled as red and all background aircraft\ntrajectory labeled as blue. The trajectory images contain various information,\nincluding the aircraft position, speed, heading, relative distances, and\narrival traffic flows. It enables us to use state-of-the-art deep convolution\nneural networks for ALT modeling. We also use real-time runway usage obtained\nfrom the trajectory data and the external information such as aircraft types\nand weather conditions as additional inputs. Moreover, a convolution neural\nnetwork (CNN) based module is designed for automatic holding-related\nfeaturizing, which takes the trajectory images, the leading aircraft holding\nstatus, and their time and speed gap at the research airspace boundary as its\ninputs. Its output is further fed into the final end-to-end ALT prediction. The\nproposed ALT prediction approach is applied to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO\nCode: WSSS) using one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)\ndata from November 1 to November 30, 2022. Experimental results show that by\nintegrating the holding featurization, we can reduce the mean absolute error\n(MAE) from 82.23 seconds to 43.96 seconds, and achieve an average accuracy of\n96.1\\%, with 79.4\\% of the predictions errors being less than 60 seconds.",

When the\nmodel parameters are drawn from unknown non-stationary distributions and we are\ngiven machine-learned predictions of the distributions, we develop a new\nalgorithm from our framework with a regret $O(W_T+\\sqrt{T})$, where $W_T$\nmeasures the total inaccuracy of the machine-learned predictions.

                "abstract": "Recently, substantial advancements in pre-trained vision-language models have\ngreatly enhanced the capabilities of multi-modal dialog systems. These models\nhave demonstrated significant improvements by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.\nHowever, the existing pre-trained models primarily focus on effectively\ncapturing the alignment between vision and language modalities, often ignoring\nthe intricate nature of dialog context. In this paper, we propose a\nparameter-efficient prompt-tuning method named DialCLIP for multi-modal dialog\nretrieval. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-modal context prompt\ngenerator to learn context features which are subsequently distilled into\nprompts within the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP. Besides, we\nintroduce domain prompt to mitigate the disc repancy from the downstream dialog\ndata. To facilitate various types of retrieval, we also design multiple experts\nto learn mappings from CLIP outputs to multi-modal representation space, with\neach expert being responsible to one specific retrieval type. Extensive\nexperiments show that DialCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two\nwidely recognized benchmark datasets (i.e., PhotoChat and MMDialog) by tuning a\nmere 0.04% of the total parameters. These results highlight the efficacy and\nefficiency of our proposed approach, underscoring its potential to advance the\nfield of multi-modal dialog retrieval.",

                "abstract": "Due to the poor illumination and the difficulty in annotating, nighttime\nconditions pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicle perception\nsystems. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely applied to\nsemantic segmentation on such images to adapt models from normal conditions to\ntarget nighttime-condition domains. Self-training (ST) is a paradigm in UDA,\nwhere a momentum teacher is utilized for pseudo-label prediction, but a\nconfirmation bias issue exists. Because the one-directional knowledge transfer\nfrom a single teacher is insufficient to adapt to a large domain shift. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose to alleviate domain gap by incrementally\nconsidering style influence and illumination change. Therefore, we introduce a\none-stage Dual-Teacher Bi-directional Self-training (DTBS) framework for smooth\nknowledge transfer and feedback. Based on two teacher models, we present a\nnovel pipeline to respectively decouple style and illumination shift. In\naddition, we propose a new Re-weight exponential moving average (EMA) to merge\nthe knowledge of style and illumination factors, and provide feedback to the\nstudent model. In this way, our method can be embedded in other UDA methods to\nenhance their performance.

For this, we consider the concurrence,\nintrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence, and evaluate the proposed\ntrade-off relations between them. In particular, we study the temporal\nevolution of a general two-qubit XYZ Heisenberg model with asymmetric\nspin-orbit interaction under decoherence and analyze the trade-off relations of\nquantum resource theory. For XYZ Heisenberg model, we confirm that the\ntrade-off relation between intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence\nholds. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of intrinsic concurrence is\nuniversally valid, but the upper bound is generally not. These relations in\nHeisenberg models can provide a way to explore how quantum resources are\ndistributed in spins, which may inspire future applications in quantum\ninformation processing.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Pre-trained code models have recently achieved substantial improvements in\nmany code intelligence tasks. These models are first pre-trained on large-scale\nunlabeled datasets in a task-agnostic manner using self-supervised learning,\nand then fine-tuned on labeled datasets in downstream tasks. However, the\nlabeled datasets are usually limited in size (i.e., human intensive efforts),\nwhich may hinder the performance of pre-trained code models in specific tasks.\nTo mitigate this, one possible solution is to leverage the large-scale\nunlabeled data in the tuning stage by pseudo-labeling. However, directly\nemploying the pseudo-labeled data can bring a large amount of noise, i.e.,\nincorrect labels, leading to suboptimal performance. How to effectively\nleverage the noisy pseudo-labeled data is a challenging yet under-explored\nproblem.In this paper, we propose a novel approach named HINT to improve\npre-trained code models with large-scale unlabeled datasets by better utilizing\nthe pseudo-labeled data. HINT includes two main modules: HybrId pseudo-labeled\ndata selection and Noise-tolerant Training. In the hybrid pseudo-data selection\nmodule, considering the robustness issue, apart from directly measuring the\nquality of pseudo labels through training loss, we further propose to employ a\nretrieval-based method to filter low-quality pseudo-labeled data. The\nnoise-tolerant training module aims to further mitigate the influence of errors\nin pseudo labels by training the model with a noise-tolerant loss function and\nby regularizing the consistency of model predictions.The experimental results\nshow that HINT can better leverage those unlabeled data in a task-specific way\nand provide complementary benefits for pre-trained models, e.g., improving the\nbest baseline model by 15.33%, 16.50%, and 8.98% on code summarization, defect\ndetection, and assertion generation, respectively.",

The challenge faced by generative models lies in their ability to\nproduce compounds that are both bioactive and novel, rather than merely making\nminor modifications to known actives present in the training set. Recognizing\nthe utility of pharmacophores in facilitating scaffold hopping, we developed\nTransPharmer, an innovative generative model that integrates ligand-based\ninterpretable pharmacophore fingerprints with generative pre-training\ntransformer (GPT) for de novo molecule generation. TransPharmer demonstrates\nsuperior performance across tasks involving unconditioned distribution\nlearning, de novo generation and scaffold elaboration under pharmacophoric\nconstraints. Its distinct exploration mode within the local chemical space\nrenders it particularly useful for scaffold hopping, producing compounds that\nare structurally novel while pharmaceutically related. The efficacy of\nTransPharmer is validated through two case studies involving the dopamine\nreceptor D2 (DRD2) and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Notably in the case of PLK1,\nthree out of four synthesized designed compounds exhibit submicromolar\nactivities, with the most potent one, IIP0943, demonstrating a potency of 5.1\nnM.

Deep learning AMR strategies have achieved tremendous\nsuccess in recent years. Modulated signals exhibit long temporal dependencies,\nand extracting global features is crucial in identifying modulation schemes.\nTraditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to\nclassify modulation schemes. Classical convolutional-based networks, due to\ntheir limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle\nto capture global relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce a\nnovel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures\nof the transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM). We utilize the\nself-attention mechanism of the transformer to model the global correlations in\nsignal sequences while employing LSTM to enhance the capture of temporal\ndependencies. To mitigate the impact like RF fingerprint features and channel\ncharacteristics on model generalization, we propose data augmentation\nstrategies known as segment substitution (SS) to enhance the model's robustness\nto modulation-related features. Experimental results on widely-used datasets\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits\nsignificant advantages in terms of complexity.

To answer this question, we conduct an\nextensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU\nhours. We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension,\nfurther pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer. To accurately assess\nthe model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing\nbenchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench. Furthermore, a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted,\nconsidering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical\ncoherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting\ninstruction tasks from 17 diverse categories. Our evaluation results\ndemonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can\nbe achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of\nknowledge alignment and response quality.

To address this issue, in the dynamic\nmulti-objective optimization problem, we introduce task-specific elastic\nfactors to adjust the descent direction towards the Pareto front. The proposed\nmethod, called Elastic Multi-Gradient Descent (EMGD), ensures that each update\nfollows an appropriate Pareto descent direction, minimizing any negative impact\non previously learned tasks. To balance the training between old and new tasks,\nwe also propose a memory editing mechanism guided by the gradient computed\nusing EMGD. This editing process updates the stored data points, reducing\ninterference in the Pareto descent direction from previous tasks. Experiments\non public datasets validate the effectiveness of our EMGD in the PCL setting.",

In this\npaper, we develop Cheetah, a massively multilingual NLG language model for\nAfrican languages. Cheetah supports 517 African languages and language\nvarieties, allowing us to address the scarcity of NLG resources and provide a\nsolution to foster linguistic diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCheetah through comprehensive evaluations across seven generation downstream\ntasks. In five of the seven tasks, Cheetah significantly outperforms other\nmodels, showcasing its remarkable performance for generating coherent and\ncontextually appropriate text in a wide range of African languages. We\nadditionally conduct a detailed human evaluation to delve deeper into the\nlinguistic capabilities of Cheetah. The introduction of Cheetah has\nfar-reaching benefits for linguistic diversity. By leveraging pretrained models\nand adapting them to specific languages, our approach facilitates the\ndevelopment of practical NLG applications for African communities. The findings\nof this study contribute to advancing NLP research in low-resource settings,\nenabling greater accessibility and inclusion for African languages in a rapidly\nexpanding digital landscape.

Previous work studying the\nproperties of tensor power iteration is either limited to a constant number of\niterations, or requires a non-trivial data-independent initialization. In this\npaper, we move beyond these limitations and analyze the dynamics of randomly\ninitialized tensor power iteration up to polynomially many steps. Our\ncontributions are threefold: First, we establish sharp bounds on the number of\niterations required for power method to converge to the planted signal, for a\nbroad range of the signal-to-noise ratios. Second, our analysis reveals that\nthe actual algorithmic threshold for power iteration is smaller than the one\nconjectured in literature by a polylog(n) factor, where n is the ambient\ndimension. Finally, we propose a simple and effective stopping criterion for\npower iteration, which provably outputs a solution that is highly correlated\nwith the true signal.

                "abstract": "Event-based cameras provide accurate and high temporal resolution\nmeasurements for performing computer vision tasks in challenging scenarios,\nsuch as high-dynamic range environments and fast-motion maneuvers. Despite\ntheir advantages, utilizing deep learning for event-based vision encounters a\nsignificant obstacle due to the scarcity of annotated data caused by the\nrelatively recent emergence of event-based cameras. To overcome this\nlimitation, leveraging the knowledge available from annotated data obtained\nwith conventional frame-based cameras presents an effective solution based on\nunsupervised domain adaptation. We propose a new algorithm tailored for\nadapting a deep neural network trained on annotated frame-based data to\ngeneralize well on event-based unannotated data. Our approach incorporates\nuncorrelated conditioning and self-supervised learning in an adversarial\nlearning scheme to close the gap between the two source and target domains. By\napplying self-supervised learning, the algorithm learns to align the\nrepresentations of event-based data with those from frame-based camera data,\nthereby facilitating knowledge transfer.Furthermore, the inclusion of\nuncorrelated conditioning ensures that the adapted model effectively\ndistinguishes between event-based and conventional data, enhancing its ability\nto classify event-based images accurately.Through empirical experimentation and\nevaluation, we demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses existing approaches\ndesigned for the same purpose using two benchmarks. The superior performance of\nour solution is attributed to its ability to effectively utilize annotated data\nfrom frame-based cameras and transfer the acquired knowledge to the event-based\nvision domain.",

                "abstract": "The correctness of a compiler affects the correctness of every program\nwritten in the language, and thus must be thoroughly evaluated. Existing\nautomatic compiler testing methods however either rely on weak oracles (e.g., a\nprogram behaves the same if only dead code is modified), or require substantial\ninitial effort (e.g., having a complete operational language semantics). While\nthe former prevents a comprehensive correctness evaluation, the latter makes\nthose methods irrelevant in practice. In this work, we propose an axiomatic\nsemantics based approach for testing compilers, called PTE. The idea is to\nincrementally develop a set of ``axioms'' capturing anecdotes of the language\nsemantics in the form of \\emph{(\\textbf{p}recondition, \\textbf{t}ransformation,\n\\textbf{e}xpectation) triples, which allows us to test the compiler\nautomatically.} Such axioms are written in the same language whose compiler is\nunder test, and can be developed either based on the language specification, or\nby generalizing the bug reports. PTE has been applied to a newly developed\ncompiler (i.e., Cangjie) and a mature compiler (i.e., Java), and successfully\nidentified 42 implementation bugs and 9 potential language design issues.",

By examining\nthe nearest-neighbor transverse spin correlation, we probe that in the WM\nphase, the spins within a supercell generate a cluster with a small total spin,\nbut between the nearest-neighbor supercells are distributed randomly.\nEspecially for the dimerized limit case, the spins within a supercell tend to\npoint to opposite directions of the transverse field.

We define a class of entanglement measures\ncalled $k$-GM concurrence which explicitly detect all $k$-nonseparable states\nin multipartite systems. It is rigorously shown that the $k$-GM concurrence\ncomplies with all the conditions of an entanglement measure. Compared to $k$-ME\nconcurrence\n[\\href{https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.062323} {Phys.\nRev.

In addition, we establish\nthe relation between $k$-ME concurrence and $k$-GM concurrence, and further\nderive a strong lower bound on the $k$-GM concurrence by exploiting the\npermutationally invariant part of a quantum state. Furthermore, we parameterize\n$k$-GM concurrence to obtain two categories of more generalized entanglement\nmeasures, $q$-$k$-GM concurrence $(q>1, 2\\leq k\\leq n)$ and $\\alpha$-$k$-GM\nconcurrence $(0\\leq\\alpha<1, 2\\leq k\\leq n)$, which fulfill the properties\npossessed by $k$-GM concurrence as well. Moreover, $\\alpha$-$2$-GM concurrence\n$(0<\\alpha<1)$, as a type of genuine multipartite entanglement measures, is\nproven in detail satisfying the requirement that the GHZ state is more\nentangled than the $W$ state in multiqubit systems.",

                "abstract": "Recent research at CHU Sainte Justine's Pediatric Critical Care Unit (PICU)\nhas revealed that traditional machine learning methods, such as semi-supervised\nlabel propagation and K-nearest neighbors, outperform Transformer-based models\nin artifact detection from PPG signals, mainly when data is limited. This study\naddresses the underutilization of abundant unlabeled data by employing\nself-supervised learning (SSL) to extract latent features from these data,\nfollowed by fine-tuning on labeled data. Our experiments demonstrate that SSL\nsignificantly enhances the Transformer model's ability to learn\nrepresentations, improving its robustness in artifact classification tasks.\nAmong various SSL techniques, including masking, contrastive learning, and DINO\n(self-distillation with no labels)-contrastive learning exhibited the most\nstable and superior performance in small PPG datasets. Further, we delve into\noptimizing contrastive loss functions, which are crucial for contrastive SSL.\nInspired by InfoNCE, we introduce a novel contrastive loss function that\nfacilitates smoother training and better convergence, thereby enhancing\nperformance in artifact classification. In summary, this study establishes the\nefficacy of SSL in leveraging unlabeled data, particularly in enhancing the\ncapabilities of the Transformer model. This approach holds promise for broader\napplications in PICU environments, where annotated data is often limited.",

                "abstract": "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) with incremental training is crucial in\nindustrial manufacturing, as unpredictable defects make obtaining sufficient\nlabeled data infeasible. However, continual learning methods primarily rely on\nsupervised annotations, while the application in UAD is limited due to the\nabsence of supervision. Current UAD methods train separate models for different\nclasses sequentially, leading to catastrophic forgetting and a heavy\ncomputational burden. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Unsupervised\nContinual Anomaly Detection framework called UCAD, which equips the UAD with\ncontinual learning capability through contrastively-learned prompts. In the\nproposed UCAD, we design a Continual Prompting Module (CPM) by utilizing a\nconcise key-prompt-knowledge memory bank to guide task-invariant `anomaly'\nmodel predictions using task-specific `normal' knowledge. Moreover,\nStructure-based Contrastive Learning (SCL) is designed with the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) to improve prompt learning and anomaly segmentation\nresults. Specifically, by treating SAM's masks as structure, we draw features\nwithin the same mask closer and push others apart for general feature\nrepresentations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and set the benchmark on\nunsupervised continual anomaly detection and segmentation, demonstrating that\nour method is significantly better than anomaly detection methods, even with\nrehearsal training.

The response of the medium is governed by a system of two\ncoupled semilinear partial differential equations for the electric fields at\nfrequency $\\omega$ and $2\\omega$. We investigate whether there are situations\nin which the generated $2\\omega$ wave is localized inside $D$, that is, the\nnonlinear interaction of the medium with the probing wave is invisible to an\noutside observer.

To mitigate this issue, AI software compression\nplays a crucial role, which aims to compress model size while keeping high\nperformance.

By simulating the attack mechanism as safety testing,\nSafeCompress can automatically compress a big model to a small one following\nthe dynamic sparse training paradigm. Then, considering two kinds of\nrepresentative and heterogeneous attack mechanisms, i.e., black-box membership\ninference attack and white-box membership inference attack, we develop two\nconcrete instances called BMIA-SafeCompress and WMIA-SafeCompress.

                "abstract": "Prompt injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in large language models\n(LLMs) to manipulate the model into unintended actions or generate malicious\ncontent. As LLM integrated applications gain wider adoption, they face growing\nsusceptibility to such attacks. This study introduces a novel evaluation\nframework for quantifying the resilience of applications. The framework\nincorporates innovative techniques designed to ensure representativeness,\ninterpretability, and robustness. To ensure the representativeness of simulated\nattacks on the application, a meticulous selection process was employed,\nresulting in 115 carefully chosen attacks based on coverage and relevance. For\nenhanced interpretability, a second LLM was utilized to evaluate the responses\ngenerated from these simulated attacks. Unlike conventional malicious content\nclassifiers that provide only a confidence score, the LLM-based evaluation\nproduces a score accompanied by an explanation, thereby enhancing\ninterpretability. Subsequently, a resilience score is computed by assigning\nhigher weights to attacks with greater impact, thus providing a robust\nmeasurement of the application resilience. To assess the framework's efficacy,\nit was applied on two LLMs, namely Llama2 and ChatGLM. Results revealed that\nLlama2, the newer model exhibited higher resilience compared to ChatGLM. This\nfinding substantiates the effectiveness of the framework, aligning with the\nprevailing notion that newer models tend to possess greater resilience.\nMoreover, the framework exhibited exceptional versatility, requiring only\nminimal adjustments to accommodate emerging attack techniques and\nclassifications, thereby establishing itself as an effective and practical\nsolution. Overall, the framework offers valuable insights that empower\norganizations to make well-informed decisions to fortify their applications\nagainst potential threats from prompt injection.",

In real-world scenarios, test data streams are not always\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Instead, they are frequently\ntemporally correlated, making them non-i.i.d. Many existing methods struggle to\ncope with this scenario. In response, we propose a diversity-aware and\ncategory-balanced buffer that can simulate an i.i.d. data stream, even in\nnon-i.i.d. scenarios.

However, existing research typically focuses on\nlimited tasks and often omits key multi-view and temporal information which is\ncrucial for robust autonomous driving. To bridge these gaps, we introduce\nNuInstruct, a novel dataset with 91K multi-view video-QA pairs across 17\nsubtasks, where each task demands holistic information (e.g., temporal,\nmulti-view, and spatial), significantly elevating the challenge level.

BEV-InMLLM integrates\nmulti-view, spatial awareness, and temporal semantics to enhance MLLMs'\ncapabilities on NuInstruct tasks. Moreover, our proposed BEV injection module\nis a plug-and-play method for existing MLLMs. Our experiments on NuInstruct\ndemonstrate that BEV-InMLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, e.g.\naround 9% improvement on various tasks.

We motivate estimators for the quantile estimands\nwith the efficient influence function, and develop their asymptotic properties\nwhen either parametric models or data-adaptive machine learners are used to\nestimate the nuisance functions.

For primes $\\ell \\geq 5,$ we give a\nnew proof of the conclusion that there are infinitely many $m$ for which\n$p(\\ell m+\\delta_{\\ell})$ is odd. This proof uses a generalization, due to the\nsecond author and Ramsey, of a result of Mazur in his classic paper on the\nEisenstein ideal. We also refine a classical criterion of Sturm for modular\nform congruences, which allows us to show that the smallest such $m$ satisfies\n$m<(\\ell^2-1)/24,$ representing a significant improvement to the previous\nbound.",

                "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is a challenge because the existing\nmethodologies do not identify the patients in their preclinical stage, which\ncan last up to a decade prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Several\nresearch studies demonstrate the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers,\namyloid beta 1-42, T-tau, and P-tau, in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease\nstages. In this work, we used machine learning models to classify different\nstages of Alzheimer's disease based on the cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels\nalone. An electronic health record of patients from the National Alzheimer's\nCoordinating Centre database was analyzed and the patients were subdivided\nbased on mini-mental state scores and clinical dementia ratings. Statistical\nand correlation analyses were performed to identify significant differences\nbetween the Alzheimer's stages. Afterward, machine learning classifiers\nincluding K-Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble Boosted Tree, Ensemble Bagged Tree,\nSupport Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes classifiers were\nemployed to classify the Alzheimer's disease stages. The results demonstrate\nthat Ensemble Boosted Tree (84.4%) and Logistic Regression (73.4%) provide the\nhighest accuracy for binary classification, while Ensemble Bagged Tree (75.4%)\ndemonstrates better accuracy for multiclassification. The findings from this\nresearch are expected to help clinicians in making an informed decision\nregarding the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's from the cerebrospinal fluid\nbiomarkers alone, monitoring of the disease progression, and implementation of\nappropriate intervention measures.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are promising 3D representations for scenes,\nobjects, and humans. However, most existing methods require multi-view inputs\nand per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover,\ncurrent methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting\nhands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations\nremain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable\nvisibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically,\ngiven an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a\nmesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric\nand textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the\nvisibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge\nfeatures of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas.\nAdditionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator\nwithin an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional\ndiscriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image,\nthe proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing\nfine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to\nimprove the visual quality of synthesized images. Experiments on the\nInterhand2.6M dataset demonstrate that our proposed VA-NeRF outperforms\nconventional NeRFs significantly. Project Page:\n\\url{https://github.com/XuanHuang0/VANeRF}.",

However, existing clinical decision support systems\nhave primarily targeted a particular patient demographic with unique medical\nconditions and focused on a single type of blood transfusion. This study aims\nto develop an advanced machine learning-based model to predict the probability\nof transfusion necessity over the next 24 hours for a diverse range of\nnon-traumatic ICU patients.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 72,072 adult\nnon-traumatic ICU patients admitted to a high-volume US metropolitan academic\nhospital between 2016 and 2020. We developed a meta-learner and various machine\nlearning models to serve as predictors, training them annually with four-year\ndata and evaluating on the fifth, unseen year, iteratively over five years.\n  Results: The experimental results revealed that the meta-model surpasses the\nother models in different development scenarios. It achieved notable\nperformance metrics, including an Area Under the Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.97, an accuracy rate of 0.93, and an F1-score\nof 0.89 in the best scenario.\n  Conclusion: This study pioneers the use of machine learning models for\npredicting blood transfusion needs in a diverse cohort of critically ill\npatients. The findings of this evaluation confirm that our model not only\npredicts transfusion requirements effectively but also identifies key\nbiomarkers for making transfusion decisions.",

To assess the performance\nof the estimators, we conduct numerical studies using Monte Carlo simulations\nand evaluate their simulated relative efficiency. The results demonstrate that\nthe suggested estimators outperform the unrestricted estimator when prior\ninformation is taken into account. Additionally, we present an empirical\napplication to demonstrate the practical utility of the suggested estimators.",

However, despite the presence of numerous\nWiFi-enabled devices around us, few expose CSI to users, resulting in a lack of\nsensing hardware options. Variants of the Espressif ESP32 have emerged as\npotential low-cost and easy-to-deploy solutions for WiFi CSI-based HAR. In this\nwork, four ESP32-S3-based 2.4GHz directional antenna systems are evaluated for\ntheir ability to facilitate long-range through-wall HAR. Two promising systems\nare proposed, one of which combines the ESP32-S3 with a directional biquad\nantenna. This combination represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first\ndemonstration of such a system in WiFi-based HAR. The second system relies on\nthe built-in printed inverted-F antenna (PIFA) of the ESP32-S3 and achieves\ndirectionality through a plane reflector. In a comprehensive evaluation of\nline-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) HAR performance, both systems\nare deployed in an office environment spanning a distance of 18 meters across\nfive rooms. In this experimental setup, the Wallhack1.8k dataset, comprising\n1806 CSI amplitude spectrograms of human activities, is collected and made\npublicly available. Based on Wallhack1.8k, we train activity recognition models\nusing the EfficientNetV2 architecture to assess system performance in LOS and\nNLOS scenarios. For the core NLOS activity recognition problem, the biquad\nantenna and PIFA-based systems achieve accuracies of 92.0$\\pm$3.5 and\n86.8$\\pm$4.7, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of long-range\nthrough-wall HAR with the proposed systems.",

Although the use of\nverification-aware languages, such as Dafny, has increased considerably in the\nlast decade, these are still not widely adopted. Often the cost of using such\nlanguages is too high, due to the level of expertise required from the\ndevelopers and challenges that they often face when trying to prove a program\ncorrect. Even though Dafny automates a lot of the verification process,\nsometimes there are steps that are too complex for Dafny to perform on its own.\nOne such case is that of missing lemmas, i.e. Dafny is unable to prove a result\nwithout being given further help in the form of a theorem that can assist it in\nthe proof of the step.\n  In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that\nleverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant\nlemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use. Moreover, for the lemmas that\ncannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide\naccompanying calculational proofs. We also discuss ideas for future work by\ndescribing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of\nverification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity\nand by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal\nspecifications and proving program properties.",

Although detected in one hundred cases in the host galaxies of\ndistant radio sources, only recently have column densities approaching the\nmaximum value observed in Lyman-alpha absorption systems been found. Here we\nexplore the implications these have for the hypothesis that the detection rate\nof HI absorption is dominated by photo-ionisation from the active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). We find, with the addition all of the current searches for HI\nabsorption at z > 0.1, a strong correlation between the HI absorption strength\nand the ionising photon rate, with the maximum value at which HI is detected\nremaining close to the theoretical value in which all of the neutral gas would\nbe ionised in a large spiral galaxy (Q = 2.9e56 ionising photons/s). We also\nrule out other effects (excitation by the radio continuum and changing gas\nproperties) as the dominant cause for the decrease in the detection rate with\nredshift. Furthermore, from the maximum theoretical column density we find that\nthe five high column density systems have spin temperatures close to those of\nthe Milky Way (T < 300 K), whereas, from our model of a gaseous galactic disk,\nthe HI detection at Q= 2.9e56 per s yields T~10 000 K, consistent with the gas\nbeing highly ionised.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "The laws that govern the nature often set certain limits or bans. Approaching\nthose limits is a common paradigm of breakthroughs in human knowledge and\ntechnological application, such as time slowing to a stop as one approaches the\nspeed of light, electrons flowing freely with no resistance as one approaches\nthe absolute zero, and an event horizon arising as one approaches a black hole.\nA well-known ban concerning the statistical mechanics of cooperative phenomena,\nsuch as ice melting into water, is the nonexistence of phase transition at\nfinite temperature in the Ising model with short-range interactions in one\ndimension. Yet, little is known about whether this forbidden transition could\nbe approached arbitrarily closely at fixed finite temperature. To explore such\nasymptoticity, the notion of marginal phase transition (MPT) was introduced\nrecently, and both the spontaneous MPT and the field-induced MPT were\ndiscovered respectively in ladder and single-chain Ising models decorated with\ngeometric frustration. Here I push the limit down to the minimal single-chain\nIsing model -- without geometric frustration -- in a magnetic field; then, a\nhidden frustration is revealed to drive the first-order MPT with large latent\nheat. Furthermore, as one approaches the zero field, MPT appears continuous\nwith no latent heat, displays abrupt change in sublattice magnetization and a\nkink-like minimum in overall magnetization with temperature, and vanishes when\nthe field drops below a threshold. These findings deepen our understanding of\ncooperative phenomena via the doubly forbidden and open new avenues to the\ndesign and engineering of the Ising systems with the different types of MPT for\nexploring exotic phenomena and low-dimensional device applications.",

The whole\nslide image is the digital specimen produced from the glass slide. Whole slide\nimage enabled specimens to be observed on a computer screen and led to\ncomputational pathology where computer vision and artificial intelligence are\nutilized for automated analysis and diagnosis. With the current computational\nadvancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without\nhuman supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis\nif the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or\nair bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely\non experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from\nthe analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the\ngoal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their\nseverity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data.\nTherefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity\nautomatically. In this paper, we propose a system that incorporates severity\nevaluation with artifact detection utilizing convolutional neural networks. The\nproposed system uses DoubleUNet to segment artifacts and an ensemble network of\nsix fine tuned convolutional neural network models to determine severity. This\nmethod outperformed current state of the art in accuracy by 9 percent for\nartifact segmentation and achieved a strong correlation of 97 percent with the\nevaluation of pathologists for severity assessment. The robustness of the\nsystem was demonstrated using our proposed heterogeneous dataset and practical\nusability was ensured by integrating it with an automated analysis system.",

                "abstract": "Energetic and optical properties of plasmonic nanocrystals strongly depend on\ntheir sizes, shapes, and composition. Whereas using plasmonic nanoparticles in\nbiotesting has become routine, applications of plasmonics in energy are still\nearly in development. Here, we investigate hot electron (HE) generation and\nrelated electromagnetic effects in both mono- and bi-metallic nanorods (NRs)\nand focus on one promising type of bi-metallic nanocrystals - core-shell Au-Ag\nnanorods. The spectra of the NRs are broadband, highly tunable with their\ngeometry, and have few plasmon resonances. In this work, we provide a new\nquantum formalism describing the HE generation in bi-metallic nanostructures.\nInterestingly, we observe that the HE generation rate at the UV plasmon\nresonance of Au-Ag NRs appears to be very high. These HEs are highly energetic\nand suitable for carbon-fuel reactions. Simultaneously, the HE generation at\nthe longitudinal plasmon (L-plasmon) peaks, which can be tuned from the yellow\nto near-IR, depends on the near-field and electromagnetic Mie effects, limiting\nthe HE efficiencies for the long and large NRs. These properties of the\nL-plasmon relate to all kinds of NRs (Au, Ag, and Au-Ag). We also consider the\ngeneration of the interband d-holes in Au and Ag, since the involvement of the\nd-band is crucial for the energetic properties of UV plasmons. The proposed\nformalism is an important development for the description of bi-metallic (or\ntri-metallic, or more complex) nanostructures, and it paves the way to the\nefficient application of the plasmonic HEs and hot holes in sensing,\nnanotechnology, photocatalysis, and electrophotochemistry.",

                "abstract": "The high energy (Regge) limit provides a playground for understanding all\nloop structures of scattering amplitudes, and plays an important role in the\ndescription of many phenomenologically relevant cross-sections. While well\nunderstood in the planar limit, the structure of non-planar corrections\nintroduces many fascinating complexities, for which a general organizing\nprinciple is still lacking. We study the structure of multi-reggeon exchanges\nin the context of the effective field theory for forward scattering, and derive\ntheir factorization into collinear operators (impact factors) and soft\noperators. We derive the structure of the renormalization group consistency\nequations in the effective theory, showing how the anomalous dimensions of the\nsoft operators are related to those of the collinear operators, allowing us to\nderive renormalization group equations in the Regge limit purely from a\ncollinear perspective. The rigidity of the consistency equations provides\nconsiderable insight into the all orders organization of Regge amplitudes in\nthe effective theory, as well as its relation to other approaches. Along the\nway we derive a number of technical results that improve the understanding of\nthe effective theory. We illustrate this collinear perspective by re-deriving\nall the standard BFKL equations for two-Glauber exchange from purely collinear\ncalculations, and we show that this perspective provides a number of conceptual\nand computational advantages as compared to the standard view from soft or\nGlauber physics. We anticipate that this formulation in terms of collinear\noperators will enable a better understanding of the relation between BFKL and\nDGLAP in gauge theories, and facilitate the analysis of renormalization group\nevolution equations describing Reggeization beyond next-to-leading order.",

                "abstract": "Given the difficulty of manually annotating motion in video, the current best\nmotion estimation methods are trained with synthetic data, and therefore\nstruggle somewhat due to a train/test gap. Self-supervised methods hold the\npromise of training directly on real video, but typically perform worse. These\ninclude methods trained with warp error (i.e., color constancy) combined with\nsmoothness terms, and methods that encourage cycle-consistency in the estimates\n(i.e., tracking backwards should yield the opposite trajectory as tracking\nforwards). In this work, we take on the challenge of improving state-of-the-art\nsupervised models with self-supervised training. We find that when the\ninitialization is supervised weights, most existing self-supervision techniques\nactually make performance worse instead of better, which suggests that the\nbenefit of seeing the new data is overshadowed by the noise in the training\nsignal. Focusing on obtaining a ``clean'' training signal from real-world\nunlabelled video, we propose to separate label-making and training into two\ndistinct stages. In the first stage, we use the pre-trained model to estimate\nmotion in a video, and then select the subset of motion estimates which we can\nverify with cycle-consistency. This produces a sparse but accurate\npseudo-labelling of the video. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model to\nreproduce these outputs, while also applying augmentations on the input. We\ncomplement this boot-strapping method with simple techniques that densify and\nre-balance the pseudo-labels, ensuring that we do not merely train on ``easy''\ntracks. We show that our method yields reliable gains over fully-supervised\nmethods in real videos, for both short-term (flow-based) and long-range\n(multi-frame) pixel tracking.",

This endeavor is challenged by transient displacement and\nacceleration noise artifacts, commonly called glitches. Uncalibrated glitches\nimpact the interferometric measurements and decrease the signal quality of\nLISA's time-delay interferometry (TDI) data used for astrophysical data\nanalysis. The paper introduces a novel calibration pipeline that employs a\nneural network ensemble to detect, characterize, and mitigate transient\nglitches of diverse morphologies. A convolutional neural network is designed\nfor anomaly detection, accurately identifying and temporally pinpointing\nanomalies within the TDI time series. Then, a hybrid neural network is\ndeveloped to differentiate between gravitational wave bursts and glitches,\nwhile a long short-term memory (LSTM) network architecture is deployed for\nglitch estimation. The LSTM network acts as a TDI inverter by processing noisy\nTDI data to obtain the underlying glitch dynamics. Finally, the inferred noise\ntransient is subtracted from the interferometric measurements, enhancing data\nintegrity and reducing biases in the parameter estimation of astronomical\ntargets. We propose a low-latency solution featuring generalized LSTM networks\nprimed for rapid response data processing and alert service in high-demand\nscenarios like predicting binary black hole mergers.

                "abstract": "Accurately selecting and estimating smooth functional effects in additive\nmodels with potentially many functions is a challenging task. We introduce a\nnovel Demmler-Reinsch basis expansion to model the functional effects that\nallows us to orthogonally decompose an effect into its linear and nonlinear\nparts. We show that our representation allows to consistently estimate both\nparts as opposed to commonly employed mixed model representations. Equipping\nthe reparameterized regression coefficients with normal beta prime spike and\nslab priors allows us to determine whether a continuous covariate has a linear,\na nonlinear or no effect at all. We provide new theoretical results for the\nprior and a compelling explanation for its superior Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmixing performance compared to the spike-and-slab group lasso. We establish an\nefficient posterior estimation scheme and illustrate our approach along effect\nselection on the hazard rate of a time-to-event response in the geoadditive Cox\nregression model in simulations and data on survival with leukemia.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "In recent years, foundation models (FMs) have solidified their role as\ncornerstone advancements in the deep learning domain. By extracting intricate\npatterns from vast datasets, these models consistently achieve state-of-the-art\nresults across a spectrum of downstream tasks, all without necessitating\nextensive computational resources. Notably, MedCLIP, a vision-language\ncontrastive learning-based medical FM, has been designed using unpaired\nimage-text training. While the medical domain has often adopted unpaired\ntraining to amplify data, the exploration of potential security concerns linked\nto this approach hasn't kept pace with its practical usage. Notably, the\naugmentation capabilities inherent in unpaired training also indicate that\nminor label discrepancies can result in significant model deviations. In this\nstudy, we frame this label discrepancy as a backdoor attack problem. We further\nanalyze its impact on medical FMs throughout the FM supply chain. Our\nevaluation primarily revolves around MedCLIP, emblematic of medical FM\nemploying the unpaired strategy. We begin with an exploration of\nvulnerabilities in MedCLIP stemming from unpaired image-text matching, termed\nBadMatch. BadMatch is achieved using a modest set of wrongly labeled data.\nSubsequently, we disrupt MedCLIP's contrastive learning through\nBadDist-assisted BadMatch by introducing a Bad-Distance between the embeddings\nof clean and poisoned data. Additionally, combined with BadMatch and BadDist,\nthe attacking pipeline consistently fends off backdoor assaults across diverse\nmodel designs, datasets, and triggers. Also, our findings reveal that current\ndefense strategies are insufficient in detecting these latent threats in\nmedical FMs' supply chains.",

                "abstract": "Recent studies in Radiance Fields have paved the robust way for novel view\nsynthesis with their photorealistic rendering quality. Nevertheless, they\nusually employ neural networks and volumetric rendering, which are costly to\ntrain and impede their broad use in various real-time applications due to the\nlengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been\nproposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while\nrendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation\nin the rendering quality if the training images are blurry. Blurriness commonly\noccurs due to the lens defocusing, object motion, and camera shake, and it\ninevitably intervenes in clean image acquisition. Several previous studies have\nattempted to render clean and sharp images from blurry input images using\nneural fields. The majority of those works, however, are designed only for\nvolumetric rendering-based neural radiance fields and are not straightforwardly\napplicable to rasterization-based 3D Gaussian splatting methods. Thus, we\npropose a novel real-time deblurring framework, deblurring 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, using a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that manipulates the\ncovariance of each 3D Gaussian to model the scene blurriness. While deblurring\n3D Gaussian Splatting can still enjoy real-time rendering, it can reconstruct\nfine and sharp details from blurry images. A variety of experiments have been\nconducted on the benchmark, and the results have revealed the effectiveness of\nour approach for deblurring.

                "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language\nModel (LLM)-based systems, in education has shown promise in enhancing teaching\nand learning experiences. However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) like GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), capable of processing\nmultimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of\nenriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education.\nGrounded in theory of multimedia learning, this paper explores the\ntransformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by\npresenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios. Possible applications for\nMLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning,\nfostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and\nfeedback. These scenarios are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats\nbut can be multimodal, increasing thus personalization, accessibility, and\npotential learning effectiveness. Besides many opportunities, challenges such\nas data protection and ethical considerations become more salient, calling for\nrobust frameworks to ensure responsible integration. This paper underscores the\nnecessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology\ncomplements rather than supplants the educator's role, ensuring thus an\neffective and ethical use of AI in science education. It calls for further\nresearch to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs on the evolving role of\neducators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other\ndisciplines.

However, the impact of autonomous driving on\nhuman-driven vehicles (HVs) has been largely ignored in AV controller\nsynthesis, which could result in egoistic AV behavior detrimental to the safety\nof passengers and surrounding traffic. In this study we develop a general\nframework for socially compliant control design of AVs with a useful metric of\nsocial psychology, called social value orientation (SVO), allowing AVs to\nleverage their impact on the behavior of the following HVs. This is critical\nsince AVs that behave in a socially compliant manner enable human drivers to\ncomprehend their actions and respond appropriately. Within the proposed\nframework, we define the utilities of the controlled AV and its following\nvehicle, to be maximized in a weighted fashion determined by the AV's SVO. The\nutility maximization covers an array of design objectives given the goal of the\nAV and the benefits for the following HV stemming from the courtesy of socially\ncompliant AV controls. An optimal control problem is then formulated to\nmaximize the utility function defined, which is numerically solved using\nPontryagin's minimum principle with optimality guarantees. The methodology\ndeveloped is applied to synthesize socially compliant control for eco-driving\nof AVs. A set of numerical results are presented to show the mechanism and\neffectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world experimental data\ncollected on Highway 55 in Minnesota.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable performance in neural\nrendering-based novel view synthesis. However, NeRF suffers from severe visual\nquality degradation when the input images have been captured under imperfect\nconditions, such as poor illumination, defocus blurring, and lens aberrations.\nEspecially, defocus blur is quite common in the images when they are normally\ncaptured using cameras. Although few recent studies have proposed to render\nsharp images of considerably high-quality, yet they still face many key\nchallenges. In particular, those methods have employed a Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP) based NeRF, which requires tremendous computational time. To overcome\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel technique Sharp-NeRF -- a\ngrid-based NeRF that renders clean and sharp images from the input blurry\nimages within half an hour of training. To do so, we used several grid-based\nkernels to accurately model the sharpness/blurriness of the scene. The\nsharpness level of the pixels is computed to learn the spatially varying blur\nkernels. We have conducted experiments on the benchmarks consisting of blurry\nimages and have evaluated full-reference and non-reference metrics. The\nqualitative and quantitative results have revealed that our approach renders\nthe sharp novel views with vivid colors and fine details, and it has\nconsiderably faster training time than the previous works.

We study the stochastic Schrodinger equation resulting from\nthe continuous monitoring with a rate $\\Gamma$ of a random hermitian operator\nchosen at every time from the gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). Due to\ninvariance by unitary transformations, the dynamics of the eigenvalues\n$\\{\\lambda_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha=1}^n$ of the density matrix can be decoupled from\nthat of the eigenvectors. Thus, stochastic equations are derived that exactly\ndescribe the dynamics of $\\lambda$'s. We consider two regimes: in the presence\nof an extra dephasing term, which can be generated by imperfect quantum\nmeasurements, the density matrix has a stationary distribution, and we show\nthat in the limit of large sizes the distribution of $\\lambda$'s is described\nby an inverse Marchenko Pastur distribution. In the case of perfect\nmeasurements instead, purification eventually occurs and we focus on\nfinite-time dynamics. In this case, remarkably, we find an exact solution for\nthe joint probability distribution of $\\lambda$'s at each time $t$ and for each\nsize $n$. Two relevant regimes emerge: at small times $t\\Gamma= O(1)$, the\nspectrum is in a Coulomb gas regime, with a well-defined continuous spectral\ndistribution in the limit of $n\\to\\infty$. In that case, all moments of the\ndensity matrix become self-averaging and it is possible to characterize the\nentanglement spectrum exactly. In the limit of large times $t \\Gamma = O(n)$\none enters instead a regime in which the eigenvalues are exponentially\nseparated $\\log(\\lambda_\\alpha/\\lambda_\\beta) = O(\\Gamma t/n)$, but\nfluctuations $\\sim O(\\sqrt{\\Gamma t/n})$ play an essential role.

                "abstract": "The emergence of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) has greatly\nincreased interest in utilizing LLMs as therapists to support individuals\nstruggling with mental health challenges. However, due to the lack of\nsystematic studies, our understanding of how LLM therapists behave, i.e., ways\nin which they respond to clients, is significantly limited. Understanding their\nbehavior across a wide range of clients and situations is crucial to accurately\nassess their capabilities and limitations in the high-risk setting of mental\nhealth, where undesirable behaviors can lead to severe consequences. In this\npaper, we propose BOLT, a novel computational framework to study the\nconversational behavior of LLMs when employed as therapists. We develop an\nin-context learning method to quantitatively measure the behavior of LLMs based\non 13 different psychotherapy techniques including reflections, questions,\nsolutions, normalizing, and psychoeducation. Subsequently, we compare the\nbehavior of LLM therapists against that of high- and low-quality human therapy,\nand study how their behavior can be modulated to better reflect behaviors\nobserved in high-quality therapy. Our analysis of GPT and Llama-variants\nreveals that these LLMs often resemble behaviors more commonly exhibited in\nlow-quality therapy rather than high-quality therapy, such as offering a higher\ndegree of problem-solving advice when clients share emotions, which is against\ntypical recommendations. At the same time, unlike low-quality therapy, LLMs\nreflect significantly more upon clients' needs and strengths. Our analysis\nframework suggests that despite the ability of LLMs to generate anecdotal\nexamples that appear similar to human therapists, LLM therapists are currently\nnot fully consistent with high-quality care, and thus require additional\nresearch to ensure quality care.",

To mitigate the coverage limitations,\nhigh-gain beamforming is essential. Implementation of beamforming involves a\nlarge number of antennas, which introduces analog beam constraint, i.e., only\none frequency-flat beam is generated per transceiver chain (TRx). Recently\nintroduced joint phase-time array (JPTA) architecture, which utilizes both true\ntime delay (TTD) units and phase shifters (PSs), alleviates analog beam\nconstraint by creating multiple frequency-dependent beams per TRx, for\nscheduling multiple users at different directions in a frequency-division\nmanner. One class of previous studies offered solutions with \"rainbow\" beams,\nwhich tend to allocate a small bandwidth per beam direction. Another class\nfocused on uniform linear array (ULA) antenna architecture, whose\nfrequency-dependent beams were designed along a single axis of either azimuth\nor elevation direction. In this paper, we present a novel 3D beamforming\ncodebook design aimed at maximizing beamforming gain to steer radiation toward\ndesired azimuth and elevation directions, as well as across sub-bands\npartitioned according to scheduled users' bandwidth requirements.

We first establish explicit\nrelations between these integrals and four classes of hyperbolic sums. Then,\nusing our previous results on hyperbolic series and applying the matrix method\nfrom linear algebra, we compute explicitly several general hyperbolic sums and\ntheir higher derivatives. These enable us to express two families of general\nBerndt-type integrals as polynomials in $\\Gamma^4(1/4)$ and $\\pi^{-1}$ with\nrational coefficients, where $\\Gamma$ is the Euler gamma function. At the end\nof the paper, we provide some conjectures of general Berndt-type integrals.",

A common approach is to feed the result of a simple inversion, for\nexample the backprojection, to a convolutional neural network (CNN) which then\ncomputes the reconstruction. Despite strong results on 'in-distribution' test\ndata similar to the training data, backprojection from sparse-view data\ndelocalizes singularities, so these approaches require a large receptive field\nto perform well. As a consequence, they overfit to certain global structures\nwhich leads to poor generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.\nMoreover, their memory complexity and training time scale unfavorably with\nimage resolution, making them impractical for application at realistic clinical\nresolutions, especially in 3D: a standard U-Net requires a substantial 140GB of\nmemory and 2600 seconds per epoch on a research-grade GPU when training on\n1024x1024 images. In this paper, we introduce GLIMPSE, a local processing\nneural network for computed tomography which reconstructs a pixel value by\nfeeding only the measurements associated with the neighborhood of the pixel to\na simple MLP. While achieving comparable or better performance with successful\nCNNs like the U-Net on in-distribution test data, GLIMPSE significantly\noutperforms them on OOD samples while maintaining a memory footprint almost\nindependent of image resolution; 5GB memory suffices to train on 1024x1024\nimages.

In\nthis survey, we present an overview of the various benefits of integrating code\ninto LLMs' training data. Specifically, beyond enhancing LLMs in code\ngeneration, we observe that these unique properties of code help (i) unlock the\nreasoning ability of LLMs, enabling their applications to a range of more\ncomplex natural language tasks; (ii) steer LLMs to produce structured and\nprecise intermediate steps, which can then be connected to external execution\nends through function calls; and (iii) take advantage of code compilation and\nexecution environment, which also provides diverse feedback for model\nimprovement. In addition, we trace how these profound capabilities of LLMs,\nbrought by code, have led to their emergence as intelligent agents (IAs) in\nsituations where the ability to understand instructions, decompose goals, plan\nand execute actions, and refine from feedback are crucial to their success on\ndownstream tasks.

                "abstract": "In standard hospital blood tests, the traditional process requires doctors to\nmanually isolate leukocytes from microscopic images of patients' blood using\nmicroscopes. These isolated leukocytes are then categorized via automatic\nleukocyte classifiers to determine the proportion and volume of different types\nof leukocytes present in the blood samples, aiding disease diagnosis. This\nmethodology is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it also has a\nhigh propensity for errors due to factors such as image quality and\nenvironmental conditions, which could potentially lead to incorrect subsequent\nclassifications and misdiagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes\nan innovative method of leukocyte detection: the Multi-level Feature Fusion and\nDeformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR). To tackle the issue of leukocyte\nscale disparity, we designed the High-level Screening-feature Fusion Pyramid\n(HS-FPN), enabling multi-level fusion. This model uses high-level features as\nweights to filter low-level feature information via a channel attention module\nand then merges the screened information with the high-level features, thus\nenhancing the model's feature expression capability. Further, we address the\nissue of leukocyte feature scarcity by incorporating a multi-scale deformable\nself-attention module in the encoder and using the self-attention and\ncross-deformable attention mechanisms in the decoder, which aids in the\nextraction of the global features of the leukocyte feature maps. The\neffectiveness, superiority, and generalizability of the proposed MFDS-DETR\nmethod are confirmed through comparisons with other cutting-edge leukocyte\ndetection models using the private WBCDD, public LISC and BCCD datasets.

Community acceptance of aircraft noise is among the most\nnoticeable of these challenges when launching or scaling up a UAM system.\nProperly managing community noise is fundamental to establishing a UAM system\nthat is environmentally and socially sustainable. In this work, we develop a\nholistic and equitable approach to manage UAM air traffic and its community\nnoise impact in urban environments. The proposed approach is a hybrid approach\nthat considers a mix of different noise mitigation strategies, including\nlimiting the number of operations, cruising at higher altitudes, and ambient\nnoise masking. We tackle the problem through the lens of network system control\nand formulate a multi-objective optimization model for managing traffic flow in\na multi-layer UAM network while concurrently pursuing demand fulfillment, noise\ncontrol, and energy saving. Further, we use a social welfare function in the\noptimization model as the basis for the efficiency-fairness trade-off in both\ndemand fulfillment and noise control. We apply the proposed approach to a\ncomprehensive case study in the city of Austin and perform design trade-offs\nthrough both visual and quantitative analyses.",

They are expected to be observed as\n(1-7) solar mass hot He-rich stars located in the HRD between sdO/B and\nWR-stars. Several thousands of such stars are expected to exist in the Galaxy,\nbut none of them have been identified so far. We aim to provide comprehensive\npredictions of the numbers and fundamental properties of He-stars and their\ncompanions in the Galaxy. This is a necessary first step to guide observations,\nto enable a comparison between evolutionary models and observed populations,\nand to determine the feedback of He-stars in the Galaxy. We expanded the\npreviously considered space of parameters describing progenitors of He-stars\nand applied a population synthesis based on a grid of models computed by the\ncode MESA. The estimated number of Galactic binaries hosting (1-7) solar mass\nHe-stars is about 20000; it declines to about 3000 for mass exceeding two solar\nones. The decisive factor that defines the number of He-stars is runaway mass\nloss after Roche lobe overflow by primary components, resulting in formation of\ncommon envelopes and merger of components. He-stars are much less numerous than\nexpected, since a fraction of close binaries with primary masses below (5-7)\nsolar ones produce subdwarfs with masses below solar. Overwhelming majority of\nHe-stars reside in binaries with an early-type companions and can be identified\nneither by the UV excess nor by emission features. The large periods of a\nsignificant fraction of binaries hosting stripped stars (exceeding several\nhundred days) also hamper their discovery. (Abridged).",

However, their totally different model structure, huge model size and\ncomputation cost hinder their application in practical recommender systems.\nHence, it is highly essential to explore how to practically utilize PRMs in\nreal-world recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel joint knowledge\ndistillation from different pre-trained recommendation models named PRM-KD for\nrecommendation, which takes full advantages of diverse PRMs as teacher models\nfor enhancing student models efficiently. Specifically, PRM-KD jointly distills\ndiverse informative knowledge from multiple representative PRMs such as\nUniSRec, Recformer, and UniM^2Rec. The knowledge from the above PRMs are then\nsmartly integrated into the student recommendation model considering their\nconfidence and consistency. We further verify the universality of PRM-KD with\nvarious types of student models, including sequential recommendation, feature\ninteraction, and graph-based models. Extensive experiments on five real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of PRM-KD, which could be\nviewed as an economical shortcut in practically and conveniently making full\nuse of different PRMs in online systems.",

However, the application of\nSMPC in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for large language models,\nparticularly those based on the Transformer architecture, often leads to\nconsiderable slowdowns or declines in performance. This is largely due to the\nmultitude of nonlinear operations in the Transformer architecture, which are\nnot well-suited to SMPC and are difficult to circumvent or optimize\neffectively. To address this concern, we introduce an advanced optimization\nframework called SecFormer, designed to strike an optimal balance between\nperformance and efficiency in PPI for Transformer models. By implementing\nknowledge distillation techniques, we successfully eliminate the high-cost\nexponential and maximum operations in PPI without sacrificing model\nperformance. Additionally, we have developed a suite of efficient SMPC\nprotocols that utilize segmented polynomials and Goldschmidt's method to handle\nother complex nonlinear functions within PPI, such as GeLU, LayerNorm, and\nSoftmax. Our extensive experiments reveal that SecFormer outperforms MPCFormer\nin performance, showing improvements of $5.6\\%$ and $24.2\\%$ for\nBERT$_{\\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\\text{LARGE}}$, respectively.

                "abstract": "The group of homeomorphisms of the closed interval that are orientation\npreserving, absolutely continuous and have an absolutely continuous inverse was\nshown by Solecki to admit a natural Polish group topology $\\tau_{ac}$. We\nobserve that, more generally, under some conditions on a compact space endowed\nwith a finite Borel measure an analogous Polish group topology can be defined\non the subgroup of the homeomorphism group which push forward the measure to\nanother one with which it is mutually absolutely continuous. We use a\nprobabilistic argument involving approximations by supmartingale processes to\nshow that in many cases there is no group topology between $\\tau_{ac}$ and the\nrestriction $\\tau_{co}$ of the compact-open topology. This applies, in\nparticular, to any compact topological manifold equipped with an Oxtoby-Ulam\nmeasure and to the Cantor space endowed with some natural Borel measures. In\nfact, we show that in such cases any separable group topology strictly finer\nthan $\\tau_{co}$ has to be also finer than $\\tau_{ac}$. For one-dimensional\nmanifolds well-known arguments show that the compact-open topology is a minimum\nHausdroff group topology on the group, which implies that $\\tau_{co}$ and\n$\\tau_{ac}$ are the only Hausdorff group topologies coarser than $\\tau_{ac}$.\nWe also show that while Solecki's example is not Roelcke precompact, the group\nof bi-absolutely continuous homeomorphisms of the Cantor space endowed with the\nmeasure given by the Fr\\\"aiss\\'e limit of the class of measured boolean\nalgebras with rational probability measures is Roelcke precompact.",

We introduce Astraios, a suite of 28\ninstruction-tuned OctoCoder models using 7 tuning methods and 4 model sizes up\nto 16 billion parameters. Through investigations across 5 tasks and 8 different\ndatasets encompassing both code comprehension and code generation tasks, we\nfind that FFT generally leads to the best downstream performance across all\nscales, and PEFT methods differ significantly in their efficacy based on the\nmodel scale. LoRA usually offers the most favorable trade-off between cost and\nperformance. Further investigation into the effects of these methods on both\nmodel robustness and code security reveals that larger models tend to\ndemonstrate reduced robustness and less security. At last, we explore the\nrelationships among updated parameters, cross-entropy loss, and task\nperformance.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Highway traffic crashes exert a considerable impact on both transportation\nsystems and the economy. In this context, accurate and dependable emergency\nresponses are crucial for effective traffic management. However, the influence\nof crashes on traffic status varies across diverse factors and may be biased\ndue to selection bias. Therefore, there arises a necessity to accurately\nestimate the heterogeneous causal effects of crashes, thereby providing\nessential insights to facilitate individual-level emergency decision-making.\nThis paper proposes a novel causal machine learning framework to estimate the\ncausal effect of different types of crashes on highway speed. The Neyman-Rubin\nCausal Model (RCM) is employed to formulate this problem from a causal\nperspective. The Conditional Shapley Value Index (CSVI) is proposed based on\ncausal graph theory to filter adverse variables, and the Structural Causal\nModel (SCM) is then adopted to define the statistical estimand for causal\neffects. The treatment effects are estimated by Doubly Robust Learning (DRL)\nmethods, which combine doubly robust causal inference with classification and\nregression machine learning models. Experimental results from 4815 crashes on\nHighway Interstate 5 in Washington State reveal the heterogeneous treatment\neffects of crashes at varying distances and durations. The rear-end crashes\ncause more severe congestion and longer durations than other types of crashes,\nand the sideswipe crashes have the longest delayed impact. Additionally, the\nfindings show that rear-end crashes affect traffic greater at night, while\ncrash to objects has the most significant influence during peak hours.\nStatistical hypothesis tests, error metrics based on matched \"counterfactual\noutcomes\", and sensitive analyses are employed for assessment, and the results\nvalidate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method.",

Especially in medical and healthcare applications, it provides\nremote patient monitoring and increases voluminous multimedia. From the\nrobotics angle, robot-assisted therapy (RAT) is an active-assistive robotic\ntechnology in rehabilitation robotics, attracting many researchers to study and\nbenefit people with disability like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children.\nHowever, the main challenge of RAT is that the model capable of detecting the\naffective states of ASD people exists and can recall individual preferences.\nMoreover, involving expert diagnosis and recommendations to guide robots in\nupdating the therapy approach to adapt to different statuses and scenarios is a\ncrucial part of the ASD therapy process. This paper proposes the architecture\nof edge cognitive computing by combining human experts and assisted robots\ncollaborating in the same framework to help ASD patients with long-term\nsupport.

Within this framework, Dirichlet process\nmixture models emerge as a compelling alternative to conventional finite\nmixture models for both clustering and outlier detection tasks. However,\ndespite their evident advantages, the widespread adoption of Dirichlet process\nmixture models in unsupervised outlier detection has been hampered by\nchallenges related to computational inefficiency and sensitivity to outliers\nduring the construction of detectors. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nnovel outlier detection method based on ensembles of Dirichlet process Gaussian\nmixtures.

We employ the linear-sigma model as the\nlow-energy description of dark many flavor QCD and show that the model\nundergoes ultra-supercooling due to the produced strong first-order thermal\nphase transition along the (approximately realized) flat direction based on the\nGildener-Weinberg mechanism. Passing through evaluation of the bubble\nnucleation/percolation, we address the reheating and relaxation processes,\nwhich are generically non-thermal and nonadiabatic. Parametrizing the reheating\nepoch in terms of the efolding number, we propose proper formulae for the\nredshift effects on the GW frequencies and signal spectra. It then turns out\nthat the ultra-supercooling predicted from the Higgs-portal scalegenesis\ngenerically yields none of GW signals with the frequencies as low as nano Hz,\ninstead, prefers to give the higher frequency signals, which still keeps the\nfuture prospected detection sensitivity, like at LISA, BBO, and DECIGO, etc. We\nalso find that with large flavors in the dark sector, the GW signals are made\nfurther smaller and the peak frequencies higher.

In a simplified modelling of a $(B,Y)$ doublet\nincluding a vector-like quark $Y$, with charge $-\\frac{4}{3}$e, there are only\ntwo free parameters: the $Y$ coupling $\\kappa_{Y}$ and mass $m_Y$. In the five\nflavor scheme, we investigate the single production of the $Y$ state decaying\ninto $Wb$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run-III and High-Luminosity LHC\n(HL-LHC) operating at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, the possible High-Energy LHC\n(HE-LHC) with $\\sqrt{s}$ = 27 TeV as well as the Future Circular Collider in\nhadron-hadron mode (FCC-hh) with $\\sqrt{s}$ = 100 TeV. Through detailed\nsignal-to-background analyses and detector simulations, we assess the exclusion\ncapabilities of the $Y$ state at the different colliders. We find that this can\nbe improved significantly with increasing collision energy, especially at the\nHE-LHC and FCC-hh, both demonstrating an obvious advantage with respect to the\nHL-LHC case in the case of high $m_Y$.

On the theoretical side, we provided a modified Rayleigh collapse time\nand natural frequency for spherical bubbles in our particular context,\ncharacterized by the density ratio between the two liquids and the\nbubble-to-droplet size ratio. Regarding the experimental aspect, experiments\nwere carried out for laser-induced cavitation bubbles inside oil-in-water (O/W)\nor water-in-oil (W/O) droplets. Two distinct fluid-mixing mechanisms were\nunveiled in the two systems, respectively. In the case of O/W droplets, a\nliquid jet emerges around the end of the bubble collapse phase, effectively\npenetrating the droplet interface. We offer a detailed analysis of the criteria\ngoverning jet penetration, involving the standoff parameter and impact velocity\nof the bubble jet on the droplet surface. Conversely, in the scenario involving\nW/O droplets, the bubble traverses the droplet interior, inducing global motion\nand eventually leading to droplet pinch-off when the local Weber number exceeds\na critical value. This phenomenon is elucidated through the equilibrium between\ninterfacial and kinetic energies. Lastly, our boundary integral model\nfaithfully reproduces the essential physics of nonspherical bubble dynamics\nobserved in the experiments. We conduct a parametric study spanning a wide\nparameter space to investigate bubble-droplet interactions.

The\nextent of this quadrupolar deformation is measured by the maximum ellipticity\nthat can be sustained by the crust of a neutron star and it places an upper\nlimit on the CGW amplitudes emitted by such systems. In this paper, following\nprevious works on this subject, we calculate the maximum ellipticity of a\nneutron star generated by the Lorentz force exerted on it by the internal\nmagnetic fields. We show that the ellipticity of stars deformed by such a\nLorentz force is of the same order of magnitude as previous theoretical and\nastrophysical constraints. We also consider if this ellipticity can be further\nenhanced by crustal surface currents.

                "abstract": "It is challenging but highly desired to acquire high-quality photos with\nclear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing\nmethods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made\nsignificant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus exclusively\non specific restoration or enhancement tasks, being insufficient in exploiting\nmulti-image. Motivated by that multi-exposure images are complementary in\ndenoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we\npropose to utilize bracketing photography to unify restoration and enhancement\ntasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we\nsuggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data\nand then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally\nmodulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are\nproposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs\nand collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both\ndatasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art\nmulti-image processing ones.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Image generation models can generate or edit images from a given text. Recent\nadvancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and\nMidjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their\nimpressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making\nthem susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and\nbiases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias\nwithin image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including\nlimited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive\nanalysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel metamorphic testing\nframework that can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social\nbias in image generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed\nimages of individuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these\nimages using gender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62\nprofessions, 39 activities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The\nframework then compares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing\non any changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a testing\noracle that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to\nneutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social\nbias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of BiasPainter, we use BiasPainter to test five widely-used\ncommercial image generation software and models, such as stable diffusion and\nMidjourney. Experimental results show that 100\\% of the generated test cases\ncan successfully trigger social bias in image generation models.",

                "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are foundational in various\napplications due to their extensive knowledge from pre-training and\nfine-tuning. Despite this, they are prone to generating factual and commonsense\nerrors, raising concerns in critical areas like healthcare, journalism, and\neducation to mislead users. Current methods for evaluating LLMs' veracity are\nlimited by test data leakage or the need for extensive human labor, hindering\nefficient and accurate error detection. To tackle this problem, we introduce a\nnovel, automatic testing framework, FactChecker, aimed at uncovering factual\ninaccuracies in LLMs. This framework involves three main steps: First, it\nconstructs a factual knowledge graph by retrieving fact triplets from a\nlarge-scale knowledge database. Then, leveraging the knowledge graph,\nFactChecker employs a rule-based approach to generates three types of questions\n(Yes-No, Multiple-Choice, and WH questions) that involve single-hop and\nmulti-hop relations, along with correct answers. Lastly, it assesses the LLMs'\nresponses for accuracy using tailored matching strategies for each question\ntype. Our extensive tests on six prominent LLMs, including text-davinci-002,\ntext-davinci-003, ChatGPT~(gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4), Vicuna, and LLaMA-2, reveal\nthat FactChecker can trigger factual errors in up to 45\\% of questions in these\nmodels. Moreover, we demonstrate that FactChecker's test cases can improve\nLLMs' factual accuracy through in-context learning and fine-tuning (e.g.,\nllama-2-13b-chat's accuracy increase from 35.3\\% to 68.5\\%).

A significant\ndistinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to\n\"reason.\" However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge\nas most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks\nrather than directly assessing their reasoning processes. Efforts have been\nmade to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they\nsuffer from data leakage or limited scope. In this paper, we introduce\nLogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves\nthe logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills\nbased on propositional and predicate logic. The results provide insights into\nLLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn\nwell. We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3,\nChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco. The results show that test cases\nfrom LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a\nrate of 25\\% - 94\\%. In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further\nused to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which\neffectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\\% for\nGPT-4. As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on\ntesting results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively. All the\ncode, data, and results will be released for reproduction and future research.",

Typical graph neural networks focus on modeling\nthe local dependencies when aggregating features of neighboring nodes, and\nobtain the representation for the entire graph by aggregating node features.\nSuch methods have two potential limitations: 1) the global node saliency w.r.t.\ngraph classification is not explicitly modeled, which is crucial since\ndifferent nodes may have different semantic relevance to graph classification;\n2) the graph representation directly aggregated from node features may have\nlimited effectiveness to reflect graph-level information. In this work, we\npropose the Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network (SAR-GNN) for graph\nclassification, which consists of two core modules: 1) a traditional graph\nneural network serving as the backbone for learning node features and 2) the\nGraph Neural Memory designed to distill a compact graph representation from\nnode features of the backbone. We first estimate the global node saliency by\nmeasuring the semantic similarity between the compact graph representation and\nnode features.

To\nquantify the impact and determine the launching mechanisms of these outflows,\nwe need to measure the wind plasma number density, an important ingredient in\nthe theoretical disk wind models. While X-ray spectroscopy is a crucial tool to\nunderstanding the wind properties, such as their velocity and ionization, in\nnearly all cases, we lack the signal-to-noise to constrain the plasma number\ndensity, weakening the constraints on outflow location and mass outflow rate.\nWe present a new approach to determine this number density in the X-ray binary\nHercules X-1 by measuring the speed of the wind ionization response to\ntime-variable illuminating continuum. Hercules X-1 is powered by a highly\nmagnetized neutron star, pulsating with a period of 1.24 s. We show that the\nwind number density in Hercules X-1 is sufficiently high to respond to these\npulsations by modeling the ionization response with the time-dependent\nphotoionization model TPHO. We then perform a pulse-resolved analysis of the\nbest-quality XMM-Newton observation of Hercules X-1 and directly detect the\nwind response, confirming that the wind density is at least $10^{12}$\ncm$^{-3}$. Finally, we simulate XRISM observations of Hercules X-1 and show\nthat they will allow us to accurately measure the number density at different\nlocations within the outflow.

                "abstract": "Post-stack seismic inversion is a widely used technique to retrieve\nhigh-resolution acoustic impedance models from migrated seismic data. Its\nmodelling operator assumes that a migrated seismic data can be generated from\nthe convolution of a source wavelet and the time derivative of the acoustic\nimpedance model. Given the band-limited nature of the seismic wavelet, the\nconvolutional model acts as a filtering operator on the acoustic impedance\nmodel, thereby making the problem of retrieving acoustic impedances from\nseismic data ambiguous. In order to compensate for missing frequencies,\npost-stack seismic inversion is often regularized, meaning that prior\ninformation about the structure of the subsurface is included in the inversion\nprocess. Recently, the Plug-and-Play methodology has gained wide interest in\nthe inverse problem community as a new form of implicit regularization, often\noutperforming state-of-the-art regularization. Plug-and-Play can be applied to\nany proximal algorithm by simply replacing the proximal operator of the\nregularizer with any denoiser of choice. We propose to use Plug-and-Play\nregularization with a 2D pre-trained, deep denoiser for 2D post-stack seismic\ninversion. Additionally, we show that a generalization of Plug-and-Play, called\nMulti-Agent Consensus Equilibrium, can be adopted to solve 3D post-stack\ninversion whilst leveraging the same 2D pre-trained denoiser used in the 2D\ncase. More precisely, Multi-Agent Consensus Equilibrium combines the results of\napplying such 2D denoiser in the inline, crossline, and time directions in an\noptimal manner. We verify the proposed methods on a portion of the SEAM Phase 1\nvelocity model and the Sleipner field dataset. 1",

                "abstract": "Machine translation systems have been widely adopted in our daily life,\nmaking life easier and more convenient. Unfortunately, erroneous translations\nmay result in severe consequences, such as financial losses. This requires to\nimprove the accuracy and the reliability of machine translation systems.\nHowever, it is challenging to test machine translation systems because of the\ncomplexity and intractability of the underlying neural models. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a novel metamorphic testing approach by syntactic tree\npruning (STP) to validate machine translation systems. Our key insight is that\na pruned sentence should have similar crucial semantics compared with the\noriginal sentence. Specifically, STP (1) proposes a core semantics-preserving\npruning strategy by basic sentence structure and dependency relations on the\nlevel of syntactic tree representation; (2) generates source sentence pairs\nbased on the metamorphic relation; (3) reports suspicious issues whose\ntranslations break the consistency property by a bag-of-words model. We further\nevaluate STP on two state-of-the-art machine translation systems (i.e., Google\nTranslate and Bing Microsoft Translator) with 1,200 source sentences as inputs.\nThe results show that STP can accurately find 5,073 unique erroneous\ntranslations in Google Translate and 5,100 unique erroneous translations in\nBing Microsoft Translator (400% more than state-of-the-art techniques), with\n64.5% and 65.4% precision, respectively.

Starting from a\nPenrose Hubbard model, our microscopic studies suggest that the Kohn-Luttinger\nmechanism driven SC in the QC is usually gapless due to violation of Anderson's\ntheorem, rendering that both chiral and nematic SCs are common. The nematic SC\nin the QC can support novel vestigial phases driven by pairing phase\nfluctuations above its $T_c$. Our combined renormalization group and\nMonte-Carlo studies provide a phase diagram in which, besides the conventional\ncharge-4e SC, two critical vestigial phases emerge, i.e. the quasi-nematic\n(Q-N) SC and Q-N metal. In the two Q-N phases, the discrete lattice rotation\nsymmetry is counter-intuitively ``quasi-broken'' with power-law decaying\norientation correlations. They separate the phase diagram into various phases\nconnected via Brezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. These\nremarkable critical vestigial phases, which resemble the intermediate BKT phase\nin the $q$-state ($q\\ge 5$) clock model, are consequence of the five- (or\nhigher-) fold anisotropy field brought about by the unique QC symmetry, which\nare absent in conventional crystalline materials.",

                "abstract": "Shape modeling research in Computer Graphics has been an active area for\ndecades. The ability to create and edit complex 3D shapes has been of key\nimportance in Computer-Aided Design, Animation, Architecture, and\nEntertainment. With the growing popularity of Virtual and Augmented Reality,\nnew applications and tools have been developed for artistic content creation;\nreal-time interactive shape modeling has become increasingly important for a\ncontinuum of virtual and augmented reality environments (eXtended Reality\n(XR)). Shape modeling in XR opens new possibilities for intuitive design and\nshape modeling in an accessible way. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches\ngenerating shape information from text prompts are set to change how artists\ncreate and edit 3D models. There has been a substantial body of research on\ninteractive 3D shape modeling. However, there is no recent extensive review of\nthe existing techniques and what AI shape generation means for shape modeling\nin interactive XR environments. In this state-of-the-art paper, we fill this\nresearch gap in the literature by surveying free-form shape modeling work in\nXR, with a focus on sculpting and 3D sketching, the most intuitive forms of\nfree-form shape modeling. We classify and discuss these works across five\ndimensions: contribution of the articles, domain setting, interaction tool,\nauto-completion, and collaborative designing. The paper concludes by discussing\nthe disconnect between interactive 3D sculpting and sketching and how this will\nlikely evolve with the prevalence of AI shape-generation tools in the future.",

                "abstract": "Existing evaluations of tool learning primarily focus on validating the\nalignment of selected tools for large language models (LLMs) with expected\noutcomes. However, these approaches rely on a limited set of scenarios where\nanswers can be pre-determined, diverging from genuine needs. Furthermore, a\nsole emphasis on outcomes disregards the intricate capabilities essential for\nLLMs to effectively utilize tools. To tackle this issue, we propose ToolEyes, a\nfine-grained system tailored for the evaluation of the LLMs' tool learning\ncapabilities in authentic scenarios. The system meticulously examines seven\nreal-world scenarios, analyzing five dimensions crucial to LLMs in tool\nlearning: format alignment, intent comprehension, behavior planning, tool\nselection, and answer organization. Additionally, ToolEyes incorporates a tool\nlibrary boasting approximately 600 tools, serving as an intermediary between\nLLMs and the physical world. Evaluations involving ten LLMs across three\ncategories reveal a preference for specific scenarios and limited cognitive\nabilities in tool learning. Intriguingly, expanding the model size even\nexacerbates the hindrance to tool learning. These findings offer instructive\ninsights aimed at advancing the field of tool learning.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "The structure of a network has a major effect on dynamical processes on that\nnetwork. Many studies of the interplay between network structure and dynamics\nhave focused on models of phenomena such as disease spread, opinion formation\nand changes, coupled oscillators, and random walks. In parallel to these\ndevelopments, there have been many studies of wave propagation and other\nspatially extended processes on networks. These latter studies consider metric\nnetworks, in which the edges are associated with real intervals. Metric\nnetworks give a mathematical framework to describe dynamical processes that\ninclude both temporal and spatial evolution of some quantity of interest --\nsuch as the concentration of a diffusing substance or the amplitude of a wave\n-- by using edge-specific intervals that quantify distance information between\nnodes. Dynamical processes on metric networks often take the form of partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we present a collection of\ntechniques and paradigmatic linear PDEs that are useful to investigate the\ninterplay between structure and dynamics in metric networks. We start by\nconsidering a time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation. We then use both\nfinite-difference and spectral approaches to study the Poisson, heat, and wave\nequations as paradigmatic examples of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDE\nproblems on metric networks. Our spectral approach is able to account for\ndegenerate eigenmodes. In our numerical experiments, we consider metric\nnetworks with up to about $10^4$ nodes and about $10^4$ edges. A key\ncontribution of our paper is to increase the accessibility of studying PDEs on\nmetric networks.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Constant weight codes (CWCs) and constant composition codes (CCCs) are two\nimportant classes of codes that have been studied extensively in both\ncombinatorics and coding theory for nearly sixty years. In this paper we show\nthat for {\\it all} fixed odd distances, there exist near-optimal CWCs and CCCs\nasymptotically achieving the classic Johnson-type upper bounds.\n  Let $A_q(n,w,d)$ denote the maximum size of $q$-ary CWCs of length $n$ with\nconstant weight $w$ and minimum distance $d$. One of our main results shows\nthat for {\\it all} fixed $q,w$ and odd $d$, one has\n$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{A_q(n,d,w)}{\\binom{n}{t}}=\\frac{(q-1)^t}{\\binom{w}{t}}$,\nwhere $t=\\frac{2w-d+1}{2}$. This implies the existence of near-optimal\ngeneralized Steiner systems originally introduced by Etzion, and can be viewed\nas a counterpart of a celebrated result of R\\\"odl on the existence of\nnear-optimal Steiner systems. Note that prior to our work, very little is known\nabout $A_q(n,w,d)$ for $q\\ge 3$. A similar result is proved for the maximum\nsize of CCCs.\n  We provide different proofs for our two main results, based on two\nstrengthenings of the well-known Frankl-R\\\"odl-Pippenger theorem on the\nexistence of near-optimal matchings in hypergraphs: the first proof follows by\nKahn's linear programming variation of the above theorem, and the second\nfollows by the recent independent work of Delcour-Postle, and\nGlock-Joos-Kim-K\\\"uhn-Lichev on the existence of near-optimal matchings\navoiding certain forbidden configurations.\n  We also present several intriguing open questions for future research.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Self-supervised pre-training paradigms have been extensively explored in the\nfield of skeleton-based action recognition. In particular, methods based on\nmasked prediction have pushed the performance of pre-training to a new height.\nHowever, these methods take low-level features, such as raw joint coordinates\nor temporal motion, as prediction targets for the masked regions, which is\nsuboptimal. In this paper, we show that using high-level contextualized\nfeatures as prediction targets can achieve superior performance. Specifically,\nwe propose Skeleton2vec, a simple and efficient self-supervised 3D action\nrepresentation learning framework, which utilizes a transformer-based teacher\nencoder taking unmasked training samples as input to create latent\ncontextualized representations as prediction targets. Benefiting from the\nself-attention mechanism, the latent representations generated by the teacher\nencoder can incorporate the global context of the entire training samples,\nleading to a richer training task. Additionally, considering the high temporal\ncorrelations in skeleton sequences, we propose a motion-aware tube masking\nstrategy which divides the skeleton sequence into several tubes and performs\npersistent masking within each tube based on motion priors, thus forcing the\nmodel to build long-range spatio-temporal connections and focus on\naction-semantic richer regions. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and\nPKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our proposed Skeleton2vec outperforms\nprevious methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Existing deep-learning-based methods for nighttime video deraining rely on\nsynthetic data due to the absence of real-world paired data. However, the\nintricacies of the real world, particularly with the presence of light effects\nand low-light regions affected by noise, create significant domain gaps,\nhampering synthetic-trained models in removing rain streaks properly and\nleading to over-saturation and color shifts. Motivated by this, we introduce\nNightRain, a novel nighttime video deraining method with adaptive-rain-removal\nand adaptive-correction. Our adaptive-rain-removal uses unlabeled rain videos\nto enable our model to derain real-world rain videos, particularly in regions\naffected by complex light effects. The idea is to allow our model to obtain\nrain-free regions based on the confidence scores. Once rain-free regions and\nthe corresponding regions from our input are obtained, we can have region-based\npaired real data. These paired data are used to train our model using a\nteacher-student framework, allowing the model to iteratively learn from less\nchallenging regions to more challenging regions. Our adaptive-correction aims\nto rectify errors in our model's predictions, such as over-saturation and color\nshifts. The idea is to learn from clear night input training videos based on\nthe differences or distance between those input videos and their corresponding\npredictions. Our model learns from these differences, compelling our model to\ncorrect the errors. From extensive experiments, our method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance. It achieves a PSNR of 26.73dB, surpassing\nexisting nighttime video deraining methods by a substantial margin of 13.7%.",

                "abstract": "Chest X-ray imaging is a critical diagnostic tool for identifying pulmonary\ndiseases. However, manual interpretation of these images is time-consuming and\nerror-prone. Automated systems utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nhave shown promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of chest X-ray\nimage classification. While previous work has mainly focused on using feature\nmaps from the final convolution layer, there is a need to explore the benefits\nof leveraging additional layers for improved disease classification. Extracting\nrobust features from limited medical image datasets remains a critical\nchallenge.

The proposed model achieves a significantly\nhigher accuracy of 97.21% and 99.60% for both three-class and two-class\nclassifications, respectively.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "The occurrence of asymmetric rolling moments in wraparound fin (WAF)\nprojectiles, even at zero free stream angle of attack, and their potential to\ninduce roll reversal and resonant instabilities has long been recognized. The\ninduced rolling moment is seen to flip sign depending on the WAF configuration\n(with concave surface leading into the roll or vice versa), and between\nsubsonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In this work, we propose a simple\nmechanism that can explain the anomalous rolling behavior of WAF projectiles in\nthe subsonic regime. By modeling the curved fin by discrete span-wise linear\nsegments, the wraparound fin can be approximated as a wing with a deflected\nwinglet, and the experimental data available in the literature for such wing\nconfigurations can be applied to the curved fin of WAF projectiles. The lifting\ncharacteristic of the curved fin can be seen to differ depending on whether the\nwingtip appears to be deflected up or down relative to the local flow incidence\nangle. Based on this differential lift between a pair of oppositely-placed\ncurved fins on a WAF rocket, it becomes possible to explain the observed sign\nof the induced rolling moment as well as its dependence on the free stream\nangle of attack for small values of the angle of attack. The physical mechanism\nfor the differential lift, and hence the induced rolling moment, can be traced\nto the span-wise location and the liftoff height of the tip vortex from the\nwraparound fin tips.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "The understanding of the convoluted evolution of infant brain networks during\nthe first postnatal year is pivotal for identifying the dynamics of early brain\nconnectivity development. Existing deep learning solutions suffer from three\nmajor limitations. First, they cannot generalize to multi-trajectory prediction\ntasks, where each graph trajectory corresponds to a particular imaging modality\nor connectivity type (e.g., T1-w MRI). Second, existing models require\nextensive training datasets to achieve satisfactory performance which are often\nchallenging to obtain. Third, they do not efficiently utilize incomplete time\nseries data. To address these limitations, we introduce FedGmTE-Net++, a\nfederated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Using the power of\nfederation, we aggregate local learnings among diverse hospitals with limited\ndatasets. As a result, we enhance the performance of each hospital's local\ngenerative model, while preserving data privacy. The three key innovations of\nFedGmTE-Net++ are: (i) presenting the first federated learning framework\nspecifically designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction in a\ndata-scarce environment, (ii) incorporating an auxiliary regularizer in the\nlocal objective function to exploit all the longitudinal brain connectivity\nwithin the evolution trajectory and maximize data utilization, (iii)\nintroducing a two-step imputation process, comprising a preliminary KNN-based\nprecompletion followed by an imputation refinement step that employs regressors\nto improve similarity scores and refine imputations. Our comprehensive\nexperimental results showed the outperformance of FedGmTE-Net++ in brain\nmulti-trajectory prediction from a single baseline graph in comparison with\nbenchmark methods.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "For decades, the spectral variations of Beta Pictoris have been modelled as\nthe result of the evaporation of exocomets close to the star, termed falling\nevaporating bodies (FEBs). Resonant perturbations by a giant planet have been\nproposed to explain the dynamical origin of these stargrazers. The disk is now\nknown to harbour two giant planets, Beta Pic b and c, orbiting the star at 9.9\nau and 2.7 au. While the former almost matches the planet formerly suspected,\nthe discovery of the latter complicates the picture. We first question the\nstability of the two-planet system. Then we investigate the dynamics of a disk\nof planetesimals orbiting the star with both planets to check the validity of\nthe FEB generation mechanism. Symplectic N-body simulations are used to\ndetermine which regions of the planetesimal disk are dynamically stable. Then\nwe focus on regions where disk particles are able to reach high eccentricities\nthanks to resonant mechanisms. The first result is that the system is\ndynamically stable. Both planets may temporarily fall in 7:1 mean motion\nresonance (MMR). Then, simulations reveal that the whole region extending\nbetween ~1.5 au and ~25 au is unstable to planetary perturbations. However, a\ndisk below 1.5 au survives, which appears to constitute an active source of\nFEBs via high-order MMRs with Beta Pic c. Beta Pic b acts as a distant\nperturber that helps sustain the whole process. These simulations rule out the\npreceding FEB generation mechanism model, which placed their origin at around\n4-5 au. Conversely, FEBs are likely to originate from a region much further in\nand related to MMRs with Beta Pic c. That mechanism also appears to last\nlonger, as new planetesimals are able to continuously enter the MMRs and evolve\ntowards the FEB state. Subsequently, the physical nature of the FEBs may differ\nfrom that previously thought, and presumably may not be icy.",

With the\nadvent of the artificial intelligence era, many deep learning frameworks have\nmade remarkable progress in various fields and are now considered effective\nmethods in many areas.

                "abstract": "In recent years, text-to-video retrieval methods based on CLIP have\nexperienced rapid development. The primary direction of evolution is to exploit\nthe much wider gamut of visual and textual cues to achieve alignment.\nConcretely, those methods with impressive performance often design a heavy\nfusion block for sentence (words)-video (frames) interaction, regardless of the\nprohibitive computation complexity. Nevertheless, these approaches are not\noptimal in terms of feature utilization and retrieval efficiency. To address\nthis issue, we adopt multi-granularity visual feature learning, ensuring the\nmodel's comprehensiveness in capturing visual content features spanning from\nabstract to detailed levels during the training phase. To better leverage the\nmulti-granularity features, we devise a two-stage retrieval architecture in the\nretrieval phase. This solution ingeniously balances the coarse and fine\ngranularity of retrieval content. Moreover, it also strikes a harmonious\nequilibrium between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, in\ntraining phase, we design a parameter-free text-gated interaction block (TIB)\nfor fine-grained video representation learning and embed an extra Pearson\nConstraint to optimize cross-modal representation learning. In retrieval phase,\nwe use coarse-grained video representations for fast recall of top-k\ncandidates, which are then reranked by fine-grained video representations.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness.

Three-dimensional\nradiation-hydrodynamic (3D RHD) ``box-in-a-star'' simulations of stellar\natmospheres offer a more realistic representation of surface convection\noccurring in late-type stars compared to traditional one-dimensional (1D)\nhydrostatic models.

Supervised\ndeep learning achieves excellent results in cancer image classification,\nusually through transfer learning.

In this paper, we demonstrate that a model pre-trained using a\nself-supervised learning algorithm known as Barlow Twins can outperform the\nconventional supervised transfer learning pipeline. We juxtapose two base\nmodels: i) pretrained in a supervised fashion on ImageNet; ii) pretrained in a\nself-supervised fashion on ImageNet. Both are subsequently fine tuned on a\nsmall labelled skin lesion dataset and evaluated on a large test set. We\nachieve a mean test accuracy of 70\\% for self-supervised transfer in comparison\nto 66\\% for supervised transfer. Interestingly, boosting performance further is\npossible by self-supervised pretraining a second time (on unlabelled skin\nlesion images) before subsequent fine tuning. This hints at an alternative path\nto collecting more labelled data in settings where this is challenging - namely\njust collecting more unlabelled images.

As a significant aspect of LLM alignment, it is thus\nimportant to formulate such a specialized set of instructions as well as\ninvestigate the resulting behavior of LLMs. To address this vacancy, we propose\na new benchmark CoDI-Eval to systematically and comprehensively evaluate LLMs'\nresponses to instructions with various constraints. We construct a large\ncollection of constraints-attributed instructions as a test suite focused on\nboth generalization and coverage. Specifically, we advocate an instruction\ndiversification process to synthesize diverse forms of constraint expression\nand also deliberate the candidate task taxonomy with even finer-grained\nsub-categories. Finally, we automate the entire evaluation process to\nfacilitate further developments. Different from existing studies on\ncontrollable text generation, CoDI-Eval extends the scope to the prevalent\ninstruction-following paradigm for the first time. We provide extensive\nevaluations of representative LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Vicuna) on CoDI-Eval,\nrevealing their limitations in following instructions with specific constraints\nand there is still a significant gap between open-source and commercial\nclosed-source LLMs. We believe this benchmark will facilitate research into\nimproving the controllability of LLMs' responses to instructions.

An active research topic under this\nmission is integrating federated learning (FL) with satellite communications\n(SatCom) so that numerous low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can collaboratively\ntrain a machine learning model. However, the special communication environment\nof SatCom leads to a very slow FL training process up to days and weeks.

In addition, NomaFedHAP includes (3) a\nnew communication topology that exploits HAPs to bridge satellites among\ndifferent orbits to mitigate the Doppler shift, and (4) a new FL model\naggregation scheme that optimally balances models between different orbits and\nshells. Moreover, we (5) derive a closed-form expression of the outage\nprobability for satellites in near and far shells, as well as for the entire\nsystem.

A prime example is the widely used ensemble Kalman filter\n(EnKF), which relies on linear updates to minimize variance among the ensemble\nof forecast states. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of deep\nlearning approaches in this domain, primarily within a supervised learning\nframework. However, the adaptability of such models to untrained scenarios\nremains a challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel DA strategy that\nutilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to apply state corrections using full or\npartial observations of the state variables. Our investigation focuses on\ndemonstrating this approach to the chaotic Lorenz '63 system, where the agent's\nobjective is to minimize the root-mean-squared error between the observations\nand corresponding forecast states. Consequently, the agent develops a\ncorrection strategy, enhancing model forecasts based on available system state\nobservations. Our strategy employs a stochastic action policy, enabling a Monte\nCarlo-based DA framework that relies on randomly sampling the policy to\ngenerate an ensemble of assimilated realizations. Results demonstrate that the\ndeveloped RL algorithm performs favorably when compared to the EnKF.\nAdditionally, we illustrate the agent's capability to assimilate non-Gaussian\ndata, addressing a significant limitation of the EnKF.",

Another one is to describe the\nsymplectic structure of the manifold $Z\\subseteq\\ssf+\\sb_l$ of normalized\nJacobi elements. Then the Hamiltonian corresponding to a fundamental invariant\nprovides a class of hyperbolic Toda lattices.

However, recent work on high-capacity\nmodels in robotics has shown promise toward being trained on large collections\nof diverse and task-agnostic datasets of video demonstrations. These models\nhave shown impressive levels of generalization to unseen circumstances,\nespecially as the amount of data and the model complexity scale. Surgical robot\nsystems that learn from data have struggled to advance as quickly as other\nfields of robot learning for a few reasons: (1) there is a lack of existing\nlarge-scale open-source data to train models, (2) it is challenging to model\nthe soft-body deformations that these robots work with during surgery because\nsimulation cannot match the physical and visual complexity of biological\ntissue, and (3) surgical robots risk harming patients when tested in clinical\ntrials and require more extensive safety measures. This perspective article\naims to provide a path toward increasing robot autonomy in robot-assisted\nsurgery through the development of a multi-modal, multi-task,\nvision-language-action model for surgical robots. Ultimately, we argue that\nsurgical robots are uniquely positioned to benefit from general-purpose models\nand provide three guiding actions toward increased autonomy in robot-assisted\nsurgery.",

The focus is on control at the transcriptional level,\nserving as a means to modulate intracellular metabolic fluxes. Recent\nstrategies in this field have employed constraint-based dynamic models for\nprocess optimization, control, and estimation. However, this results in bilevel\ndynamic optimization problems, which pose considerable numerical and conceptual\nchallenges. In this study, we present an alternative hybrid physics-informed\ndynamic modeling framework for metabolic cybergenetics, aimed at simplifying\noptimization, control, and estimation tasks. By utilizing machine-learning\nsurrogates, our approach effectively embeds the physics of metabolic networks\ninto the process rates of structurally simpler macro-kinetic models coupled\nwith gene expression. These surrogates, informed by flux balance analysis, link\nthe domains of manipulatable intracellular enzymes to metabolic exchange\nfluxes. This ensures that critical knowledge captured by the system's metabolic\nnetwork is preserved. The resulting models can be integrated into metabolic\ncybergenetic schemes involving single-level optimizations. Additionally, the\nhybrid modeling approach maintains the number of system states at a necessary\nminimum, easing the burden of process monitoring and estimation. Our hybrid\nphysics-informed metabolic cybergenetic framework is demonstrated using a\ncomputational case study on the optogenetically-assisted production of\nitaconate by $\\textit{Escherichia coli}$.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Automatic recognition of dysarthric speech remains a highly challenging task\nto date. Neuro-motor conditions and co-occurring physical disabilities create\ndifficulty in large-scale data collection for ASR system development. Adapting\nSSL pre-trained ASR models to limited dysarthric speech via data-intensive\nparameter fine-tuning leads to poor generalization. To this end, this paper\npresents an extensive comparative study of various data augmentation approaches\nto improve the robustness of pre-trained ASR model fine-tuning to dysarthric\nspeech. These include: a) conventional speaker-independent perturbation of\nimpaired speech; b) speaker-dependent speed perturbation, or GAN-based\nadversarial perturbation of normal, control speech based on their time\nalignment against parallel dysarthric speech; c) novel Spectral basis GAN-based\nadversarial data augmentation operating on non-parallel data. Experiments\nconducted on the UASpeech corpus suggest GAN-based data augmentation\nconsistently outperforms fine-tuned Wav2vec2.0 and HuBERT models using no data\naugmentation and speed perturbation across different data expansion operating\npoints by statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions up to\n2.01% and 0.96% absolute (9.03% and 4.63% relative) respectively on the\nUASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers. After cross-system outputs\nrescoring, the best system produced the lowest published WER of 16.53% (46.47%\non very low intelligibility) on UASpeech.",

                "abstract": "With the increasing number of fast-electric vehicle charging stations\n(fast-EVCSs) and the popularization of information technology, electricity\nprice competition between fast-EVCSs is highly expected, in which the\nutilization of public and/or privacy-preserved information will play a crucial\nrole. Self-interest electric vehicle (EV) users, on the other hand, try to\nselect a fast-EVCS for charging in a way to maximize their utilities based on\nelectricity price, estimated waiting time, and their state of charge. While\nexisting studies have largely focused on finding equilibrium prices, this study\nproposes a personalized dynamic pricing policy (PeDP) for a fast-EVCS to\nmaximize revenue using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We first propose\na multiple fast-EVCSs competing simulation environment to model the selfish\nbehavior of EV users using a game-based charging station selection model with a\nmonetary utility function. In the environment, we propose a Q-learning-based\nPeDP to maximize fast-EVCS' revenue. Through numerical simulations based on the\nenvironment: (1) we identify the importance of waiting time in the EV charging\nmarket by comparing the classic Bertrand competition model with the proposed\nPeDP for fast-EVCSs (from the system perspective); (2) we evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed PeDP and analyze the effects of the information on\nthe policy (from the service provider perspective); and (3) it can be seen that\nprivacy-preserved information sharing can be misused by artificial\nintelligence-based PeDP in a certain situation in the EV charging market (from\nthe customer perspective).",

                "abstract": "Smart contracts are computer programs running on blockchains to automate the\ntransaction execution between users. The absence of contract specifications\nposes a real challenge to the correctness verification of smart contracts.\nProgram invariants are properties that are always preserved throughout the\nexecution, which characterize an important aspect of the program behaviors. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel invariant generation framework, INVCON+, for\nSolidity smart contracts. INVCON+ extends the existing invariant detector,\nInvCon, to automatically produce verified contract invariants based on both\ndynamic inference and static verification. Unlike INVCON+, InvCon only produces\nlikely invariants, which have a high probability to hold, yet are still not\nverified against the contract code. Particularly, INVCON+ is able to infer more\nexpressive invariants that capture richer semantic relations of contract code.\nWe evaluate INVCON+ on 361 ERC20 and 10 ERC721 real-world contracts, as well as\ncommon ERC20 vulnerability benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that\nINVCON+ efficiently produces high-quality invariant specifications, which can\nbe used to secure smart contracts from common vulnerabilities.",

                "abstract": "Wind is one kind of high-efficient, environmentally-friendly and\ncost-effective energy source. Wind power, as one of the largest renewable\nenergy in the world, has been playing a more and more important role in\nsupplying electricity. Though growing dramatically in recent years, the amount\nof generated wind power can be directly or latently affected by multiple\nuncertain factors, such as wind speed, wind direction, temperatures, etc. More\nimportantly, there exist very complicated dependencies of the generated power\non the latent composition of these multiple time-evolving variables, which are\nalways ignored by existing works and thus largely hinder the prediction\nperformances. To this end, we propose DEWP, a novel Deep Expansion learning for\nWind Power forecasting framework to carefully model the complicated\ndependencies with adequate expressiveness. DEWP starts with a stack-by-stack\narchitecture, where each stack is composed of (i) a variable expansion block\nthat makes use of convolutional layers to capture dependencies among multiple\nvariables; (ii) a time expansion block that applies Fourier series and\nbackcast/forecast mechanism to learn temporal dependencies in sequential\npatterns. These two tailored blocks expand raw inputs into different latent\nfeature spaces which can model different levels of dependencies of\ntime-evolving sequential data. Moreover, we propose an inference block\ncorresponding for each stack, which applies multi-head self-attentions to\nacquire attentive features and maps expanded latent representations into\ngenerated wind power. In addition, to make DEWP more expressive in handling\ndeep neural architectures, we adapt doubly residue learning to process\nstack-by-stack outputs. Finally, we present extensive experiments in the\nreal-world wind power forecasting application on two datasets from two\ndifferent turbines to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Bayesian\nhierarchical models offer a coherent probabilistic framework for evaluating\nassociations between environmental exposures and health effects, which take\ninto account exposure measurement errors introduced by uncertainty in the\nestimated exposure as well as spatial misalignment between the exposure and\nhealth outcome data. While two-stage Bayesian analyses are often regarded as a\ngood alternative to fully Bayesian analyses when joint estimation is not\nfeasible, there has been minimal research on how to properly propagate\nuncertainty from the first-stage exposure model to the second-stage health\nmodel, especially in the case of a large number of participant locations along\nwith spatially correlated exposures. We propose a scalable two-stage Bayesian\napproach, called a sparse multivariate normal (sparse MVN) prior approach,\nbased on the Vecchia approximation for assessing associations between exposure\nand health outcomes in environmental epidemiology. We compare its performance\nwith existing approaches through simulation. Our sparse MVN prior approach\nshows comparable performance with the fully Bayesian approach, which is a gold\nstandard but is impossible to implement in some cases.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Neural networks are increasingly finding their way into the realm of graphs\nand modeling relationships between features. Concurrently graph neural network\nexplanation approaches are being invented to uncover relationships between the\nnodes of the graphs. However, there is a disparity between the existing\nattribution methods, and it is unclear which attribution to trust. Therefore\nresearch has introduced evaluation experiments that assess them from different\nperspectives. In this work, we assess attribution methods from a perspective\nnot previously explored in the graph domain: retraining. The core idea is to\nretrain the network on important (or not important) relationships as identified\nby the attributions and evaluate how networks can generalize based on these\nrelationships. We reformulate the retraining framework to sidestep issues\nlurking in the previous formulation and propose guidelines for correct\nanalysis. We run our analysis on four state-of-the-art GNN attribution methods\nand five synthetic and real-world graph classification datasets. The analysis\nreveals that attributions perform variably depending on the dataset and the\nnetwork. Most importantly, we observe that the famous GNNExplainer performs\nsimilarly to an arbitrary designation of edge importance. The study concludes\nthat the retraining evaluation cannot be used as a generalized benchmark and\nrecommends it as a toolset to evaluate attributions on a specifically addressed\nnetwork, dataset, and sparsity.",

Sharding boosts blockchain scalability by dividing its\nnodes into parallel shards, yet it's vulnerable to the $1\\%$ attacks where\ndishonest nodes target a shard to corrupt the entire blockchain.

Although DNN models deployed\nat the edge are promising to provide AI as a service with low latency, their\ncooperation is yet to be explored. In this paper, we consider the DNN service\nproviders share their computing resources as well as their models' parameters\nand allow other DNNs to offload their computations without mirroring. We\npropose a novel algorithm called coordinated DNNs on edge (\\textbf{CoDE}) that\nfacilitates coordination among DNN services by creating multi-task DNNs out of\nindividual models. CoDE aims to find the optimal path that results in the\nlowest possible cost, where the cost reflects the inference delay, model\naccuracy, and local computation workload. With CoDE, DNN models can make new\npaths for inference by using their own or other models' parameters. We then\nevaluate the performance of CoDE through numerical experiments. The results\ndemonstrate a $75\\%$ reduction in the local service computation workload while\ndegrading the accuracy by only $2\\%$ and having the same inference time in a\nbalanced load condition.

Confirmatory factor analysis\n(CFA) is a prevalent and pivotal technique for statistically validating the\ncovariance structure of latent common factors derived from multiple observed\nvariables. In contrast to other factor analysis methods, CFA offers a flexible\ncovariance modeling approach for common factors, enhancing the interpretability\nof relationships between the common factors, as well as between common factors\nand observations. However, the application of classic CFA models faces dual\nbarriers: the lack of a prerequisite specification of \"non-zero loadings\" or\nfactor membership (i.e., categorizing the observations into distinct common\nfactors), and the formidable computational burden in high-dimensional scenarios\nwhere the number of observed variables surpasses the sample size. To bridge\nthese two gaps, we propose the SCFA model by integrating the underlying\nhigh-dimensional covariance structure of observed variables into the CFA model.\nAdditionally, we offer computationally efficient solutions (i.e., closed-form\nuniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators) and ensure accurate statistical\ninference through closed-form exact variance estimators for all model\nparameters and factor scores. Through an extensive simulation analysis\nbenchmarking against standard computational packages, SCFA exhibits superior\nperformance in estimating model parameters and recovering factor scores, while\nsubstantially reducing the computational load, across both low- and\nhigh-dimensional scenarios. It exhibits moderate robustness to model\nmisspecification. We illustrate the practical application of the SCFA model by\nconducting factor analysis on a high-dimensional gene expression dataset.",
