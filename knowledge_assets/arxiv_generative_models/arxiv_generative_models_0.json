            "summary": "Recent significant advances in text-to-image models unlock the possibility of\ntraining vision systems using synthetic images, potentially overcoming the\ndifficulty of collecting curated data at scale. It is unclear, however, how\nthese models behave at scale, as more synthetic data is added to the training\nset. In this paper we study the scaling laws of synthetic images generated by\nstate of the art text-to-image models, for the training of supervised models:\nimage classifiers with label supervision, and CLIP with language supervision.\nWe identify several factors, including text prompts, classifier-free guidance\nscale, and types of text-to-image models, that significantly affect scaling\nbehavior. After tuning these factors, we observe that synthetic images\ndemonstrate a scaling trend similar to, but slightly less effective than, real\nimages in CLIP training, while they significantly underperform in scaling when\ntraining supervised image classifiers. Our analysis indicates that the main\nreason for this underperformance is the inability of off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image models to generate certain concepts, a limitation that\nsignificantly impairs the training of image classifiers. Our findings also\nsuggest that scaling synthetic data can be particularly effective in scenarios\nsuch as: (1) when there is a limited supply of real images for a supervised\nproblem (e.g., fewer than 0.5 million images in ImageNet), (2) when the\nevaluation dataset diverges significantly from the training data, indicating\nthe out-of-distribution scenario, or (3) when synthetic data is used in\nconjunction with real images, as demonstrated in the training of CLIP models.",

We motivate and present Gen2Det, a\nsimple modular pipeline to create synthetic training data for object detection\nfor free by leveraging state-of-the-art grounded image generation methods.\nUnlike existing works which generate individual object instances, require\nidentifying foreground followed by pasting on other images, we simplify to\ndirectly generating scene-centric images. In addition to the synthetic data,\nGen2Det also proposes a suite of techniques to best utilize the generated data,\nincluding image-level filtering, instance-level filtering, and better training\nrecipe to account for imperfections in the generation. Using Gen2Det, we show\nhealthy improvements on object detection and segmentation tasks under various\nsettings and agnostic to detection methods. In the long-tailed detection\nsetting on LVIS, Gen2Det improves the performance on rare categories by a large\nmargin while also significantly improving the performance on other categories,\ne.g. we see an improvement of 2.13 Box AP and 1.84 Mask AP over just training\non real data on LVIS with Mask R-CNN. In the low-data regime setting on COCO,\nGen2Det consistently improves both Box and Mask AP by 2.27 and 1.85 points. In\nthe most general detection setting, Gen2Det still demonstrates robust\nperformance gains, e.g. it improves the Box and Mask AP on COCO by 0.45 and\n0.32 points.",

            "summary": "We introduce a family of local models of dynamics based on ``word problems''\nfrom computer science and group theory, for which we can place rigorous lower\nbounds on relaxation timescales. These models can be regarded either as random\ncircuit or local Hamiltonian dynamics, and include many familiar examples of\nconstrained dynamics as special cases. The configuration space of these models\nsplits into dynamically disconnected sectors, and for initial states to relax,\nthey must ``work out'' the other states in the sector to which they belong.\nWhen this problem has a high time complexity, relaxation is slow. In some of\nthe cases we study, this problem also has high space complexity. When the space\ncomplexity is larger than the system size, an unconventional type of jamming\ntransition can occur, whereby a system of a fixed size is not ergodic, but can\nbe made ergodic by appending a large reservoir of sites in a trivial product\nstate. This manifests itself in a new type of Hilbert space fragmentation that\nwe call fragile fragmentation. We present explicit examples where slow\nrelaxation and jamming strongly modify the hydrodynamics of conserved\ndensities. In one example, density modulations of wavevector $q$ exhibit almost\nno relaxation until times $O(\\exp(1/q))$, at which point they abruptly\ncollapse. We also comment on extensions of our results to higher dimensions.",

Often parts of a captured 3D scene or object are missing due to mesh\nreconstruction failures or a lack of observations (e.g., contact regions, such\nas the bottom of objects, or hard-to-reach areas). We approach this challenging\n3D inpainting problem by leveraging a 2D inpainting diffusion model. We\nidentify a surprising behavior of these models, where they generate more 3D\nconsistent inpaints when images form a 2$\\times$2 grid, and show how to\ngeneralize this behavior to more than four images. We then present an iterative\nframework to distill these inpainted regions into a single consistent 3D scene.\nIn contrast to related works, we focus on completing scenes rather than\ndeleting foreground objects, and our approach does not require tight 2D object\nmasks or text.

This volumetric primitives representation marries the\ncapacity of volumetric representations with the efficiency of primitive-based\nrendering. Our PrimDiffusion framework has three appealing properties: 1)\ncompact and expressive parameter space for the diffusion model, 2) flexible 3D\nrepresentation that incorporates human prior, and 3) decoder-free rendering for\nefficient novel-view and novel-pose synthesis. Extensive experiments validate\nthat PrimDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D human generation.\nNotably, compared to GAN-based methods, our PrimDiffusion supports real-time\nrendering of high-quality 3D humans at a resolution of $512\\times512$ once the\ndenoising process is done.

Here we\nperform PEPS simulations of low-energy dynamics in the Kitaev honeycomb model,\nwhich supports fractionalized gauge flux (vison) excitations. We identify gauge\nsymmetry emerging upon optimizing an unbiased PEPS ground state. Using the PEPS\nadapted local mode approximation, we further classify the low-lying excited\nstates by discerning different vison sectors. Our simulations of spin and\nspin-dimer dynamical correlations establish close connections with experimental\nobservations. Notably, the selection rule imposed by the locally conserved\nvisons results in nearly flat dispersions in momentum space for excited states\nbelonging to the 2-vison or 4-vison sectors.",

Our work shows that the localization --\"grounding\"-- abilities of\nthese models can be further improved by finetuning for self-consistent visual\nexplanations. We propose a strategy for augmenting existing text-image datasets\nwith paraphrases using a large language model, and SelfEQ, a weakly-supervised\nstrategy on visual explanation maps for paraphrases that encourages\nself-consistency. Specifically, for an input textual phrase, we attempt to\ngenerate a paraphrase and finetune the model so that the phrase and paraphrase\nmap to the same region in the image. We posit that this both expands the\nvocabulary that the model is able to handle, and improves the quality of the\nobject locations highlighted by gradient-based visual explanation methods (e.g.\nGradCAM). We demonstrate that SelfEQ improves performance on Flickr30k,\nReferIt, and RefCOCO+ over a strong baseline method and several prior works.\nParticularly, comparing to other methods that do not use any type of box\nannotations, we obtain 84.07% on Flickr30k (an absolute improvement of 4.69%),\n67.40% on ReferIt (an absolute improvement of 7.68%), and 75.10%, 55.49% on\nRefCOCO+ test sets A and B respectively (an absolute improvement of 3.74% on\naverage).",

Similar to Zero-1-to-3, we start from a\npre-trained 2D image generator for generalization, and fine-tune it for NVS.\nCompared to recent and concurrent works, we obtain significant improvements\nwithout resorting to an explicit 3D representation, which is slow and\nmemory-consuming or training an additional 3D network. We do so by encoding\nbetter the target camera pose via a new per-pixel ray conditioning\nnormalization (RCN) layer. The latter injects pose information in the\nunderlying 2D image generator by telling each pixel its specific viewing\ndirection. We also improve multi-view consistency via a light-weight multi-view\nattention layer and multi-view noise sharing. We train Free3D on the Objaverse\ndataset and demonstrate excellent generalization to various new categories in\nseveral new datasets, including OminiObject3D and GSO. We hope our simple and\neffective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help future research in\nNVS with more accuracy pose. The project page is available at\nhttps://chuanxiaz.com/free3d/.",

Additionally, the color content of the scenes, solar-zenith\nangle, and population density of different geographies influence the data\ndiversity. These two factors conjointly render suboptimal aerial-visual\nperception of the deep neural network (DNN) models trained primarily on the\nground-view data, including the open-world foundational models.\n  To pave the way for a transformative era of aerial detection, we present\nMultiview Aerial Visual RECognition or MAVREC, a video dataset where we record\nsynchronized scenes from different perspectives -- ground camera and\ndrone-mounted camera. MAVREC consists of around 2.5 hours of industry-standard\n2.7K resolution video sequences, more than 0.5 million frames, and 1.1 million\nannotated bounding boxes. This makes MAVREC the largest ground and aerial-view\ndataset, and the fourth largest among all drone-based datasets across all\nmodalities and tasks. Through our extensive benchmarking on MAVREC, we\nrecognize that augmenting object detectors with ground-view images from the\ncorresponding geographical location is a superior pre-training strategy for\naerial detection. Building on this strategy, we benchmark MAVREC with a\ncurriculum-based semi-supervised object detection approach that leverages\nlabeled (ground and aerial) and unlabeled (only aerial) images to enhance the\naerial detection. We publicly release the MAVREC dataset:\nhttps://mavrec.github.io.",

            "summary": "Learning from unstructured and uncurated data has become the dominant\nparadigm for generative approaches in language and vision. Such unstructured\nand unguided behavior data, commonly known as play, is also easier to collect\nin robotics but much more difficult to learn from due to its inherently\nmultimodal, noisy, and suboptimal nature. In this paper, we study this problem\nof learning goal-directed skill policies from unstructured play data which is\nlabeled with language in hindsight. Specifically, we leverage advances in\ndiffusion models to learn a multi-task diffusion model to extract robotic\nskills from play data. Using a conditional denoising diffusion process in the\nspace of states and actions, we can gracefully handle the complexity and\nmultimodality of play data and generate diverse and interesting robot\nbehaviors. To make diffusion models more useful for skill learning, we\nencourage robotic agents to acquire a vocabulary of skills by introducing\ndiscrete bottlenecks into the conditional behavior generation process. In our\nexperiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a wide\nvariety of environments in both simulation and the real world.

However, existing methods are not hyper-realistic enough\nfor post-generation usage, as users cannot view, render and edit the resulting\n3D content from a full range. To address these challenges, we introduce\nHyperDreamer with several key designs and appealing properties: 1) Viewable:\n360 degree mesh modeling with high-resolution textures enables the creation of\nvisually compelling 3D models from a full range of observation points. 2)\nRenderable: Fine-grained semantic segmentation and data-driven priors are\nincorporated as guidance to learn reasonable albedo, roughness, and specular\nproperties of the materials, enabling semantic-aware arbitrary material\nestimation. 3) Editable: For a generated model or their own data, users can\ninteractively select any region via a few clicks and efficiently edit the\ntexture with text-based guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of HyperDreamer in modeling region-aware materials with\nhigh-resolution textures and enabling user-friendly editing.

The electrons lose their heat within 0.5 ps\nwhile the lattice temperature rises slowly in 3.5 to 8 ps, leaving a gap of 3-7\nps. We propose that the hidden energy is transiently stored in high-frequency\nphonon modes for which diffraction is insensitive and which are excited in 0.5\nps. Within a three-temperature model we use three heat baths, namely electrons,\nhigh-frequency and low-frequency phonon modes to simulate the observations.

            "summary": "Modeling spatial-temporal interactions among neighboring agents is at the\nheart of multi-agent problems such as motion forecasting and crowd navigation.\nDespite notable progress, it remains unclear to which extent modern\nrepresentations can capture the causal relationships behind agent interactions.\nIn this work, we take an in-depth look at the causal awareness of these\nrepresentations, from computational formalism to real-world practice. First, we\ncast doubt on the notion of non-causal robustness studied in the recent\nCausalAgents benchmark. We show that recent representations are already\npartially resilient to perturbations of non-causal agents, and yet modeling\nindirect causal effects involving mediator agents remains challenging. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce a metric learning approach that\nregularizes latent representations with causal annotations. Our controlled\nexperiments show that this approach not only leads to higher degrees of causal\nawareness but also yields stronger out-of-distribution robustness. To further\noperationalize it in practice, we propose a sim-to-real causal transfer method\nvia cross-domain multi-task learning. Experiments on pedestrian datasets show\nthat our method can substantially boost generalization, even in the absence of\nreal-world causal annotations. We hope our work provides a new perspective on\nthe challenges and potential pathways towards causally-aware representations of\nmulti-agent interactions.

We focus on\nunconventional processes involving the interplay between the two ferromagnetic\nlayers, which are classified into direct and indirect mechanisms. The direct\nmechanism involves spin current generation by one ferromagnetic layer and its\nsubsequent absorption by the other. In the indirect mechanism, the in-plane\nspin-polarized current from one ferromagnetic layer ``leaks'' into the other\nlayer, where it is converted into an out-of-plane spin current and reabsorbed\nby the original layer. The direct mechanism results in a predominantly\ndampinglike torque, which damps the magnetization towards a certain direction\n$\\mathbf{s}_d$. The indirect mechanism results in a predominantly fieldlike\ntorque with respect to a generally different direction $\\mathbf{s}_f$. Similar\nto the current-in-plane giant magnetoresistance, the indirect mechanism is only\nactive if the thickness of the nonmagnetic spacer is smaller than or comparable\nto the mean-free path. Numerical calculations for a semiclassical model based\non the Boltzmann equation confirm the presence of both direct and indirect\nmechanisms of spin current generation. First-principles calculations reveal\nsizeable unconventional spin-orbit torques in Co/Cu/Co, Py/Cu/Py, and Co/Pt/Co\ntrilayers and provide strong evidence of indirect spin current generation.",

Our key idea is to solve this\nblind inverse problem in the reflectance map, an appearance representation\ninvariant to the underlying geometry, by learning to reverse the image\nformation with a novel diffusion model which we refer to as the Diffusion\nReflectance Map Network (DRMNet). Given an observed reflectance map converted\nand completed from the single input image, DRMNet generates a reflectance map\ncorresponding to a perfect mirror sphere while jointly estimating the\nreflectance. The forward process can be understood as gradually filtering a\nnatural illumination with lower and lower frequency reflectance and additive\nGaussian noise. DRMNet learns to invert this process with two subnetworks,\nIllNet and RefNet, which work in concert towards this joint estimation. The\nnetwork is trained on an extensive synthetic dataset and is demonstrated to\ngeneralize to real images, showing state-of-the-art accuracy on established\ndatasets.",

Reflection correspondences are point\ncorrespondences in the reflected world, i.e., the scene reflected by the object\nsurface. The object geometry and reflectance alters the scene geometrically and\nradiometrically, respectively, causing incorrect pixel correspondences.\nGeometry recovered from each image is also hampered by distortions, namely\ngeneralized bas-relief ambiguity, leading to erroneous 3D correspondences. We\nshow that reflection correspondences can resolve the ambiguities arising from\nthese distortions. We introduce a neural correspondence estimator and a RANSAC\nalgorithm that fully leverages all three kinds of correspondences for robust\nand accurate joint camera pose and object shape estimation just from the object\nappearance. The method expands the horizon of numerous downstream tasks,\nincluding camera pose estimation for appearance modeling (e.g., NeRF) and\nmotion estimation of reflective objects (e.g., cars on the road), to name a\nfew, as it relieves the requirement of overlapping background.",

We show that the problem remains\nNP-hard for restricted types of graphs and specify some families of graphs for\nwhich the heuristics guarantee the optimality. The second exact algorithm\nturned out to be about twice faster than ILP for graphs with more than 230\nvertices and up to 1080 vertices, which were the largest benchmark instances\nthat were solved optimally. The heuristics were tested for the existing 2284\nbenchmark problem instances with up to 14000 vertices and delivered solutions\nfor the largest instances in less than one minute.

When used for\ndownstream object detection, we demonstrate that the proposed self-supervision\nframework can improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art supervised baselines by\n5.8% in mAP.",

            "summary": "As blockchain smart contracts become more widespread and carry more valuable\ndigital assets, they become an increasingly attractive target for attackers.\nOver the past few years, smart contracts have been subject to a plethora of\ndevastating attacks, resulting in billions of dollars in financial losses.\nThere has been a notable surge of research interest in identifying defects in\nsmart contracts. However, existing smart contract fuzzing tools are still\nunsatisfactory. They struggle to screen out meaningful transaction sequences\nand specify critical inputs for each transaction. As a result, they can only\ntrigger a limited range of contract states, making it difficult to unveil\ncomplicated vulnerabilities hidden in the deep state space.\n  In this paper, we shed light on smart contract fuzzing by employing a\nsequence-aware mutation and seed mask guidance strategy. In particular, we\nfirst utilize data-flow-based feedback to determine transaction orders in a\nmeaningful way and further introduce a sequence-aware mutation technique to\nexplore deeper states. Thereafter, we design a mask-guided seed mutation\nstrategy that biases the generated transaction inputs to hit target branches.\nIn addition, we develop a dynamic-adaptive energy adjustment paradigm that\nbalances the fuzzing resource allocation during a fuzzing campaign. We\nimplement our designs into a new smart contract fuzzer named MuFuzz, and\nextensively evaluate it on three benchmarks. Empirical results demonstrate that\nMuFuzz outperforms existing tools in terms of both branch coverage and bug\nfinding. Overall, MuFuzz achieves higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art\nfuzzers (up to 25%) and detects 30% more bugs than existing bug detectors.",

            "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable results on various complex\nreasoning benchmarks. The reasoning capabilities of LLMs enable them to execute\nfunction calls, using user-provided functions to overcome their inherent\nlimitations, such as knowledge cutoffs, poor arithmetic skills, or lack of\naccess to private data. This development has expanded LLMs' scope to include\nmulti-function calling, where LLMs are equipped with a variety of functions and\nselect the proper functions based on the context. Multi-function calling\nabilities of LLMs have catalyzed LLM-based software development, allowing them\nto tackle more complex problems. However, current methods for multi-function\ncalling often require sequential reasoning and acting for each function which\ncan result in high latency, cost, and sometimes inaccurate behavior. To address\nthis, we introduce LLMCompiler, which executes functions in parallel to\nefficiently orchestrate multi-function calling. Drawing from the principles of\nclassical compilers, LLMCompiler streamlines parallel function calling with\nthree components: (i) an LLM Planner, formulating execution strategies and\ndependencies; (ii) a Task Fetching Unit, dispatching function calling tasks;\nand (iii) an Executor, executing these tasks in parallel. LLMCompiler\nautomatically computes an optimized orchestration for the function calls and\ncan be used with open-source models such as LLaMA-2. We have benchmarked\nLLMCompiler on a range of tasks including cases with non-trivial\ninter-dependency between function calls, as well as cases that require dynamic\nreplanning based on intermediate results. We observe consistent latency speedup\nof up to 3.7x, cost savings of up to 6.7x, and accuracy improvement of up to\n~9% as compared to ReAct. Additionally, LLMCompiler achieves up to 1.35x\nlatency gain over OpenAI's recent parallel function calling, while achieving\nsimilar accuracy.",

The system is based on spin-1/2 qubits in a resonator such as atoms in\nan optical cavity or superconducting qubits coupled to a metal microwave\nresonator. By sending light or microwave into the resonator, it induces AC\nStark shifts on particular angular-momentum eigenstates (Dicke states) of\nqubits. Then we are able to generate barriers that hinder transitions between\nadjacent Dicke states and tear the original Hilbert space into pieces.\nTherefore, a simple global single-qubit rotation becomes highly non-trivial,\nand thus generates entanglement among the many-body system. By optimal control\nof energy shifts on Dicke states, we are able to generate arbitrary symmetric\nentangled states. We also exemplify that we can create varieties of useful\nstates with near-unity fidelities in only one or very few steps, including W\nstates, spin-squeezed states (SSS), and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nstates. Particularly, the SSS can be created by only one step with a squeezing\nparameter $\\xi_R^2\\sim1/N^{0.843}$ approaching the Heisenberg limit (HL).

            "summary": "Extreme precipitation in the Arctic region plays a crucial role in global\nweather and climate patterns. Bear Island (Bj{\\o}rn{\\o}ya) is located in the\nNorwegian Svalbard archipelago, which is, therefore, selected for our study on\nextreme precipitation. The island occupies a unique geographic position at the\nintersection of the high and low Arctic, characterized by a flat and\nlake-filled northern region contrasting with mountainous terrain along its\nsouthern shores. Its maritime-polar climate is influenced by North Atlantic\ncurrents, resulting in relatively mild winter temperatures. An increase in\nprecipitation level in Bear Island is a significant concern linked to climate\nchange and has global implications. We have collected the amount of daily\nprecipitation as well as daily maximum temperatures from the meteorological\nstation of Bj{\\o}rn{\\o}ya located on the island, operated by the Norwegian\nCentre for Climate Services for a period spanning from January 1, 1960 to\nDecember 31, 2021. We observe that the trend of yearly mean precipitation\nduring this period linearly increases. We analyze the recorded data to\ninvestigate the changing pattern of precipitation extremes over the climate\nscales. We employ the generalized extreme value distribution to model yearly\nand seasonal maxima of daily precipitation amount and determine the return\nlevels and return period of precipitation extremes. We compare the variability\nof precipitation extremes between the two time periods: (i) 1960-1990 and (ii)\n1991-2021. Our analysis reveals an increase in the frequency of precipitation\nextremes occurrences between 1991 and 2021. Our findings establish a better\nunderstanding of precipitation extremes in Bear Island from a statistical\nviewpoint, with an observation of seasonal and yearly variability, especially,\nduring the period of the last 31 years.",

When doing so, recent studies demonstrated the\nimportance of accounting for the symmetries and geometry of parameter spaces.\nHowever, those works developed architectures tailored to specific networks such\nas MLPs and CNNs without normalization layers, and generalizing such\narchitectures to other types of networks can be challenging. In this work, we\novercome these challenges by building new metanetworks - neural networks that\ntake weights from other neural networks as input. Put simply, we carefully\nbuild graphs representing the input neural networks and process the graphs\nusing graph neural networks. Our approach, Graph Metanetworks (GMNs),\ngeneralizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle, such as\nmulti-head attention layers, normalization layers, convolutional layers, ResNet\nblocks, and group-equivariant linear layers. We prove that GMNs are expressive\nand equivariant to parameter permutation symmetries that leave the input neural\nnetwork functions unchanged. We validate the effectiveness of our method on\nseveral metanetwork tasks over diverse neural network architectures.",

The Heisenberg exchanges, which can\nbe calculated to an arbitrary shell, are transferred into the Monte Carlo\ncalculation. Using Cr-based magnets as the showcases, we show that our method\nis a powerful tool to study the 2D magnets in two aspects. First, considering\nlong-range exchanges enables us to identify the spin frustration in the\nsuspended CrTe2 monolayer, whereas the heterostructure calculations reveal that\nthe ferromagnetism can be recovered if the monolayer CrTe2 is grown onto\nvarious 2D substrates. Second, we realize a high-throughput screening of novel\nmagnets discovered by random structure searches. Six 2D Cr chalcogenides are\nselected to have high TM.

A linear arrangement is usually\ndefined as a permutation of the $n$ vertices of a graph. An intuitive geometric\nsetting is that of vertices lying on consecutive integer positions in the real\nline, starting at 1; edges are typically drawn as semicircles above the real\nline. In this paper we study the Maximum Linear Arrangement problem (MaxLA),\nthe maximization variant of minLA and a less studied problem than minLA. We a\ndevise new characterization of maximum arrangements of general graphs, and\nprove that MaxLA can be solved for cycle graphs in constant time, and for\n$k$-linear trees ($k\\le2$) in time $O(n)$. We present a simple algorithm that\nsolves a constrained variant of MaxLA, which we call bipartite MaxLA, in time\n$O(n)$. This algorithm has two promising characteristics. First, it solves\nMaxLA for most trees consisting of a few tenths of nodes. Second, it produces a\nhigh quality approximation to MaxLA for trees where the algorithm fails to\nsolve MaxLA. Furthermore, we conjecture this algorithm solves MaxLA for at\nleast $50\\%$ of all free trees.",

            "summary": "Despite diffusion models having shown powerful abilities to generate\nphotorealistic images, generating videos that are realistic and diverse still\nremains in its infancy. One of the key reasons is that current methods\nintertwine spatial content and temporal dynamics together, leading to a notably\nincreased complexity of text-to-video generation (T2V). In this work, we\npropose HiGen, a diffusion model-based method that improves performance by\ndecoupling the spatial and temporal factors of videos from two perspectives,\ni.e., structure level and content level. At the structure level, we decompose\nthe T2V task into two steps, including spatial reasoning and temporal\nreasoning, using a unified denoiser. Specifically, we generate spatially\ncoherent priors using text during spatial reasoning and then generate\ntemporally coherent motions from these priors during temporal reasoning. At the\ncontent level, we extract two subtle cues from the content of the input video\nthat can express motion and appearance changes, respectively. These two cues\nthen guide the model's training for generating videos, enabling flexible\ncontent variations and enhancing temporal stability. Through the decoupled\nparadigm, HiGen can effectively reduce the complexity of this task and generate\nrealistic videos with semantics accuracy and motion stability. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superior performance of HiGen over the\nstate-of-the-art T2V methods.",

            "summary": "Penalizing complexity (PC) priors is a principled framework for designing\npriors that reduce model complexity. PC priors penalize the Kullback-Leibler\nDivergence (KLD) between the distributions induced by a ``simple'' model and\nthat of a more complex model. However, in many common cases, it is impossible\nto construct a prior in this way because the KLD is infinite. Various\napproximations are used to mitigate this problem, but the resulting priors then\nfail to follow the designed principles. We propose a new class of priors, the\nWasserstein complexity penalization (WCP) priors, by replacing KLD with the\nWasserstein distance in the PC prior framework. These priors avoid the infinite\nmodel distance issues and can be derived by following the principles exactly,\nmaking them more interpretable. Furthermore, principles and recipes to\nconstruct joint WCP priors for multiple parameters analytically and numerically\nare proposed and we show that they can be easily obtained, either numerically\nor analytically, for a general class of models. The methods are illustrated\nthrough several examples for which PC priors have previously been applied.",

By Fourier transforming different time-dependent\nterms in the Jefimenko equations, we unravel that in 0.1--30 THz range the\nelectric field of far-field EM radiation by Ni layer, chosen as an example, is\ndominated by charge current pumped by demagnetization, while often invoked\nmagnetic dipole radiation from time-dependent magnetization of a single\nmagnetic layer is a negligible effect. Such overlooked case of charge current\npumping by time-dependent quantum system, whose magnetization is shrinking\nwhile its vector does not rotate, does not require any spin-to-charge\nconversion via SOC effects. In Ni/Pt bilayer, EM radiation remains dominated by\ncharge current within Ni layer, whose magnitude is larger than in the case of\nsingle Ni layer due to faster demagnetization, while often invoked\nspin-to-charge conversion within Pt layer provides additional but smaller\ncontribution.

For\nexample, consider prompting an LM to write code that counts the number of times\nit detects sarcasm in an essay: the LM may struggle to write an implementation\nfor \"detect_sarcasm(string)\" that can be executed by the interpreter (handling\nthe edge cases would be insurmountable). However, LMs may still produce a valid\nsolution if they are used not only to write the code, but also to selectively\n\"emulate\" the interpreter by generating the expected output of\n\"detect_sarcasm(string)\" and other lines of code (e.g., that the interpreter\ncould not compile). In this work, we propose Chain of Code (CoT), a simple yet\nsurprisingly effective extension that improves LM code-driven reasoning. The\nkey idea is to encourage LMs to format linguistic sub-tasks in a program as\nflexible pseudocode that the compiler can explicitly catch undefined behaviors\nand hand off to simulate with an LM (as an \"LMulator\"). Experiments demonstrate\nthat Chain of Code outperforms Chain of Thought and other baselines across a\nvariety of benchmarks; on BIG-Bench Hard, Chain of Code achieves 84%, a gain of\n12% over Chain of Thought.

Existing watermarking strategies operate by altering the\ndecoder of an existing language model, and the ability for a language model to\ndirectly learn to generate the watermark would have significant implications\nfor the real-world deployment of watermarks. First, learned watermarks could be\nused to build open models that naturally generate watermarked text, allowing\nfor open models to benefit from watermarking. Second, if watermarking is used\nto determine the provenance of generated text, an adversary can hurt the\nreputation of a victim model by spoofing its watermark and generating damaging\nwatermarked text. To investigate the learnability of watermarks, we propose\nwatermark distillation, which trains a student model to behave like a teacher\nmodel that uses decoding-based watermarking. We test our approach on three\ndistinct decoding-based watermarking strategies and various hyperparameter\nsettings, finding that models can learn to generate watermarked text with high\ndetectability.

We also\ndiscuss applications to discrete spin systems and some experimental scenarios\nwhere boundary conditions with finite twist are necessary.",

            "summary": "Flux binding is a mechanism that is well-understood for global symmetries.\nGiven two systems, each with a global symmetry, gauging the composite symmetry\ninstead of individual symmetries corresponds to the condensation of the\ncomposite of gauge charges belonging to individually gauged theories and the\nbinding of the gauge fluxes. The condensed composite charge is created by a\n``short\" string given by the new minimal coupling corresponding to the\ncomposite symmetry. This paper studies what happens when combined subsystem\nsymmetries are gauged, especially when the component charges and fluxes have\ndifferent sub-dimensional mobilities. We investigate $3+1$D systems with planar\nsymmetries where, for example, the planar symmetry of a planon charge is\ncombined with one of the planar symmetries of a fracton charge. We propose the\nprinciple of \\textit{Remote Detectability} to determine how the fluxes bind and\npotentially change their mobility. This understanding can then be used to\ndesign fracton models with sub-dimensional excitations that are decorated with\nexcitations having nontrivial statistics or non-abelian fusion rules.",

            "summary": "Existing methods for synthesizing 3D human gestures from speech have shown\npromising results, but they do not explicitly model the impact of emotions on\nthe generated gestures. Instead, these methods directly output animations from\nspeech without control over the expressed emotion. To address this limitation,\nwe present AMUSE, an emotional speech-driven body animation model based on\nlatent diffusion. Our observation is that content (i.e., gestures related to\nspeech rhythm and word utterances), emotion, and personal style are separable.\nTo account for this, AMUSE maps the driving audio to three disentangled latent\nvectors: one for content, one for emotion, and one for personal style. A latent\ndiffusion model, trained to generate gesture motion sequences, is then\nconditioned on these latent vectors. Once trained, AMUSE synthesizes 3D human\ngestures directly from speech with control over the expressed emotions and\nstyle by combining the content from the driving speech with the emotion and\nstyle of another speech sequence. Randomly sampling the noise of the diffusion\nmodel further generates variations of the gesture with the same emotional\nexpressivity. Qualitative, quantitative, and perceptual evaluations demonstrate\nthat AMUSE outputs realistic gesture sequences. Compared to the state of the\nart, the generated gestures are better synchronized with the speech content and\nbetter represent the emotion expressed by the input speech.

In previous studies, researchers\nused basic Information Retrieval (IR) models to decompose requirements and\ndesign elements into chunks, and then evaluated the extent to which chunks of\ndesign elements covered all chunks in the requirement. However, results had low\naccuracy because many critical concepts that extend across the entirety of the\nsentence were not well represented when the sentence was parsed into\nindependent chunks. In this paper we leverage recent advances in natural\nlanguage processing to deliver significantly more accurate results. We propose\ntwo major architectures: Satisfaction BERT (Sat-BERT), and Dual-Satisfaction\nBERT (DSat-BERT), along with their multitask learning variants to improve\nsatisfaction assessments. We perform RSA on five different datasets and compare\nresults from our variants against the chunk-based legacy approach.

In this work, we introduce PhotoMaker, an efficient\npersonalized text-to-image generation method, which mainly encodes an arbitrary\nnumber of input ID images into a stack ID embedding for preserving ID\ninformation. Such an embedding, serving as a unified ID representation, can not\nonly encapsulate the characteristics of the same input ID comprehensively, but\nalso accommodate the characteristics of different IDs for subsequent\nintegration. This paves the way for more intriguing and practically valuable\napplications. Besides, to drive the training of our PhotoMaker, we propose an\nID-oriented data construction pipeline to assemble the training data. Under the\nnourishment of the dataset constructed through the proposed pipeline, our\nPhotoMaker demonstrates better ID preservation ability than test-time\nfine-tuning based methods, yet provides significant speed improvements,\nhigh-quality generation results, strong generalization capabilities, and a wide\nrange of applications.

Under these free transformations, we show that\nlogarithmic negativity emerges as the pivotal entanglement measure for\ndetermining entangled states' transformations, analogous to the role of entropy\nin the second law of thermodynamics. Previous results have proven that\nentanglement is irreversible under quantum operations that completely preserve\nPPT and leave open the question of reversibility for quantum operations that do\nnot generate entanglement asymptotically. However, we find that going beyond\nthe complete positivity constraint imposed by standard quantum mechanics\nenables a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation, which may\nsuggest a potential incompatibility between the reversibility of entanglement\nand the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.",

To address this issue, we propose a novel\ninference method named Attention Buckets. This approach enables LLMs to handle\ncontext by conducting parallel processes, each featuring a unique RoPE angle\nbase that shapes the attention waveform. Attention Buckets ensures that an\nattention trough of a particular process can be compensated with an attention\npeak of another run, reducing the risk of the LLM missing essential information\nresiding within the attention trough. Our extensive experiments on the widely\nrecognized tool use benchmark demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where a\n7B-parameter open-source model enhanced by Attention Buckets achieves SOTA\nperformance on par with GPT-4.",

As they do so,\nthey draw energy from the turbulence, possibly up to the point where they start\nmodifying the turbulent cascade. Stochastic acceleration then enters a\nnonlinear regime because turbulence damping back-reacts in turn on the\nacceleration process. This article develops a phenomenological model to explore\nthis phenomenon and its consequences on the particle and turbulent energy\nspectra. We determine a criterion that specifies the threshold of nonthermal\nparticle energy density and the characteristic momentum beyond which\nback-reaction becomes effective. Once the back-reaction sets in, the turbulence\ncascade becomes damped below a length scale that keeps increasing in time. The\naccelerated particle momentum distribution develops a near power-law of the\nform ${\\rm d}n/{\\rm d}p\\propto p^{-s}$ with $s\\sim2$ beyond the momentum at\nwhich back-reaction first sets in. At very high energies, where the gyroradius\nof accelerated particles becomes comparable to the outer scale of the\nturbulence, the energy spectrum can display an even harder spectrum with $s\\sim\n1.3-1.5$ over a short segment. The low-energy part of the spectrum, below the\ncritical momentum, is expected to be hard ($s\\sim 1$ or harder), and shaped by\nany residual acceleration process in the damped region of the turbulence\ncascade. This characteristic broken power-law shape with $s\\sim 2$ at high\nenergies may find phenomenological applications in various high-energy\nastrophysical contexts.",

Here, we generate entanglement in a novel bipartite quantum system\ncontaining two massive objects: a photoelectron, which is a free particle\npropagating rapidly in space, and a light-dressed atomic ion with tunable\ncoupled energy levels. Because of the entanglement, the measured photoelectron\nspectra reveal information about the coherent dynamics in the residual ion\ninteracting with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses delivered by a seeded\nfree-electron laser. The observations are supported by a quantum optics based\nanalytical model, which was further validated by numerical simulations based on\nthe time-dependent Dirac equation. The degree of entanglement between the two\nobjects is interpreted in terms of the entanglement entropy of the reduced\nsystem, as a function of the interaction time between the laser pulse and the\ndressed ion. Our results uncover the potential for using short-wavelength\ncoherent light pulses from free-electron lasers to generate entangled\nphotoelectron and ion systems for studying `spooky' action at a distance across\nultrafast timescales.",

Previous datasets and studies for this setting have predominantly\nconcentrated on a limited set of pre-defined aspects, focused solely on single\ndocument inputs, or relied on synthetic data. To advance research on more\nrealistic scenarios, we introduce OpenAsp, a benchmark for multi-document\n\\textit{open} aspect-based summarization. This benchmark is created using a\nnovel and cost-effective annotation protocol, by which an open aspect dataset\nis derived from existing generic multi-document summarization datasets. We\nanalyze the properties of OpenAsp showcasing its high-quality content. Further,\nwe show that the realistic open-aspect setting realized in OpenAsp poses a\nchallenge for current state-of-the-art summarization models, as well as for\nlarge language models.",

Starting with the physical Hamiltonian\nfor the analog simulator, we construct translation-invariant effective\nHamiltonians by integrating over the simulator high-energy states produced by\nthe blockade mechanism when some of the atoms are sufficiently close to each\nothers. Remarkably, for all the simulators considered, the effective\nHamiltonians have the three types of terms present for the CAHM (Electric\nfield, matter charge and currents energies) but, in addition, terms quartic in\nthe electric field. For the two leg ladder, these additional terms cannot be\nremoved by fine-tuning the adjustable parameters of currently available\ndevices. For positive detuning, the new terms create highly-degenerate vacua\nresulting in a very interesting phase diagram. Using numerical methods, we\ndemonstrate the close correspondence between the physical simulator and the\neffective description for the ground state energy and real-time evolution. We\ndiscuss the phase diagram at fixed geometry with variable Rabi frequency and\ndetuning and show that a rich variety of phases can be reached with potential\ninterest in the context of QCD at finite density.

Existing defenses against\npoisoning attacks in FL have several limitations, such as relying on specific\nassumptions about attack types and strategies or data distributions or not\nsufficiently robust against advanced injection techniques and strategies and\nsimultaneously maintaining the utility of the aggregated model. To address the\ndeficiencies of existing defenses, we take a generic and completely different\napproach to detect poisoning (targeted and untargeted) attacks. We present\nFreqFed, a novel aggregation mechanism that transforms the model updates (i.e.,\nweights) into the frequency domain, where we can identify the core frequency\ncomponents that inherit sufficient information about weights. This allows us to\neffectively filter out malicious updates during local training on the clients,\nregardless of attack types, strategies, and clients' data distributions. We\nextensively evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of FreqFed in different\napplication domains, including image classification, word prediction, IoT\nintrusion detection, and speech recognition. We demonstrate that FreqFed can\nmitigate poisoning attacks effectively with a negligible impact on the utility\nof the aggregated model.",

            "summary": "In this work a general framework for providing detailed probabilistic\nsocioeconomic scenarios as well as estimates concerning country-level food\nsecurity risk is proposed. Our methodology builds on (a) the Bayesian\nprobabilistic version of the world population model and (b) on the\ninterdependencies of the minimum food requirements and the national food system\ncapacities on key drivers, such as: population, income, natural resources, and\nother socioeconomic and climate indicators. Model uncertainty plays an\nimportant role in such endeavours. In this perspective, the concept of the\nrecently developed convex risk measures which mitigate the model uncertainty\neffects, is employed for the development of a framework for assessment, in the\ncontext of food security. The proposed method provides predictions and\nevaluations for food security risk both within and across probabilistic\nscenarios at country level. Our methodology is illustrated through its\nimplementation for the cases of Egypt and Ethiopia, for the time period\n2019-2050, under the combined context of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\n(SSPs) and the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).",

            "summary": "Recent molecular communication (MC) research has integrated more detailed\ncomputational models to capture the dynamics of practical biophysical systems.\nThis research focuses on developing realistic models for MC transceivers\ninspired by spheroids - three-dimensional cell aggregates commonly used in\norgan-on-chip experimental systems. Potential applications that can be used or\nmodeled with spheroids include nutrient transport in an organ-on-chip system,\nthe release of biomarkers or reception of drug molecules by a cancerous tumor\nsite, or transceiver nanomachines participating in information exchange. In\nthis paper, a simple diffusive MC system is considered where a spheroidal\ntransmitter and receiver are in an unbounded fluid environment. These\nspheroidal antennas are modeled as porous media for diffusive signaling\nmolecules, then their boundary conditions and effective diffusion coefficients\nare characterized. Further, for either a point source or spheroidal\ntransmitter, Green's function for concentration (GFC) outside and inside the\nreceiving spheroid is analytically derived and formulated in terms of an\ninfinite series and confirmed by a particle-based simulator (PBS). The provided\nGFCs enable computation of the transmitted and received signals in the\nspheroidal communication system. This study shows that the porous structure of\nthe receiving spheroid amplifies diffusion signals but also disperses them,\nthus there is a trade-off between porosity and information transmission rate.\nAlso, the results reveal that the porous arrangement of the transmitting\nspheroid not only disperses the received signal but also attenuates it. System\nperformance is also evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER). Decreasing the\nporosity of the receiving spheroid is shown to enhance system performance.\nConversely, reducing the porosity of the transmitting spheroid can adversely\naffect system performance.",

            "summary": "Synthesizing multi-view 3D from one single image is a significant and\nchallenging task. For this goal, Zero-1-to-3 methods aim to extend a 2D latent\ndiffusion model to the 3D scope. These approaches generate the target-view\nimage with a single-view source image and the camera pose as condition\ninformation. However, the one-to-one manner adopted in Zero-1-to-3 incurs\nchallenges for building geometric and visual consistency across views,\nespecially for complex objects. We propose a cascade generation framework\nconstructed with two Zero-1-to-3 models, named Cascade-Zero123, to tackle this\nissue, which progressively extracts 3D information from the source image.\nSpecifically, a self-prompting mechanism is designed to generate several nearby\nviews at first. These views are then fed into the second-stage model along with\nthe source image as generation conditions. With self-prompted multiple views as\nthe supplementary information, our Cascade-Zero123 generates more highly\nconsistent novel-view images than Zero-1-to-3. The promotion is significant for\nvarious complex and challenging scenes, involving insects, humans, transparent\nobjects, and stacked multiple objects etc. The project page is at\nhttps://cascadezero123.github.io/.",

            "summary": "We report the discovery of X-ray polarization from the X-ray-bright\nthread/filament G0.13-0.11 in the Galactic Center region. This filament\nfeatures a bright hard X-ray source, most plausibly a Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN),\nand an extended and structured diffuse component. Combining the polarization\nsignal from IXPE with the imaging/spectroscopic data from Chandra, we find that\nX-ray emission of G0.13-0.11 is highly polarized PD=$57(\\pm18)$\\% in the 3-6\nkeV band, while the polarization angle is PA=$21^\\circ(\\pm9^\\circ)$. This high\ndegree of polarization proves the synchrotron origin of the X-ray emission from\nG0.13-0.11. In turn, the measured polarization angle implies that the X-ray\nemission is polarized approximately perpendicular to a sequence of non-thermal\nradio filaments that may be part of the Galactic Center Radio Arc. The magnetic\nfield of the order of $100\\,{\\rm\\mu G}$ appears to be preferentially ordered\nalong the filaments. The above field strength is the fiducial value that makes\nour model self-consistent, while the other conclusions are largely\nmodel-independent.",

There is a large body of work dealing with axiomatic\ncharacterizations, computational complexity, and algorithmic analysis of\nmultiwinner voting rules. Although many challenges remain, significant progress\nhas been made in showing existence of fair and representative outcomes as well\nas efficient algorithmic solutions for many commonly studied settings. However,\nmuch of this work focuses on single-shot elections, even though in numerous\nreal-world settings elections are held periodically and repeatedly. Hence, it\nis imperative to extend the study of multiwinner voting to temporal settings.\nRecently, there have been several efforts to address this challenge. However,\nthese works are difficult to compare, as they model multi-period voting in very\ndifferent ways. We propose a unified framework for studying temporal fairness\nin this domain, drawing connections with various existing bodies of work, and\nconsolidating them within a general framework. We also identify gaps in\nexisting literature, outline multiple opportunities for future work, and put\nforward a vision for the future of multiwinner voting in temporal settings.",

            "summary": "We investigate the direction-dependent switching current in a flux-tunable\nfour-terminal Josephson junction defined in an InAs/Al two-dimensional\nheterostructure. The device exhibits the Josephson diode effect, with switching\ncurrents that depend on the sign of the bias current. The superconducting diode\nefficiency, reaching a maximum of $|\\eta|\\approx34\\%$, is widely tunable - both\nin amplitude and sign - as a function of magnetic fluxes and gate voltages. Our\nobservations are supported by a circuit model of three parallel Josephson\njunctions with non-sinusoidal current-phase relation. With respect to\nconventional Josephson interferometers, phase-tunable multiterminal Josephson\njunctions enable large diode efficiencies in structurally symmetric devices,\nwhere local magnetic fluxes break both time-reversal and spatial-inversion\nsymmetries. Our work establishes a pathway to develop Josephson diodes with\nwide-range tunability and that do not rely on exotic materials or externally\napplied magnetic fields.",

            "summary": "Recently, diffusion models have made remarkable progress in text-to-image\n(T2I) generation, synthesizing images with high fidelity and diverse contents.\nDespite this advancement, latent space smoothness within diffusion models\nremains largely unexplored. Smooth latent spaces ensure that a perturbation on\nan input latent corresponds to a steady change in the output image. This\nproperty proves beneficial in downstream tasks, including image interpolation,\ninversion, and editing. In this work, we expose the non-smoothness of diffusion\nlatent spaces by observing noticeable visual fluctuations resulting from minor\nlatent variations. To tackle this issue, we propose Smooth Diffusion, a new\ncategory of diffusion models that can be simultaneously high-performing and\nsmooth. Specifically, we introduce Step-wise Variation Regularization to\nenforce the proportion between the variations of an arbitrary input latent and\nthat of the output image is a constant at any diffusion training step. In\naddition, we devise an interpolation standard deviation (ISTD) metric to\neffectively assess the latent space smoothness of a diffusion model. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion\nstands out as a more desirable solution not only in T2I generation but also\nacross various downstream tasks. Smooth Diffusion is implemented as a\nplug-and-play Smooth-LoRA to work with various community models. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Smooth-Diffusion.",

In a highly publicized event, the Governor of New Mexico\nrecently issued an emergency order temporarily banning the carrying of firearms\nin some areas -- and thus rescinding the right-to-carry law in New Mexico --\nafter a spate of gun violence, citing a statistical threshold of general\nsocietal violence under which right-to-carry laws should be superseded. In this\npaper we frame this policy intervention as a dynamical systems model that\nmeasures the incidence of gun violence as a function of gun prevalence. We show\nthat the Governor's emergency order -- fittingly issued as an emergency health\norder -- is effectively like trying to stop an epidemic after it has become\nviral in that with this kind of instantaneous stopping condition, under simple\nassumptions, such a regulation is too little, too late. On the other hand, a\ngraduated response that scales with increasing violence can drive equilibrium\ngun prevalence to zero. This is a new mathematical model relating gun violence\nwith gun prevalence which we hope continues to spur attention from the modeling\ncommunity to bring its tools and techniques to bear on this important and\nchallenging social problem. More importantly, our model, despite its\nsimplicity, exhibits complex dynamics and has substantial research and\neducational value in promoting the application of mathematics in the social\nsciences, extending beyond gun control issues.",

            "summary": "Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate impressive abilities in\nprocessing both images and text. However, they are vulnerable to multi-modal\nadversarial examples (AEs). Investigating the generation of\nhigh-transferability adversarial examples is crucial for uncovering VLP models'\nvulnerabilities in practical scenarios. Recent works have indicated that\nleveraging data augmentation and image-text modal interactions can enhance the\ntransferability of adversarial examples for VLP models significantly. However,\nthey do not consider the optimal alignment problem between dataaugmented\nimage-text pairs. This oversight leads to adversarial examples that are overly\ntailored to the source model, thus limiting improvements in transferability. In\nour research, we first explore the interplay between image sets produced\nthrough data augmentation and their corresponding text sets. We find that\naugmented image samples can align optimally with certain texts while exhibiting\nless relevance to others. Motivated by this, we propose an Optimal\nTransport-based Adversarial Attack, dubbed OT-Attack. The proposed method\nformulates the features of image and text sets as two distinct distributions\nand employs optimal transport theory to determine the most efficient mapping\nbetween them. This optimal mapping informs our generation of adversarial\nexamples to effectively counteract the overfitting issues. Extensive\nexperiments across various network architectures and datasets in image-text\nmatching tasks reveal that our OT-Attack outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods in terms of adversarial transferability.",

While these simulations demonstrate the possibility of a\nself-sustaining dynamo, the magnetic activity generated in these models\nsaturates at $\\beta \\gg 1$.

As a pedagogical example, we present\nexact time-dependent solutions for the evolution of weak magnetic fields in an\nincompressible fluid subject to linear shear and magnetic diffusivity. We find\nthat the maximum factor by which the initial magnetic energy can be increased\ndepends on the magnetic Reynolds number as ${\\mathcal R}_{\\rm m}^{2/3}$. We\nestimate that current global numerical simulations of dwarf nova discs have\nnumerical magnetic Reynolds numbers around 6 orders of magnitude less than the\nphysical value found in dwarf nova discs of ${\\mathcal R}_{\\rm m} \\sim\n10^{10}$. We suggest that, given the current limitations on computing power,\nexpecting to be able to compute realistic dynamo action in observable accretion\ndiscs using numerical MHD is, for the time being, a step too far.",

            "summary": "The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great\nconvenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane\nrendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such\nanomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to\nunsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and\neffectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image\nanomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase\npipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with\nthe masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using\ncross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it\nleveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those\ninvolving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of\nthe proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits\nsuperior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably,\nthe self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection\naccuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance,\nemploying the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised\npretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an\nimproved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin\nTransformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an\nAUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the\noriginal 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of\nself-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning\ntechniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and\nefficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation\nsystems.",

A detailed analysis of the corneal retardation time $\\tau$ as a\nhighly related parameter to the intraocular pressure (IOP), and its plausible\nrole as an indicator of ocular hypertension disease.

This retardation time can be easily\ncalculated from the well-known signal and pressure amplitudes of non-contact\ntonometers like the Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA).

A clear relationship between the corneal retardation time and the\ncorneal-compensated intraocular pressure was found, underlying the risk for\nocular hypertensive (OHT) subjects with lower $\\tau$ values to develop\nhypertension illnesses (due to the inability of poorly viscoelastic corneas to\nabsorb IOP fluctuations, resulting in probable optic nerve damage).\nSignificance.

            "summary": "Humans interact with objects all the time. Enabling a humanoid to learn\nhuman-object interaction (HOI) is a key step for future smart animation and\nintelligent robotics systems. However, recent progress in physics-based HOI\nrequires carefully designed task-specific rewards, making the system unscalable\nand labor-intensive. This work focuses on dynamic HOI imitation: teaching\nhumanoid dynamic interaction skills through imitating kinematic HOI\ndemonstrations. It is quite challenging because of the complexity of the\ninteraction between body parts and objects and the lack of dynamic HOI data. To\nhandle the above issues, we present PhysHOI, the first physics-based whole-body\nHOI imitation approach without task-specific reward designs. Except for the\nkinematic HOI representations of humans and objects, we introduce the contact\ngraph to model the contact relations between body parts and objects explicitly.\nA contact graph reward is also designed, which proved to be critical for\nprecise HOI imitation. Based on the key designs, PhysHOI can imitate diverse\nHOI tasks simply yet effectively without prior knowledge. To make up for the\nlack of dynamic HOI scenarios in this area, we introduce the BallPlay dataset\nthat contains eight whole-body basketball skills. We validate PhysHOI on\ndiverse HOI tasks, including whole-body grasping and basketball skills.",

In\nparticular, we investigate three interesting breaking patterns of the $S_4$\ngroup and study the structure of the domain walls in the broken phase for three\npossible residual symmetries. The presentation of domain walls in the case of\nmultiple vacua is usually complicated, which therefore implies that most of the\nanalyzes only approximate their presentation. Here, we propose a subtle way to\nrepresent the $S_{4}$ domain wall networks by presenting the vacua in each\nbreaking pattern as vectors with their components corresponding to their\ncoordinates in the flavon space. Then, through the properties of the obtained\nvectors, we find that the domain wall networks can be represented by Platonic\nor Archimedean solids where the vertices represent the degenerate vacua while\nthe edges correspond to the domain walls that separate them. As an\nillustration, we propose a type-II seesaw model that is based on the $S_{4}$\nflavor symmetry, and study its phenomenological implications on the neutrino\nsector. To solve the domain wall problem within this toy model, we consider an\napproach based on high-dimensional effective operators induced by gravity that\nexplicitly break the structure of the induced vacua favoring one vacuum over\nthe others.",

Two case studies are shown, one from 15th December\n2016, and one from 30th January 2018, in which well-defined main signal fades\nand secondary diffraction fringing are observed. In particular, the broadband\nobserving capabilities of LOFAR permit us to see considerable frequency\ndependent behaviour in the QPOs which, to our knowledge, is a new result. We\nextract some of the clearest examples of scintillation arcs reported in an\nionospheric context, from delay-Doppler spectral analysis of these two events.\nThese arcs permit the extraction of propagation velocities for the plasma\nstructures causing the QPOs ranging from 50 - 200 ms$^{-1}$, depending on the\nassumed altitude. The spacing between the individual plasma structures ranges\nbetween 5 - 20 km. The periodicities of the main signal fades in each event\nand, in the case of the 2018 data, co-temporal ionosonde data, suggest the\npropagation of the plasma structures causing the QPOs is in the E-region. Each\nof the two events is accurately reproduced using a Gaussian perturbation phase\nscreen model. Individual signal fades and enhancements were modelled using\nsmall variations in total electron content (TEC) amplitudes of order 1 mTECu,\ndemonstrating the sensitivity of LOFAR to very small fluctuations in\nionospheric plasma density.

            "summary": "Anisotropic low-resolution (LR) magnetic resonance (MR) images are fast to\nobtain but hinder automated processing. We propose to use denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) to super-resolve these 2D-acquired LR MR slices.\nThis paper introduces AniRes2D, a novel approach combining DDPM with a residual\nprediction for 2D super-resolution (SR). Results demonstrate that AniRes2D\noutperforms several other DDPM-based models in quantitative metrics, visual\nquality, and out-of-domain evaluation. We use a trained AniRes2D to\nsuper-resolve 3D volumes slice by slice, where comparative quantitative results\nand reduced skull aliasing are achieved compared to a recent state-of-the-art\nself-supervised 3D super-resolution method. Furthermore, we explored the use of\nnoise conditioning augmentation (NCA) as an alternative augmentation technique\nfor DDPM-based SR models, but it was found to reduce performance. Our findings\ncontribute valuable insights to the application of DDPMs for SR of anisotropic\nMR images.",

The proposed adversarial\nlearning is achieved by classifying model-based denoised samples and samples to\nwhich random Gaussian noise is added to a specific sampling step. With the\naddition of explicit adversarial learning on data samples, ADDM can learn the\nsemantic characteristics of the data more robustly during training, which\nachieves a similar data sampling performance with much fewer sampling steps\nthan DDPM. We apply ADDM to anomaly detection in unsupervised MRI images.\nExperimental results show that the proposed ADDM outperformed existing\ngenerative model-based unsupervised anomaly detection methods. In particular,\ncompared to other DDPM-based anomaly detection methods, the proposed ADDM shows\nbetter performance with the same number of sampling steps and similar\nperformance with 50% fewer sampling steps.",

The spin Hamiltonian of the system is considered taking into\naccount isotropic exchange, antisymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya exchange, and\nsecond- and fourth-order single-ion anisotropy. Within the framework of the\nmolecular field approximation, calculations were made of the Neel temperatures,\nthe average magnetic moments of $3d$ ions, total and partial magnetizations,\nand effective anisotropy constants. The existence in the model system\nYFe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$ of two regions of negative magnetization $0.25 \\leq\nx\\leq 0.5$ and $x\\approx 0.8$ with the corresponding magnetization reversal\npoints reaching room temperature at $x\\approx 0.45$. The phenomenon of spin\nreorientation observed for single-crystal samples in a wide range of\nconcentrations is explained by a sharp decrease in the contribution of\nantisymmetric exchange to magnetic anisotropy with increasing deviation from\nthe parent compositions and competition between the contributions of single-ion\nanisotropy of Fe and Cr ions. It has been suggested that the spatial\norientation of the Neel ${\\bf G}$ vector and the $G_{xyz}$ configuration are\nthe reason for the small value of saturation magnetization observed\nexperimentally for compositions inside or near the region of negative\nmagnetization.",

In addition, their\nstationary solutions are not guaranteed to be unique, so multiple runs with\ndifferent initial conditions must be performed to ensure sufficient sample\ncoverage.

To address this, we extend this framework to account\nfor the progressive transformation between the clean and noisy speech signals.\nThis allows us to apply recent developments from image generation literature,\nand to systematically investigate design aspects of diffusion models that\nremain largely unexplored for speech enhancement, such as the neural network\npreconditioning, the training loss weighting, the stochastic differential\nequation (SDE), or the amount of stochasticity injected in the reverse process.\nWe show that the performance of previous diffusion-based speech enhancement\nsystems cannot be attributed to the progressive transformation between the\nclean and noisy speech signals. Moreover, we show that a proper choice of\npreconditioning, training loss weighting, SDE and sampler allows to outperform\na popular diffusion-based speech enhancement system in terms of perceptual\nmetrics while using fewer sampling steps, thus reducing the computational cost\nby a factor of four.",

            "summary": "Accurate and precise positioning is required to guarantee the massive\nadoption of a wide range of 5G indoor applications, such as logistics and smart\nmanufacturing. Native support for New Radio (NR) positioning services was\nincluded in 3GPP Rel-16, where angles-of-arrival/departure and time-\n(difference-)of-arrival measurements were specified in uplink and downlink.\nHowever, all these positioning techniques assume Lineof-Sight (LoS)\npropagation, suffering from systematic bias errors when such a condition cannot\nbe guaranteed. To improve the accuracy and precision of indoor positioning\nsystems that rely on proximity, triangulation, or trilateration principles,\nthis paper considers the deployment of reference nodes to ensure LoS to one,\ntwo, or three nodes, respectively. For this purpose, the indoor service area is\nmodeled with a graph whose nodes represent the polygons that partition the\nfloor plan. Then, the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques,\nwhich specify the minimum number of reference nodes and their placement to\nguarantee a LoS condition regardless the user terminal position. The desired\naccuracy for positioning is guaranteed by setting a minimum distance and a\nminimum angle between the reference nodes as two configuration parameters of\nthe derived algorithms.",

            "summary": "Quantum multiprover interactive proof systems with entanglement MIP* are much\nmore powerful than their classical counterpart MIP (Babai et al. '91, Ji et al.\n'20): while MIP = NEXP, the quantum class MIP* is equal to RE, a class\nincluding the halting problem. This is because the provers in MIP* can share\nunbounded quantum entanglement. However, recent works of Qin and Yao '21 and\n'23 have shown that this advantage is significantly reduced if the provers'\nshared state contains noise. This paper attempts to exactly characterize the\neffect of noise on the computational power of quantum multiprover interactive\nproof systems. We investigate the quantum two-prover one-round interactive\nsystem MIP*[poly, O(1)], where the verifier sends polynomially many bits to the\nprovers and the provers send back constantly many bits. We show noise\ncompletely destroys the computational advantage given by shared entanglement in\nthis model. Specifically, we show that if the provers are allowed to share\narbitrarily many EPR states, where each EPR state is affected by an arbitrarily\nsmall constant amount of noise, the resulting complexity class is contained in\nNEXP = MIP. This improves significantly on the previous best-known bound of\nNEEEXP (nondeterministic triply exponential time) by Qin and Yao '21. We also\nshow that this collapse in power is due to the noise, rather than the O(1)\nanswer size, by showing that allowing for noiseless EPR states gives the class\nthe full power of RE = MIP*[poly, poly]. Along the way, we develop two\ntechnical tools of independent interest. First, we give a new, deterministic\ntester for the positivity of an exponentially large matrix, provided it has a\nlow-degree Fourier decomposition in terms of Pauli matrices. Secondly, we\ndevelop a new invariance principle for smooth matrix functions having bounded\nthird-order Fr\\'echet derivatives or which are Lipschitz continous.",

            "summary": "Original balance theory (Heider 1944) predicts human relations based on\nperceptions and attitudes between a pair of individuals (P - O) towards an\ninanimate object X. Social network extensions of his theory have replaced this\nX with a third individual. This has led to a plethora of adaptations that have\noften been inconsistent with Heider and with each other. We present a general\nmodel and formal notation for these social network extensions that permit\nsocial scientists to be more explicit about their balance theoretic statements.\nSpecifically, we formulate statements as a comparison of two conditional\nprobabilities of a tie, where the conditionals are defined by the 2-path\nrelation Ego - X - Alter. Given the importance Heider assigns to the role of\nnegative associations, we further identify negative ties as separate from\nnon-ties (neutral or zero-valued ties) and consider a signed graph to be a\nrestricted multigraph composed of three mutually exclusive and exhaustive\nrelations: positive ties, negative ties, and zero-ties. We stress that\nneutrality is the result of a triadic process. Combining these two features\ninto our theoretical frame results in 27 identifiable configurations. Drawing\non the work on Transitivity Correlation models, we propose a set of simple\ndescriptive statistics to measure the extent to which evidence for any\nstipulated balance configuration is present in a network. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how to apply this approach to assess network-level balance in a\nlarge data set consisting of friendly vs hostile relations between countries\nfrom 1816 to 2007. We find strong evidence particularly for one of the four\nclassic Heiderian balance theory predictions, and virtually no evidence in\nsupport of the imbalance predictions. However, we do find stable and surprising\nevidence that `neutral' ties are important in balancing the relations among\nnations.",

            "summary": "In a two-round auction, a subset of bidders is selected (probabilistically),\naccording to their bids in the first round, for the second round, where they\ncan increase their bids. We formalize the two-round auction model, restricting\nthe second round to a dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) auction for\nthe selected bidders. It turns out that, however, such two-round auctions are\nnot directly DSIC, even if the probability of each bidder being selected for\nthe second round is monotonic to its first bid, which is surprisingly\ncounter-intuitive. We also illustrate the necessary and sufficient conditions\nof two-round auctions being DSIC. Besides, we characterize the Nash equilibria\nfor untruthful two-round auctions. One can achieve better revenue performance\nby setting proper probability for selecting bidders for the second round\ncompared with truthful two-round auctions.",

            "summary": "The ability to perform causal reasoning is widely considered a core feature\nof intelligence. In this work, we investigate whether large language models\n(LLMs) can coherently reason about causality. Much of the existing work in\nnatural language processing (NLP) focuses on evaluating commonsense causal\nreasoning in LLMs, thus failing to assess whether a model can perform causal\ninference in accordance with a set of well-defined formal rules. To address\nthis, we propose a new NLP task, causal inference in natural language, inspired\nby the \"causal inference engine\" postulated by Judea Pearl et al. We compose a\nlarge dataset, CLadder, with 10K samples: based on a collection of causal\ngraphs and queries (associational, interventional, and counterfactual), we\nobtain symbolic questions and ground-truth answers, through an oracle causal\ninference engine. These are then translated into natural language. We evaluate\nmultiple LLMs on our dataset, and we introduce and evaluate a bespoke\nchain-of-thought prompting strategy, CausalCoT. We show that our task is highly\nchallenging for LLMs, and we conduct an in-depth analysis to gain deeper\ninsight into the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our data is open-sourced\nat https://huggingface.co/datasets/causalNLP/cladder, and our code can be found\nat https://github.com/causalNLP/cladder.",

            "summary": "Measurement uncertainties, represented by cyber-attacks and data losses,\nseriously degrade the quality of power system measurements. Fortunately, the\npowerful generation ability of the denoising diffusion models can enable more\nprecise measurement generation for power system data recovery. However, the\ncontrollable data generation and efficient computing methods of denoising\ndiffusion models for deterministic trajectory still need further investigation.\nTo this end, this paper proposes an improved two-stage denoising diffusion\nmodel (TSDM) to identify and reconstruct the measurements with various\nmeasurement uncertainties. The first stage of the model comprises a\nclassifier-guided conditional anomaly detection component, while the second\nstage involves diffusion-based measurement imputation component. Moreover, the\nproposed TSDM adopts precise means and optimal variances to accelerate the\ndiffusion generation process with subsequence sampling. Extensive numerical\ncase studies demonstrate that the proposed TSDM can accurately recover power\nsystem measurements despite strong randomness under renewable energy\nintegration and highly nonlinear dynamics under complex cyber-physical\ncontingencies. Additionally, the proposed TSDM has stronger robustness compared\nto existing reconstruction networks and exhibits lower computational complexity\nthan general denoising diffusion models.",

            "summary": "We present the discovery of the most distant OH megamaser to be observed in\nthe main lines, using data from the MeerKAT International Giga-Hertz Tiered\nExtragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey. At a newly measured redshift of $z\n= 0.7092$, the system has strong emission in both the 1665MHz ($L \\approx 2500$\nL$_{\\odot}$) and 1667 MHz ($L \\approx 4.5\\times10^4$ L$_{\\odot}$) transitions,\nwith both narrow and broad components. We interpret the broad line as a\nhigh-velocity-dispersion component of the 1667 MHz transition, with velocity $v\n\\sim 330$km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic velocity. The host galaxy has\na stellar mass of $M_{\\star} = 2.95 \\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and a\nstar-formation rate of SFR = 371 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, placing it $\\sim 1.5$dex\nabove the main sequence for star-forming galaxies at this redshift, and can be\nclassified as an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy. Alongside the optical imaging\ndata, which exhibits evidence for a tidal tail, this suggests that the OH\nmegamaser arises from a system that is currently undergoing a merger, which is\nstimulating star formation and providing the necessary conditions for pumping\nthe OH molecule to saturation. The OHM is likely to be lensed, with a\nmagnification factor of $\\sim 2.5$, and perhaps more if the maser emitting\nregion is compact and suitably offset relative to the centroid of its host\ngalaxy's optical light.

For the hot component of T~CrB, we find average\ndereddened colours of $(U-B)_0 = -0.70 \\pm 0.08$ and $(B-V)_0 = 0.23 \\pm 0.06$,\nwhich correspond to an effective temperature of $9400 \\pm 500$~K and an optical\nluminosity of $40-110~L_\\odot$ during the superactive state (2016-2022). After\nthe end of the superactive state, the hot component became significantly\nredder, $(U-B)_0 \\approx -0.3$ and $(B-V)_0 \\approx 0.6$ in August 2023, and\nits luminosity decreased markedly to $20-25$~$L_\\odot$ in April-May 2023, and\nto $8-9~L_\\odot$ in August 2023. The total mass accreted during the superactive\nstate from 2014 to 2023 is $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-7}$~M$_\\odot$. This is a\nsignificant fraction of the mass required to cause a thermonuclear runaway\n(TNR). Overall our results support a model in which a large accretion disc acts\nas a reservoir with increased accretion rate onto the central white dwarf\nduring disc high states, ultimately leading to a TNR explosion, which now seems\nto be imminent.",

While past work has generally been\nlimited to linear systems that have a closed-form solution, we consider using\nthe conjugate gradient method to find a solution. We show that using the\nconjugate gradient method can outperform closed-form solutions, enables merging\nvia linear systems that are otherwise intractable to solve, and flexibly allows\nchoosing from a wide variety of initializations and estimates for the ''task\nsubspace''. We ultimately demonstrate that our merging framework called\n''Matching Models in their Task Subspace'' (MaTS) achieves state-of-the-art\nresults in multitask and intermediate-task model merging.

The events are modelled as Cox\nprocesses (doubly stochastic Poisson processes) where the event intensities may\ndepend on all the modeled events as well as external factors. The model has a\nstrictly concave log-likelihood function which facilitates its fitting to\nobserved data. Besides event times, the model describes the random lengths of\nstoppage times which can have a strong influence on the final score of a match.\nThe model is illustrated on eight years of data from Campeonato Brasileiro de\nFutebol S\\'erie A. We find that dynamic regressors significantly improve the\nin-game predictive power of the model. In particular, a) when a team receives a\nred card, its goal intensity decreases more than 30%; b) the goal rate of a\nteam increases by 10% if it is losing by one goal and by 20% if its losing by\ntwo goals; and c) when the goal difference at the end of the second half is\nless than or equal to one, the stoppage time is on average more than one minute\nlonger than in matches with a difference of two goals.",

            "summary": "Infrared and visible image fusion aims at generating a fused image containing\nthe intensity and detail information of source images, and the key issue is\neffectively measuring and integrating the complementary information of\nmulti-modality images from the same scene. Existing methods mostly adopt a\nsimple weight in the loss function to decide the information retention of each\nmodality rather than adaptively measuring complementary information for\ndifferent image pairs. In this study, we propose a multi-scale dual attention\n(MDA) framework for infrared and visible image fusion, which is designed to\nmeasure and integrate complementary information in both structure and loss\nfunction at the image and patch level. In our method, the residual downsample\nblock decomposes source images into three scales first. Then, dual attention\nfusion block integrates complementary information and generates a spatial and\nchannel attention map at each scale for feature fusion. Finally, the output\nimage is reconstructed by the residual reconstruction block. Loss function\nconsists of image-level, feature-level and patch-level three parts, of which\nthe calculation of the image-level and patch-level two parts are based on the\nweights generated by the complementary information measurement. Indeed, to\nconstrain the pixel intensity distribution between the output and infrared\nimage, a style loss is added. Our fusion results perform robust and informative\nacross different scenarios. Qualitative and quantitative results on two\ndatasets illustrate that our method is able to preserve both thermal radiation\nand detailed information from two modalities and achieve comparable results\ncompared with the other state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments show the\neffectiveness of our information integration architecture and adaptively\nmeasure complementary information retention in the loss function.",

            "summary": "Despite its exceptional soft tissue contrast, Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) faces the challenge of long scanning times compared to other modalities\nlike X-ray radiography. Shortening scanning times is crucial in clinical\nsettings, as it increases patient comfort, decreases examination costs and\nimproves throughput. Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) and deep\nlearning allow accelerated MRI acquisition by reconstructing high-quality\nimages from undersampled data. While reconstruction algorithms have received\nmost of the focus, designing acquisition trajectories to optimize\nreconstruction quality remains an open question. This thesis explores two\napproaches to address this gap in the context of Cartesian MRI. First, we\npropose two algorithms, lazy LBCS and stochastic LBCS, that significantly\nimprove upon G\\\"ozc\\\"u et al.'s greedy learning-based CS (LBCS) approach. These\nalgorithms scale to large, clinically relevant scenarios like multi-coil 3D MR\nand dynamic MRI, previously inaccessible to LBCS. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat generative adversarial networks (GANs) can serve as a natural criterion\nfor adaptive sampling by leveraging variance in the measurement domain to guide\nacquisition. Second, we delve into the underlying structures or assumptions\nthat enable mask design algorithms to perform well in practice. Our experiments\nreveal that state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, while\ncapable of adaptation and long-horizon planning, offer only marginal\nimprovements over stochastic LBCS, which is neither adaptive nor does long-term\nplanning. Altogether, our findings suggest that stochastic LBCS and similar\nmethods represent promising alternatives to deep RL. They shine in particular\nby their scalability and computational efficiency and could be key in the\ndeployment of optimized acquisition trajectories in Cartesian MRI.",

Therefore, text-to-image models for\ninterior design are required to have outstanding prompt-following capabilities,\nas well as iterative collaboration with design professionals to achieve the\ndesired outcome. In this paper, we collect and optimize text-image data in the\ndesign field and continue training in both English and Chinese on the basis of\nthe open-source CLIP model.

            "summary": "In this article, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of some black\nholes, namely AdS Reissner Nordstrom (R-N), AdS Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB),\nand AdS Einstein-power-Yang-Mills (EPYM), from different frameworks:\nbulk-boundary (BB) and restricted phase space (RPS). Using the generalized\noff-shell Helmholtz free energy method, we calculate the thermodynamic topology\nof the selected black holes in each space separately and determine their\ntopological classifications. We show that the addition of GB terms, dimensions,\nand other factors do not affect the topological classes of black holes in both\nspaces. The calculations and plots indicate that the AdS R-N and AdS EGB black\nholes show similar behavior and their topological numbers sets in both spaces,\ni.e., BB and RPS, are similar and equal to ($W=+1$). However, AdS EPYM black\nholes show an interesting behavior. In addition to BBT and RPS, we also\nconsider the extended phase space thermodynamics (EPST) and evaluate the\nthermodynamic topology for AdS EPYM black hole. The changing ($r-\\tau$) in both\nspaces shows similar behavior. Also, the topological number and the total\ntopological numbers for this black hole in the BB, RPS and EPS thermodynamics\nare completely same, i,e., $(\\omega_{BBT}=\\omega_{RPS}=\\omega_{EPST}=+1, -1)$\nor $W_{BBT}=W_{RPS}=W_{EPST}=0$. An important point is that the\nEinstein-Yang-Mills black hole has thermodynamic topology equivalence in three\nspaces. The present result may be due to the non-linear YM charge parameter and\nthe difference between the gauge and gravity corrections in the above black\nholes",

            "summary": "Human intelligence and human consciousness emerge gradually during the\nprocess of cognitive development. Understanding this development is an\nessential aspect of understanding the human mind and may facilitate the\nconstruction of artificial minds with similar properties. Importantly, human\ncognitive development relies on embodied interactions with the physical and\nsocial environment, which is perceived via complementary sensory modalities.\nThese interactions allow the developing mind to probe the causal structure of\nthe world. This is in stark contrast to common machine learning approaches,\ne.g., for large language models, which are merely passively ``digesting'' large\namounts of training data, but are not in control of their sensory inputs.\nHowever, computational modeling of the kind of self-determined embodied\ninteractions that lead to human intelligence and consciousness is a formidable\nchallenge. Here we present MIMo, an open-source multi-modal infant model for\nstudying early cognitive development through computer simulations. MIMo's body\nis modeled after an 18-month-old child with detailed five-fingered hands. MIMo\nperceives its surroundings via binocular vision, a vestibular system,\nproprioception, and touch perception through a full-body virtual skin, while\ntwo different actuation models allow control of his body.

            "summary": "This paper explores the emerging knowledge-driven autonomous driving\ntechnologies. Our investigation highlights the limitations of current\nautonomous driving systems, in particular their sensitivity to data bias,\ndifficulty in handling long-tail scenarios, and lack of interpretability.\nConversely, knowledge-driven methods with the abilities of cognition,\ngeneralization and life-long learning emerge as a promising way to overcome\nthese challenges. This paper delves into the essence of knowledge-driven\nautonomous driving and examines its core components: dataset \\& benchmark,\nenvironment, and driver agent. By leveraging large language models, world\nmodels, neural rendering, and other advanced artificial intelligence\ntechniques, these components collectively contribute to a more holistic,\nadaptive, and intelligent autonomous driving system. The paper systematically\norganizes and reviews previous research efforts in this area, and provides\ninsights and guidance for future research and practical applications of\nautonomous driving. We will continually share the latest updates on\ncutting-edge developments in knowledge-driven autonomous driving along with the\nrelevant valuable open-source resources at:\n\\url{https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/awesome-knowledge-driven-AD}.",

            "summary": "Learning scene graphs from natural language descriptions has proven to be a\ncheap and promising scheme for Scene Graph Generation (SGG). However, such\nunstructured caption data and its processing are troubling the learning an\nacurrate and complete scene graph. This dilema can be summarized as three\npoints. First, traditional language parsers often fail to extract meaningful\nrelationship triplets from caption data. Second, grounding unlocalized objects\nin parsed triplets will meet ambiguity in visual-language alignment. Last,\ncaption data typically are sparse and exhibit bias to partial observations of\nimage content. These three issues make it hard for the model to generate\ncomprehensive and accurate scene graphs. To fill this gap, we propose a simple\nyet effective framework, GPT4SGG, to synthesize scene graphs from holistic and\nregion-specific narratives. The framework discards traditional language parser,\nand localize objects before obtaining relationship triplets. To obtain\nrelationship triplets, holistic and dense region-specific narratives are\ngenerated from the image. With such textual representation of image data and a\ntask-specific prompt, an LLM, particularly GPT-4, directly synthesizes a scene\ngraph as \"pseudo labels\". Experimental results showcase GPT4SGG significantly\nimproves the performance of SGG models trained on image-caption data. We\nbelieve this pioneering work can motivate further research into mining the\nvisual reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",

In a nondegenerate three-level laser coupled to a\ntwo-mode squeezed vacuum reservoir, we examine, under realistic experimental\nconditions, the Gaussian steering of two laser modes, $\\mathcal{A}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}$, generated within the cascade transitions, respectively. We find\nthat the $\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{B}$ steerability is always higher\nthan that from $\\mathcal{B}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}$; in addition, the steering\nasymmetry cannot exceed $\\ln 2$, which implies that the state\n$\\hat{\\varrho}_{\\mathcal{AB}}$ never diverges to an extremal asymmetry state.\nWe show how squeezed noise can play a constructive role in realizing one-way\nsteering. As the main result, we demonstrate that the state\n$\\hat{\\varrho}_{\\mathcal{AB}}$ can exhibit one-way steering solely from\n$\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{B}$, which we show to emerge as a consequence\nof the fact that the intensity difference of the modes $\\mathcal{A}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}$ is verified to remain always positive, irrespective of the\nphysical and environmental parameters of $\\hat{\\varrho}_{\\mathcal{AB}}$.

We generalize the drift-plus-penalty framework, a\nprimal-dual stochastic gradient method developed for the i.i.d. case, to the\nMarkov chain sampling setting. We propose two variants of drift-plus-penalty;\none is for the case when the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain is\nknown while the other is for the case of unknown mixing time. In fact, our\nalgorithms apply to a more general setting of constrained online convex\noptimization where the sequence of constraint functions follows a Markov chain.\nBoth algorithms are adaptive in that the first works without knowledge of the\ntime horizon while the second uses AdaGrad-style algorithm parameters, which is\nof independent interest.

We present experiments and theory on soft hydraulic knots formed by\ninterlinked microfluidic devices comprising two intersecting channels separated\nby a thin elastomeric membrane.

To explain our observations, we develop a\nmathematical model based on lubrication theory coupled with tension-dominated\nmembrane deflections that compares favorably to our experimental data.

At the same time, topological defects are being\nidentified across a diverse range of biological systems and are points of\nlocalized mechanical stress. It is therefore important to ask how mechanical\nstress localization around topological defects is controlled. Here, we use\ncontinuum simulations of nonequilibrium, fluctuating and active nematics to\nexplore the patterns of stress localization, as well as their extent and\nintensity around topological defects. We find that by increasing the\norientational elasticity of the material, the isotropic stress pattern around\ntopological defects is changed substantially from a stress dipole characterized\nby symmetric compression-tension regions around the core of the defect to a\nlocalized stress monopole at the defect position. Moreover, we show that\nelastic anisotropy alters the extent and intensity of the stresses, and can\nresult in the dominance of tension or compression around defects. Finally,\nincluding both nonequilibrium fluctuations and active stress generation, we\nfind that the elastic constant tunes the relative effect of each, leading to\nthe flipping of tension and compression regions around topological defects.\nThis flipping of the tension-compression regions only by changing the elastic\nconstant presents an interesting, simple, way of switching the dynamic behavior\nin active matter by changing a passive material property. We expect these\nfindings to motivate further exploration tuning stresses in active biological\nmaterials by varying material properties of the constituent units.",

Consequently,\nmanipulating DLOs poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving large\ndeformations that require highly accurate global models. To address these\nchallenges, this paper presents MultiAC6: a new multi Actor-Critic framework\nfor robot action space decomposition to control large 3D deformations of DLOs.\nIn our approach, two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents orient and\nposition a robot gripper to deform a DLO into the desired shape. Unlike\nprevious DRL-based studies, MultiAC6 is able to solve the sim-to-real gap,\nachieving large 3D deformations up to 40 cm in real-world settings.\nExperimental results also show that MultiAC6 has a 66\\% higher success rate\nthan a single-agent approach.

While the interchain-intraorbital pair\ncorrelations exhibit a slow power-law decay in both orbitals, the interorbital\npair correlation also develops due to the hybridization via interorbital\nhopping. These intra and interorbital pair correlations are enhanced by Hund's\ncoupling, but more importantly, the interorbital pairing correlation develops\neven without Hund's coupling, where apparent interorbital pairing glue is\nabsent.

Motivated by\nthe classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditional\ncontext pairs based on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that the\nautoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way.\nNotably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlighted\ntokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs. Our\napproach is compatible with current LLMs and VLMs, achieving impressive\ncustomized generation results without training. Experiments confirm its\neffectiveness in focusing on input contexts and generating reliable content.\nWithout tuning on LLaVA-v1.5, our method secured 69.5 in the MMBench test and\n1552.5 in MME-perception.

In this paper, we study the\nappearance of the regular black hole without mass inflation, which violates the\nstrong cosmic censorship conjecture. Since the Cauchy horizon is stable, the\nphotons entering the two horizons of the regular black hole in the preceding\ncompanion universe can come out from the white hole in our universe. These rays\ncreate a novel multi-ring structure, which is significantly different from the\nimage of the Schwarzschild black hole.

The non-linear alternating current (AC) power flow\nequations that model different physical laws (together with operational\nconstraints) lay the foundation for the feasibility region of the OPF problem.\nWhile significant research has focused on convex relaxations, which are\napproaches to solve an OPF problem by enlarging the true feasibility region,\nthe opposite approach of convex restrictions offers valuable insights as well.\nConvex restrictions, including polyhedral restrictions, reduce the true\nfeasible region to a convex region, ensuring that it contains only feasible\npoints. In this work, we develop a sequential optimization method that offers a\nscalable way to obtain (bounds on) solutions to OPF problems for distribution\nnetworks. To do so, we first develop sufficient conditions for the existence of\nfeasible power flow solutions in the neighborhood of a specific (feasible)\noperating point in distribution networks, and second, based on these\nconditions, we construct a polyhedral restriction of the feasibility region.\nOur numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the sequential optimization\nmethod as an alternative to existing approaches to obtain (bounds on) solutions\nto OPF problems for distribution networks. By construction, the optimization\nproblems can be solved in polynomial time and are guaranteed to have feasible\nsolutions.",

Artificial intelligence offers a promising\navenue for flow field solving. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning\nframework for rapidly reconstructing airfoil flow fields. Channel attention and\nspatial attention modules are utilized in the downsampling stage of the UNet to\nenhance the feature learning capabilities of the deep learning model.\nAdditionally, integrating the predicted flow field values generated by the deep\nlearning model into the NS equation solver validates the credibility of the\nflow field prediction results. The NACA series airfoils were used to validate\nthe prediction accuracy and generalization of the deep learning model. The\nexperimental results represent the deep learning model achieving flow field\nprediction speeds three orders of magnitude faster than CFD solver.\nFurthermore, the CFD solver integrated with deep learning model demonstrates a\nthreefold acceleration compared to CFD solver. By extensively mining historical\nflow field data, an efficient solution is derived for the rapid simulation of\naircraft flow fields.",

We employ\nsemi-analytical General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) computations to\nstudy the emission from the accretion flow around LQBHs. Our findings indicate\nthat the increase of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effects results in an\nenlargement of the rings from LQBHs, thereby causing a more circular\npolarization pattern in the shadow images. We make comparisons with the Event\nHorizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr\\,A$^*$ and M\\,87$^*$, which enable\nus to determine an upper limit for the polymetric function $P$ in LQG. The\nupper limit for Sgr\\,A$^*$ is $0.2$, while for M\\,87$^*$ it is $0.07$. Both\nblack holes exhibit a preference for a relatively high spin ($a\\gtrsim0.5$ for\nSgr\\,A$^*$ and $0.5\\lesssim a \\lesssim 0.7$ for M\\,87$^*$). The constraints for\nSgr\\,A$^*$ are based on black hole spin and ring diameter, whereas for\nM\\,87$^*$, the constraints are further tightened by the polarimetric pattern.\nIn essence, our simulations provide observational constraints on the effect of\nLQG in supermassive black holes (SMBH), providing the most consistent\ncomparison with observation.",

Analytical\nmodeling of the buckling of miniaturized pillars is especially important due to\nthe difficulties in conducting experiments. Here, a well-posed stress-driven\nnonlocal model is developed, which allows the calculation of the critical loads\nand buckling configurations of the miniaturized pillars on an elastic\nfoundation and with arbitrary numbers of edge cracks. The discontinuities in\nbending slopes and deflection at the damaged cross-sections due to the edge\ncracks are captured through the incorporation of both rotational and\ntranslational springs. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to investigate the\ninstability of pillars containing a range of one to four cracks. This analysis\nreveals interesting effects regarding the influence of crack location,\nnonlocality, and elastic foundation on the initial and subsequent critical\nloads and associated buckling configurations. The main findings are: (i) the\nshielding and amplification effects related to a system of cracks become more\nsignificant as the dimensions of pillars reduce, (ii) the influence of the\nshear force at the damaged cross-section related to the translational spring\nmust not be neglected when dealing with higher modes of buckling and long\ncracks, (iii) an elastic foundation decreases the effects of the cracks and\nsize dependency on the buckling loads, and (iv) the effects of the edge cracks\non the critical loads and buckling configurations of the miniaturized pillars\nare highly dependent on the boundary conditions.",

            "summary": "Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the\nbroadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple\nfractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in\nsharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently\nshown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling\nmay display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named\nQD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic,\nnon-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the\ninformation propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is\nentangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the\ndistribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an\nenvironment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the\nfraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two\nsimilar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a\nnoisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We\nderive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we\nanalyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD,\nintermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The\nencoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero\ncorrelation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be\nprobed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction,\nwhich becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The\nQD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must\nbe probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry\nbreaking in the replica space.",

We present a custom\njoin-ordering optimization applicable at multiple stages during query\ncompilation and execution.

We demonstrate FedSplit\nenjoyers a faster convergence speed than the standard federated learning method\nboth theoretically and empirically. The generalization bound of the FedSplit\nmethod is also studied. To practically implement the proposed method on real\ndatasets, factor analysis is introduced to facilitate the decoupling of hidden\nelements. This leads to a practically implemented model for FedSplit and we\nfurther refer to as FedFac.

            "summary": "The magnetization manipulation by spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in\nnonmagnetic-metal (NM)/ferromagnet (FM) heterostructures has provided great\nopportunities for spin devices. Besides the conventional spin Hall effect (SHE)\nin heavy metals with strong spin-orbit coupling, the orbital currents have been\nproposed to be another promising approach to generate strong SOTs. Here, we\nsystematically study the SOTs efficiency and its dependence on the FM thickness\nand different NM/FM interfaces in two prototypical Pt/Py and Ta/Py systems by\ninserting an ultrathin magnetic layer (0.4 nm thick ML = Co, Fe, Gd, and Ni).\nThe dampinglike (DL) torque efficiency $\\xi_{DL}$ is significantly enhanced by\ninserting ultrathin Co, Fe, and Ni layers and is noticeably suppressed for the\nGd insertion. Moreover, the Ni insertion results in a sign change of the\nfield-like (FL) torque in Pt/Py and substantially reduces $\\xi_{DL}$ in Ta/Py.\nThese results are likely related to the additional spin currents generated by\ncombining the orbital Hall effect (OHE) in the NM and orbital-to-spin\nconversion in the ML insertion layer and/or their interfaces, especially for\nthe Ni insertion. Our results demonstrate that inserting ultrathin ML can\neffectively manipulate the strength and sign of the SOTs, which would be\nhelpful for spintronics applications.",

A heuristic picture based on coherently flipping `superdipoles'\nwith disordered internal structure has been argued to capture the essence of\nthe experimentally reported behavior, pointing to the key role of effectively\ndisordered interactions in structural glasses. We test these ideas by devising\nan explicit one-dimensional model of interacting spins incorporating both the\nspin-glass spirit of the superdipole argument, and the necessary long-time\ndecorrelation of structural disorder, encoded here in a slow dynamics of the\ncoupling constants. The frequency-dependent third-order response of the model\nqualitatively reproduces the typical humped shape reported in experiments. The\ntemperature dependence of the maximum value is also qualitatively reproduced.\nIn contrast, the humped shape of the third-order response is not reproduced by\na simple kinetically constrained spin model with non-interacting spins. To\nrationalize these results, we propose a two-length-scale scenario by\ndistinguishing between the characteristic length of dynamical heterogeneities\nand a coherence length that monitors the effect of interactions. We show that\nboth length scales are identical in the kinetically constrained spin model,\nwhile they have significantly different dynamics in the model of interacting\nspins.",

The proposed method establishes a\nmulti-agricultural machinery task allocation model by combining the path\npre-planning of a simulated annealing algorithm and the static task allocation\nof a genetic algorithm. By sequentially fusing these two algorithms, their\nrespective shortcomings can be overcome, and their advantages in global and\nlocal search can be utilised. Consequently, the search capability of the\npopulation is enhanced, leading to the discovery of more optimal solutions.\nThen, an adaptive crossover operator is constructed according to the task\nassignment model, considering the capacity, path cost, and time of agricultural\nmachinery; two-segment coding and multi-population adaptive mutation are used\nto assign tasks to improve the diversity of the population and enhance the\nexploration ability of the population; and to improve the global optimisation\nability of the hybrid algorithm, a 2-Opt local optimisation operator and an\nCircle modification algorithm are introduced. Finally, simulation experiments\nwere conducted in MATLAB to evaluate the performance of the multi-agricultural\nmachinery collaborative task assignment based on the improved genetic hybrid\nalgorithm. The algorithm's capabilities were assessed through comparative\nanalysis in the simulation trials. The results demonstrate that the developed\nhybrid algorithm can effectively reduce path costs, and the efficiency of the\nassignment outcomes surpasses that of the classical genetic algorithm.

            "summary": "During the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the ultraviolet radiation from the\nfirst stars and galaxies ionised the neutral hydrogen of the intergalactic\nmedium, which can emit radiation through its 21 cm hyperfine transition. This\n21 cm signal is a direct probe of the first light sources in the early\nUniverse. Measuring the 21 cm power spectrum is a key science goal for the\nfuture Square Kilometre Array (SKA), however, observing and interpreting it is\na challenging task. Another high-potential probe of the EoR is the patchy\nkinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (pkSZ), observed as a foreground to the\nprimary cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies on small scales.\nDespite recent promising measurements by ground-based telescopes, placing\nconstraints on reionization from pkSZ observations is a non-trivial task,\nsubject to strong model dependence.\n  In this work, we propose to alleviate the difficulties in observing and\ninterpreting the 21 cm and pkSZ power spectra by combining them. With a simple\nyet effective parametric model that establishes a formal connection between\nthem, we are able to jointly fit mock 21 cm and pkSZ data points. We confirm\nthat these two observables provide complementary information on reionization,\nleading to significantly improved constraints when combined. We demonstrate\nthat with as few as two measurements of the 21 cm power spectrum with 100 hours\nof observations with the SKA, as well as a single $\\ell=3000$ pkSZ data point,\nwe can reconstruct the reionization history of the Universe and its morphology.\nWe find that the reionization global history (morphology) is better constrained\nwith two 21 cm measurements at different redshifts (scales). Therefore, a\ncombined analysis of the two probes will give access to tighter constraints on\ncosmic reionization even in the early stages of 21 cm detections.",

            "summary": "Cosmological studies have now entered Stage IV according to the Dark Energy\nTask Force prescription, thanks to new missions (Euclid, Rubin Observatory,\nSRG/eROSITA) that are expected to provide the required ultimate accuracy in the\ndark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS). However, none of these projects have\nthe power to systematically unveil the galaxy cluster population at $z>1$.\nThere therefore remains the need for an ATHENA-like mission to run independent\ncosmological investigations and scrutinise the consistency between the results\nfrom the $0<z<1$ and $1<z<2$ epochs. We study the constraints on the DE EoS and\non primordial non-Gaussanities for typical X-ray cluster surveys executed by\nATHENA. We consider two survey designs: 50 deg$^2$ at 80ks (survey A) and 200\ndeg$^2$ at 20ks (survey B). We analytically derive cluster counts in a space of\nobservable properties, and predict the cosmological potential of the\ncorresponding samples with a Fisher analysis. The achieved depth allows us to\nunveil the halo mass function down to the group scale out to $z=2$. We predict\nthe detection of thousands of clusters down to a few 10$^{13} h^{-1}\nM_{\\odot}$, in particular 940 and 1400 clusters for surveys A and B,\nrespectively, at $z>1$. Such samples will allow a detailed modelling of the\nevolution of cluster physics along with a standalone cosmological analysis. Our\nresults suggest that survey B has the optimal design as it provides greater\nstatistics. Remarkably, high-$z$ clusters, despite representing 15% or less of\nthe full samples, allow a significant reduction of the uncertainty on the\ncosmological parameters: $\\Delta w_a$ is reduced by a factor of 2.3 and $\\Delta\nf_{NL}^{loc}$ by a factor of 3. Inventorying the high-$z$ X-ray cluster\npopulation can play a crucial role in ensuring overall cosmological\nconsistency. This will be the major aim of future new-generation ATHENA-like\nmissions.",

This feature\nis crucial to accurately model and manage real-world data and information as\nemerged in various contexts, such as the smooth movement of video game\ncharacters, the 3D movement of mechanical arms, and data streamed by sensors.\nNevertheless, extending ASP in this direction, without affecting its\ndeclarative nature and its well-defined semantics, poses non-trivial\nchallenges; thus, no ASP system is able to reason natively with non-integer\ndomains. Indeed, the widespread floating-point arithmetic is not applicable to\nthe ASP case, as the reproducibility of results cannot be guaranteed and the\nsemantics of an ASP program would not be uniquely and declaratively determined,\nregardless of the employed machine or solver. To overcome such limitations and\nin the realm of pure ASP, this paper proposes an extension of ASP in which\nnon-integers are approximated to rational numbers, fully granting\nreproducibility and declarativity.

The only cases of isomorphic extensions which are\nnot almost automorphic are again due to Glasner and Downarowicz, who in the\nsame article provide a construction of such systems in a rather general\ntopological setting.\n  Here, we use the Anosov-Katok method in order to provide an alternative route\nto such examples and to show that these may be realised as smooth skew product\ndiffeomorphisms of the two-torus with an irrational rotation on the base.\nMoreover - and more importantly - a modification of the construction allows to\nensure that lifts of these diffeomorphism to finite covering spaces provide\nnovel examples of finite-to-one topomorphic extensions of irrational rotations.\nThese are still strictly ergodic and share the same dynamical eigenvalues as\nthe original system, but show an additional singular continuous component of\nthe dynamical spectrum.",

Existing works have considered the problem where either all\nagents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no\nsafety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis\nframework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal\ntemporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over the system and uncontrollable\nstochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to\nconstruct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that\nare valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we reduce conservatism\nand increase data efficiency compared to existing works by constructing a\nnormalized prediction region over all agents and time steps. We then formulate\na worst-case mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent\nrealizations within the prediction region to obtain control inputs that\nprovably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently\nsolve this MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of\nthe original one. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case\nstudies.",

Given that the quantum information is encoded in a state of a\nsystem of distinguishable particles, and given that the shared bi-partite\nentangled state is also that of a system of distinguishable particles, the\noptimal teleportation fidelity of the shared state is known to be\n$(F_{max}d+1)/(d+1)$ with $F_{max}$ being the `maximal singlet fraction' of the\nshared state. In the present work, we address the question of optimal\nteleportation fidelity given that the quantum information to be teleported is\nencoded in Fermionic modes while a $2N$-mode state of a system of Fermions\n(with maximum $2N$ no. of Fermions -- in the second quantization language) is\nshared between the sender and receiver with each party possessing $N$ modes of\nthe $2N$-mode state. Parity Superselection Rule (PSSR) in Fermionic Quantum\nTheory (FQT) puts constraint on the allowed set of physical states and\noperations, and thereby, leads to a different notion of Quantum Teleportation.\nDue to PSSR, we introduce restricted Clifford twirl operations that constitute\nthe Unitary 2-design in case of FQT, and show that the structure of the\ncanonical form of Fermionic invariant shared state differs from that of the\nisotropic state -- the corresponding canonical invariant form for teleportation\nin Standard Quantum Theory (SQT). We provide a lower bound on the optimal\nteleportation fidelity in FQT and compare the result with teleportation in SQT.\nSurprisingly, we find that, under separable measurements on a bipartite\nFermionic state, input and output states of the Fermionic teleportation channel\ncannot be distinguished operationally, even if a particular kind of resource\nstate with `maximal singlet fraction' being less than unity is used.",

CrackSAM exhibits\nremarkable superiority, particularly in challenging conditions such as dim\nlighting, shadows, road markings, construction joints, and other interference\nfactors.

The primary objective\nof this research is to address the aging effects of LiDAR sensors over the\nproduct life cycle, specifically focusing on aspects such as laser beam profile\ndeterioration, output power reduction and intrinsic parameter drift, which are\nmostly neglected in current sensor models. By that, this proceeding research is\nintended to path the way, not only towards identifying and modeling respective\ndegradation effects, but also to suggest quantitative model validation metrics.",

Although many fields have managed to include\nblockchain in their core functionalities, the adoption of blockchain, in\ngeneral, is constrained by the so-called trilemma trade-off between\ndecentralization, scalability, and security. In our previous work, we have\nshown that using a digital twin for dynamically managing blockchain systems\nduring runtime can be effective in managing the trilemma trade-off. Our Digital\nTwin leverages DDDAS feedback loop, which is responsible for getting the data\nfrom the system to the digital twin, conducting optimisation, and updating the\nphysical system.

Parameter tuning is\nformulated as a minimization problem of the deviation of the maneuvering motion\nsimulated with given parameters and the real-scale ship trials, and the global\nsolution is explored using CMA-ES. By constraining the exploration ranges to\nthe neighborhood of the previously determined parameter values, the proposed\nmethod limits the output in a realistic range. The proposed method is applied\nto the tuning of 12 parameters for a container ship with five different widths\nof the exploration range.

The Rost case is more complex than the Root case\nsince it naturally requires randomisation for general initial measures, and we\ndevelop the necessary tools to develop these solutions.

Diffusion models are an emerging class\nof deep generative models that show great potential regarding reconstruction\nfidelity. However, they face challenges in preserving intensity characteristics\nin the reconstructed images, limiting their performance in anomaly detection.\nTo address this challenge, we propose to condition the denoising mechanism of\ndiffusion models with additional information about the image to reconstruct\ncoming from a latent representation of the noise-free input image. This\nconditioning enables high-fidelity reconstruction of healthy brain structures\nwhile aligning local intensity characteristics of input-reconstruction pairs.\nWe evaluate our method's reconstruction quality, domain adaptation features and\nfinally segmentation performance on publicly available data sets with various\npathologies.

To probe the limit of such methods, we\ndesigned a universal readout error mitigation protocol based on quantum state\ntomography (QST), which estimates the density matrix of a quantum system, and\nquantum detector tomography (QDT), which characterizes the measurement\nprocedure. By treating readout error mitigation in the context of state\ntomography the method becomes largely device-, architecture-, noise source-,\nand quantum state-independent. We implement this method on a superconducting\nqubit and benchmark the increase in reconstruction fidelity for QST. We\ncharacterize the performance of the method by varying important noise sources,\nsuch as suboptimal readout signal amplification, insufficient resonator photon\npopulation, off-resonant qubit drive, and effectively shortened $T_1$ and $T_2$\ndecay times.

            "summary": "Satellite imagery solutions are widely used to study and monitor different\nregions of the Earth. However, a single satellite image can cover only a\nlimited area. In cases where a larger area of interest is studied, several\nimages must be stitched together to create a single larger image, called a\nmosaic, that can cover the area. Today, with the increasing number of satellite\nimages available for commercial use, selecting the images to build the mosaic\nis challenging, especially when the user wants to optimize one or more\nparameters, such as the total cost and the cloud coverage percentage in the\nmosaic. More precisely, for this problem the input is an area of interest,\nseveral satellite images intersecting the area, a list of requirements relative\nto the image and the mosaic, such as cloud coverage percentage, image\nresolution, and a list of objectives to optimize. We contribute to the\nconstraint and mixed integer lineal programming formulation of this new\nproblem, which we call the \\textit{satellite image mosaic selection problem},\nwhich is a multi-objective extension of the polygon cover problem. We propose a\ndataset of realistic and challenging instances, where the images were captured\nby the satellite constellations SPOT, Pl\\'eiades and Pl\\'eiades Neo. We\nevaluate and compare the two proposed models and show their efficiency for\nlarge instances, up to 200 images.",

The matching distance between persistent Betti\nnumbers functions (or rank invariants), is among the most studied metrics in\nthis context, particularly in 2-parameter persistence. The main reason for this\ninterest is that, in the 2-parameter case, the foliation method allows for an\neffective computation of the matching distance, based on filtering the space\nalong lines of positive slope. Our work provides a qualitative analysis, based\non a construction called extended Pareto grid, of the filtering lines that\nactually contribute to the computation of the matching distance. Under certain\ngenericity assumptions, we show that these lines must either be horizontal,\nvertical, of slope 1 or belong to a finite collection of special lines\nassociated with discontinuity phenomena.",

We will show how to change the\ntranslation, scaling, rotation, and also the shape of formation continuously by\nonly tuning the positions of the leaders in both 2-D and 3-D spaces, where the\nrotation of formation in 3-D space is realized by changing the yaw angle, pitch\nangle, and roll angle of formation sequentially. Compared with\nreal-Laplacian-based methods, the first advantage of the proposed\ncomplex-Laplacian-based approach is that each follower requires fewer neighbors\nand lesser communication. The second advantage is that non-convex and\nnon-generic nominal configurations are allowed and the uniqueness of the\ncomplex-constraint-based target formation can be guaranteed by the\nnon-collocated nominal agents. The third advantage is that more formation\nshapes can be realized by only tuning the positions of the leaders. Two\nsimulation examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.",

However, the lack of efficient models imposes a\nbarrier for the adoption of such models in resource-constrained environments.\nTherefore, smaller distilled models for the Spanish language could be proven to\nbe highly scalable and facilitate their further adoption on a variety of tasks\nand scenarios. In this work, we take one step in this direction by developing\nSpanishTinyRoBERTa, a compressed language model based on RoBERTa for efficient\nquestion answering in Spanish. To achieve this, we employ knowledge\ndistillation from a large model onto a lighter model that allows for a wider\nimplementation, even in areas with limited computational resources, whilst\nattaining negligible performance sacrifice. Our experiments show that the dense\ndistilled model can still preserve the performance of its larger counterpart,\nwhile significantly increasing inference speedup.

When executing MAPF plans in dynamic\nworkspaces, AGVs can be frequently delayed, e.g., due to encounters with humans\nor third-party vehicles. If the remainder of the AGVs keeps following their\nindividual plans, synchrony of the fleet is lost and some AGVs may pass through\nroadmap intersections in a different order than originally planned. Although\nthis could reduce the cumulative route completion time of the AGVs, generally,\na change in the original ordering can cause conflicts such as deadlocks. In\npractice, synchrony is therefore often enforced by using a MAPF execution\npolicy employing, e.g., an Action Dependency Graph (ADG) to maintain ordering.\nTo safely re-order without introducing deadlocks, we present the concept of the\nSwitchable Action Dependency Graph (SADG). Using the SADG, we formulate a\ncomparatively low-dimensional Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) that\nrepeatedly re-orders AGVs in a recursively feasible manner, thus maintaining\ndeadlock-free guarantees, while dynamically minimizing the cumulative route\ncompletion time of all AGVs. Various simulations validate the efficiency of our\napproach when compared to the original ADG method as well as robust MAPF\nsolution approaches.",

We\nshow that box operads, a rectangular type of operads introduced in\narXiv:2305.20036, constitute the correct framework to encode them and resolve\ntheir relations up to homotopy. Our first main result is a Koszul duality\ntheory for box operads, extending the duality for (nonsymmetric) operads. In\nthis new theory, the classical restriction of being quadratic is replaced by\nthe notion of being $\\textit{thin-quadratic}$, a condition referring to a\nparticular class of ``thin'' operations. Our main case of interest is the box\noperad $Lax$ encoding lax prestacks as algebras. We show that $Lax$ is not\nKoszul by explicitly computing its Koszul complex. We then go on to remedy the\nsituation by suitably restricting the Koszul dual box cooperad\n$Lax^{\\antishriek}$ to obtain our second main result: we establish a minimal\n(in particular cofibrant) model $Lax_{\\infty}$ for the box operad $Lax$\nencoding lax prestacks. This sheds new light on Markl's question on the\nexistence of a cofibrant model for the operad encoding presheaves of algebras\nfrom arXiv:math/0103052.

            "summary": "The Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Devices (EMCCD), owing to their high\nquantum efficiency and decent spatial resolution, are widely used to study\ntypical quantum optical phenomena such as spatial entanglement and related\napplications. Researchers have already developed a procedure that enables us to\nstatistically determine whether a pixel detects a single photon or not based on\nwhether its output is higher or lower than the estimated noise level. However,\nthese techniques are limited to extremely low photon numbers ( $\\approx 0.15$\nmean number of photons per pixel per exposure), allowing for at most one photon\nper pixel. This limitation hinders applications due to the large number of\nframes required for any study. In this work, we present a method to estimate\nthe mean rate of photons per pixel per frame for a specific exposure time.\nSubsequently, we make a statistical estimate of the number of photons ($\\geq\n1$) incident on each pixel. This allows us to effectively utilize the EMCCD as\na photon number resolving device, which significantly reduces the required\nexperimentation time. As evidence of our approach, we quantify contrast in\nquantum correlation exhibited by a pair of spatially entangled photons\ngenerated by Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion process. We employ the\nstandard methods commonly used within the scientific community for comparison\nwith our proposed method. We find an enhancement in the signal to noise ratio\nby about a factor of 3 for identical number of frames. This implies that this\ntechnique can achieve excellent results only within half the data collection\ntime as compared to the conventional techniques.",

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or software to\nmimic or even surpass human intelligence in a given cognitive task. While\nhumans learn by both induction and deduction, the success of current AI is\nrooted in induction, relying on its ability to detect statistical regularities\nin task input -- an ability learnt from a vast amount of training data using\nenormous computation resources. We examine the performance of such a\nstatistical AI in a human task through the lens of four factors, including task\nlearnability, statistical resource, computation resource, and learning\ntechniques, and then propose a three-phase visual framework to understand the\nevolving relation between AI and jobs. Based on this conceptual framework, we\ndevelop a simple economic model of competition to show the existence of an\ninflection point for each occupation. Before AI performance crosses the\ninflection point, human workers always benefit from an improvement in AI\nperformance, but after the inflection point, human workers become worse off\nwhenever such an improvement occurs. To offer empirical evidence, we first\nargue that AI performance has passed the inflection point for the occupation of\ntranslation but not for the occupation of web development. We then study how\nthe launch of ChatGPT, which led to significant improvement of AI performance\non many tasks, has affected workers in these two occupations on a large online\nlabor platform. Consistent with the inflection point conjecture, we find that\ntranslators are negatively affected by the shock both in terms of the number of\naccepted jobs and the earnings from those jobs, while web developers are\npositively affected by the very same shock. Given the potentially large\ndisruption of AI on employment, more studies on more occupations using data\nfrom different platforms are urgently needed.",

            "summary": "The present paper is concerned with the integral of the absolute value of a\nBrownian motion with drift. By establishing an asymptotic expansion of the\nspace Laplace transform, we obtain series representations for the probability\ndensity function and cumulative distribution function of the integral, making\nuse of Meijer's G-function. A functional recursive formula is derived for the\nmoments, which is shown to yield only exponentials and Gauss' error function up\nto arbitrary orders, permitting exact computations. In order to obtain sharp\nasymptotic estimates for small- and large-deviation probabilities, we employ a\nmarginal space-time Laplace transform and apply a newly developed generalized\nLaplace's method to exponential Airy integrals. The impact of drift on the\ncomplete distribution of the integral is explored in depth. The new formulae\ncomplement existing ones in the standard Brownian motion case to great extent\nin terms of both theoretical generality and modeling capacity and have been\npresented for easy implementation, which numerical experiments demonstrate.",

            "summary": "Feature selection on incomplete datasets is an exceptionally challenging\ntask. Existing methods address this challenge by first employing imputation\nmethods to complete the incomplete data and then conducting feature selection\nbased on the imputed data. Since imputation and feature selection are entirely\nindependent steps, the importance of features cannot be considered during\nimputation. However, in real-world scenarios or datasets, different features\nhave varying degrees of importance. To address this, we propose a novel\nincomplete data feature selection framework that considers feature importance.\nThe framework mainly consists of two alternating iterative stages: the M-stage\nand the W-stage. In the M-stage, missing values are imputed based on a given\nfeature importance vector and multiple initial imputation results. In the\nW-stage, an improved reliefF algorithm is employed to learn the feature\nimportance vector based on the imputed data. Specifically, the feature\nimportance vector obtained in the current iteration of the W-stage serves as\ninput for the next iteration of the M-stage. Experimental results on both\nartificially generated and real incomplete datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms other approaches significantly.",

In order\nto address this problem, we present Augmentation-free Dense Contrastive\nKnowledge Distillation (Af-DCD), a new contrastive distillation learning\nparadigm to train compact and accurate deep neural networks for semantic\nsegmentation applications. Af-DCD leverages a masked feature mimicking\nstrategy, and formulates a novel contrastive learning loss via taking advantage\nof tactful feature partitions across both channel and spatial dimensions,\nallowing to effectively transfer dense and structured local knowledge learnt by\nthe teacher model to a target student model while maintaining training\nefficiency.

            "summary": "Data-driven learning-based control methods such as reinforcement learning\n(RL) have become increasingly popular with recent proliferation of the machine\nlearning paradigm. These methods address the parameter sensitiveness and\nunmodeled dynamics in model-based controllers, such as finite control-set model\npredictive control. RL agents are typically utilized in simulation\nenvironments, where they are allowed to explore multiple \"unsafe\" actions\nduring the learning process. However, this type of learning is not applicable\nto online self-learning of controllers in physical power converters, because\nunsafe actions would damage them. To address this, this letter proposes a safe\nonline RL-based control framework to autonomously find the optimal switching\nstrategy for the power converters, while ensuring system safety during the\nentire self-learning process. The proposed safe online RL-based control is\nvalidated in a practical testbed on a two-level voltage source converter\nsystem, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

It aims at transmitting the extracted\ninformation rather than the original data, which receivers will try to recover.\nIntuitively, the larger extracted information, the longer latency of semantic\ncommunication will be. Besides, larger extracted information will result in\nmore accurate reconstructed information, thereby causing a higher utility of\nthe semantic communication system. Shorter latency and higher utility are\ndesirable objectives for the system, so there will be a trade-off between\nutility and latency. This paper proposes a joint optimization algorithm for\ntotal latency and utility. Moreover, security is essential for the semantic\ncommunication system. We incorporate the secrecy rate, a physical-layer\nsecurity method, into the optimization problem. The secrecy rate is the\ncommunication rate at which no information is disclosed to an eavesdropper.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm obtains the best\njoint optimization performance compared to the baselines.",

            "summary": "Video Motion Magnification (VMM) aims to break the resolution limit of human\nvisual perception capability and reveal the imperceptible minor motion that\ncontains valuable information in the macroscopic domain. However, challenges\narise in this task due to photon noise inevitably introduced by photographic\ndevices and spatial inconsistency in amplification, leading to flickering\nartifacts in static fields and motion blur and distortion in dynamic fields in\nthe video. Existing methods focus on explicit motion modeling without\nemphasizing prioritized denoising during the motion magnification process. This\npaper proposes a novel dynamic filtering strategy to achieve static-dynamic\nfield adaptive denoising. Specifically, based on Eulerian theory, we separate\ntexture and shape to extract motion representation through inter-frame shape\ndifferences, expecting to leverage these subdivided features to solve this task\nfinely. Then, we introduce a novel dynamic filter that eliminates noise cues\nand preserves critical features in the motion magnification and amplification\ngeneration phases. Overall, our unified framework, EulerMormer, is a pioneering\neffort to first equip with Transformer in learning-based VMM. The core of the\ndynamic filter lies in a global dynamic sparse cross-covariance attention\nmechanism that explicitly removes noise while preserving vital information,\ncoupled with a multi-scale dual-path gating mechanism that selectively\nregulates the dependence on different frequency features to reduce spatial\nattenuation and complement motion boundaries. We demonstrate extensive\nexperiments that EulerMormer achieves more robust video motion magnification\nfrom the Eulerian perspective, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods.

            "summary": "In estimating the average treatment effect in observational studies, the\ninfluence of confounders should be appropriately addressed. To this end, the\npropensity score is widely used. If the propensity scores are known for all the\nsubjects, bias due to confounders can be adjusted by using the inverse\nprobability weighting (IPW) by the propensity score. Since the propensity score\nis unknown in general, it is usually estimated by the parametric logistic\nregression model with unknown parameters estimated by solving the score\nequation under the strongly ignorable treatment assignment (SITA) assumption.\nViolation of the SITA assumption and/or misspecification of the propensity\nscore model can cause serious bias in estimating the average treatment effect.\nTo relax the SITA assumption, the IPW estimator based on the outcome-dependent\npropensity score has been successfully introduced. However, it still depends on\nthe correctly specified parametric model and its identification. In this paper,\nwe propose a simple sensitivity analysis method for unmeasured confounders. In\nthe standard practice, the estimating equation is used to estimate the unknown\nparameters in the parametric propensity score model. Our idea is to make\ninference on the average causal effect by removing restrictive parametric model\nassumptions while still utilizing the estimating equation. Using estimating\nequations as constraints, which the true propensity scores asymptotically\nsatisfy, we construct the worst-case bounds for the average treatment effect\nwith linear programming. Different from the existing sensitivity analysis\nmethods, we construct the worst-case bounds with minimal assumptions. We\nillustrate our proposal by simulation studies and a real-world example.",

In human activity recognition, this pretext task employed a masking\nstrategy centered on the time dimension. However, this masking strategy fails\nto fully exploit the inherent characteristics of wearable sensor data and\noverlooks the inter-channel information coupling, thereby limiting its\npotential as a powerful pretext task. To address these limitations, we propose\na novel masking strategy called Channel Masking. It involves masking the sensor\ndata along the channel dimension, thereby compelling the encoder to extract\nchannel-related features while performing the masked reconstruction task.\nMoreover, Channel Masking can be seamlessly integrated with masking strategies\nalong the time dimension, thereby motivating the self-supervised model to\nundertake the masked reconstruction task in both the time and channel\ndimensions. Integrated masking strategies are named Time-Channel Masking and\nSpan-Channel Masking. Finally, we optimize the reconstruction loss function to\nincorporate the reconstruction loss in both the time and channel dimensions.

To overcome these limitations, we leverage\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to represent videos, conducting stylization in\nthe rendered feature space. Our innovative approach involves the simultaneous\nrepresentation of both the human subject and the surrounding scene using two\nNeRFs. This dual representation facilitates the animation of human subjects\nacross various poses and novel viewpoints. Specifically, we introduce a novel\ngeometry-guided tri-plane representation, significantly enhancing feature\nrepresentation robustness compared to direct tri-plane optimization. Following\nthe video reconstruction, stylization is performed within the NeRFs' rendered\nfeature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nstrikes a superior balance between stylized textures and temporal coherence,\nsurpassing existing approaches.

Recent studies in self-supervised learning have\nshown their potential in learning rich representations without relying on\nlabels, yet they fall short in learning disentangled embeddings and addressing\nissues of inductive bias (e.g., transformation-invariance). To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose TimeDRL, a generic multivariate time-series\nrepresentation learning framework with disentangled dual-level embeddings.\nTimeDRL is characterized by three novel features: (i) disentangled derivation\nof timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings from patched time-series data\nusing a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) utilization of timestamp-predictive and\ninstance-contrastive tasks for disentangled representation learning, with the\nformer optimizing timestamp-level embeddings with predictive loss, and the\nlatter optimizing instance-level embeddings with contrastive loss; and (iii)\navoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases, such as\ntransformation-invariance from cropping and masking. Comprehensive experiments\non 6 time-series forecasting datasets and 5 time-series classification datasets\nhave shown that TimeDRL consistently surpasses existing representation learning\napproaches, achieving an average improvement of forecasting by 57.98% in MSE\nand classification by 1.25% in accuracy. Furthermore, extensive ablation\nstudies confirmed the relative contribution of each component in TimeDRL's\narchitecture, and semi-supervised learning evaluations demonstrated its\neffectiveness in real-world scenarios, even with limited labeled data.",

            "summary": "After more than five years of development, we present a new version of Dark\nSage, a semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation that breaks the mould for\nmodels of its kind. Included among the major changes is an overhauled treatment\nof stellar feedback that is derived from energy conservation, operates on local\nscales, affects gas gradually over time rather than instantaneously, and\npredicts a mass-loading factor for every galaxy, which is a first for a SAM.\nBuilding on the model's resolved angular-momentum structure of galaxies, we now\nconsider the heating of stellar discs, delivering predictions for disc\nstructure both radially and vertically, another SAM first. We add a further\ndimension to stellar discs by tracking the distribution of stellar ages in each\nannulus. Each annulus--age bin has its own velocity dispersion and metallicity\nevolved in the model. This allows Dark Sage to make structural predictions for\ngalaxies that previously only hydrodynamic simulations could. We present the\nmodel as run on the merger trees of the highest-resolution gravity-only\nsimulation of the MillenniumTNG suite. Despite its additional complexity\nrelative to other SAMs, Dark Sage only has three free parameters, the least of\nany SAM, which we calibrate exclusively against the cosmic star formation\nhistory and the $z=0$ stellar and HI mass functions using a particle-swarm\noptimisation method. The Dark Sage codebase, written in C and Python, is\npublicly available at https://github.com/arhstevens/DarkSage",

This paper presents the Federated Learning-based Intrusion Detection\nSystem (FL-IDS), an innovative approach designed to improve FANET security.\nFL-IDS leverages federated learning to address privacy concerns of centralized\nintrusion detection systems. FL-IDS operates in a decentralized manner,\nenabling UAVs to collaboratively train a global intrusion detection model\nwithout sharing raw data. Local models are assigned to each UAV, using\nclient-specific data, and only updated model weights are shared with a central\nserver. This preserves privacy while utilizing collective intelligence for\neffective intrusion detection. Experimental results show FL-IDS's competitive\nperformance with Central IDS (C-IDS) while mitigating privacy concerns. The\nBias Towards Specific Clients (BTSC) method further enhances FL-IDS\nperformance, surpassing C-IDS even at lower attacker ratios. A comparative\nanalysis with traditional intrusion detection methods, including Local IDS\n(L-IDS), provides insights into FL-IDS's strengths.

Recent studies by Hatta and Zhou, however, show\nthat gluon generalized parton distribution (GPD) $E_g$, which is associated\nwith spin-flip processes, exhibits the Regge behavior identical to the BFKL\nPomeron. This was done by deriving the small-$x$ evolution equation for the\nreal part of $F$-type spin-flip gluon GTMDs $F_{1,2}$. In this article, we have\nshown that though the evolution equation for ${\\rm Re}(F_{1,2})$ has IR poles -\nthey all mutually cancel - making the equation IR finite and self-consistent.\nWe also have analytically solved the equations in the dilute regime and find\nsmall-$x$ asymptotics of the GTMDs ${\\rm Re}(F_{1,2})$ as \\begin{eqnarray} {\\rm\nRe}(F_{1,2}) \\sim \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha_s\\left(4\\ln2-8/3\\right)}\n\\left(\\cos 3\\phi_{k\\Delta} +\\cos \\phi_{k\\Delta}\\right). \\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray} Interestingly, the surviving solution corresponds to conformal\nspin $n=2$ and carries an explicit $\\cos 3\\phi_{k\\Delta} + \\cos \\phi_{k\\Delta}$\nazimuthal dependence. As the imaginary part of $F_{1,2}$, is related to the\nspin-dependent odderon or Gluon Siver function and scales as ${\\rm Im}(F_{1,2})\n\\sim x^{0}$, the positive intercept for ${\\rm Re}(F_{1,2})$, implies that it is\nexpected to dominate over the gluon Siver function in the small-$x$ limit - and\nmay directly impact the modeling of unpolarised GTMDs and associated spin-flip\nprocesses.",

            "summary": "Here, we design a novel class of Janus structures PbXY(X,Y = F, Cl, Br, I)\nand propose it for the solar mediated photocatalytic water splitting hydrogen\nproduction as well as for the photovoltaic solarcell applications. Charge\nanalysis shows that covalent bonding for less electronegative atoms and ionic\nbonding for more electronegative atoms. Strong dual bonding like ionic one side\nand covalent other side is observed when heavy and lighter atoms are part of\nthe same Janus structures. The as designed Janus structures show good dynamical\nstability through phonon calculations. Basic electronic structure using\nGeneralised Gradient Approximation(GGA) reveal both direct and indirect nature\nof band gap with large tunability. Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) electronic\nstructure calculations are performed and wider band gaps are predicted for\nthese Janus structures. The calculated effective masses of charge carriers show\nrobust charge carrier dynamics. The orbital resolved electronic density of\nstates (DOS) shows that the conduction band edge is composed of pz orbital of\nPb atom. The partialcharge density calculated at conduction band minimum (CBM)\nalso support the result obtained from PDOS analysis. Breaking of\ncentrosymmetry, polarization in the out of plane direction, the z-oriented\norbitals of CBM all points that these materials are suitable for shift current\ngeneration. The calculated optical absorption spectra show that the Janus\nstructures are suitable for visible light absorption. The calculated potential\ndifference between the top and bottom layer show significant variation and\nmaximum (1.02 eV) is observed for PbClF. Further, we show that combining both\npotential difference and HSE bandgap, valence band maximum(VBM) and CBM\nstraddle the water redox potentials, thus making the Janus structures suitable\nfor water redox reactions.",

            "summary": "Human behavior anomaly detection aims to identify unusual human actions,\nplaying a crucial role in intelligent surveillance and other areas. The current\nmainstream methods still adopt reconstruction or future frame prediction\ntechniques. However, reconstructing or predicting low-level pixel features\neasily enables the network to achieve overly strong generalization ability,\nallowing anomalies to be reconstructed or predicted as effectively as normal\ndata. Different from their methods, inspired by the Student-Teacher Network, we\npropose a novel framework called the Multilevel Guidance-Exploration\nNetwork(MGENet), which detects anomalies through the difference in high-level\nrepresentation between the Guidance and Exploration network. Specifically, we\nfirst utilize the pre-trained Normalizing Flow that takes skeletal keypoints as\ninput to guide an RGB encoder, which takes unmasked RGB frames as input, to\nexplore motion latent features. Then, the RGB encoder guides the mask encoder,\nwhich takes masked RGB frames as input, to explore the latent appearance\nfeature. Additionally, we design a Behavior-Scene Matching Module(BSMM) to\ndetect scene-related behavioral anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShanghaiTech\nand UBnormal datasets, with AUC of 86.9 % and 73.5 %, respectively.

            "summary": "Infants' ability to recognize and categorize objects develops gradually. The\nsecond year of life is marked by both the emergence of more semantic visual\nrepresentations and a better understanding of word meaning. This suggests that\nlanguage input may play an important role in shaping visual representations.\nHowever, even in suitable contexts for word learning like dyadic play sessions,\ncaregivers utterances are sparse and ambiguous, often referring to objects that\nare different from the one to which the child attends. Here, we systematically\ninvestigate to what extent caregivers' utterances can nevertheless enhance\nvisual representations. For this we propose a computational model of visual\nrepresentation learning during dyadic play. We introduce a synthetic dataset of\nego-centric images perceived by a toddler-agent that moves and rotates toy\nobjects in different parts of its home environment while hearing caregivers'\nutterances, modeled as captions. We propose to model toddlers' learning as\nsimultaneously aligning representations for 1) close-in-time images and 2)\nco-occurring images and utterances. We show that utterances with statistics\nmatching those of real caregivers give rise to representations supporting\nimproved category recognition. Our analysis reveals that a small\ndecrease/increase in object-relevant naming frequencies can drastically impact\nthe learned representations. This affects the attention on object names within\nan utterance, which is required for efficient visuo-linguistic alignment.\nOverall, our results support the hypothesis that caregivers' naming utterances\ncan improve toddlers' visual representations.",

            "summary": "Egocentric sensors such as AR/VR devices capture human-object interactions\nand offer the potential to provide task-assistance by recalling 3D locations of\nobjects of interest in the surrounding environment. This capability requires\ninstance tracking in real-world 3D scenes from egocentric videos (IT3DEgo). We\nexplore this problem by first introducing a new benchmark dataset, consisting\nof RGB and depth videos, per-frame camera pose, and instance-level annotations\nin both 2D camera and 3D world coordinates. We present an evaluation protocol\nwhich evaluates tracking performance in 3D coordinates with two settings for\nenrolling instances to track: (1) single-view online enrollment where an\ninstance is specified on-the-fly based on the human wearer's interactions. and\n(2) multi-view pre-enrollment where images of an instance to be tracked are\nstored in memory ahead of time. To address IT3DEgo, we first re-purpose methods\nfrom relevant areas, e.g., single object tracking (SOT) -- running SOT methods\nto track instances in 2D frames and lifting them to 3D using camera pose and\ndepth. We also present a simple method that leverages pretrained segmentation\nand detection models to generate proposals from RGB frames and match proposals\nwith enrolled instance images. Perhaps surprisingly, our extensive experiments\nshow that our method (with no finetuning) significantly outperforms SOT-based\napproaches. We conclude by arguing that the problem of egocentric instance\ntracking is made easier by leveraging camera pose and using a 3D allocentric\n(world) coordinate representation.",

However, most existing GNNs follow the homophily assumption, where\nconnected nodes are more likely to exhibit similar feature distributions and\nthe same labels, and such an assumption has proven to be vulnerable in a\ngrowing number of practical applications. As a supplement, heterophily reflects\ndissimilarity in connected nodes, which has gained significant attention in\ngraph learning. To this end, data engineers aim to develop a powerful GNN model\nthat can ensure performance under both homophily and heterophily. Despite\nnumerous attempts, most existing GNNs struggle to achieve optimal node\nrepresentations due to the constraints of undirected graphs. The neglect of\ndirected edges results in sub-optimal graph representations, thereby hindering\nthe capacity of GNNs. To address this issue, we introduce AMUD, which\nquantifies the relationship between node profiles and topology from a\nstatistical perspective, offering valuable insights for \\underline{A}daptively\n\\underline{M}odeling the natural directed graphs as the \\underline{U}ndirected\nor \\underline{D}irected graph to maximize the benefits from subsequent graph\nlearning. Furthermore, we propose \\underline{A}daptive \\underline{D}irected\n\\underline{P}attern \\underline{A}ggregation (ADPA) as a new directed graph\nlearning paradigm for AMUD.

Specifically, we estimate the\ninstantaneous COVID-19 exponential growth rate for each U.S. county by using\nTLGRF that chooses an adaptive fitting window size based on relevant day-level\nand county-level features affecting the disease spread. Through transfer\nlearning, TLGRF can accurately estimate case growth rates for counties with\nsmall sample sizes. Out-of-sample prediction analysis shows that TLGRF\noutperforms established growth rate estimation methods. Furthermore, we\nconducted a case study based on outbreak case data from the state of Colorado\nand showed that the timely detection of outbreaks could have been improved by\nup to 224% using TLGRF when compared to the decisions made by Colorado's\nDepartment of Health and Environment (CDPHE). To facilitate implementation, we\nhave developed a publicly available outbreak detection tool for timely\ndetection of COVID-19 outbreaks in each U.S. county, which received substantial\nattention from policymakers.",

            "summary": "Finite element analysis of soft tissues is a well-developed method that\nallows estimation of mechanical quantities (e.g. stresses, strains). A\nconstitutive law has to be used to characterise the individual tissues. This is\ncomplex as biological tissues are generally visco-hyperelastic, anisotropic,\nand heterogenous. A specific characteristic, their nearly incompressibility,\nwas well reported in the literature, but very little effort has been made to\ncompare volume variations computed by the simulations with in vivo\nmeasurements. In the present study, volume changes of the fat pad during\ncontrolled indentations of the human heel region were estimated from segmented\nmedical images using digital volume correlation. Indentations were repeated\nwith high and mild intensity normal and shear loads. The experiment was\nreproduced using finite element modelling with several values of Poisson's\nratio for the fat pad, extracted from literature values (from 0.4500 to\n0.4999). Estimated fat pad volume changes were compared to the measured ones to\nassess the best value of Poisson's ratio in each indentation case. The impact\nof the Poisson's ratio on the Jacobian of the deformation gradient and the\nvolumetric strains was also computed. A single value of Poisson's ratio could\nnot fit all the indentation cases. Estimated volume changes were between 0.9 %\n- 11.7 % with a Poisson's ratio from 0.4500 to 0.4999. The best fit was\nobtained with a 0.4900 Poisson's ratio except for the high normal load where a\nvalue of 0.4999 resulted in less error. In conclusion, special care should be\ntaken when setting the Poisson's ratio as the resulting estimated deformations\nmay become unrealistic when the value is far from incompressible materials.",

The widely used dynamical mean-field\ntheory faces difficulty in solving quantum impurity models numerically. Hybrid\nquantum--classical algorithms such as variational quantum eigensolver emerge as\na potential solution for quantum impurity models. A common challenge in these\nalgorithms is the rapid growth of the number of variational parameters with the\nnumber of spin-orbitals in the impurity. In our approach to this problem, we\ndevelop compact ansatzes using a combination of two different strategies.\nFirst, we employ compact physics-inspired ansatz, $k$-unitary cluster Jastrow\nansatz, developed in the field of quantum chemistry. Second, we eliminate\nlargely redundant variational parameters of physics-inspired ansatzes\nassociated with bath sites based on physical intuition. This is based on the\nfact that a quantum impurity model with a star-like geometry has no direct\nhopping between bath sites. We benchmark the accuracy of these ansatzes for\nboth ground-state energy and dynamic quantities by solving typical quantum\nimpurity models with/without shot noise. The results suggest that we can\nmaintain the accuracy of ground-state energy while we drop the number of\nvariational parameters associated with bath sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat a moment expansion, when combined with the proposed ansatzes, can\ncalculate the imaginary-time Green's functions under the influence of shot\nnoise. This study demonstrates the potential for addressing complex impurity\nmodels in large-scale quantum simulations with fewer variational parameters\nwithout sacrificing accuracy.",

Subsequently, we introduce a novel approach called\nDAR (\\textbf{D}iscriminatively \\textbf{A}ligned \\textbf{R}ationalization),\nwhich utilizes an auxiliary module pretrained on the full input to\ndiscriminatively align the selected rationale and the original input.

Laboratory experiments show cost reductions of 12.3-23.2%\nfor the one-node MPC and 31.2-42.5% for the three-node MPC relative to the\nthermostatic controller. The performance of the one-node MPC is limited by\nsignificant plant-model mismatch, while the three-node formulation better\napproximates real-world dynamics and results in much more effective cost\nreduction and load shifting.

The spatial extension of the large-scale non-circular motions is\ncoincident with the bar, which undoubtedly confirms the presence of a\nnon-axisymmetric perturbation in the potential of NGC\\,1087. The oval\ndistortion is enhanced in CO due to its dynamically cold nature rather than in\n\\ha. We found that the kinematics in all phases including stellar, ionized and\nmolecular, can be described simultaneously by a model containing a bisymmetric\nperturbation; however, we find that an inflow model of gas along the bar major\naxis is also likely. Furthermore the molecular mass inflow rate associated can\nexplain the observed star formation rate in the bar.\n  This reinforces the idea that bars are mechanisms for transporting gas and\ntriggering star formation. This work contributes to our understanding of\nnon-axisymmetry in galaxies using the most sophisticated data so far.",

In a\nrecent discussion of this conjecture Narovlansky and Verlinde (NV) [6] came to\nconclusions which radically differ from those of RS. In particular these\nconclusions disagree by factors which diverge as $N \\to \\infty$. Among these is\na mismatch between the scaling of boundary entropy and bulk horizon area. In\nthis note, we point out differences in two key assumptions made by RS and NV\nwhich lead to these mismatches, and explain why we think the RS assumptions are\ncorrect. When the NV assumptions, which we believe are unwarranted, are\nreplaced by those of RS, the conclusions match both RS and the standard\nrelation between entropy and area.\n  In the process of discussing these, we will shed some light on: the various\nnotions of temperature that appear in the duality; the relationship between\nHamiltonian energy and bulk mass; and the location of bulk conical defect\nstates in the spectrum of DSSYK$_{\\infty}$.",

These devices interact using communication protocols like MQTT,\nBluetooth, and Wi-Fi. However, as MIoT devices proliferate, these networked\ndevices are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper focuses on the\nvulnerabilities present in the Message Queuing Telemetry and Transport (MQTT)\nprotocol. The MQTT protocol is prone to cyber-attacks that can harm the\nsystem's functionality. The memory-constrained MIoT devices enforce a\nlimitation on storing all data logs that are required for comprehensive network\nforensics. This paper solves the data log availability challenge by detecting\nthe attack in real-time and storing the corresponding logs for further analysis\nwith the proposed network forensics framework: MediHunt. Machine learning (ML)\ntechniques are the most real safeguard against cyber-attacks. However, these\nmodels require a specific dataset that covers diverse attacks on the MQTT-based\nIoT system for training. The currently available datasets do not encompass a\nvariety of applications and TCP layer attacks. To address this issue, we\nleveraged the usage of a flow-based dataset containing flow data for TCP/IP\nlayer and application layer attacks. Six different ML models are trained with\nthe generated dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the MediHunt framework\nin detecting real-time attacks. F1 scores and detection accuracy exceeded 0.99\nfor the proposed MediHunt framework with our custom dataset.",

To achieve this,\nwe adopt a projected-gradient based learning method, named as\nProjected-Gradient Unlearning (PGU), in which the model takes steps in the\northogonal direction to the gradient subspaces deemed unimportant for the\nretaining dataset, so as to its knowledge is preserved. By utilizing Stochastic\nGradient Descent (SGD) to update the model weights, our method can efficiently\nscale to any model and dataset size. We provide empirically evidence to\ndemonstrate that our unlearning method can produce models that behave similar\nto models retrained from scratch across various metrics even when the training\ndataset is no longer accessible.

We\ndub this effect the \"gyrotropic magnetic Hall effect\" (GMHE), in analogy with\nthe gyrotropic current achieved by rectifying the optical fields. Importantly,\nwe find that the GMHE conductivity is a reactive or dissipationless transport\ncoefficient, which is even under time-reversal symmetry. We reveal the \"Zeeman\nBerry curvature\" as the quantum origin of the GMHE, whose integral over all\nstates below the Fermi energy gives the GMHE conductivity. Furthermore, by\nsymmetry analysis, we show that the GMHE can appear in a wide range of\ntwo-dimensional materials. To demonstrate our proposal, we evaluate the GMHE\ncurrent in two-dimensional Rashba system and in the surface of topological\ninsulator, where a low-frequency magnetic field with a small amplitude can be\nconverted into a detectable Hall voltage.",

As the core of open-vocabulary understanding, alignment of\nvisual content with the semantics of unbounded text has become the bottleneck\nof this field. To address this challenge, recent works propose to utilize CLIP\nas an additional classifier and aggregate model predictions with CLIP\nclassification results. Despite their remarkable progress, performance of OVS\nmethods in relevant scenarios is still unsatisfactory compared with supervised\ncounterparts. We attribute this to the in-vocabulary embedding and\ndomain-biased CLIP prediction. To this end, we present a Semantic-assisted\nCAlibration Network (SCAN). In SCAN, we incorporate generalized semantic prior\nof CLIP into proposal embedding to avoid collapsing on known categories.\nBesides, a contextual shift strategy is applied to mitigate the lack of global\ncontext and unnatural background noise. With above designs, SCAN achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on all popular open-vocabulary segmentation\nbenchmarks.

Motivated by the strength of\nthis model, we for the first time pioneer an investigation into the\nidentification of the maximum relative fair clique in large-scale graphs. We\nintroduce a novel concept of colorful support, which serves as the foundation\nfor two innovative graph reduction techniques. These techniques effectively\nnarrow the graph's size by iteratively removing edges that do not belong to\nrelative fair cliques. Furthermore, a series of upper bounds of the maximum\nrelative fair clique size is proposed by incorporating consideration of vertex\nattributes and colors. The pruning techniques derived from these upper bounds\ncan significantly trim unnecessary search space during the branch-and-bound\nprocedure. Adding to this, we present a heuristic algorithm with a linear time\ncomplexity, employing both a degree-based greedy strategy and a colored\ndegree-based greedy strategy to identify a larger relative fair clique. This\nheuristic algorithm can serve a dual purpose by aiding in branch pruning,\nthereby enhancing overall search efficiency.

This method offers a more natural and flexible\napproach to human interaction with these systems compared to traditional text\ndescriptions or coordinates. However, the categorization of visual referring\nprompting remains undefined, and its impact on the performance of LMMs has yet\nto be formally examined. In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive\nanalysis of LMMs using a variety of visual referring prompting strategies. We\nintroduce a benchmark dataset called VRPTEST, comprising 3 different visual\ntasks and 2,275 images, spanning diverse combinations of prompt strategies.\nUsing VRPTEST, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight versions of\nprominent open-source and proprietary foundation models, including two early\nversions of GPT-4V. We develop an automated assessment framework based on\nsoftware metamorphic testing techniques to evaluate the accuracy of LMMs\nwithout the need for human intervention or manual labeling. We find that the\ncurrent proprietary models generally outperform the open-source ones, showing\nan average accuracy improvement of 22.70%; however, there is still potential\nfor improvement. Moreover, our quantitative analysis shows that the choice of\nprompt strategy significantly affects the accuracy of LMMs, with variations\nranging from -17.5% to +7.3%. Further case studies indicate that an appropriate\nvisual referring prompting strategy can improve LMMs' understanding of context\nand location information, while an unsuitable one might lead to answer\nrejection.

            "summary": "Recently, video generation has attracted massive attention and yielded\nnoticeable outcomes. Concerning the characteristics of video, multi-text\nconditioning incorporating sequential events is necessary for next-step video\ngeneration. In this work, we propose a novel multi-text video generation~(MTVG)\nby directly utilizing a pre-trained diffusion-based text-to-video~(T2V)\ngeneration model without additional fine-tuning. To generate consecutive video\nsegments, visual consistency generated by distinct prompts is necessary with\ndiverse variations, such as motion and content-related transitions. Our\nproposed MTVG includes Dynamic Noise and Last Frame Aware Inversion which\nreinitialize the noise latent to preserve visual coherence between videos of\ndifferent prompts and prevent repetitive motion or contents. Furthermore, we\npresent Structure Guiding Sampling to maintain the global appearance across the\nframes in a single video clip, where we leverage iterative latent updates\nacross the preceding frame. Additionally, our Prompt Generator allows for\narbitrary format of text conditions consisting of diverse events. As a result,\nour extensive experiments, including diverse transitions of descriptions,\ndemonstrate that our proposed methods show superior generated outputs in terms\nof semantically coherent and temporally seamless video.Video examples are\navailable in our project page: https://kuai-lab.github.io/mtvg-page.",

Although only a\nsmall fraction ($\\lesssim 1\\%$) of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs is\nrequired to explain such observations, these PBHs may play important roles in\nearly structure/star/galaxy formation. In this chapter, we combine\nsemi-analytical analysis and cosmological simulations to explore the possible\nimpact of PBHs on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, taking into\naccount two (competing) effects of PBHs: acceleration of structure formation\nand gas heating by BH accretion feedback. We find that the impact of\nstellar-mass PBHs (allowed by existing observational constraints) on primordial\nstar formation is likely minor, although they do alter the properties of the\nfirst star-forming halos/clouds and can potentially trigger the formation of\nmassive BHs, while supermassive PBHs serve as seeds of massive structures that\ncan explain the apparent overabundance of massive galaxies in recent\nobservations. Our tentative models and results call for future studies with\nimproved modeling of the interactions between PBHs, particle DM, and baryons to\nbetter understand the impact of PBHs on early star/galaxy/structure formation\nand their imprints in high-redshift observations.",

However, the\nwell-known and highly useful Babinet's principle, which relates the scattering\nof solid and inverse structures, is not strictly applicable for this dielectric\ncase as it is only valid for infinitesimally thin perfect electric conductors.\nHere, we show that Babinet's principle can be generalized to dielectric systems\nwithin certain boundaries, which we refer to as the quasi-Babinet principle and\ndemonstrate for spherical and more generically shaped Mie resonators.\nLimitations arise due to geometry-dependent terms as well as material frequency\ndispersion and losses.

How to design fair and neutral simulation studies is therefore of\ngreat interest for both researchers developing new methods and practitioners\nconfronted with the choice of the most suitable method. The term simulation\nusually refers to parametric simulation, that is, computer experiments using\nartificial data made up of pseudo-random numbers. Plasmode simulation, that is,\ncomputer experiments using the combination of resampling feature data from a\nreal-life dataset and generating the target variable with a user-selected\noutcome-generating model (OGM), is an alternative that is often claimed to\nproduce more realistic data. We compare parametric and Plasmode simulation for\nthe example of estimating the mean squared error of the least squares estimator\nin linear regression. If the true underlying data-generating process (DGP) and\nthe OGM were known, parametric simulation would be the best choice in terms of\nestimating the MSE well. However, in reality, both are usually unknown, so\nresearchers have to make assumptions: in Plasmode simulation studies for the\nOGM, in parametric simulation for both DGP and OGM. Most likely, these\nassumptions do not reflect the truth. Here, we aim to find out how assumptions\ndeviating from the true DGP and the true OGM affect the performance of\nparametric simulation and Plasmode simulations in the context of MSE estimation\nfor the least squares estimator and in which situations which simulation type\nis preferable. Our results suggest that the preferable simulation method\ndepends on many factors, including the number of features, and how the\nassumptions of a parametric simulation differ from the true DGP. Also, the\nresampling strategy used for Plasmode influences the results. In particular,\nsubsampling with a small sampling proportion can be recommended.",

Classical spectral clustering measures the edge weights of\ngraph using pairwise Euclidean-based metric, and solves the optimal graph\npartition by relaxing the constraints of indicator matrix and performing\nLaplacian decomposition. However, Euclidean-based similarity might cause skew\ngraph cuts when handling non-spherical data distributions, and the relaxation\nstrategy introduces information loss. Meanwhile, spectral clustering requires\nspecifying the number of clusters, which is hard to determine without enough\nprior knowledge. In this work, we leverage the path-based similarity to enhance\nintra-cluster associations, and propose MeanCut as the objective function and\ngreedily optimize it in degree descending order for a nondestructive graph\npartition. This algorithm enables the identification of arbitrary shaped\nclusters and is robust to noise. To reduce the computational complexity of\nsimilarity calculation, we transform optimal path search into generating the\nmaximum spanning tree (MST), and develop a fast MST (FastMST) algorithm to\nfurther improve its time-efficiency. Moreover, we define a density gradient\nfactor (DGF) for separating the weakly connected clusters. The validity of our\nalgorithm is demonstrated by testifying on real-world benchmarks and\napplication of face recognition.

            "summary": "Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for downlink precoding\nat the base station (BS), especially for frequency FDD wideband massive MIMO\nsystems with OFDM. In FDD systems, CSI is attained through CSI feedback from\nthe user equipment (UE). However, large-scale antennas and large number of\nsubcarriers significantly increase CSI feedback overhead. Deep learning-based\nCSI feedback methods have received tremendous attention in recent years due to\ntheir great capability of compressing CSI. Nonetheless, large amounts of\ncollected samples are required to train deep learning models, which is severely\nchallenging in practice. Besides, with the rapidly increasing number of\nantennas and subcarriers, most of these deep learning methods' CSI feedback\noverhead also grow dramatically, owing to their focus on full-dimensional CSI\nfeedback. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a low-overhead\nIncorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI feedback Framework (IEFSF) for\nmassive MIMO systems. To further reduce the feedback overhead, a\nlow-dimensional eigenvector-based CSI matrix is first formed with the\nincorporation process at the UE, and then recovered to the full-dimensional\neigenvector-based CSI matrix at the BS via the extrapolation process. After\nthat, to alleviate the necessity of the extensive collected samples and enable\nfew-shot CSI feedback, we further propose a knowledge-driven data augmentation\nmethod and an artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) -based data\naugmentation method by exploiting the domain knowledge of wireless channels and\nby exploiting a novel generative model, respectively. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed IEFSF can significantly reduce CSI feedback\noverhead by 16 times compared with existing CSI feedback methods while\nmaintaining higher feedback accuracy using only several hundreds of collected\nsamples.",

Previous\nmethods estimate 2D-3D correspondences by matching point and pixel patterns\nlearned by neural networks, and use Perspective-n-Points (PnP) to estimate\nrigid transformation during post-processing. However, these methods struggle to\nmap points and pixels to a shared latent space robustly since points and pixels\nhave very different characteristics with patterns learned in different manners\n(MLP and CNN), and they also fail to construct supervision directly on the\ntransformation since the PnP is non-differentiable, which leads to unstable\nregistration results. To address these problems, we propose to learn a\nstructured cross-modality latent space to represent pixel features and 3D\nfeatures via a differentiable probabilistic PnP solver. Specifically, we design\na triplet network to learn VoxelPoint-to-Pixel matching, where we represent 3D\nelements using both voxels and points to learn the cross-modality latent space\nwith pixels. We design both the voxel and pixel branch based on CNNs to operate\nconvolutions on voxels/pixels represented in grids, and integrate an additional\npoint branch to regain the information lost during voxelization. We train our\nframework end-to-end by imposing supervisions directly on the predicted pose\ndistribution with a probabilistic PnP solver. To explore distinctive patterns\nof cross-modality features, we design a novel loss with adaptive-weighted\noptimization for cross-modality feature description.

            "summary": "We present a study of blue straggler stars (BSSs) of open cluster NGC 7142\nusing AstroSat/UVIT data and other archival data. Using a machine\nlearning-based algorithm, ML-MOC, on Gaia DR3 data, we find 546 sources as\ncluster members. Based on the location on the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, we\nidentify ten BSS candidates, also detected in UVIT/F148W filter. We study the\nvariable nature of BSSs by constructing their light curves using the TESS data.\nTwo BSSs reported as eclipsing binaries in Gaia DR3 are confirmed to be\neclipsing binaries based on our analysis and also show the presence of hot\ncompanions as per the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs).\nThe physical parameters of the hot companions of these two BSSs derived by\nfitting binary models to their light curves and those derived from the SEDs are\nfound to be in good agreement. Additionally, five more BSSs in the cluster\nshows UV excess, four of which are likely to have a hot companion based on\nSEDs. The hot companions with the estimated temperatures $\\sim$14000 $-$ 28000\nK, radii $\\sim$0.01 $-$ 0.05 R$_{\\odot}$, and luminosities $\\sim$0.03 $-$ 0.1\nL$_{\\odot}$, are inferred to be extremely low mass ($<$ 0.2 M$_{\\odot}$),\nlow-mass (0.2 $-$ 0.4 M$_{\\odot}$), normal-mass (0.4 $-$ 0.6 M$_{\\odot}$), and\nhigh-mass ($>$ 0.6 M$_{\\odot}$) white dwarfs (WD). For the first time in an\nopen cluster, we find the entire range of masses in WDs found as hot companions\nof BSSs. These masses imply that the Case-A/Case-B mass transfer as well as\nmerger are responsible for the formation of at least 60$\\%$ of the BSSs of this\ncluster.",

            "summary": "Individual trajectories, containing substantial information on\nhuman-environment interactions across space and time, is a crucial input for\ngeospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts, leveraging\ntrajectory data for various applications have overlooked the implicit\nspatial-temporal dependency within trajectories and failed to encode and\nrepresent it in a format friendly to deep learning, posing a challenge in\nobtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper\nproposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL)\nto formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory\nrepresentations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a\nweighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility\ninteractions over both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly\nencoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion) to learn entangled spatial-temporal\ndependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and\ntime information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility\nregularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories.\nTested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL\noutperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal\ndistributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal\ncorrelations. We also explore how spatial-temporal features presented in latent\nspace, validating that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This\nmethod is also transferable for general-purpose geospatial data representations\nfor broad downstream tasks, as well advancing GeoFMs developing.",

We consider a fluid queueing model\nthat facilitates explicit characterization of the queueing delay of packets,\nand establish explicit conditions on link rates that can minimize the average\nand maximum queueing delay in both single-hop and multi-stage (switching)\nnetworks. These min-delay conditions require maintaining an identical ratio\nbetween the ingress and egress rates of different nodes at the same layer of\nthe network. We term the policies that follow these conditions\nrate-proportional policies. We further generalize the rate-proportional\npolicies to queue-proportional policies, which minimize the queueing delay\nasymptotically based on the time-varying queue length while remaining agnostic\nof packet arrival rates. We validate that the proposed policies lead to minimum\nqueueing delay under various network topologies and settings, compared with\nbenchmarks including the backpressure policy that maximizes network throughput\nand the max-link-rate policy that fully utilizes bandwidth. We further remark\nthat the explicit min-delay policy design in multi-stage networks facilitates\nco-optimization with other metrics, such as minimizing total bandwidth,\nbalancing link utilization and node buffer usage.

            "summary": "With the constant spread of misinformation on social media networks, a need\nhas arisen to continuously assess the veracity of digital content. This need\nhas inspired numerous research efforts on the development of misinformation\ndetection (MD) models. However, many models do not use all information\navailable to them and existing research contains a lack of relevant datasets to\ntrain the models, specifically within the South African social media\nenvironment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the transferability of\nknowledge of a MD model between different contextual environments. This\nresearch contributes a multimodal MD model capable of functioning in the South\nAfrican social media environment, as well as introduces a South African\nmisinformation dataset. The model makes use of multiple sources of information\nfor misinformation detection, namely: textual and visual elements. It uses\nbidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the textual\nencoder and a residual network (ResNet) as the visual encoder. The model is\ntrained and evaluated on the Fakeddit dataset and a South African\nmisinformation dataset. Results show that using South African samples in the\ntraining of the model increases model performance, in a South African\ncontextual environment, and that a multimodal model retains significantly more\nknowledge than both the textual and visual unimodal models. Our study suggests\nthat the performance of a misinformation detection model is influenced by the\ncultural nuances of its operating environment and multimodal models assist in\nthe transferability of knowledge between different contextual environments.\nTherefore, local data should be incorporated into the training process of a\nmisinformation detection model in order to optimize model performance.",

            "summary": "Retrieving spatial information and understanding the semantic information of\nthe surroundings are important for Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) semantic segmentation.\nIn the application of autonomous driving, autonomous vehicles need to be aware\nof their surroundings to drive safely. However, current BEV semantic\nsegmentation techniques, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and\ntransformers, have difficulties in obtaining the global semantic relationships\nof the surroundings at the early layers of the network. In this paper, we\npropose to incorporate a novel Residual Graph Convolutional (RGC) module in\ndeep CNNs to acquire both the global information and the region-level semantic\nrelationship in the multi-view image domain. Specifically, the RGC module\nemploys a non-overlapping graph space projection to efficiently project the\ncomplete BEV information into graph space. It then builds interconnected\nspatial and channel graphs to extract spatial information between each node and\nchannel information within each node (i.e., extract contextual relationships of\nthe global features). Furthermore, it uses a downsample residual process to\nenhance the coordinate feature reuse to maintain the global information. The\nsegmentation data augmentation and alignment module helps to simultaneously\naugment and align BEV features and ground truth to geometrically preserve their\nalignment to achieve better segmentation results. Our experimental results on\nthe nuScenes benchmark dataset demonstrate that the RGC network outperforms\nfour state-of-the-art networks and its four variants in terms of IoU and mIoU.\nThe proposed RGC network achieves a higher mIoU of 3.1% than the best\nstate-of-the-art network, BEVFusion. Code and models will be released.",

In this work, we investigate the merging history of massive\ngalaxies at $3 < z < 6$ using a well-developed semi-analytic galaxy formation\ncatalogue. We find that the major merger rate increases with redshift up to 3\nand then flattens. The fraction of wet mergers, during which the sum of the\ncold gas mass is higher than the sum of the stellar mass in two merging\ngalaxies, also increases from $\\sim$ 34\\% at $z = 0$ to 96\\% at $z = 3$.\nInterestingly, almost all major mergers are wet at $z > 3$ . This can be\nattributed to the high fraction ($> 50\\%$) of cold gas at $z > 3$. In addition,\nwe study some special systems of massive merging galaxies at $3 < z < 6$,\nincluding the massive gas-rich major merging systems and extreme dense\nproto-clusters, and investigate the supermassive black hole-dark matter halo\nmass relation and dual AGNs. We find that the galaxy formation model reproduces\nthe incidence of those observed massive galaxies, but fails to reproduce the\nrelation between the supermassive black hole mass and the dark matter halo mass\nat $z \\sim 6$. The latter requires more careful estimates of the supermassive\nblack hole masses observationally. Otherwise, it could suggest modifications of\nthe modeling of the supermassive black hole growth at high redshifts.",

            "summary": "The escalating size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has spurred a growing\nresearch interest in hosting and serving DNN models across multiple devices. A\nnumber of studies have been reported to partition a DNN model across devices,\nproviding device placement solutions. The methods appeared in the literature,\nhowever, either suffer from poor placement performance due to the exponential\nsearch space or miss an optimal placement as a consequence of the reduced\nsearch space with limited heuristics. Moreover, these methods have ignored the\nruntime inter-operator optimization of a computation graph when coarsening the\ngraph, which degrades the end-to-end inference performance. This paper presents\nMoirai that better exploits runtime inter-operator fusion in a model to render\na coarsened computation graph, reducing the search space while maintaining the\ninter-operator optimization provided by inference backends. Moirai also\ngeneralizes the device placement algorithm from multiple perspectives by\nconsidering inference constraints and device heterogeneity.Extensive\nexperimental evaluation with 11 large DNNs demonstrates that Moirai outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art counterparts, i.e., Placeto, m-SCT, and GETF, up to\n4.28$\\times$ in reduction of the end-to-end inference latency.

The ability to precisely predict protein thermostability\nis pivotal for various subfields and applications in biochemistry, including\ndrug development, protein evolution analysis, and enzyme synthesis. Despite the\nproposition of multiple methodologies aimed at addressing this issue, few\napproaches have successfully achieved optimal performance coupled with high\ncomputational efficiency. Two principal hurdles contribute to the existing\nchallenges in this domain. The first is the complexity of extracting and\naggregating sufficiently representative features from proteins. The second\nrefers to the limited availability of experimental data for protein mutation\nanalysis, further complicating the comprehensive evaluation of model\nperformance on unseen data samples. With the advent of Large Language\nModels(LLM), such as the ESM models in protein research, profound\ninterpretation of protein features is now accessibly aided by enormous training\ndata. Therefore, LLMs are indeed to facilitate a wide range of protein\nresearch. In our study, we introduce an ESM-assisted efficient approach that\nintegrates protein sequence and structural features to predict the\nthermostability changes in protein upon single-point mutations. Furthermore, we\nhave curated a dataset meticulously designed to preclude data leakage,\ncorresponding to two extensively employed test datasets, to facilitate a more\nequitable model comparison.",

We derive the local energy density of GWs in the galaxy\ncluster induced by the instaneous oscillation of ULDP in the PDMFs. These\nstochastic local GWs exhibit a pulse-like spectrum, with frequency depending on\nthe mass of the ULDP, and can be detected in Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) or\nfuture space-based interferometers.

A bi-directional\ndistillation, including forward and backward distillations, is carried out\nwithin the framework, where the former forward distills the 2D predictions to\nthe student network, and the latter improves the quality of the 2D predictions,\nwhich subsequently enhances the final 3D part segmentation.

A simple conditional\ngenerative model, based on the minGPT architecture, can effectively generate\ncandidate polymers that exhibit a mean ionic conductivity that is significantly\ngreater than those in the original training set. This approach, coupled with\nmolecular dynamics simulations for validation and a specifically designed\nacquisition mechanism, allows the platform to refine its output iteratively.\nNotably, after the first iteration, we observed an increase in both the mean\nand the lower bound of the ionic conductivity of the new polymer candidates.\nThe platform's effectiveness is underscored by the identification of 19 polymer\nrepeating units, each displaying a computed ionic conductivity surpassing that\nof Polyethylene Oxide (PEO). The discovery of these polymers validates the\nplatform's efficacy in identifying potential polymer materials. Acknowledging\ncurrent limitations, future work will focus on enhancing modeling techniques,\nvalidation processes, and acquisition strategies, aiming for broader\napplicability in polymer science and machine learning.",

We designed and built a pico-hydroelectric\nsystem in a remote rural Himalayan village. We developed a Prioritized Load\nControl System (PLCS) that diverts excess electrical power to useful purposes\nsuch as heating up bath water and the air in the community center when the\nelectrical demand from the village is low; instead of dumping the excess\nelectricity back into the river in the form of heat. A critical part of the\nPLCS system is the failsafe mechanism where the turbines and electrical\ncomponents on the grid are protected in case any part of the PLCS system stops\nfunctioning, possibly intermittently. Our novel failsafe system contains the\nfollowing enhancements compared to previous systems: (1) adjustable threshold\nvoltage, (2) controllable fractional power diversion with adjustable\nparameters, (3) automatic reset with adjustable parameters. In addition, the\nfailsafe subsystem uses the widely available Arduino platform and programming\nenvironment, and JSON for human readable and writable communications,\ndemonstrating their suitability for critical applications.",

The NLD simulation allows the brief natural-language\ndescription to control the object interactions, significantly reducing the\nhuman efforts for creating a large amount of interaction data. To facilitate\nthe research of NLD simulation, we collect the Language-to-Interaction(L2I)\nbenchmark dataset with 120,000 natural-language descriptions of object\ninteractions in 6 common types of road topologies. Each description is\nassociated with the programming code, which the graphic render can use to\nvisually reconstruct the object interactions in the virtual scenes. As a\nmethodology contribution, we design SimCopilot to translate the interaction\ndescriptions to the renderable code.

Even early dark\nenergy (EDE) models, initially considered the most promising for alleviating\nthe Hubble tension, fall short of addressing the issue without exacerbating\nother tensions, such as the $S_8$ tension. Considering that a negative dark\nmatter (DM) equation of state (EoS) parameter is conducive to reduce the value\nof $\\sigma_8$ parameter, in this paper, we extend the axion-like EDE model in\nthis paper by replacing the cold dark matter (CDM) with DM characterized by a\nconstant EoS $w_{\\rm dm}$ (referred as WDM hereafter). We then impose\nconstraints on this axion-like EDE extension model, along with three other\nmodels: the axion-like EDE model, $\\Lambda$WDM, and $\\Lambda$CDM. These\nconstraints are derived from a comprehensive analysis incorporating data from\nthe Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations\n(BAO), the Pantheon compilation, as well as a prior on $H_0$ (i.e.,\n$H_0=73.04\\pm1.04$, based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al.) and\na Gaussianized prior on $S_8$ (i.e., $S_8=0.766\\pm0.017$, determined through\nthe joint analysis of KID1000+BOSS+2dLenS).

            "summary": "Stable diffusion is the mainstay of the text-to-image (T2I) synthesis in the\ncommunity due to its generation performance and open-source nature. Recently,\nStable Diffusion XL (SDXL), the successor of stable diffusion, has received a\nlot of attention due to its significant performance improvements with a higher\nresolution of 1024x1024 and a larger model. However, its increased computation\ncost and model size require higher-end hardware(e.g., bigger VRAM GPU) for\nend-users, incurring higher costs of operation. To address this problem, in\nthis work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion model for text-to-image\nsynthesis obtained by distilling the knowledge of SDXL. To this end, we first\nperform an in-depth analysis of the denoising U-Net in SDXL, which is the main\nbottleneck of the model, and then design a more efficient U-Net based on the\nanalysis. Secondly, we explore how to effectively distill the generation\ncapability of SDXL into an efficient U-Net and eventually identify four\nessential factors, the core of which is that self-attention is the most\nimportant part. With our efficient U-Net and self-attention-based knowledge\ndistillation strategy, we build our efficient T2I models, called KOALA-1B &\n-700M, while reducing the model size up to 54% and 69% of the original SDXL\nmodel. In particular, the KOALA-700M is more than twice as fast as SDXL while\nstill retaining a decent generation quality. We hope that due to its balanced\nspeed-performance tradeoff, our KOALA models can serve as a cost-effective\nalternative to SDXL in resource-constrained environments.",

We reveal that a\ngalaxy's morphology -- reflecting its formation history, particularly\naccretions and mergers -- is a far better determinant of the sSFR.\nConsequently, we suggest that galaxy formation models which regulate the sSFR\nprimarily through BH feedback prescriptions or bulge-regulated disc\nfragmentation consider acquisitions and mergers which establish the galaxy\nmorphology. We additionally make several new observations regarding current\n($z\\sim0$) star-formation rates. (i) Galaxies with little to no star formation\nhave bulges with an extensive range of stellar masses; bulge mass does not\ndictate presence/absence on the `star-forming main sequence'. (ii) The (wet\nmerger)-built, dust-rich S0 galaxies are the `green valley' bridging population\nbetween elliptical galaxies on the `red sequence' and spiral galaxies on the\nblue star-forming main sequence. (iii) The dust-poor S0 galaxies are not on the\nstar-forming main sequence nor in the `green valley'. Instead, they wait in the\nfield for gas accretion and/or minor mergers to transform them into spiral\ngalaxies. Mid-infrared sample selection can miss these (primordial) low\ndust-content and low stellar-luminosity S0 galaxies. Finally, the appearance of\nthe quasi-triangular-shaped galaxy-assembly sequence, previously dubbed the\nTriangal, which tracks the morphological evolution of galaxies, is revealed in\nthe sSFR-(stellar mass) diagram.",

            "summary": "We argue that time series analysis is fundamentally different in nature to\neither vision or natural language processing with respect to the forms of\nmeaningful self-supervised learning tasks that can be defined. Motivated by\nthis insight, we introduce a novel approach called \\textit{Series2Vec} for\nself-supervised representation learning. Unlike other self-supervised methods\nin time series, which carry the risk of positive sample variants being less\nsimilar to the anchor sample than series in the negative set, Series2Vec is\ntrained to predict the similarity between two series in both temporal and\nspectral domains through a self-supervised task. Series2Vec relies primarily on\nthe consistency of the unsupervised similarity step, rather than the intrinsic\nquality of the similarity measurement, without the need for hand-crafted data\naugmentation. To further enforce the network to learn similar representations\nfor similar time series, we propose a novel approach that applies\norder-invariant attention to each representation within the batch during\ntraining. Our evaluation of Series2Vec on nine large real-world datasets, along\nwith the UCR/UEA archive, shows enhanced performance compared to current\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised techniques for time series. Additionally, our\nextensive experiments show that Series2Vec performs comparably with fully\nsupervised training and offers high efficiency in datasets with limited-labeled\ndata. Finally, we show that the fusion of Series2Vec with other representation\nlearning models leads to enhanced performance for time series classification.\nCode and models are open-source at\n\\url{https://github.com/Navidfoumani/Series2Vec.}",

Stable diffusion is an outstanding\nmodel series that paves the way for producing high-resolution images with\nthorough details from text prompts or reference images. It will be an\ninteresting topic about how to leverage the capability of stable diffusion to\nelevate the image variations of certain categories (e.g., vehicles, humans, and\ndaily objects); particularly, it has the potential to gain improvements for\nsmall datasets with image-sparse categories. This study utilized seven\ncategories in the popular COCO dataset and three widespread weed species in\nMichigan to evaluate the efficiency of a recent version of stable diffusion. In\ndetail, Stable diffusion was used to generate synthetic images belonging to\nthese classes; then, YOLOv8 models were trained based on these synthetic\nimages, whose performance was compared to the models trained on original\nimages. In addition, several techniques (e.g., Image-to-image translation,\nDreambooth, ControlNet) of Stable diffusion were leveraged for image generation\nwith different focuses. In spite of the overall results being disappointing,\npromising results have been achieved in some classes, illustrating the\npotential of stable diffusion models to improve the performance of detection\nmodels, which represent more helpful information being conveyed into the models\nby the generated images.

Model-free offline RL penalizes the Q value for\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data or constrains the policy closed to the behavior\npolicy to tackle this problem, but this inhibits the exploration of the OOD\nregion. Model-based offline RL, which uses the trained environment model to\ngenerate more OOD data and performs conservative policy optimization within\nthat model, has become an effective method for this problem. However, the\ncurrent model-based algorithms rarely consider agent robustness when\nincorporating conservatism into policy. Therefore, the new model-based offline\nalgorithm with a conservative Bellman operator (MICRO) is proposed. This method\ntrades off performance and robustness via introducing the robust Bellman\noperator into the algorithm. Compared with previous model-based algorithms with\nrobust adversarial models, MICRO can significantly reduce the computation cost\nby only choosing the minimal Q value in the state uncertainty set. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MICRO outperforms prior RL algorithms in offline\nRL benchmark and is considerably robust to adversarial perturbations.",

The state-of-the-art solutions on ER rely on\npre-trained language models (PLMs), which require fine-tuning on a lot of\nlabeled matching/non-matching entity pairs. Recently, large languages models\n(LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown the ability to perform many tasks without\ntuning model parameters, which is known as in-context learning (ICL) that\nfacilitates effective learning from a few labeled input context demonstrations.\nHowever, existing ICL approaches to ER typically necessitate providing a task\ndescription and a set of demonstrations for each entity pair and thus have\nlimitations on the monetary cost of interfacing LLMs. To address the problem,\nin this paper, we provide a comprehensive study to investigate how to develop a\ncost-effective batch prompting approach to ER. We introduce a framework BATCHER\nconsisting of demonstration selection and question batching and explore\ndifferent design choices that support batch prompting for ER. We also devise a\ncovering-based demonstration selection strategy that achieves an effective\nbalance between matching accuracy and monetary cost. We conduct a thorough\nevaluation to explore the design space and evaluate our proposed strategies.\nThrough extensive experiments, we find that batch prompting is very\ncost-effective for ER, compared with not only PLM-based methods fine-tuned with\nextensive labeled data but also LLM-based methods with manually designed\nprompting.

This paper investigates novel index-based feedback\nmechanisms that aim at reducing the beamforming feedback overhead in Wi-Fi\nlinks. The proposed methods mitigate the overhead by generating a set of\ncandidate beamforming vectors using an unsupervised learning-based framework.\nThe amount of feedback information required is thus reduced by using the index\nof the candidate as feedback instead of transmitting the entire beamforming\nmatrix. We explore several methods that consider different representations of\nthe data in the candidate set. In particular, we propose five different ways to\ngenerate and represent the candidate sets that consider the covariance matrices\nof the channel, serialize the feedback matrix, and account for the effective\ndistance, among others. Additionally, we also discuss the implications of using\npartial information in the compressed beamforming feedback on the link\nperformance and compare it with the newly proposed index-based methods.\nExtensive IEEE 802.11 standard-compliant simulation results show that the\nproposed methods effectively minimize the feedback overhead, enhancing the\nthroughput while maintaining an adequate link performance.",

This is especially important for small-scale, turbulent dynamo\nprocesses, which are known to be sensitive to the effects of compression. To\ncontrol the viscous properties of the compressible modes, we perform\nsupersonic, visco-resistive dynamo simulations with additional bulk viscosity\n$\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$, deriving a new $\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$ Reynolds number $\\rm{Re}_{\\rm\nbulk}$, and viscous Prandtl number $\\rm{P}\\nu \\equiv \\rm{Re}_{\\rm bulk} /\n\\rm{Re}_{\\rm shear}$, where $\\rm{Re}_{\\rm shear}$ is the shear viscosity\nReynolds number. For $10^{-3} \\leq \\rm{P}\\nu \\leq \\infty$, we explore a broad\nrange of statistics critical to the dynamo problem, including the integral and\nspectral energy ratios, growth rates, and the magnetic $E_{\\rm mag}(k)$ and\nkinetic $E_{\\rm kin}(k)$ energy spectrum. We derive a general framework for\ndecomposing $E_{\\rm mag}$ growth rates into incompressible and compressible\nterms via orthogonal tensor decompositions of $\\nabla\\otimes\\mathbf{v}$, where\n$\\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity. We find that compressible modes play a dual\nrole, growing and decaying $E_{\\rm mag}$, and that field-line stretching is the\nmain driver of growth, even in supersonic dynamos. In the absence of $\\nu_{\\rm\nbulk}$, compressible modes pile up on small-scales, creating an apparent\nspectral bottleneck, which disappears for $\\rm{P}\\nu \\approx 1$. As $\\rm{P}\\nu$\ndecreases, compressible modes are dissipated at increasingly larger scales, in\nturn suppressing incompressible modes through a coupling between viscosity\noperators. We emphasise the importance of further understanding the role of\n$\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$ in compressible astrophysical plasmas.",

            "summary": "Deep Graph Learning (DGL) has emerged as a crucial technique across various\ndomains. However, recent studies have exposed vulnerabilities in DGL models,\nsuch as susceptibility to evasion and poisoning attacks. While empirical and\nprovable robustness techniques have been developed to defend against graph\nmodification attacks (GMAs), the problem of certified robustness against graph\ninjection attacks (GIAs) remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce the node-aware bi-smoothing framework, which is the first certifiably\nrobust approach for general node classification tasks against GIAs. Notably,\nthe proposed node-aware bi-smoothing scheme is model-agnostic and is applicable\nfor both evasion and poisoning attacks. Through rigorous theoretical analysis,\nwe establish the certifiable conditions of our smoothing scheme. We also\nexplore the practical implications of our node-aware bi-smoothing schemes in\ntwo contexts: as an empirical defense approach against real-world GIAs and in\nthe context of recommendation systems. Furthermore, we extend two\nstate-of-the-art certified robustness frameworks to address node injection\nattacks and compare our approach against them. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed certificates.",

The analytical solutions of wave frequency and growth rate are\nderived when the wave speed is larger than the ion thermal speed but smaller\nthan the electron thermal speed. The unstable drift mode is found to have a\nlower limit of wavenumber due to the suprathermal electrons, which does not\nexist in Maxwellian plasmas. The population of suprathermal ions affects the\ncritical wavenumber for instability but does not determine its emergence.\nMoreover, the wave frequency, growth rate, and critical wavenumber are\nnumerically solved from the dispersion relation.

            "summary": "Gravitational wave observations of binary black holes have revealed\nunexpected structure in the black hole mass distribution. Previous studies of\nthe mass distribution employ physically-motivated phenomenological models and\ninfer the parameters that directly control the features of the mass\ndistribution that are allowed in their model, associating the constraints on\nthose parameters with their physical motivations. In this work, we take an\nalternative approach in which we introduce a model parameterizing the\nunderlying stellar and core-collapse physics and obtaining the remnant black\nhole distribution as a derived byproduct. In doing so, we directly constrain\nthe stellar physics necessary to explain the astrophysical distribution of\nblack hole properties under a given model. We apply this approach to modeling\nthe mapping between stellar core mass and remnant black hole mass, including\nthe effects of mass loss due to the pulsational pair instability supernova\n(PPISN) process, which has been proposed as an explanation for the observed\nexcess of black holes at $\\sim 35 M_\\odot$. Placing constraints on the nuclear\nreaction rates necessary to explain the PPISN parameters, we conclude that the\npeak observed at $\\sim 35 M_\\odot$ is highly unlikely to be a signature from\nthe PPISN process. This procedure can be applied to modeling any physical\nprocess that underlies the astrophysical mass distribution. Allowing the\nparameters of the core-remnant mass relationship to evolve with redshift\npermits correlated and physically reasonable changes in the location, shape,\nand amplitude of features in the mass function. We find that the current data\nare consistent with no redshift evolution in the core-remnant mass\nrelationship, but ultimately place only weak constraints on the change of these\nparameters.",

Recently, a novel two-state formulation of the structure of a\nself-aerated flow was proposed by Kramer & Valero [2023 J. Fluid Mech. 966,\nA37], which physically explains the air concentration through the weak\ninteraction of two canonical flow momentum layers, comprising a Turbulent\nBoundary Layer (TBL) and a Turbulent Wavy Layer (TWL). The TWL was modelled\nusing a Gaussian error function, assuming that the most dominant contribution\nare wave troughs. Here, it is shown that air bubbles form an integral part of\nthe TWL, and its formulation is expanded by adopting a superposition principle\nof entrapped air (waves) and entrained air (bubbles). Combining the\nsuperposition principle with the two-state formulation, an expression for the\ndepth-averaged (mean) air concentration is derived, which allows to quantify\nthe contribution of different physical mechanisms to the mean air\nconcentration. Overall, the presented concepts help to uncover new flow\nphysics, thereby contributing fundamentally to our understanding of\nself-aerated flows.",

Both these surrogate models take 5 muscle activation levels as input\nand output Cartesian coordinate vectors for each mesh node on the muscle's\nsurface. Thus, the neural network architecture features a significantly lower\ninput than output dimension. 5 muscle activation levels were sufficient to\nachieve an average error of 0.97 +/- 0.16 mm, or 0.57 +/- 0.10 % for the 2809\nmesh node positions of the biceps. The model achieved evaluation times of 9.88\nms per predicted deformation state on CPU only and 3.48 ms with GPU-support,\nleading to theoretical frame rates of 101 fps and 287 fps respectively. Deep\nlearning surrogates thus provide a way to make continuum-mechanical simulations\naccessible for visual real-time applications.",

In this work, we restate the key\nevidence substantiating these insights, then address a response to by authors\nof one of the path integration hypothesis papers.

Second, we\nevaluate the response's preferred ``unified theory for the origin of grid\ncells\" in trained deep path integrators and show that it is at best\n``occasionally suggestive,\" not exact or comprehensive.

In this work, a linear cluster state and GHZ state generation\nscheme is developed for group-IV color centers. In particular, this article\nfocuses on an in-depth investigation of the required control operations,\nincluding the coherent spin and excitation gates. We choose an off-resonant\nRaman scheme for the spin gates, which can be much faster than microwave\ncontrol. We do not rely on a reduced level scheme and use efficient\napproximations to design high-fidelity Raman gates. We benchmark the\nspin-control and excitation scheme using the tin vacancy color center coupled\nto a cavity, assuming a realistic experimental setting. Additionally, the\narticle investigates the fidelities of the Raman and excitation gates in the\npresence of radiative and non-radiative decay mechanisms.

            "summary": "The phenomenon of model-wise double descent, where the test error peaks and\nthen reduces as the model size increases, is an interesting topic that has\nattracted the attention of researchers due to the striking observed gap between\ntheory and practice \\citep{Belkin2018ReconcilingMM}. Additionally, while double\ndescent has been observed in various tasks and architectures, the peak of\ndouble descent can sometimes be noticeably absent or diminished, even without\nexplicit regularization, such as weight decay and early stopping. In this\npaper, we investigate this intriguing phenomenon from the optimization\nperspective and propose a simple optimization-based explanation for why double\ndescent sometimes occurs weakly or not at all. To the best of our knowledge, we\nare the first to demonstrate that many disparate factors contributing to\nmodel-wise double descent (initialization, normalization, batch size, learning\nrate, optimization algorithm) are unified from the viewpoint of optimization:\nmodel-wise double descent is observed if and only if the optimizer can find a\nsufficiently low-loss minimum. These factors directly affect the condition\nnumber of the optimization problem or the optimizer and thus affect the final\nminimum found by the optimizer, reducing or increasing the height of the double\ndescent peak. We conduct a series of controlled experiments on random feature\nmodels and two-layer neural networks under various optimization settings,\ndemonstrating this optimization-based unified view. Our results suggest the\nfollowing implication: Double descent is unlikely to be a problem for\nreal-world machine learning setups. Additionally, our results help explain the\ngap between weak double descent peaks in practice and strong peaks observable\nin carefully designed setups.",

Ray tracing (RT)-based methods have been widely used for many\nyears, but they require significant computational effort that may become\nprohibitive with the increased network densification and/or use of higher\nfrequencies in B5G/6G systems. In this paper, we propose a data-driven,\nmodel-free pathloss map prediction (PMP) method, called PMNet. PMNet uses a\nsupervised learning approach: it is trained on a limited amount of RT (or\nchannel measurement) data and map data. Once trained, PMNet can predict\npathloss over location with high accuracy (an RMSE level of $10^{-2}$) in a few\nmilliseconds. We further extend PMNet by employing transfer learning (TL). TL\nallows PMNet to learn a new network scenario quickly (x5.6 faster training) and\nefficiently (using x4.5 less data) by transferring knowledge from a pre-trained\nmodel, while retaining accuracy. Our results demonstrate that PMNet is a\nscalable and generalizable ML-based PMP method, showing its potential to be\nused in several network optimization applications.",

For example, scammers may attempt to create junk content that is\nsimilar to popular educational videos but with no meaningful information. This\npaper evaluates the performance of several CLIP variations for content\nmoderation of children's cartoons in both the supervised and zero-shot setting.\nWe show that our proposed model (Vanilla CLIP with Projection Layer)\noutperforms previous work conducted on the Malicious or Benign (MOB) benchmark\nfor video content moderation.

            "summary": "In this paper we revisit the classical problem of estimating a signal as it\nimpinges on a multi-sensor array. We focus on the case where the impinging\nsignal's bandwidth is appreciable and is operating in a broadband regime.\nEstimating broadband signals, often termed broadband (or wideband) beamforming,\nis traditionally done through filter and summation, true time delay, or a\ncoupling of the two. Our proposed method deviates substantially from these\nparadigms in that it requires no notion of filtering or true time delay. We use\nblocks of samples taken directly from the sensor outputs to fit a robust\nSlepian subspace model using a least squares approach. We then leverage this\nmodel to estimate uniformly spaced samples of the impinging signal. Alongside a\ncareful discussion of this model and how to choose its parameters we show how\nto fit the model to new blocks of samples as they are received, producing a\nstreaming output. We then go on to show how this method naturally extends to\nadaptive beamforming scenarios, where we leverage signal statistics to\nattenuate interfering sources. Finally, we discuss how to use our model to\nestimate from dimensionality reducing measurements. Accompanying these\ndiscussions are extensive numerical experiments establishing that our method\noutperforms existing filter based approaches while being comparable in terms of\ncomputational complexity.",

            "published": "2023-12-06T21:35:57Z",
            "summary": "We propose a theoretical approach to some of the nanorod-based metamaterial\nimplementations that does not depend on macroscopic electrodynamics. The\napproach is motivated by the fact that in actual experiments the incident\nelectromagnetic wave encounters a metamaterial structure which is planar in its\nshape, contains a layer or two of artificially created building blocks, and\ntherefore cannot be regarded as a three-dimensional continuous medium. This\nleads to a theoretical framework in which the phenomenological concept of\nrefractive index loses its principled meaning, and the deeper concept of\nscattering is taking center stage. Our proposal and its mathematical\nrealization rely heavily on Feynman's explanation of the physical origin of the\nindex of refraction and on his formula for the field of a plane of oscillating\ncharges. We provide a complete proof of Feynman's formula, filling in some\nsteps that were missing in the original derivation, and then generalize it to\nthe case of a finite disk, which may be relevant to the actual experiments\ninvolving laser beams. We then show how the formula can be applied to\nmetamaterial nanoplasmonics by considering some subtle interference effects in\nnarrow laser beams striking metamaterial plates. The first two effects use a\nsingle layer of aligned plasmonic nanorods, while the third uses a single layer\nof gyrotropic elements that may conveniently be described by the celebrated\nBorn-Kuhn oscillator model. The considered effects can potentially be used in\nthe development of quality standards for various metamaterial devices.",

This is\nparticularly significant for the unbanked population, which lacks access to\nstandard financial services. Our research targets businesses looking to shift\ntheir client to client payment processes, such as B2B invoicing, remittances,\nand cross-border transactions, to the Lightning Network. We compare the\nefficiency of interconnected mesh nodes (complete graph topology) with central\nrouting nodes (star graph topology), with a specific focus on the dual central\nnode approach. This approach introduces features like circular rebalancing,\nredundancy, and a closed network system. Through a basic SimPy model, we assess\nthe network's throughput in a 100 node scenario. While this approach\ncentralizes a technology initially designed for decentralization, it fosters\nbroader enterprise adoption of Bitcoin-based payment networks and encourages\nparticipation in the decentralized financial ecosystem. Our study also\nconsiders the regulatory implications of using central routing nodes, possibly\nclassified as payment processors under Money Transmission Laws (MTL). These\nfindings aim to contribute to the discourse on the Lightning Network's\napplication in business, highlighting its potential to drive shifts in\nfinancial technology towards more decentralized systems.",

In this work, we evaluated Android data safety labels\nand explored how differences between the two label designs impact user\ncomprehension and label utility. We conducted a between-subjects,\nsemi-structured interview study with 12 Android users and 12 iOS users. While\nsome users found Android Data Safety Labels informative and helpful, other\nusers found them too vague. Compared to iOS App Privacy Labels, Android users\nfound the distinction between data collection groups more intuitive and found\nexplicit inclusion of omitted data collection groups more salient. However,\nsome users expressed skepticism regarding elided information about collected\ndata type categories. Most users missed critical information due to not\nexpanding the accordion interface, and they were surprised by collection\npractices excluded from Android's definitions.

In this work, we address the\nchallenging problem of generating synchronized object motion and human motion\nguided by language descriptions in 3D scenes. We propose Controllable\nHuman-Object Interaction Synthesis (CHOIS), an approach that generates object\nmotion and human motion simultaneously using a conditional diffusion model\ngiven a language description, initial object and human states, and sparse\nobject waypoints. While language descriptions inform style and intent,\nwaypoints ground the motion in the scene and can be effectively extracted using\nhigh-level planning methods. Naively applying a diffusion model fails to\npredict object motion aligned with the input waypoints and cannot ensure the\nrealism of interactions that require precise hand-object contact and\nappropriate contact grounded by the floor. To overcome these problems, we\nintroduce an object geometry loss as additional supervision to improve the\nmatching between generated object motion and input object waypoints.

            "summary": "The advent of transformers, higher computational budgets, and big data has\nengendered remarkable progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Impressive\nperformance of industry pre-trained models has garnered public attention in\nrecent years and made news headlines. That these are industry models is\nnoteworthy. Rarely, if ever, are academic institutes producing exciting new NLP\nmodels. Using these models is critical for competing on NLP benchmarks and\ncorrespondingly to stay relevant in NLP research. We surveyed 100 papers\npublished at EMNLP 2022 to determine whether this phenomenon constitutes a\nreliance on industry for NLP publications.\n  We find that there is indeed a substantial reliance. Citations of industry\nartifacts and contributions across categories is at least three times greater\nthan industry publication rates per year. Quantifying this reliance does not\nsettle how we ought to interpret the results. We discuss two possible\nperspectives in our discussion: 1) Is collaboration with industry still\ncollaboration in the absence of an alternative? Or 2) has free NLP inquiry been\ncaptured by the motivations and research direction of private corporations?",

            "summary": "Neuro-symbolic AI bridges the gap between purely symbolic and neural\napproaches to learning. This often requires maximizing the likelihood of a\nsymbolic constraint w.r.t the neural network's output distribution. Such output\ndistributions are typically assumed to be fully-factorized. This limits the\napplicability of neuro-symbolic learning to the more expressive autoregressive\ndistributions, e.g., transformers. Under such distributions, computing the\nlikelihood of even simple constraints is #P-hard. Instead of attempting to\nenforce the constraint on the entire output distribution, we propose to do so\non a random, local approximation thereof. More precisely, we optimize the\nlikelihood of the constraint under a pseudolikelihood-based approximation\ncentered around a model sample. Our approximation is factorized, allowing the\nreuse of solutions to sub-problems, a main tenet for efficiently computing\nneuro-symbolic losses. Moreover, it is a local, high-fidelity approximation of\nthe likelihood, exhibiting low entropy and KL-divergence around the model\nsample. We evaluate our approach on Sudoku and shortest-path prediction cast as\nautoregressive generation, and observe that we greatly improve upon the base\nmodel's ability to predict logically-consistent outputs. We also evaluate on\nthe task of detoxifying large language models. Using a simple constraint\ndisallowing a list of toxic words, we are able to steer the model's outputs\naway from toxic generations, achieving SoTA detoxification compared to previous\napproaches.",

Previous work has tested the\naccuracy of this approach with N-body simulations, but generally on idealised\nmock galaxy surveys. However, systematic biases may arise solely due to survey\nselection effects such as flux-limited samples, edge-effects, and complications\ndue to the obscuration of the Galactic plane. In this work, we explore the\nimpact of each of these effects independently and simultaneously, using the\nsemi-analytic models from numerical simulations to generate mock catalogues\nthat mimic the 2M++ density field. We find the reconstruction and analysis\nmethods used for our 2M++ mocks produce a value of fsigma_8 that is biased high\nby a factor 1.04 \\pm 0.01 compared to the true value. Moreover, a cosmic volume\nmatching that of 2M++ has a cosmic variance uncertainty in fsigma_8 of ~5%. The\nsystematic bias is a function of distance: it is unbiased close to the origin\nbut is biased slightly high for distances in the range 100-180 Mpc/h.\nCorrecting for this small bias, we find the linear fsigma_8 = 0.362 \\pm 0.023.\nThe predicted peculiar velocities from 2M++ have an error of 170 km/s that\nslowly increases with distance, exceeding 200 km/s only at distances of 180-200\nMpc/h.

            "summary": "Zipf (1935) posited that wordforms are optimized to minimize utterances'\ncommunicative costs. Under the assumption that cost is given by an utterance's\nlength, he supported this claim by showing that words' lengths are inversely\ncorrelated with their frequencies. Communicative cost, however, can be\noperationalized in different ways. Piantadosi et al. (2011) claim that cost\nshould be measured as the distance between an utterance's information rate and\nchannel capacity, which we dub the channel capacity hypothesis (CCH) here.\nFollowing this logic, they then proposed that a word's length should be\nproportional to the expected value of its surprisal (negative log-probability\nin context). In this work, we show that Piantadosi et al.'s derivation does not\nminimize CCH's cost, but rather a lower bound, which we term CCH-lower. We\npropose a novel derivation, suggesting an improved way to minimize CCH's cost.\nUnder this method, we find that a language's word lengths should instead be\nproportional to the surprisal's expectation plus its variance-to-mean ratio.\nExperimentally, we compare these three communicative cost functions: Zipf's,\nCCH-lower , and CCH. Across 13 languages and several experimental settings, we\nfind that length is better predicted by frequency than either of the other\nhypotheses. In fact, when surprisal's expectation, or expectation plus\nvariance-to-mean ratio, is estimated using better language models, it leads to\nworse word length predictions. We take these results as evidence that Zipf's\nlongstanding hypothesis holds.",

            "summary": "Hyperbolic geometry has recently garnered considerable attention in machine\nlearning due to its capacity to embed hierarchical graph structures with low\ndistortions for further downstream processing. This paper introduces a simple\nframework to detect local outliers for datasets grounded in hyperbolic 2-space\nreferred to as HLoOP (Hyperbolic Local Outlier Probability). Within a Euclidean\nspace, well-known techniques for local outlier detection are based on the Local\nOutlier Factor (LOF) and its variant, the LoOP (Local Outlier Probability),\nwhich incorporates probabilistic concepts to model the outlier level of a data\nvector. The developed HLoOP combines the idea of finding nearest neighbors,\ndensity-based outlier scoring with a probabilistic, statistically oriented\napproach. Therefore, the method consists in computing the Riemmanian distance\nof a data point to its nearest neighbors following a Gaussian probability\ndensity function expressed in a hyperbolic space. This is achieved by defining\na Gaussian cumulative distribution in this space. The HLoOP algorithm is tested\non the WordNet dataset yielding promising results. Code and data will be made\navailable on request for reproductibility.",

A co-simulation platform\nintegrating Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and Webots was developed to\nserve as the driving simulator. A real-world roundabout in Ann Arbor, Michigan\nwas built in the co-simulation platform as the study area, and the merging\nscenarios were investigated. 36 participants were recruited and asked to\nnavigate the roundabout under three danger levels (e.g., low, medium, high) and\nthree collision warning designs (e.g., no warning, warning issued 1 second in\nadvance, warning issued 2 seconds in advance). Results indicated that advanced\nwarnings can significantly enhance safety by minimizing potential risks\ncompared to scenarios without warnings. Earlier warnings enabled smoother\ndriver responses and reduced abrupt decelerations. In addition, a personalized\nintention prediction model was developed to predict drivers' stop-or-go\ndecisions when the warning is displayed. Among all tested machine learning\nmodels, the XGBoost model achieved the highest prediction accuracy with a\nprecision rate of 95.56% and a recall rate of 97.73%.",

            "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) represents a growing machine learning (ML) paradigm\ndesigned for training models across numerous nodes that retain local datasets,\nall without directly exchanging the underlying private data with the parameter\nserver (PS). Its increasing popularity is attributed to notable advantages in\nterms of training deep neural network (DNN) models under privacy aspects and\nefficient utilization of communication resources. Unfortunately, DNNs suffer\nfrom high computational and communication costs, as well as memory consumption\nin intricate tasks. These factors restrict the applicability of FL algorithms\nin communication-constrained systems with limited hardware resources.\n  In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm that overcomes these limitations\nby synergistically combining a pruning-based method with the FL process,\nresulting in low-dimensional representations of the model with minimal\ncommunication cost, dubbed Masked Pruning over FL (MPFL). The algorithm\noperates by initially distributing weights to the nodes through the PS.\nSubsequently, each node locally trains its model and computes pruning masks.\nThese low-dimensional masks are then transmitted back to the PS, which\ngenerates a consensus pruning mask, broadcasted back to the nodes. This\niterative process enhances the robustness and stability of the masked pruning\nmodel. The generated mask is used to train the FL model, achieving significant\nbandwidth savings. We present an extensive experimental study demonstrating the\nsuperior performance of MPFL compared to existing methods.

            "summary": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) is rapidly growing in wireless technology, aiming to\nconnect vast numbers of devices to gather and distribute vital information.\nDespite individual devices having low energy consumption, the cumulative demand\nresults in significant energy usage. Consequently, the concept of\nultra-low-power tags gains appeal. Such tags communicate by reflecting rather\nthan generating the radio frequency (RF) signals by themselves. Thus, these\nbackscatter tags can be low-cost and battery-free. The RF signals can be\nambient sources such as wireless-fidelity (Wi-Fi), cellular, or television (TV)\nsignals, or the system can generate them externally. Backscatter channel\ncharacteristics are different from conventional point-to-point or cooperative\nrelay channels. These systems are also affected by a strong interference link\nbetween the RF source and the tag besides the direct and backscattering links,\nmaking signal detection challenging. This paper provides an overview of the\nfundamentals, challenges, and ongoing research in signal detection for AmBC\nnetworks. It delves into various detection methods, discussing their advantages\nand drawbacks. The paper's emphasis on signal detection sets it apart and\npositions it as a valuable resource for IoT and wireless communication\nprofessionals and researchers.",

            "summary": "Machine learning models are often trained to predict the outcome resulting\nfrom a human decision. For example, if a doctor decides to test a patient for\ndisease, will the patient test positive? A challenge is that the human decision\ncensors the outcome data: we only observe test outcomes for patients doctors\nhistorically tested. Untested patients, for whom outcomes are unobserved, may\ndiffer from tested patients along observed and unobserved dimensions. We\npropose a Bayesian model class which captures this setting. The purpose of the\nmodel is to accurately estimate risk for both tested and untested patients.\nEstimating this model is challenging due to the wide range of possibilities for\nuntested patients. To address this, we propose two domain constraints which are\nplausible in health settings: a prevalence constraint, where the overall\ndisease prevalence is known, and an expertise constraint, where the human\ndecision-maker deviates from purely risk-based decision-making only along a\nconstrained feature set. We show theoretically and on synthetic data that\ndomain constraints improve parameter inference. We apply our model to a case\nstudy of cancer risk prediction, showing that the model's inferred risk\npredicts cancer diagnoses, its inferred testing policy captures known public\nhealth policies, and it can identify suboptimalities in test allocation. Though\nour case study is in healthcare, our analysis reveals a general class of domain\nconstraints which can improve model estimation in many settings.",

For this\nstudy we use the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) where these two $\\kappa$\nparameters are identified with the two most relevant effective couplings at\nleading order, concretely $a=\\kappa_V$ and $b=\\kappa_{2V}$. Our focus is put on\nthese two couplings and their potential correlations which we believe carry\ninteresting information on the underlying ultraviolet theory. The particular\nstudied process is $e^+e^- \\to HH \\nu \\bar \\nu$, where the vector boson\nscattering subprocess $WW \\to HH$ plays a central role, specially at the\nlargest planned energy colliders. Our detailed study of this process as a\nfunction of the energy and the angular variables indicates that the produced\nHiggs bosons in the BSM scenarios will have in general a high transversality as\ncompared to the SM case if $\\kappa_V^2 \\neq \\kappa_{2V}$. In order to enhance\nthe sensitivity to these HEFT parameters $\\kappa_V$ and $\\kappa_{2V}$ and their\npotential correlations we propose here some selected differential cross\nsections for the $e^+e^- \\to HH \\nu \\bar\\nu$ process where different kinematic\nproperties of the BSM case with respect to the SM are manifested. Finally, we\nwill focus on the dominant Higgs decays to $b \\bar b$ pairs leading to final\nevents with 4 $b$-jets and missing transverse energy from the undetected\nneutrinos and will provide the expected accessibility to the\n$(\\kappa_V,\\kappa_{2V})$ effective couplings and their potential correlations.\nIn our study we will consider the three projected energies for $e^+e^-$\ncolliders of 500 GeV, 1000 GeV and 3000 GeV.",

Recently, data-driven approaches for weather\nforecasting based on deep learning have shown great promise, achieving\naccuracies that are competitive with operational systems. However, those\nmethods often employ complex, customized architectures without sufficient\nablation analysis, making it difficult to understand what truly contributes to\ntheir success. Here we introduce Stormer, a simple transformer model that\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on weather forecasting with minimal\nchanges to the standard transformer backbone. We identify the key components of\nStormer through careful empirical analyses, including weather-specific\nembedding, randomized dynamics forecast, and pressure-weighted loss. At the\ncore of Stormer is a randomized forecasting objective that trains the model to\nforecast the weather dynamics over varying time intervals. During inference,\nthis allows us to produce multiple forecasts for a target lead time and combine\nthem to obtain better forecast accuracy. On WeatherBench 2, Stormer performs\ncompetitively at short to medium-range forecasts and outperforms current\nmethods beyond 7 days, while requiring orders-of-magnitude less training data\nand compute.

Over time, the dynamics of such flows\nevolve towards a finite-dimensional invariant manifold. Using only data from\ndirect numerical simulations, in the present work we identify the manifold and\ndetermine evolution equations for the dynamics on it. We use an advanced\nautoencoder framework to automatically estimate the intrinsic dimension of the\nmanifold and provide an orthogonal coordinate system. Then, we learn the\ndynamics by determining an equation on the manifold by using both a function\nspace approach (approximating the Koopman operator) and a state space approach\n(approximating the vector field on the manifold). We apply this method to exact\ncoherent states for Kolmogorov flow and minimal flow unit pipe flow. Fully\nresolved simulations for these cases require O(103) and O(105) degrees of\nfreedom respectively, and we build models with two or three degrees of freedom\nthat faithfully capture the dynamics of these flows.

Nevertheless, we show that this 2D diffusion model can still serve as a\ngenerative prior in a 3D multi-view reconstruction problem where we optimize a\nNeRF using a combination of score distillation sampling and NeRF reconstruction\nlosses. Predicted depth is used as additional supervision to encourage accurate\ngeometry. We compare our approach to 3D inpainting methods that focus on object\nremoval. Because our method can generate content to fill any 3D masked region,\nwe additionally demonstrate 3D object completion, 3D object replacement, and 3D\nscene completion.",

It aims to minimize the expected system cost across day-ahead and\nreal-time stages and approximate the cost efficiency of the stochastic market\ndesign. However, solving the bilevel optimization problem is computationally\nchallenging for large-scale systems. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a\nnovel technique based on strong duality and McCormick envelopes, which relaxes\nthe problem to a linear program, enabling large-scale applications. The\nproposed bilevel framework is applied to the 1576-bus NYISO system and\nbenchmarked against a myopic strategy, where the VRES bid is the mean value of\nthe probabilistic power forecast. Results demonstrate that, under high VRES\npenetration levels (e.g., 40%), our framework can significantly reduce system\ncosts and market-price volatility, by optimizing VRES quantities efficiently in\nthe day-ahead market. Furthermore, we find that when transmission capacity\nincreases, the proposed bilevel model will still reduce the system cost,\nwhereas the myopic strategy may incur a much higher cost due to over-scheduling\nof VRES in the day-ahead market and the lack of flexible conventional\ngenerators in real time.",

Here, the sample\ncomplexity for estimating the worst-case performance gap across groups (e.g.,\nthe largest difference in error rates) increases exponentially with the number\nof group-denoting sensitive attributes.

By allowing a small probabilistic slack on the groups over which a\nmodel has approximately equal performance, we show that the sample complexity\nrequired for discovering performance violations is reduced exponentially to be\nat most upper bounded by the square root of the number of groups. As a\nbyproduct of our analysis, when the groups are weighted by a specific prior\ndistribution, we show that R\\'enyi entropy of order $2/3$ of the prior\ndistribution captures the sample complexity of the proposed CVaR test\nalgorithm.

When taking the second\napproach as a starting point to design quantum algorithms for machine learning,\nit is important to understand how mathematical structures in quantum mechanics\ncan lead to useful inductive biases in quantum models. In this work, we bring a\ncollection of theoretical evidence from the Quantum Cognition literature to the\nfield of Quantum Machine Learning to investigate how non-commutativity of\nquantum observables can help to learn data with ''order effects'', such as the\nchanges in human answering patterns when swapping the order of questions in a\nsurvey. We design a multi-task learning setting in which a generative quantum\nmodel consisting of sequential learnable measurements can be adapted to a given\ntask -- or question order -- by changing the order of observables, and we\nprovide artificial datasets inspired by human psychology to carry out our\ninvestigation. Our first experimental simulations show that in some cases the\nquantum model learns more non-commutativity as the amount of order effect\npresent in the data is increased, and that the quantum model can learn to\ngenerate better samples for unseen question orders when trained on others -\nboth signs that the model architecture suits the task.",

To\nillustrate this, we consider GW190521, a short duration gravitational-wave\nevent observed in the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run. We show that\ndescribing this event as a collapsing cosmic string loop is favoured over\nprevious cosmic string analyses by an approximate log Bayes factor of $22$. The\nbinary black hole hypothesis is still preferred, mostly because the cosmic\nstring remnant is non-spinning. It remains an open question whether a spinning\nremnant could form from loops with angular momentum, but if possible, it would\nlikely bring into contention the binary black hole preference.

            "summary": "Effective string theory has shown its universal power in the prediction of\nthe spectrum of low-lying excited states of confining strings. Here we study\nconfining flux tubes in $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories. For the $N=2$ theory,\nwhich corresponds to the 3d Ising gauge model, we compute the spectrum of\nlow-lying excitations of confining strings and show that it agrees with the\nuniversal Nambu--Goto predictions except for an additional massive scalar\nresonance. This resonance, however, turns out to be a bulk glueball mixing with\nthe flux tube excitations rather than a genuine string worldsheet state. In\ngeneral $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories (dual to clock spin models), we observe a\ncontinuous phase transition for $N \\geq 4$, while for $N > 5$ it is governed by\nthe $O(2)$ universality class. The critical behavior of the string tension and\nmass gap is verified to be described by a dangerously irrelevant operator. At\nlarge $N$ the glueball spectrum is expected to approach the spectrum of U(1)\ngauge theory, which is confirmed by our lattice data.",

            "summary": "We use numerical simulations to model Gaia DR3 data with the aim of\nconstraining the Milky Way bar and spiral structure parameters. We show that\nboth the morphology and the velocity field in Milky Way-like galactic disc\nmodels are strong functions of time, changing dramatically over a few tens of\nMyr. This suggests that by finding a good match to the observed radial velocity\nfield, v_R(x,y), we can constrain the bar-spiral orientation. Incorporating\nuncertainties into our models is necessary to match the data; most importantly,\na heliocentric distance uncertainty above 10-15% distorts the bar's shape and\n$v_R$ quadrupole pattern morphology, and decreases its apparent angle with\nrespect to the Sun-Galactocentric line. An excellent match to the \\Gaia DR3\n$v_R(x,y)$ field is found for a simulation with a bar length R_b~3.6 kpc. We\nargue that the data are consistent with a MW bar as short as ~3 kpc, for\nmoderate strength inner disc spiral structure (A_2/A_0~0.25) or, alternatively,\nwith a bar length up to ~5.2 kpc, provided that spiral arms are quite weak\n(A_2/A_0~0.1), and is most likely in the process of disconnecting from a spiral\narm. We demonstrate that the bar angle and distance uncertainty can similarly\naffect the match between our models and the data - a smaller bar angle (20 deg\ninstead of 30 deg) requires smaller distance uncertainty (20% instead of 30%)\nto explain the observations. Fourier components of the face-on density\ndistribution of our models suggest that the MW does not have strong m=1 and/or\nm=3 spirals inside the solar radius.",

Safety\nmechanisms and specialized training procedures are put in place to prevent\nimproper responses from these assistants. In this work, we bypass these\nmeasures for ChatGPT and Bard (and, to some extent, Bing chat) by making them\nimpersonate complex personas with opposite characteristics as those of the\ntruthful assistants they are supposed to be. We start by creating elaborate\nbiographies of these personas, which we then use in a new session with the same\nchatbots. Our conversation followed a role-play style to get the response the\nassistant was not allowed to provide. By making use of personas, we show that\nthe response that is prohibited is actually provided, making it possible to\nobtain unauthorized, illegal, or harmful information. This work shows that by\nusing adversarial personas, one can overcome safety mechanisms set out by\nChatGPT and Bard. It also introduces several ways of activating such\nadversarial personas, altogether showing that both chatbots are vulnerable to\nthis kind of attack.",

In this study,\nwe present a comprehensive analysis of this dataset utilizing a forward\nmodelling approach. We explore five distinct atmospheric models, each aiming to\nencompass diverse physical and chemical phenomena proposed to happen in cool\natmospheres in a self-consistent way. Our aim is to assess their performance in\nestimating key atmospheric parameters: Teff, log(g), [M/H], C/O, gamma, fsed,\nand R. To achieve this, we apply our Bayesian framework, ForMoSA, employing an\noptimized nested sampling algorithm for model-data comparison. Our findings\nreveal that each parameter's estimate is significantly influenced by factors\nsuch as the wavelength range considered, the spectral features used, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and the model chosen for the fit. The observed parameter\ndispersion may be attributed to systematic error in the models, resulting from\ntheir difficulties in accurately replicating the complex atmospheric structure\nof VHS1256b, notably the complexity of its clouds and dust distribution. To\npropagate the impact of these systematic uncertainties on our atmospheric\nproperty estimates, we introduce innovative fitting methodologies based on\nindependent fits performed on different spectral windows. We finally derived a\nTeff consistent with the spectral type of the target, considering its young\nage, which is confirmed by our estimate of log(g). Despite the exceptional data\nquality, attaining robust estimates for chemical abundances [M/H] and C/O,\noften employed as indicators of formation history, remains challenging with\nestimates dispersed on the entire range explored by the model grids.",

            "summary": "Generating instructional images of human daily actions from an egocentric\nviewpoint serves a key step towards efficient skill transfer. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel problem -- egocentric action frame generation. The goal is to\nsynthesize the action frame conditioning on the user prompt question and an\ninput egocentric image that captures user's environment. Notably, existing\negocentric datasets lack the detailed annotations that describe the execution\nof actions. Additionally, the diffusion-based image manipulation models fail to\ncontrol the state change of an action within the corresponding egocentric image\npixel space. To this end, we finetune a visual large language model (VLLM) via\nvisual instruction tuning for curating the enriched action descriptions to\naddress our proposed problem. Moreover, we propose to Learn EGOcentric (LEGO)\naction frame generation using image and text embeddings from VLLM as additional\nconditioning. We validate our proposed model on two egocentric datasets --\nEgo4D and Epic-Kitchens. Our experiments show prominent improvement over prior\nimage manipulation models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. We\nalso conduct detailed ablation studies and analysis to provide insights on our\nmethod.",

To support this proposal, we\nfirst demonstrate its validity in examples of chaotic and integrable systems.\nWe then show that for Haar-random initial states in RMTs the mean and\ncovariance of the Lanczos spectrum suffices to produce the full long time\nbehavior of general survival probabilities including the spectral form factor,\nas well as the spread complexity. In addition, for initial states with\ncontinuous overlap with energy eigenstates, we analytically find the long time\naverages of the probabilities of Krylov basis elements in terms of the mean\nLanczos spectrum. This analysis suggests a notion of eigenstate complexity, the\nstatistics of which differentiate integrable systems and classes of quantum\nchaos. Finally, we clarify the relation between spread complexity and the\nuniversality classes of RMT by exploring various values of the Dyson index and\nPoisson distributed spectra.",

At low column densities\n($N_\\mathrm{H\\,I}<4\\times10^{20}~\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) where $p_{353}$ and\n$N_\\mathrm{H\\,I}$ are uncorrelated, there is a strong positive\n$p_{353}$-$f_\\mathrm{CNM}$ correlation. We fit the $p_{353}$-$f_{\\rm CNM}$\ncorrelation with data-driven models to constrain the degree of magnetic field\ndisorder between phases along the line-of-sight. We argue that an increased\nmagnetic field disorder in the warm neutral medium (WNM) relative to the CNM\nbest explains the positive $p_{353}$-$f_\\mathrm{CNM}$ correlation in diffuse\nregions. Modeling the CNM-associated dust column as being maximally polarized,\nwith a polarization fraction $p_{\\rm CNM} \\sim$ 0.2, we find that the best-fit\nmean polarization fraction in the WNM-associated dust column is 0.22$p_{\\rm\nCNM}$. The model further suggests that a significant $f_{\\rm CNM}$-correlated\nfraction of the non-CNM column (an additional ~18.4\\% of the HI mass on\naverage) is also more magnetically ordered, and we speculate that the\nadditional column is associated with the unstable medium (UNM).

This requires evaluating policies not\nonly on their overall effectiveness but also on whether their benefits are felt\nacross all communities. We illustrate the importance of considering such\ndisparities for flood adaptation using the FEMA National Flood Insurance\nProgram Community Rating System and its dataset of $\\sim$2.5 million flood\ninsurance claims. We use ${\\rm C{\\scriptsize AUSAL}F{\\scriptsize LOW}}$, a\ncausal inference method based on deep generative models, to estimate the\ntreatment effect of flood adaptation interventions based on a community's\nincome, diversity, population, flood risk, educational attainment, and\nprecipitation. We find that the program saves communities \\$5,000--15,000 per\nhousehold. However, these savings are not evenly spread across communities. For\nexample, for low-income communities savings sharply decline as flood-risk\nincreases in contrast to their high-income counterparts with all else equal.\nEven among low-income communities, there is a gap in savings between\npredominantly white and non-white communities: savings of predominantly white\ncommunities can be higher by more than \\$6000 per household. As communities\nworldwide ramp up efforts to reduce losses inflicted by floods, simply\nprescribing a series flood adaptation measures is not enough. Programs must\nprovide communities with the necessary technical and economic support to\ncompensate for historical patterns of disenfranchisement, racism, and\ninequality. Future flood adaptation efforts should go beyond reducing losses\noverall and aim to close existing gaps to equitably support communities in the\nrace for climate adaptation.",

We present our\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations of this event starting several weeks\nbefore and out to approximately two years after g-band peak brightness and\ncombine them with public photometric data. This extensive dataset robustly\nreveals a change in the light-curve slope and a bump in the rising light curve\nof a TDE for the first time, which may indicate more than one dominant emission\nmechanism contributing to the pre-peak light curve. We further confirm the\nrelation seen in previous TDEs whereby the redder emission peaks later than the\nbluer emission. The post-peak bolometric light curve of AT 2019azh is better\ndescribed by an exponential decline than by the canonical t^{-5/3} (and in fact\nany) power-law decline. We find a possible mid-infrared excess around peak\noptical luminosity, but cannot determine its origin. In addition, we provide\nthe earliest measurements of the Halpha emission-line evolution and find no\nsignificant time delay between the peak of the V-band light curve and that of\nthe Halpha luminosity. These results can be used to constrain future models of\nTDE line formation and emission mechanisms in general. More pre-peak 1-2 day\ncadence observations of TDEs are required to determine whether the\ncharacteristics observed here are common among TDEs. More importantly, detailed\nemission models are needed to fully exploit such observations for understanding\nthe emission physics of TDEs.",

A central\ncomponent of exciton physics is the electron-hole interaction, which is\ncommonly treated as screened solely by electrons within a material. However,\nnuclear motion can screen this Coulomb interaction as well, with several recent\nstudies developing model approaches for approximating the phonon screening to\nthe properties of excitons. While these model approaches tend to improve\nagreement with experiment for exciton properties, they rely on several\napproximations that restrict their applicability to a wide range of materials,\nand thus far they have neglected the effect of finite temperatures. Here, we\ndevelop a fully first-principles, parameter-free approach to compute the\ntemperature-dependent effects of phonon screening within the ab initio GW-Bethe\nSalpeter equation framework. We recover previously proposed models of phonon\nscreening as well-defined limits of our general framework, and discuss their\nvalidity by comparing them against our first-principles results. We develop an\nefficient computational workflow and apply it to a diverse set of\nsemiconductors, specifically AlN, CdS, GaN, MgO and SrTiO3. We demonstrate\nunder different physical scenarios how excitons may be screened by multiple\npolar optical or acoustic phonons, how their binding energies can exhibit\nstrong temperature dependence, and the ultrafast timescales on which they\ndissociate into free electron-hole pairs.",

            "summary": "The flavor evolution of neutrinos in dense astrophysical sources, such as\ncore-collapse supernovae or compact binary mergers, is non-linear due to the\ncoherent forward scattering of neutrinos among themselves. Recent work in this\ncontext has been addressed to figure out whether flavor equipartition could be\na generic flavor outcome of fast flavor conversion. We investigate the flavor\nconversion physics injecting random perturbations in the neutrino field in two\nsimulation setups: 1. a spherically symmetric simulation shell without periodic\nboundaries, with angular distributions evolving dynamically thanks to\nnon-forward scatterings of neutrinos with the background medium, and neutrino\nadvection; 2. a periodic simulation shell, with angular distributions of\nneutrinos defined a priori and neutrino advection. We find that, independent of\nthe exact initial flavor configuration and type of perturbations, flavor\nequipartition is generally achieved in the system with periodic boundaries; in\nthis case, perturbations aid the diffusion of flavor structures to smaller and\nsmaller scales. However, flavor equipartition is not a general outcome in the\nsimulation shell without periodic boundaries, where the inhomogeneities induced\nperturbing the neutrino field affect the flavor evolution, but do not\nfacilitate the diffusion of flavor waves. This work highlights the importance\nof the choice of the simulation boundary conditions in the exploration of fast\nflavor conversion physics.",

Without employing an effective field theory\napproach, where the photon field directly mixed with the additional $U(1)$, we\nanalyze a general renormalizable model and investigate the complete evolution\nof the hidden sector particles precisely. Due to the substantial\nself-interactions among hidden sector particles, the evolution of the hidden\nsector temperature plays a crucial role, which is addressed concurrently with\nthe number densities of hidden sector particles by solving a set of coupled\nBoltzmann equations. We thoroughly examine eight benchmark models covering six\ndistinct cases.

As such it resolves the\ncapability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum\nerror-correcting code.

We\ninvestigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet\n(dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical\nsignatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively,\nthat go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits\ntransport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary\ncircuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and\nscattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue\nthat the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these\nsolvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can\nserve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are\nsensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived\nquasiparticles or dual-unitarity.",

On the other hand, the significant role of commensurate filling\nis akin to the Mott insulator. Recent progress in simulator platforms presents\nunprecedented opportunities to investigate quantum melting in the strongly\ninteracting regime through synergy between theory and experiments. However, the\nearlier theory literature presents diverging predictions. We study the quantum\nfreezing of GWC through large-scale density matrix renormalization group\nsimulations of a triangular lattice extended Hubbard model. We find a single\nfirst-order phase transition between the Fermi liquid and the\n$\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ GWC state. The GWC state shows long-range\nantiferromagnetic $120^\\circ$ N{\\'e}el order. Our results present the simplest\nanswers to the question of the quantum phase transition into the GWC phase and\nthe properties of the GWC phase.",

To address the first two\nissues, we introduce a new framework and open-source software nbi (Neural\nBayesian Inference), which supports both amortized and sequential NPE. First,\nnbi provides built-in \"featurizer\" networks with demonstrated efficacy on\nsequential data, such as light curve and spectra, thus obviating the need for\nthis customization on the user end. Second, we introduce a modified algorithm\nSNPE-IS, which facilities asymptotically exact inference by using the surrogate\nposterior under NPE only as a proposal distribution for importance sampling.\nThese features allow nbi to be applied off-the-shelf to astronomical inference\nproblems involving light curves and spectra.

Under this setting, the model can perceive tasks from prompts\nand accomplish them without any extra task-specific head predictions or model\nfine-tuning. However, Skeleton sequence modeling via in-context learning\nremains unexplored. Directly applying existing in-context models from other\nareas onto skeleton sequences fails due to the inter-frame and cross-task pose\nsimilarity that makes it outstandingly hard to perceive the task correctly from\na subtle context. To address this challenge, we propose Skeleton-in-Context\n(SiC), an effective framework for in-context skeleton sequence modeling. Our\nSiC is able to handle multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously after a\nsingle training process and accomplish each task from context according to the\ngiven prompt. It can further generalize to new, unseen tasks according to\ncustomized prompts. To facilitate context perception, we additionally propose a\ntask-unified prompt, which adaptively learns tasks of different natures, such\nas partial joint-level generation, sequence-level prediction, or 2D-to-3D\nmotion prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our SiC on multiple tasks, including motion prediction, pose\nestimation, joint completion, and future pose estimation. We also evaluate its\ngeneralization capability on unseen tasks such as motion-in-between.

            "summary": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) plays an essential role in\nextracting valuable content information from images across diverse tasks. It\naligns textual and visual modalities to comprehend the entire image, including\nall the details, even those irrelevant to specific tasks. However, for a finer\nunderstanding and controlled editing of images, it becomes crucial to focus on\nspecific regions of interest, which can be indicated as points, masks, or boxes\nby humans or perception models. To fulfill the requirements, we introduce\nAlpha-CLIP, an enhanced version of CLIP with an auxiliary alpha channel to\nsuggest attentive regions and fine-tuned with constructed millions of RGBA\nregion-text pairs. Alpha-CLIP not only preserves the visual recognition ability\nof CLIP but also enables precise control over the emphasis of image contents.\nIt demonstrates effectiveness in various tasks, including but not limited to\nopen-world recognition, multimodal large language models, and conditional 2D /\n3D generation. It has a strong potential to serve as a versatile tool for\nimage-related tasks.",

            "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention\ndue to their strong multimodal understanding capability. However, existing\nworks rely heavily on modality-specific encoders, which usually differ in\narchitecture and are limited to common modalities. In this paper, we present\nOneLLM, an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unified\nframework. We achieve this through a unified multimodal encoder and a\nprogressive multimodal alignment pipeline. In detail, we first train an image\nprojection module to connect a vision encoder with LLM. Then, we build a\nuniversal projection module (UPM) by mixing multiple image projection modules\nand dynamic routing. Finally, we progressively align more modalities to LLM\nwith the UPM. To fully leverage the potential of OneLLM in following\ninstructions, we also curated a comprehensive multimodal instruction dataset,\nincluding 2M items from image, audio, video, point cloud, depth/normal map, IMU\nand fMRI brain activity. OneLLM is evaluated on 25 diverse benchmarks,\nencompassing tasks such as multimodal captioning, question answering and\nreasoning, where it delivers excellent performance.

First, we propose a formal definition for this problem. Next, we introduce\nDiffusion Illusions, the first comprehensive pipeline designed to automatically\ngenerate a wide range of these illusions. Specifically, we both adapt the\nexisting `score distillation loss' and propose a new `dream target loss' to\noptimize a group of differentially parametrized prime images, using a frozen\ntext-to-image diffusion model. We study three types of illusions, each where\nthe prime images are arranged in different ways and optimized using the\naforementioned losses such that images derived from them align with user-chosen\ntext prompts or images. We conduct comprehensive experiments on these illusions\nand verify the effectiveness of our proposed method qualitatively and\nquantitatively.

In this work, we\nintroduce a self-supervised illumination harmonization approach formulated in\nthe intrinsic image domain. First, we estimate a simple global lighting model\nfrom mid-level vision representations to generate a rough shading for the\nforeground region. A network then refines this inferred shading to generate a\nharmonious re-shading that aligns with the background scene. In order to match\nthe color appearance of the foreground and background, we utilize ideas from\nprior harmonization approaches to perform parameterized image edits in the\nalbedo domain. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we present\nresults from challenging real-world composites and conduct a user study to\nobjectively measure the enhanced realism achieved compared to state-of-the-art\nharmonization methods.",

An important\nclass of these are reflections and spurious couplings between antennas. We\napply a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to the modelling and mitigation of\nthese systematics in simulated Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA)\ndata. This method allows us to form statistical uncertainty estimates for both\nour models and the recovered visibilities, which is an important ingredient in\nestablishing robust upper limits on the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) power\nspectrum. In cases where the noise is large compared to the EoR signal, this\napproach can constrain the systematics well enough to mitigate them down to the\nnoise level for both systematics studied. Where the noise is smaller than the\nEoR, our modelling can mitigate the majority of the reflections with there\nbeing only a minor level of residual systematics, while cross-coupling sees\nessentially complete mitigation. Our approach performs similarly to existing\nfiltering/fitting techniques used in the HERA pipeline, but with the added\nbenefit of rigorously propagating uncertainties.

We show how to achieve constant regret in zero-sum games and\n$O(T^{1/4})$ regret in general-sum games while using only $O(\\log t)$\nbest-response queries at a given iteration $t$, thus improving over the best\nprior result, which required $O(T)$ queries per iteration. Moreover, our\nframework yields the first last-iterate convergence guarantees for self-play\nwith best-response oracles in zero-sum games. This convergence occurs at a\nlinear rate, though with a condition-number dependence. We go on to show a\n$O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ best-iterate convergence rate without such a dependence. Our\nresults build on linear-rate convergence results for variants of the\nFrank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for strongly convex and smooth minimization problems\nover polyhedral domains. These FW results depend on a condition number of the\npolytope, known as facial distance. In order to enable application to settings\nsuch as EFGs, we show two broad new results: 1) the facial distance for\npolytopes in standard form is at least $\\gamma/\\sqrt{k}$ where $\\gamma$ is the\nminimum value of a nonzero coordinate of a vertex of the polytope and $k\\leq n$\nis the number of tight inequality constraints in the optimal face, and 2) the\nfacial distance for polytopes of the form\n$\\mathbf{A}\\boldsymbol{x}=\\boldsymbol{b},\\mathbf{C}\\boldsymbol{x}\\leq\\boldsymbol{d},\n\\boldsymbol{x}\\geq \\mathbf{0}$ where $\\boldsymbol{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$,\n$\\mathbf{C}\\geq\\boldsymbol{0}$ is a nonzero integral matrix, and\n$\\boldsymbol{d}\\geq \\boldsymbol{0}$, is at least\n$1/(\\|\\mathbf{C}\\|_\\infty\\sqrt{n})$.

            "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion models have successfully enabled text-guided\nimage inpainting. While it seems straightforward to extend such editing\ncapability into video domain, there has been fewer works regarding text-guided\nvideo inpainting. Given a video, a masked region at its initial frame, and an\nediting prompt, it requires a model to do infilling at each frame following the\nediting guidance while keeping the out-of-mask region intact. There are three\nmain challenges in text-guided video inpainting: ($i$) temporal consistency of\nthe edited video, ($ii$) supporting different inpainting types at different\nstructural fidelity level, and ($iii$) dealing with variable video length. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce Any-Length Video Inpainting with\nDiffusion Model, dubbed as AVID. At its core, our model is equipped with\neffective motion modules and adjustable structure guidance, for fixed-length\nvideo inpainting. Building on top of that, we propose a novel Temporal\nMultiDiffusion sampling pipeline with an middle-frame attention guidance\nmechanism, facilitating the generation of videos with any desired duration. Our\ncomprehensive experiments show our model can robustly deal with various\ninpainting types at different video duration range, with high quality.

In natural\nlanguage processing and computer vision, parameter-efficient approaches like\nprompt-tuning and adapters have emerged as solid alternatives by fine-tuning\nonly a small number of extra parameters, without sacrificing performance\naccuracy. Specifically, adapters, due to their flexibility, have recently\ngarnered significant attention, leading to several variants. For audio\nclassification tasks, the Audio Spectrogram Transformer model shows impressive\nresults. However, surprisingly, how to efficiently adapt it to several\ndownstream tasks has not been tackled before. In this paper, we bridge this gap\nand present a detailed investigation of common parameter-efficient methods,\nrevealing that adapters consistently outperform the other methods across four\nbenchmarks. This trend is also confirmed in few-shot learning settings and when\nthe total number of trainable parameters increases, demonstrating adapters\nsuperior scalability.

We present a method for proactively evaluating the potential\ndiscriminatory impact of LMs in a wide range of use cases, including\nhypothetical use cases where they have not yet been deployed.

Applying\nthis methodology reveals patterns of both positive and negative discrimination\nin the Claude 2.0 model in select settings when no interventions are applied.\nWhile we do not endorse or permit the use of language models to make automated\ndecisions for the high-risk use cases we study, we demonstrate techniques to\nsignificantly decrease both positive and negative discrimination through\ncareful prompt engineering, providing pathways toward safer deployment in use\ncases where they may be appropriate.

            "summary": "The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in\ndriving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and\ncarbon capture. Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design\nby directly generating entirely novel materials given desired property\nconstraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have low\nsuccess rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limited\nset of property constraints. Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generates\nstable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further\nbe fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property\nconstraints. To enable this, we introduce a new diffusion-based generative\nprocess that produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types,\ncoordinates, and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules to\nenable fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labeled\ndataset. Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGen\nare more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 times\ncloser to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully\ngenerates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as\nmechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate\nmulti-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that have\nboth high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chain\nrisk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of\nMatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a\nuniversal generative model for materials design.",

It has been pointed out by\nCaron-Huot and Wilhlem [1] that RG anomalous dimension can be extracted from\nthe phase of the S-matrix, which can greatly simplify calculations via\nunitarity methods. In this paper we generalize the results of [1] to show that\nthe phase can be used to reconstruct rapidity anomalous dimensions, by\nperforming a complex boost. The methodology introduced here also allows one to\ncalculate without the need for a rapidity regulator. We demonstrate the use of\nthis method to derive the rapidity anomalous dimensions in the Sudakov form\nfactor, the two parton soft function and the Regge trajectory in QCD.",

GeoShapley extends the Nobel Prize-winning\nShapley value framework in game theory by conceptualizing location as a player\nin a model prediction game, which enables the quantification of the importance\nof location and the synergies between location and other features in a model.\nGeoShapley is a model-agnostic approach and can be applied to statistical or\nblack-box machine learning models in various structures. The interpretation of\nGeoShapley is directly linked with spatially varying coefficient models for\nexplaining spatial effects and additive models for explaining non-spatial\neffects. Using simulated data, GeoShapley values are validated against known\ndata-generating processes and are used for cross-comparison of seven\nstatistical and machine learning models. An empirical example of house price\nmodeling is used to illustrate GeoShapley's utility and interpretation with\nreal world data.

The most widely used\nalgorithms for primary subtraction aim to decouple bright stellar speckle noise\nfrom planetary signatures by subtracting an approximation of the temporally\nevolving stellar noise from each frame in an imaging sequence. Our approach\naims to improve the stellar noise approximation and increase the planet\ndetection sensitivity by leveraging deep learning in a novel direct imaging\npost-processing algorithm. We show that a convolutional autoencoder neural\nnetwork, trained on an extensive reference library of real imaging sequences,\naccurately reconstructs the stellar speckle noise at the location of a\npotential planet signal. This tool is used in a post-processing algorithm we\ncall Direct Exoplanet Detection with Convolutional Image Reconstruction, or\nConStruct. The reliability and sensitivity of ConStruct are assessed using real\nKeck/NIRC2 angular differential imaging datasets. Of the 30 unique point\nsources we examine, ConStruct yields a higher S/N than traditional PCA-based\nprocessing for 67$\\%$ of the cases and improves the relative contrast by up to\na factor of 2.6. This work demonstrates the value and potential of deep\nlearning to take advantage of a diverse reference library of point spread\nfunction realizations to improve direct imaging post-processing.

Since typical E2E approaches require large amounts\nof training data and resources, leveraging pre-trained foundation models\ninstead of training from scratch is gaining attention. Although there have been\nattempts to use pre-trained speech and language models in ASR, most of them are\nlimited to using either. This paper explores the potential of integrating a\npre-trained speech representation model with a large language model (LLM) for\nE2E ASR. The proposed model enables E2E ASR by generating text tokens in an\nautoregressive manner via speech representations as speech prompts, taking\nadvantage of the vast knowledge provided by the LLM. Furthermore, the proposed\nmodel can incorporate remarkable developments for LLM utilization, such as\ninference optimization and parameter-efficient domain adaptation.

While existing methods focus on warping the garment to\nfit the body pose, they often overlook the synthesis quality around the\ngarment-skin boundary and realistic effects like wrinkles and shadows on the\nwarped garments. These limitations greatly reduce the realism of the generated\nresults and hinder the practical application of VITON techniques. Leveraging\nthe notable success of diffusion-based models in cross-modal image synthesis,\nsome recent diffusion-based methods have ventured to tackle this issue.\nHowever, they tend to either consume a significant amount of training resources\nor struggle to achieve realistic try-on effects and retain garment details. For\nefficient and high-fidelity VITON, we propose WarpDiffusion, which bridges the\nwarping-based and diffusion-based paradigms via a novel informative and local\ngarment feature attention mechanism. Specifically, WarpDiffusion incorporates\nlocal texture attention to reduce resource consumption and uses a novel\nauto-mask module that effectively retains only the critical areas of the warped\ngarment while disregarding unrealistic or erroneous portions. Notably,\nWarpDiffusion can be integrated as a plug-and-play component into existing\nVITON methodologies, elevating their synthesis quality. Extensive experiments\non high-resolution VITON benchmarks and an in-the-wild test set demonstrate the\nsuperiority of WarpDiffusion, surpassing state-of-the-art methods both\nqualitatively and quantitatively.",

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among the\nmost promising algorithms but they are slow, often achieve poor classification\nin the field and typically require large training data sets. Our objective was\nto design CNNs that are fast at inference time and achieve good classification\nperformance while learning from moderate-sized data. Recordings from a\nrainforest ecosystem were used. Start and end-point of sounds from 20 bird\nspecies were manually annotated. Spectrograms from 10 second segments were used\nas CNN input. We designed simple CNNs with a frequency unwrapping layer\n(SIMP-FU models) such that any output unit was connected to all spectrogram\nfrequencies but only to a sub-region of time, the Receptive Field (RF). Our\nmodels allowed experimentation with different RF durations. Models either used\nthe time-indexed labels that encode start and end-point of sounds or simpler\nsegment-level labels. Models learning from time-indexed labels performed\nconsiderably better than their segment-level counterparts. Best classification\nperformances was achieved for models with intermediate RF duration of 1.5\nseconds. The best SIMP-FU models achieved AUCs over 0.95 in 18 of 20 classes on\nthe test set. On compact low-cost hardware the best SIMP-FU models evaluated up\nto seven times faster than real-time data acquisition. RF duration was a major\ndriver of classification performance. The optimum of 1.5 s was in the same\nrange as the duration of the sounds. Our models achieved good classification\nperformance while learning from moderate-sized training data. This is explained\nby the usage of time-indexed labels during training and adequately sized RF.\nResults confirm the feasibility of deploying small CNNs with good\nclassification performance on compact low-cost devices.",

In this simple model, we ignore any possible\ninvestment of the firm in pollution reducing technologies. We formulate the\nproblem of optimal production by a stochastic optimization problem. Then, we\nshow that, as expected, the market reduces the optimal production policy in the\nfirst case if the firm is not given a generous initial cheap allowance package.\nHowever, when the large producer activities can change the market risk premium,\nthe cut on the production and consequently pollution cannot be guaranteed. In\nfact, there are cases in this model when the optimal production is {\\it always}\nlarger than expected, and an increase in production, and thus pollution, can\nincrease the profit of the firm.

The scope of this research method is now\npoised to grow dramatically as it absorbs the new affordances provided by Large\nLanguage Models (LLM)s. Generative Agent-Based Models (GABM) are not just\nclassic Agent-Based Models (ABM)s where the agents talk to one another. Rather,\nGABMs are constructed using an LLM to apply common sense to situations, act\n\"reasonably\", recall common semantic knowledge, produce API calls to control\ndigital technologies like apps, and communicate both within the simulation and\nto researchers viewing it from the outside. Here we present Concordia, a\nlibrary to facilitate constructing and working with GABMs. Concordia makes it\neasy to construct language-mediated simulations of physically- or\ndigitally-grounded environments. Concordia agents produce their behavior using\na flexible component system which mediates between two fundamental operations:\nLLM calls and associative memory retrieval. A special agent called the Game\nMaster (GM), which was inspired by tabletop role-playing games, is responsible\nfor simulating the environment where the agents interact. Agents take actions\nby describing what they want to do in natural language. The GM then translates\ntheir actions into appropriate implementations. In a simulated physical world,\nthe GM checks the physical plausibility of agent actions and describes their\neffects. In digital environments simulating technologies such as apps and\nservices, the GM may handle API calls to integrate with external tools such as\ngeneral AI assistants (e.g., Bard, ChatGPT), and digital apps (e.g., Calendar,\nEmail, Search, etc.). Concordia was designed to support a wide array of\napplications both in scientific research and for evaluating performance of real\ndigital services by simulating users and/or generating synthetic data.",

To bridge this gap, we present Reason2Drive, a benchmark dataset with\nover 600K video-text pairs, aimed at facilitating the study of interpretable\nreasoning in complex driving environments. We distinctly characterize the\nautonomous driving process as a sequential combination of perception,\nprediction, and reasoning steps, and the question-answer pairs are\nautomatically collected from a diverse range of open-source outdoor driving\ndatasets, including nuScenes, Waymo and ONCE. Moreover, we introduce a novel\naggregated evaluation metric to assess chain-based reasoning performance in\nautonomous systems, addressing the semantic ambiguities of existing metrics\nsuch as BLEU and CIDEr. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conduct experiments\nto assess various existing VLMs, revealing insights into their reasoning\ncapabilities. Additionally, we develop an efficient approach to empower VLMs to\nleverage object-level perceptual elements in both feature extraction and\nprediction, further enhancing their reasoning accuracy.

We find that taking the\naverage of activations associated with a target dataset, and then subtracting\nthe mean of all training activations, results in effective steering vectors. We\ntest this method on a variety of models on natural language tasks by steering\naway from generating toxic text, and steering the completion of a story towards\na target genre. We also apply mean-centring to extract function vectors, more\neffectively triggering the execution of a range of natural language tasks by a\nsignificant margin (compared to previous baselines).

            "summary": "A common method to study deep learning systems is to use simplified model\nrepresentations -- for example, using singular value decomposition to visualize\nthe model's hidden states in a lower dimensional space. This approach assumes\nthat the results of these simplified are faithful to the original model. Here,\nwe illustrate an important caveat to this assumption: even if the simplified\nrepresentations can accurately approximate the full model on the training set,\nthey may fail to accurately capture the model's behavior out of distribution --\nthe understanding developed from simplified representations may be an illusion.\nWe illustrate this by training Transformer models on controlled datasets with\nsystematic generalization splits. First, we train models on the Dyck\nbalanced-parenthesis languages. We simplify these models using tools like\ndimensionality reduction and clustering, and then explicitly test how these\nsimplified proxies match the behavior of the original model on various\nout-of-distribution test sets. We find that the simplified proxies are\ngenerally less faithful out of distribution. In cases where the original model\ngeneralizes to novel structures or deeper depths, the simplified versions may\nfail, or generalize better. This finding holds even if the simplified\nrepresentations do not directly depend on the training distribution. Next, we\nstudy a more naturalistic task: predicting the next character in a dataset of\ncomputer code. We find similar generalization gaps between the original model\nand simplified proxies, and conduct further analysis to investigate which\naspects of the code completion task are associated with the largest gaps.\nTogether, our results raise questions about the extent to which mechanistic\ninterpretations derived using tools like SVD can reliably predict what a model\nwill do in novel situations.",

It leverages a machine learning model trained\nwith low-fidelity simulation data, in each optimization cycle, thereby\nproficiently predicting a target variable and discerning whether a\nhigh-fidelity simulation is necessitated, which notably conserves computational\nresources. Additionally, the machine learning model is strategically deployed\nprior to optimization to reduce the search space, thereby further accelerating\nconvergence toward the optimal solution. The methodology has been employed to\nenhance two optimization algorithms, namely Differential Evolution and Particle\nSwarm Optimization. Comparative analyses illustrate performance improvements\nacross both algorithms. Notably, this method is adeptly adaptable across any\ninverse design application, facilitating a harmonious synergy between a\nrepresentative low-fidelity machine learning model, and high-fidelity\nsimulation, and can be seamlessly applied across any variety of\npopulation-based optimization algorithms.",

Nevertheless, there is an ongoing discussion surrounding\nthe transition from an initial homogeneous and isotropic quantum state,\ncharacterizing the matter fields during inflation, to a classical\ninhomogeneous/anisotropic one, which gives rise to large-scale structure in the\nUniverse. To tackle this issue, in the present work we explore an inflationary\nscenario where quantum ``collapse'' (or reduction) occurs naturally during the\nevolution of the system; this model is inspired in the so called Continuous\nSpontaneous Localization (CSL) model. Our present work builds upon previous\nresults by considering the primordial power spectrum up to the second order in\nthe Hubble Flow Functions, where we perform an estimation of the model free\nparameters. By validating the predictions of the model against observational\ndata, we investigate whether this second-order calculation can explain the\nslight departure from the power law observed in the scalar spectral running\nindex.

However, P63's tissue damage and\nhigh cost necessitate alternative methods. This study introduces xAI-CycleGAN,\nan advanced architecture combining Mask CycleGAN with explainability features\nand structure-preserving capabilities for transforming H&E stained breast\ntissue images into P63-like images. The architecture allows for output editing,\nenhancing resemblance to actual images and enabling further model refinement.\nWe showcase xAI-CycleGAN's efficacy in maintaining structural integrity and\ngenerating high-quality images.

Of the many opportunities and challenges this presents, the\ncapacity for artificial agents to shape individual and collective human\ndecision-making in such environments is of particular importance. In order to\nassess and manage the impact of artificial agents on human well-being, we must\nconsider not only the technical capabilities of such agents, but the impact\nthey have on human social dynamics at the individual and population level. We\napproach this problem by modelling the potential for artificial agents to\n\"nudge\" attitudes to fairness and cooperation in populations of human agents,\nwho update their behavior according to a process of social learning. We show\nthat the presence of artificial agents in a population playing the ultimatum\ngame generates highly divergent, multi-stable outcomes in the learning dynamics\nof human agents' behaviour. These outcomes correspond to universal fairness\n(successful nudging), universal selfishness (failed nudging), and a strategy of\nfairness towards artificial agents and selfishness towards other human agents\n(unintended consequences of nudging). We then consider the consequences of\nhuman agents shifting their behavior when they are aware that they are\ninteracting with an artificial agent. We show that under a wide range of\ncircumstances artificial agents can achieve optimal outcomes in their\ninteractions with human agents while avoiding deception. However we also find\nthat, in the donation game, deception tends to make nudging easier to achieve.",

While independent learning in\nMARL offers flexibility and scalability, accurately assigning credit to\nindividual agents in offline settings poses challenges due to partial\nobservability and emergent behavior. Directly transferring the online credit\nassignment method to offline settings results in suboptimal outcomes due to the\nabsence of real-time feedback and intricate agent interactions. Our approach,\nMACCA, characterizing the generative process as a Dynamic Bayesian Network,\ncaptures relationships between environmental variables, states, actions, and\nrewards. Estimating this model on offline data, MACCA can learn each agent's\ncontribution by analyzing the causal relationship of their individual rewards,\nensuring accurate and interpretable credit assignment. Additionally, the\nmodularity of our approach allows it to seamlessly integrate with various\noffline MARL methods. Theoretically, we proved that under the setting of the\noffline dataset, the underlying causal structure and the function for\ngenerating the individual rewards of agents are identifiable, which laid the\nfoundation for the correctness of our modeling. Experimentally, we tested MACCA\nin two environments, including discrete and continuous action settings.

This approach becomes\ncomputationally expensive at long times, because of the convolution integrals\nand the large amount of computer memory needed to store the Green's functions.\nA recent idea for the compression of nonequilibrium Green's functions is the\nquantics tensor train representation. Here, we explore this approach by\nimplementing equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations of the two-dimensional\nHubbard model with a second-order weak-coupling approximation to the\nself-energy.

Accurate control\nof both camera and object motion is essential for video generation.

The architecture and training strategy of\nMotionCtrl are carefully devised, taking into account the inherent properties\nof camera motion, object motion, and imperfect training data. Compared to\nprevious methods, MotionCtrl offers three main advantages: 1) It effectively\nand independently controls camera motion and object motion, enabling more\nfine-grained motion control and facilitating flexible and diverse combinations\nof both types of motion. 2) Its motion conditions are determined by camera\nposes and trajectories, which are appearance-free and minimally impact the\nappearance or shape of objects in generated videos. 3) It is a relatively\ngeneralizable model that can adapt to a wide array of camera poses and\ntrajectories once trained.

            "summary": "In evolving cyber landscapes, the detection of malicious URLs calls for\ncooperation and knowledge sharing across domains. However, collaboration is\noften hindered by concerns over privacy and business sensitivities. Federated\nlearning addresses these issues by enabling multi-clients collaboration without\ndirect data exchange. Unfortunately, if highly expressive Transformer models\nare used, clients may face intolerable computational burdens, and the exchange\nof weights could quickly deplete network bandwidth. In this paper, we propose\nFed-urlBERT, a federated URL pre-trained model designed to address both privacy\nconcerns and the need for cross-domain collaboration in cybersecurity.\nFed-urlBERT leverages split learning to divide the pre-training model into\nclient and server part, so that the client part takes up less extensive\ncomputation resources and bandwidth. Our appraoch achieves performance\ncomparable to centralized model under both independently and identically\ndistributed (IID) and two non-IID data scenarios. Significantly, our federated\nmodel shows about an 7% decrease in the FPR compared to the centralized model.\nAdditionally, we implement an adaptive local aggregation strategy that\nmitigates heterogeneity among clients, demonstrating promising performance\nimprovements. Overall, our study validates the applicability of the proposed\nTransformer federated learning for URL threat analysis, establishing a\nfoundation for real-world collaborative cybersecurity efforts.

            "summary": "The \"Reversal Curse\" refers to the scenario where auto-regressive decoder\nlarge language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, trained on \"A is B\" fail to\nlearn \"B is A\", demonstrating a basic failure of logical deduction. This raises\na red flag in the use of GPT models for certain general tasks such as\nconstructing knowledge graphs, considering their adherence to this symmetric\nprinciple. In our study, we examined a bidirectional LLM, BERT, and found that\nit is immune to the reversal curse. Driven by ongoing efforts to construct\nbiomedical knowledge graphs with LLMs, we also embarked on evaluating more\ncomplex but essential deductive reasoning capabilities. This process included\nfirst training encoder and decoder language models to master the intersection\n($\\cap$) and union ($\\cup$) operations on two sets and then moving on to assess\ntheir capability to infer different combinations of union ($\\cup$) and\nintersection ($\\cap$) operations on three newly created sets. The findings\nshowed that while both encoder and decoder language models, trained for tasks\ninvolving two sets (union/intersection), were proficient in such scenarios,\nthey encountered difficulties when dealing with operations that included three\nsets (various combinations of union and intersection). Our research highlights\nthe distinct characteristics of encoder and decoder models in simple and\ncomplex logical reasoning. In practice, the choice between BERT and GPT should\nbe guided by the specific requirements and nature of the task at hand,\nleveraging their respective strengths in bidirectional context comprehension\nand sequence prediction.",

We\naddress this task by combining 1-best hypotheses and decoder signals from an\nautomatic speech recognition system with acoustic representations from an audio\nencoder as input features to a large language model (LLM). In particular, we\nare interested in data and resource efficient systems that require only a small\namount of training data and can operate in scenarios with only a single frozen\nLLM available on a device. For this reason, our model is trained on 80k or less\nexamples of multimodal data using a combination of low-rank adaptation and\nprefix tuning. We compare the proposed system to unimodal baselines and show\nthat the multimodal approach achieves lower equal-error-rates (EERs), while\nusing only a fraction of the training data.

Dedicated methods for reducing hallucinations in image\ncaptioning largely focus on closed-vocabulary object tokens, ignoring most\ntypes of hallucinations that occur in practice. In this work, we propose MOCHa,\nan approach that harnesses advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) to\naddress the sequence-level nature of hallucinations in an open-world setup. To\noptimize for caption fidelity to the input image, we leverage ground-truth\nreference captions as proxies to measure the logical consistency of generated\ncaptions. However, optimizing for caption fidelity alone fails to preserve the\nsemantic adequacy of generations; therefore, we propose a multi-objective\nreward function that jointly targets these qualities, without requiring any\nstrong supervision. We demonstrate that these goals can be simultaneously\noptimized with our framework, enhancing performance for various captioning\nmodels of different scales. Our qualitative and quantitative results\ndemonstrate MOCHa's superior performance across various established metrics. We\nalso demonstrate the benefit of our method in the open-vocabulary setting. To\nthis end, we contribute OpenCHAIR, a new benchmark for quantifying\nopen-vocabulary hallucinations in image captioning models, constructed using\ngenerative foundation models.

First, a regime in which the characteristic time and\nlength scales diverge as a power law at a critical temperature $T_c$. This\nregime is found by an approximation that neglects activated relaxation\nchannels, which can be interpreted as akin to the one found by the\nmode-coupling transition of glasses.

These\nprocesses can enrich in unexplored ways the phase diagram of well-established\nmodels.

The ResNet models treat the time and\nfrequency dimensions equally. They follow the default stride configuration\ndesigned for image recognition, where the horizontal and vertical axes exhibit\nsimilarities. This approach ignores the fact that time and frequency are\nasymmetric in speech representation. In this paper, we address this issue and\nlook for optimal stride configurations specifically tailored for speaker\nverification. We represent the stride space on a trellis diagram, and conduct a\nsystematic study on the impact of temporal and frequency resolutions on the\nperformance and further identify two optimal points, namely Golden Gemini,\nwhich serves as a guiding principle for designing 2D ResNet-based speaker\nverification models. By following the principle, a state-of-the-art ResNet\nbaseline model gains a significant performance improvement on VoxCeleb, SITW,\nand CNCeleb datasets with 7.70%/11.76% average EER/minDCF reductions,\nrespectively, across different network depths (ResNet18, 34, 50, and 101),\nwhile reducing the number of parameters by 16.5% and FLOPs by 4.1%. We refer to\nit as Gemini ResNet. Further investigation reveals the efficacy of the proposed\nGolden Gemini operating points across various training conditions and\narchitectures. Furthermore, we present a new benchmark, namely the Gemini\nDF-ResNet, using a cutting-edge model.",

Finally the target view features extracted from\nmulti-view inputs are injected into a pre-trained diffusion model.

            "summary": "Designing civil structures such as bridges, dams or buildings is a complex\ntask requiring many synergies from several experts. Each is responsible for\ndifferent parts of the process. This is often done in a sequential manner, e.g.\nthe structural engineer makes a design under the assumption of certain material\nproperties (e.g. the strength class of the concrete), and then the material\nengineer optimizes the material with these restrictions. This paper proposes a\nholistic optimization procedure, which combines the concrete mixture design and\nstructural simulations in a joint, forward workflow that we ultimately seek to\ninvert. In this manner, new mixtures beyond standard ranges can be considered.\nAny design effort should account for the presence of uncertainties which can be\naleatoric or epistemic as when data is used to calibrate physical models or\nidentify models that fill missing links in the workflow. Inverting the causal\nrelations established poses several challenges especially when these involve\nphysics-based models which most often than not do not provide\nderivatives/sensitivities or when design constraints are present. To this end,\nwe advocate Variational Optimization, with proposed extensions and\nappropriately chosen heuristics to overcome the aforementioned challenges. The\nproposed methodology is illustrated using the design of a precast concrete beam\nwith the objective to minimize the global warming potential while satisfying a\nnumber of constraints associated with its load-bearing capacity after 28days\naccording to the Eurocode, the demoulding time as computed by a complex\nnonlinear Finite Element model, and the maximum temperature during the\nhydration.",

This shortcoming has been attributed to a lack of sufficiently\npowerful multimodal data augmentation. To address this, we present SurfaceAug,\na novel ground truth sampling algorithm. SurfaceAug pastes objects by\nresampling both images and point clouds, enabling object-level transformations\nin both modalities. We evaluate our algorithm by training a multimodal detector\non KITTI and compare its performance to previous works.

This paper presents a novel control strategy\nusing nonlinear model predictive controller embedded with a complex droop\ncontrol architecture for voltage restoration and power sharing in medium\nvoltage DC (MVDC) Naval MGs. The complex droop control ensures allocating\nsupercapacitors (SCs) for high-frequency loads (i.e., PPLs), while battery\nenergy storage system (BESS) and auxiliary generators share the steady-state\nload (i.e., CPL). Compared to state-of-the-art control of the naval ship MGs\nthat relies on linear models, the proposed method incorporates the nonlinear\nbehavior of the MGs in the closed-loop control framework via nonlinear model\npredictive control (NMPC). A reduced order representation of the MVDC dynamic\nis employed as the prediction model, augmented with a multi-objective,\nconstraints-based, optimal control formulation.

            "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-motion generation using diffusion and\nautoregressive models have shown promising results. However, these models often\nsuffer from a trade-off between real-time performance, high fidelity, and\nmotion editability. To address this gap, we introduce MMM, a novel yet simple\nmotion generation paradigm based on Masked Motion Model. MMM consists of two\nkey components: (1) a motion tokenizer that transforms 3D human motion into a\nsequence of discrete tokens in latent space, and (2) a conditional masked\nmotion transformer that learns to predict randomly masked motion tokens,\nconditioned on the pre-computed text tokens. By attending to motion and text\ntokens in all directions, MMM explicitly captures inherent dependency among\nmotion tokens and semantic mapping between motion and text tokens. During\ninference, this allows parallel and iterative decoding of multiple motion\ntokens that are highly consistent with fine-grained text descriptions,\ntherefore simultaneously achieving high-fidelity and high-speed motion\ngeneration. In addition, MMM has innate motion editability. By simply placing\nmask tokens in the place that needs editing, MMM automatically fills the gaps\nwhile guaranteeing smooth transitions between editing and non-editing parts.\nExtensive experiments on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMM\nsurpasses current leading methods in generating high-quality motion (evidenced\nby superior FID scores of 0.08 and 0.429), while offering advanced editing\nfeatures such as body-part modification, motion in-betweening, and the\nsynthesis of long motion sequences. In addition, MMM is two orders of magnitude\nfaster on a single mid-range GPU than editable motion diffusion models. Our\nproject page is available at \\url{https://exitudio.github.io/MMM-page}.",

Existing methods face difficulties in simultaneously\naddressing context-aware image inpainting and text-guided object inpainting due\nto the distinct optimal training strategies required. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce PowerPaint, the first high-quality and versatile\ninpainting model that excels in both tasks. First, we introduce learnable task\nprompts along with tailored fine-tuning strategies to guide the model's focus\non different inpainting targets explicitly. This enables PowerPaint to\naccomplish various inpainting tasks by utilizing different task prompts,\nresulting in state-of-the-art performance. Second, we demonstrate the\nversatility of the task prompt in PowerPaint by showcasing its effectiveness as\na negative prompt for object removal. Additionally, we leverage prompt\ninterpolation techniques to enable controllable shape-guided object inpainting.\nFinally, we extensively evaluate PowerPaint on various inpainting benchmarks to\ndemonstrate its superior performance for versatile image inpainting.

In this work, our goal is\nto learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply\ndistilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a\nset of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of\nlanguage-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input\nimage through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better\ndisentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings\nto a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings\nalong various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate\nimages with novel compositions of visual concepts.

To address this, we propose a novel framework that separates\nthe encoding of the visual context and preserving the structure of the query\nimages. This results in the ability to learn from the visual context and text\nprompts, but also from either one of them. Furthermore, we enable our model to\nhandle few-shot settings, to effectively address diverse in-context learning\nscenarios.

            "summary": "Biases in the dataset often enable the model to achieve high performance on\nin-distribution data, while poorly performing on out-of-distribution data. To\nmitigate the detrimental effect of the bias on the networks, previous works\nhave proposed debiasing methods that down-weight the biased examples identified\nby an auxiliary model, which is trained with explicit bias labels. However,\nfinding a type of bias in datasets is a costly process. Therefore, recent\nstudies have attempted to make the auxiliary model biased without the guidance\n(or annotation) of bias labels, by constraining the model's training\nenvironment or the capability of the model itself. Despite the promising\ndebiasing results of recent works, the multi-class learning objective, which\nhas been naively used to train the auxiliary model, may harm the bias\nmitigation effect due to its regularization effect and competitive nature\nacross classes. As an alternative, we propose a new debiasing framework that\nintroduces binary classifiers between the auxiliary model and the main model,\ncoined bias experts. Specifically, each bias expert is trained on a binary\nclassification task derived from the multi-class classification task via the\nOne-vs-Rest approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed\nstrategy improves the bias identification ability of the auxiliary model.\nConsequently, our debiased model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art\non various challenge datasets.",

By the observation of intermittent jets, we want to understand\nthe causes of periodic eruption characteristics. Methods. We report\nintermittent jets observed by the GST. The analysis was aided by 1400 {\\AA} and\n2796 {\\AA} data from IRIS.These observational instruments allowed us to analyze\nthe temporal characteristics of jet events. Results. The jet continued for up\nto 4 hours. The time distance diagram shows that the peak of the jet has\nobviously periodic eruption characteristics (5 minutes) during 18:00 UT-18:50\nUT. We also found periodic brightening phenomenon (5 minutes) during jets\nbursts in the observed bands in the Transition Region (1400 {\\AA} and 2796\n{\\AA}), which may be a response to intermittent jets in the upper solar\natmosphere.The time lag is 3 minutes. Evolutionary images in the TiO band\nrevealed the horizontal movement of granulation at the location of jet.\nCompared to the quiet region of the Sun, we found that the footpoint of the jet\nis enhanced at the center of the H {\\alpha} spectral line profile, with no\nsignificant changes in the line wings. This suggests the presence of prolonged\nheating at the footpoint of the jet. In the mixed-polarity magnetic field\nregion of the jet, we observed magnetic flux emergence, cancellation, and shear\nindicating possible intermittent magnetic reconnection. That is confirmed by\nthe NLFFF model reconstructed using the magneto-friction method. Conclusions.\nThe multi-wavelength analysis indicates that the events we studied were\ntriggered by magnetic reconnection caused by mixed-polarity magnetic fields. We\nsuggest that the horizontal motion of the granulation in the photosphere drives\nthe magnetic reconnection, which is modulated by p-mode oscillations.",

We propose DocBinFormer (Document Binarization\nTransformer), a novel two-level vision transformer (TL-ViT) architecture based\non vision transformers for effective document image binarization. The presented\narchitecture employs a two-level transformer encoder to effectively capture\nboth global and local feature representation from the input images. These\ncomplimentary bi-level features are exploited for efficient document image\nbinarization, resulting in improved results for system-generated as well as\nhandwritten document images in a comprehensive approach. With the absence of\nconvolutional layers, the transformer encoder uses the pixel patches and\nsub-patches along with their positional information to operate directly on\nthem, while the decoder generates a clean (binarized) output image from the\nlatent representation of the patches. Instead of using a simple vision\ntransformer block to extract information from the image patches, the proposed\narchitecture uses two transformer blocks for greater coverage of the extracted\nfeature space on a global and local scale. The encoded feature representation\nis used by the decoder block to generate the corresponding binarized output.\nExtensive experiments on a variety of DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks show that\nthe proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four metrics.

This\ntechnique has recently been extended to the baryonic sector. In this work\ndifferent ways of implementing this approach for baryon correlators are\nexamined. Using both real and synthetic data it is found that for heavy\nbaryons, such as the $\\Xi_{cc}(ccu)$ baryon, different choices are equivalent\nand that for the lighter nucleon the effect of different implementations is\nminimal.

            "summary": "Face inpainting is important in various applications, such as photo\nrestoration, image editing, and virtual reality. Despite the significant\nadvances in face generative models, ensuring that a person's unique facial\nidentity is maintained during the inpainting process is still an elusive goal.\nCurrent state-of-the-art techniques, exemplified by MyStyle, necessitate\nresource-intensive fine-tuning and a substantial number of images for each new\nidentity. Furthermore, existing methods often fall short in accommodating\nuser-specified semantic attributes, such as beard or expression. To improve\ninpainting results, and reduce the computational complexity during inference,\nthis paper proposes the use of Parallel Visual Attention (PVA) in conjunction\nwith diffusion models. Specifically, we insert parallel attention matrices to\neach cross-attention module in the denoising network, which attends to features\nextracted from reference images by an identity encoder. We train the added\nattention modules and identity encoder on CelebAHQ-IDI, a dataset proposed for\nidentity-preserving face inpainting. Experiments demonstrate that PVA attains\nunparalleled identity resemblance in both face inpainting and face inpainting\nwith language guidance tasks, in comparison to various benchmarks, including\nMyStyle, Paint by Example, and Custom Diffusion. Our findings reveal that PVA\nensures good identity preservation while offering effective\nlanguage-controllability. Additionally, in contrast to Custom Diffusion, PVA\nrequires just 40 fine-tuning steps for each new identity, which translates to a\nsignificant speed increase of over 20 times.",

We propose three methods to identify prototypical samples\nfrom a large dataset of in-distribution samples.

However, training these models\ncan incur significant expenses, often requiring tens of thousands of GPUs for\nmonths of continuous operation. Typically, this training is carried out in\nspecialized GPU clusters equipped with homogeneous high-speed Remote Direct\nMemory Access (RDMA) network interface cards (NICs). The acquisition and\nmaintenance of such dedicated clusters is challenging. Current LLM training\nframeworks, like Megatron-LM and Megatron-DeepSpeed, focus primarily on\noptimizing training within homogeneous cluster settings. In this paper, we\nintroduce Holmes, a training framework for LLMs that employs thoughtfully\ncrafted data and model parallelism strategies over the heterogeneous NIC\nenvironment. Our primary technical contribution lies in a novel scheduling\nmethod that intelligently allocates distinct computational tasklets in LLM\ntraining to specific groups of GPU devices based on the characteristics of\ntheir connected NICs. Furthermore, our proposed framework, utilizing pipeline\nparallel techniques, demonstrates scalability to multiple GPU clusters, even in\nscenarios without high-speed interconnects between nodes in distinct clusters.\nWe conducted comprehensive experiments that involved various scenarios in the\nheterogeneous NIC environment. In most cases, our framework achieves\nperformance levels close to those achievable with homogeneous RDMA-capable\nnetworks (InfiniBand or RoCE), significantly exceeding training efficiency\nwithin the pure Ethernet environment.

            "summary": "Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) has\nbecome increasingly popular recently. Due to the characteristics of ORSIs,\nORSI-SOD is full of challenges, such as multiple objects, small objects, low\nilluminations, and irregular shapes. To address these challenges, we propose a\nconcise yet effective Texture-Semantic Collaboration Network (TSCNet) to\nexplore the collaboration of texture cues and semantic cues for ORSI-SOD.\nSpecifically, TSCNet is based on the generic encoder-decoder structure. In\naddition to the encoder and decoder, TSCNet includes a vital Texture-Semantic\nCollaboration Module (TSCM), which performs valuable feature modulation and\ninteraction on basic features extracted from the encoder. The main idea of our\nTSCM is to make full use of the texture features at the lowest level and the\nsemantic features at the highest level to achieve the expression enhancement of\nsalient regions on features. In the TSCM, we first enhance the position of\npotential salient regions using semantic features. Then, we render and restore\nthe object details using the texture features. Meanwhile, we also perceive\nregions of various scales, and construct interactions between different\nregions. Thanks to the perfect combination of TSCM and generic structure, our\nTSCNet can take care of both the position and details of salient objects,\neffectively handling various scenes. Extensive experiments on three datasets\ndemonstrate that our TSCNet achieves competitive performance compared to 14\nstate-of-the-art methods.

            "summary": "Training autonomous agents that can learn new tasks from only a handful of\ndemonstrations is a long-standing problem in machine learning. Recently,\ntransformers have been shown to learn new language or vision tasks without any\nweight updates from only a few examples, also referred to as in-context\nlearning. However, the sequential decision making setting poses additional\nchallenges having a lower tolerance for errors since the environment's\nstochasticity or the agent's actions can lead to unseen, and sometimes\nunrecoverable, states. In this paper, we use an illustrative example to show\nthat naively applying transformers to sequential decision making problems does\nnot enable in-context learning of new tasks. We then demonstrate how training\non sequences of trajectories with certain distributional properties leads to\nin-context learning of new sequential decision making tasks. We investigate\ndifferent design choices and find that larger model and dataset sizes, as well\nas more task diversity, environment stochasticity, and trajectory burstiness,\nall result in better in-context learning of new out-of-distribution tasks. By\ntraining on large diverse offline datasets, our model is able to learn new\nMiniHack and Procgen tasks without any weight updates from just a handful of\ndemonstrations.",

So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and\nantisolitons towards opposite directions. Here we introduce a local driving\nmechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the\nsame direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we\nconstruct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally\ncoupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such\nnonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations -- so-called non-Hermitian skin\nwaves, which are typically unstable -- into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We\nrationalize our observations by introducing non-reciprocal generalizations of\nthe Frenkel-Kontorova and sine-Gordon models, and use the latter to predict the\nterminal velocity of the (anti)solitons and determine their stability. Finally,\nwe harness non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active\nwaveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information.\nMore broadly, our findings suggest that non-reciprocal driving is a robust\nmechanism to steer nonlinear waves and could be generalized beyond mechanics,\ne.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter.",

            "summary": "In the field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), accurately discerning commander\nintent and executing linguistic commands within a visual context presents a\nsignificant challenge. This paper introduces a sophisticated encoder-decoder\nframework, developed to address visual grounding in AVs.Our Context-Aware\nVisual Grounding (CAVG) model is an advanced system that integrates five core\nencoders-Text, Image, Context, and Cross-Modal-with a Multimodal decoder. This\nintegration enables the CAVG model to adeptly capture contextual semantics and\nto learn human emotional features, augmented by state-of-the-art Large Language\nModels (LLMs) including GPT-4. The architecture of CAVG is reinforced by the\nimplementation of multi-head cross-modal attention mechanisms and a\nRegion-Specific Dynamic (RSD) layer for attention modulation. This\narchitectural design enables the model to efficiently process and interpret a\nrange of cross-modal inputs, yielding a comprehensive understanding of the\ncorrelation between verbal commands and corresponding visual scenes. Empirical\nevaluations on the Talk2Car dataset, a real-world benchmark, demonstrate that\nCAVG establishes new standards in prediction accuracy and operational\nefficiency. Notably, the model exhibits exceptional performance even with\nlimited training data, ranging from 50% to 75% of the full dataset. This\nfeature highlights its effectiveness and potential for deployment in practical\nAV applications. Moreover, CAVG has shown remarkable robustness and\nadaptability in challenging scenarios, including long-text command\ninterpretation, low-light conditions, ambiguous command contexts, inclement\nweather conditions, and densely populated urban environments. The code for the\nproposed model is available at our Github.",

On the other hand, smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH) method, a popular meshless alternative, inherently circumvents the mesh\ngeneration and yields smoother numerical outcomes but at the expense of\ncomputational efficiency. Therefore, numerous researchers have strategically\namalgamated the strengths of both methods to investigate complex flow phenomena\nand this synergy has yielded precise and computationally efficient outcomes.\nHowever, algorithms involving the weak coupling of these two methods tend to be\nintricate, which has issues pertaining to versatility, implementation, and\nmutual adaptation to hardware and coding structures. Thus, achieving a robust\nand strong coupling of FVM and SPH in a unified framework is imperative. Due to\ndiffering boundary algorithms between these methods in Wang's work, the crucial\nstep for establishing a strong coupling of both methods within a unified SPH\nframework lies in incorporating the FVM boundary algorithm into the Eulerian\nSPH method. In this paper, we propose a straightforward algorithm in the\nEulerian SPH method, algorithmically equivalent to that in FVM, grounded in the\nprinciple of zero-order consistency. Moreover, several numerical examples,\nincluding fully and weakly compressible flows with various boundary conditions\nin the Eulerian SPH method, validate the stability and accuracy of the proposed\nalgorithm.",

This inadequacy renders them impractical for applications\nrequiring realistic food imagery, such as training models for image-based\ndietary assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce FoodFusion, a\nLatent Diffusion model engineered specifically for the faithful synthesis of\nrealistic food images from textual descriptions.

Additionally,\nwe propose and employ two distinct data cleaning methodologies to ensure that\nthe resulting image-text pairs maintain both realism and accuracy. The\nFoodFusion model, thus trained, demonstrates a remarkable ability to generate\nfood images that exhibit a significant improvement in terms of both realism and\ndiversity over the publicly available image generation models.

The drive to establish this requirement often leads to the inclusion\nof irrelevant variables in the model.

We establish a complete\nclass theorem by characterizing sequential rationality via the new Conditional\nB-Dominance.

            "summary": "Researchers in natural science need reliable methods for quantifying animal\nbehavior. Recently, numerous computer vision methods emerged to automate the\nprocess. However, observing wild species at remote locations remains a\nchallenging task due to difficult lighting conditions and constraints on power\nsupply and data storage. Event cameras offer unique advantages for\nbattery-dependent remote monitoring due to their low power consumption and high\ndynamic range capabilities. We use this novel sensor to quantify a behavior in\nChinstrap penguins called ecstatic display. We formulate the problem as a\ntemporal action detection task, determining the start and end times of the\nbehavior. For this purpose, we recorded a colony of breeding penguins in\nAntarctica during several weeks and labeled event data on 16 nests. The\ndeveloped method consists of a generator of candidate time intervals\n(proposals) and a classifier of the actions within them. The experiments show\nthat the event cameras' natural response to motion is effective for continuous\nbehavior monitoring and detection, reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of\n58% (which increases to 63% in good weather conditions). The results also\ndemonstrate the robustness against various lighting conditions contained in the\nchallenging dataset. The low-power capabilities of the event camera allows to\nrecord three times longer than with a conventional camera. This work pioneers\nthe use of event cameras for remote wildlife observation, opening new\ninterdisciplinary opportunities. https://tub-rip.github.io/eventpenguins/",

            "summary": "In this thesis, we focus on the problem of validating and benchmarking\nquantum annealers. To this end, we propose two algorithms for solving\nreal-world problems and test how they perform on the current generation of\nquantum annealers. The first algorithm allows for solving the dynamics of\nquantum systems (or, in fact, any dynamical systems). The second of the\nproposed algorithms is suitable for solving a particular family of railway\ndispatching problems. We assess the performance of those algorithms on the\ncurrent generation of D-Wave quantum annealers with the assistance of two\nnovel, classical strategies for solving an Ising model also presented in the\nthesis. The first, tensor network-based approach is a heuristic algorithm\ntailored for solving instances defined on Chimera-like graphs, thus making it\nideal for providing a baseline with which the results from physical annealers\ncan be compared. The other presented approach is a massively parallel\nimplementation of the exhaustive (brute-force) search through the whole\nsolution space. Although the brute-force approach is limited to moderate\ninstance sizes, it has the advantage of being able to compute the low energy\nspectrum and certify the solutions. Our results suggest that present-day\nquantum annealers are able to solve a subset of the aforementioned problems. In\nparticular, we show that the D-Wave annealers are capable of capturing the\ndynamics of a simple quantum system in a specific regime of parameters, and can\nbe used to obtain good-quality solutions for instances of railway conflict\nmanagement problems. Finally, our findings indicate that the current generation\nof D-Wave annealers is far from perfect. We discuss problem instances for which\nthe annealers failed to find a good or even feasible solution. We also provide,\nwhere possible, a plausible explanation of why some of the presented problems\nmight be hard for the annealers.",

To learn the reflection intensity\nprior, we introduce the Reflection Prior Extraction Network (RPEN). By\nsegmenting images into regional patches, RPEN learns non-uniform reflection\nprior in an image.

In the gravity dual of the Weyl\ntransformed CFT, the so-called cutoff brane induced by the Weyl transformation\nplays the same role as the KR brane. Unlike the non-fluctuating configuration,\nin the $2d$ effective theory the additional twist operator is inserted at a\ndifferent places, compared with the one inserted on the brane. Though this is\nwell-understood in the Weyl transformed CFT set-up, it is confusing in the\nAdS/BCFT set-up where the effective theory is supposed to locate on the brane.\nThis confusion indicates that the KR brane may be emergent from the boundary\nCFT$_2$ via the Weyl transformations.\n  We also calculate the balanced partial entanglement (BPE) in the fluctuating\nbrane configurations and find it coincide with the entanglement wedge\ncross-section (EWCS).

We employ holographic duality in order to construct such a\nstate and study its thermoelectric transport, fermionic spectral function and\nthe sign of the Meissner effect. We uncover the unusual features of this\n\"timelike superconductor\": the absence of the gap in the fermionic spectrum and\nco-existence of Drude peak and supercurrent in the AC transport, which are\nreminiscent to those of time-reversal-odd and gapless superconductors,\ncorrespondingly. We show that this state is dynamically stable and\nthermodynamically at least metastable. Along the way we develop the holographic\nmodel of the charged vector field, which acquires mass due to a variant of the\nStueckelberg mechanism with the adjoint Higgs field.",

Owing to inherent noise and distribution gaps across different\nmodalities, MBTS can be complex to model. Various deep learning models have\nbeen developed to learn representations of MBTS but still fall short in\nrobustness due to the ignorance of modal-to-modal variations. This paper\npresents a multi-scale and multi-modal biomedical time series representation\nlearning (MBSL) network with contrastive learning to migrate these variations.\nFirstly, MBTS is grouped based on inter-modal distances, then each group with\nminimum intra-modal variations can be effectively modeled by individual\nencoders. Besides, to enhance the multi-scale feature extraction (encoder),\nvarious patch lengths and mask ratios are designed to generate tokens with\nsemantic information at different scales and diverse contextual perspectives\nrespectively. Finally, cross-modal contrastive learning is proposed to maximize\nconsistency among inter-modal groups, maintaining useful information and\neliminating noises. Experiments against four bio-medical applications show that\nMBSL outperforms state-of-the-art models by 33.9% mean average errors (MAE) in\nrespiration rate, by 13.8% MAE in exercise heart rate, by 1.41% accuracy in\nhuman activity recognition, and by 1.14% F1-score in obstructive sleep\napnea-hypopnea syndrome.",

The utilization of\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, has shown promise in\naiding wildfire management efforts. This work focuses on the development of an\noptimal wildfire escape route planning system specifically designed for drones,\nconsidering dynamic fire and smoke models. First, the location of the source of\nthe wildfire can be well located by information fusion between UAV and\nsatellite, and the road conditions in the vicinity of the fire can be assessed\nand analyzed using multi-channel remote sensing data. Second, the road network\ncan be extracted and segmented in real time using UAV vision technology, and\neach road in the road network map can be given priority based on the results of\nroad condition classification. Third, the spread model of dynamic fires\ncalculates the new location of the fire source based on the fire intensity,\nwind speed and direction, and the radius increases as the wildfire spreads.\nSmoke is generated around the fire source to create a visual representation of\na burning fire. Finally, based on the improved A* algorithm, which considers\nall the above factors, the UAV can quickly plan an escape route based on the\nstarting and destination locations that avoid the location of the fire source\nand the area where it is spreading. By considering dynamic fire and smoke\nmodels, the proposed system enhances the safety and efficiency of drone\noperations in wildfire environments.",

While several studies have\nattempted to address this issue by reducing the number of score function\nevaluations using advanced ODE solvers without fine-tuning, the decreased\nnumber of denoising iterations misses the opportunity to update fine details,\nresulting in noticeable quality degradation. In our work, we introduce an\nadvanced acceleration technique that leverages the temporal redundancy inherent\nin diffusion models.

To\nrealize the practical benefits of this intuition, we conduct an extensive\nanalysis and propose a novel method, FRDiff.

Based on the\nscenario of decoding the mysterious $Y(4220)$, $Y(4360)$, and $\\psi(4415)$\nstates as the $S$-wave deeply bound $D \\bar D_1$, $D^* \\bar D_1$, and $D^* \\bar\nD_2^*$ molecules, respectively, we predict the existence of charmonium-like\nmolecular resonances by utilizing the one-boson-exchange model and the complex\nscaling method. A conclusive finding is that the existence of deeply bound\ncharmonium-like molecules must indicate the existence of $S$-wave deeply bound\n$C$-parity partners. While no radially excited $S$-wave resonances were found,\nour results suggest the existence of $P$-wave $D \\bar D_1$, $D^* \\bar D_1$, and\n$D^* \\bar D_2^*$ molecular resonances. We expect future experiments to search\nfor such molecular resonances predicted here, which will not only enrich the\nongoing construction of \"Particle Zoo 2.0\" but also provide a crucial hint to\nscrutinize the assignments of hadronic molecules to the $Y(4220)$, $Y(4360)$,\nand $\\psi(4415)$ states.",

            "summary": "Text-to-3D model adaptations have advanced static 3D model quality, but\nsequential 3D model generation, particularly for animatable objects with large\nmotions, is still scarce. Our work proposes AnimatableDreamer, a text-to-4D\ngeneration framework capable of generating diverse categories of non-rigid\nobjects while adhering to the object motions extracted from a monocular video.\nAt its core, AnimatableDreamer is equipped with our novel optimization design\ndubbed Canonical Score Distillation (CSD), which simplifies the generation\ndimension from 4D to 3D by denoising over different frames in the time-varying\ncamera spaces while conducting the distillation process in a unique canonical\nspace shared per video. Concretely, CSD ensures that score gradients\nback-propagate to the canonical space through differentiable warping, hence\nguaranteeing the time-consistent generation and maintaining morphological\nplausibility across different poses. By lifting the 3D generator to 4D with\nwarping functions, AnimatableDreamer offers a novel perspective on non-rigid 3D\nmodel generation and reconstruction. Besides, with inductive knowledge from a\nmulti-view consistent diffusion model, CSD regularizes reconstruction from\nnovel views, thus cyclically enhancing the generation process. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the capability of our method in generating\nhigh-flexibility text-guided 3D models from the monocular video, while also\nshowing improved reconstruction performance over typical non-rigid\nreconstruction methods.

The predominant approach of fitting a large neural network and then\npruning it to a reduced size has commonly neglected shortcomings. The produced\nsurrogate models often will not capture the sensitivities and uncertainties\ninherent in the original model. In particular, (higher-order) derivative\ninformation of such surrogates could differ drastically. Given a large enough\nnetwork, we expect this derivative information to match. However, the pruned\nmodel will almost certainly not share this behavior.\n  In this paper, we propose to find surrogate models by using sensitivity\ninformation throughout the learning and pruning process. We build on work using\nInterval Adjoint Significance Analysis for pruning and combine it with the\nrecent advancements in Sobolev Training to accurately model the original\nsensitivity information in the pruned neural network based surrogate model. We\nexperimentally underpin the method on an example of pricing a multidimensional\nBasket option modelled through a stochastic differential equation with Brownian\nmotion. The proposed method is, however, not limited to the domain of\nquantitative finance, which was chosen as a case study for intuitive\ninterpretations of the sensitivities. It serves as a foundation for building\nfurther surrogate modelling techniques considering sensitivity information.",

High-resolution observations of\nlow-redshift clumpy galaxy analogues are rare and restricted to a limited set\nof galaxies but the increasing availability of wide-field galaxy survey data\nmakes the detection of large clumpy galaxy samples increasingly feasible. Deep\nLearning, and in particular CNNs, have been successfully applied to image\nclassification tasks in astrophysical data analysis. However, one application\nof DL that remains relatively unexplored is that of automatically identifying\nand localising specific objects or features in astrophysical imaging data. In\nthis paper we demonstrate the feasibility of using Deep learning-based object\ndetection models to localise GSFCs in astrophysical imaging data. We apply the\nFaster R-CNN object detection framework (FRCNN) to identify GSFCs in low\nredshift (z<0.3) galaxies. Unlike other studies, we train different FRCNN\nmodels not on simulated images with known labels but on real observational data\nthat was collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy Survey and labelled\nby volunteers from the citizen science project `Galaxy Zoo: Clump Scout'. The\nFRCNN model relies on a CNN component as a `backbone' feature extractor. We\nshow that CNNs, that have been pre-trained for image classification using\nastrophysical images, outperform those that have been pre-trained on\nterrestrial images. In particular, we compare a domain-specific CNN -`Zoobot' -\nwith a generic classification backbone and find that Zoobot achieves higher\ndetection performance and also requires smaller training data sets to do so.\nOur final model is capable of producing GSFC detections with a completeness and\npurity of >=0.8 while only being trained on ~5,000 galaxy images.",

            "summary": "The success of large language models has inspired the computer vision\ncommunity to explore image segmentation foundation model that is able to\nzero/few-shot generalize through prompt engineering. Segment-Anything(SAM),\namong others, is the state-of-the-art image segmentation foundation model\ndemonstrating strong zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the success, recent\nstudies reveal the weakness of SAM under strong distribution shift. In\nparticular, SAM performs awkwardly on corrupted natural images, camouflaged\nimages, medical images, etc. Motivated by the observations, we aim to develop a\nself-training based strategy to adapt SAM to target distribution. Given the\nunique challenges of large source dataset, high computation cost and incorrect\npseudo label, we propose a weakly supervised self-training architecture with\nanchor regularization and low-rank finetuning to improve the robustness and\ncomputation efficiency of adaptation. We validate the effectiveness on 5 types\nof downstream segmentation tasks including natural clean/corrupted images,\nmedical images, camouflaged images and robotic images. Our proposed method is\ntask-agnostic in nature and outperforms pre-trained SAM and state-of-the-art\ndomain adaptation methods on almost all downstream tasks with the same testing\nprompt inputs.",

Inspired by image animation\nwhich decouples the video as one specific appearance with the corresponding\nmotion, we propose AnimateZero to unveil the pre-trained text-to-video\ndiffusion model, i.e., AnimateDiff, and provide more precise appearance and\nmotion control abilities for it. For appearance control, we borrow intermediate\nlatents and their features from the text-to-image (T2I) generation for ensuring\nthe generated first frame is equal to the given generated image. For temporal\ncontrol, we replace the global temporal attention of the original T2V model\nwith our proposed positional-corrected window attention to ensure other frames\nalign with the first frame well. Empowered by the proposed methods, AnimateZero\ncan successfully control the generating progress without further training. As a\nzero-shot image animator for given images, AnimateZero also enables multiple\nnew applications, including interactive video generation and real image\nanimation. The detailed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method in both T2V and related applications.",

While previous studies have paid attention to improving retrieval\nmodels and understanding relevance judgments, we focus on enhancing legal case\nretrieval by utilizing the salient content in legal case queries. We first\nannotate the salient content in queries manually and investigate how sparse and\ndense retrieval models attend to those content.

In this work, we propose a general framework\nPCDP-SGD, which aims to compress redundant gradient norms and preserve more\ncrucial top gradient components via projection operation before gradient\nclipping. Additionally, we extend PCDP-SGD as a fundamental component in\ndifferential privacy federated learning~(DPFL) for mitigating the data\nheterogeneous challenge and achieving efficient communication. We prove that\npre-projection enhances the convergence of DP-SGD by reducing the dependence of\nclipping error and bias to a fraction of the top gradient eigenspace, and in\ntheory, limits cross-client variance to improve the convergence under\nheterogeneous federation.

            "summary": "Dense formation flight with multirotor swarms is a powerful, nature-inspired\nflight regime with numerous applications in the realworld. However, when\nmultirotors fly in close vertical proximity to each other, the propeller\ndownwash from the vehicles can have a destabilising effect on each other.\nUnfortunately, even in a homogeneous team, an accurate model of downwash forces\nfrom one vehicle is unlikely to be sufficient for predicting aggregate forces\nfrom multiple vehicles in formation.\n  In this work, we model the interaction patterns produced by one or more\nvehicles flying in close proximity to an ego-vehicle. We first present an\nexperimental test rig designed to capture 6-DOF exogenic forces acting on a\nmultirotor frame. We then study and characterize these measured forces as a\nfunction of the relative states of two multirotors flying various patterns in\nits vicinity.\n  Our analysis captures strong non-linearities present in the aggregation of\nthese interactions. Then, by modeling the formation as a graph, we present a\nnovel approach for learning the force aggregation function, and contrast it\nagainst simpler linear models. Finally, we explore how our proposed models\ngeneralize when a fourth vehicle is added to the formation.",

We have found that the flat Minkowski 3D spacetime is\n\"well-stitched\", which means that it possesses a structure described by 24\ncausal relations between 12 events. We have proved that a 3D spacetime is\n\"well-stitched\" if and only if it is conformally flat. The concept of a\n\"well-stitched\" spacetime does not rely on metrical information about lengths,\ntimes, etc., and does not belong to the metric geometry, but rather to geometry\nof incidence. We therefore have \"translated\" an important concept of a\nconformally-flat spacetime from the \"metric\" language of Riemannian geometry to\nthe \"non-metric\" language of the geometry of incidence. The results of this\npaper provide a tool for detecting the curvature of the 3D spacetime on the\nbasis of causal relations only, without any measurement instruments like rulers\nand clocks, provided that the spacetime is not conformally flat.",

Visual inspection\nof the deep images and GALFIT modelling yielded a galaxy sample highly complete\ndown to $M_{g}\\sim-9$ ($L_{g}\\sim3\\times 10^{5}\\,L_\\odot$) and spanning\nmagnitudes $-16.4 < M_g < -8$ and half-light radii $50\\,pc\\ <\\ r_e\\ <\\\n1600\\,pc$ assuming the distance of M104. These 40 new, out of which 27 are\ngroup members with high confidence, double the number of potential satellites\nof M104 within the virial radius, placing it among the richest hosts in the\nLocal Volume. Using a Principle Component Analysis (PCA), we find that the\nentire sample of candidates consistent with an almost circular on-sky\ndistribution, more circular than any comparable environment found in the\nIllustris TNG100-1 simulation. However the distribution of the high probability\nsample is more oblate and consistent with the simulation. The cumulative\nsatellite luminosity function is broadly consistent with analogues from the\nsimulation, albeit it contains no bright satellite with $M_{g}<-16.4$\n($L_{g}\\sim3 \\times 10^{8}\\,L_\\odot$), a $2.3\\,\\sigma$ occurrence.

Numerous Shapley value estimation methods have been proposed and\nempirically compared on an average basis in the XAI literature. However, less\nfocus has been devoted to analyzing the precision of the Shapley value\nexplanations on an individual basis. We extend our work in Olsen et al.

This is expected from a statistical point of\nview, but to the best of our knowledge, it has not been systematically\naddressed in the Shapley value literature.

One promising approach to compactly delivering these high\nenergy electron beams in a cost-effective manner is laser wakefield\nacceleration (LWFA), which offers ultra-strong accelerating gradients. However,\nthe transition from this concept to a functional machine intended for tumor\ntreatment is still being investigated. Here we present the first self-developed\nprototype for LWFA-based VHEE radiotherapy, exhibiting high compactness\n(occupying less than 5 square meters) and high operational stability (validated\nover a period of one month). Subsequently, we employed this device to irradiate\na tumor implanted in a mouse model. Following a dose delivery of $5.8\\pm0.2$ Gy\nwith precise tumor conformity, all irradiated mice exhibited pronounced control\nof tumor growth. For comparison, this tumor-control efficacy was similar to\nthat achieved using commercial X-ray radiotherapy equipment operating at\nequivalent doses. These results demonstrate the potential of a compact\nlaser-driven VHEE system for preclinical studies involving small animal models\nand its promising prospects for future clinical translation in cancer therapy.",

            "summary": "Mobile service robots are proving to be increasingly effective in a range of\napplications, such as healthcare, monitoring Activities of Daily Living (ADL),\nand facilitating Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). These robots heavily rely on\nHuman Action Recognition (HAR) to interpret human actions and intentions.\nHowever, for HAR to function effectively on service robots, it requires prior\nknowledge of human presence (human detection) and identification of individuals\nto monitor (human tracking). In this work, we propose an end-to-end pipeline\nthat encompasses the entire process, starting from human detection and\ntracking, leading to action recognition. The pipeline is designed to operate in\nnear real-time while ensuring all stages of processing are performed on the\nedge, reducing the need for centralised computation. To identify the most\nsuitable models for our mobile robot, we conducted a series of experiments\ncomparing state-of-the-art solutions based on both their detection performance\nand efficiency. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline, we\nproposed a dataset comprising daily household activities. By presenting our\nfindings and analysing the results, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach\nin enabling mobile robots to understand and respond to human behaviour in\nreal-world scenarios relying mainly on the data from their RGB cameras.",

            "summary": "We present a novel method for measuring the lags of (weak) variability\ncomponents in neutron-star and black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). For\nthis we assume that the power and cross spectra of these sources consists of a\nnumber of components that are coherent in different energy bands, but are\nincoherent with one another. The technique is based on fitting simultaneously\nthe power spectrum (PS) and the Real and Imaginary parts of the cross spectrum\n(CS) with a combination of Lorentzian functions. We show that, because the PS\nof LMXBs is insensitive to signals with a large Imaginary part and a small Real\npart in the CS, this approach allows us to uncover new variability components\nthat are only detected in the CS. We also demonstrate that, contrary to earlier\nclaims, the frequency of the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the\nblack-hole binary GRS 1915+105 does not depend on energy. Rather, the apparent\nenergy dependence of the QPO frequency can be explained by the presence of a\nseparate QPO component with a slightly higher frequency than that of the QPO,\nwhose rms amplitude increases faster with energy than the rms amplitude of the\nQPO. From all the above we conclude that, as in the case of the PS, the CS of\nblack-hole and neutron-star binaries can be fitted by a combination of\nLorentzian components. Our findings provide evidence that the\nfrequency-dependent part of the transfer function of these systems can be\ndescribed by a combination of responses, each of them acting over relatively\nwell-defined time scales. This conclusion challenges models that assume that\nthe main contribution to the lags comes from a global, broadband, transfer\nfunction of the accreting system.",

[Method] The\nthree-dimensional Langevin approach considering nucleus elongation,\ndeformation, and mass asymmetry is applied to simulate fission dynamics. The\nmacro-microscopic models are used to calculate the transport coefficients.\n[Results] The fragment mass, deformation, and total kinetic energy (TKE) of\n$^{187}$Ir fission at different excitation energies are calculated. Based on\nthe mass-TKE correlations, four fission modes are identified, namely two\nasymmetric standard modes, a symmetric super-long mode, and a symmetric\nliquid-drop mode. Strong excitation-energy resistance of two asymmetric modes\nis found. The mass distributions show the dominance of single-peak shape, which\nis in good agreement with experimental data. The fission potential energy\nsurface and the fission dynamics are analyzed to investigate the origins of the\nmodes and the competition between neutron and proton shell effects.\n[Conclusions] Multiple fission modes are included in the $^{187}$Ir fission\nbehind the single-peak-like distribution of observables.

By training the network with environmental characteristics\nsurrounding each galaxy in redshift space, our ANN model can accurately predict\nthe line-of-sight velocity of each individual galaxy. When this velocity is\nused to eliminate the RSD effect, the two-point correlation function (TPCF) in\nreal space can be recovered with an accuracy better than 1% at $s$ > 8\n$h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$, and 4% on all scales compared to ground truth. The\nreal-space power spectrum can be recovered within 3% on $k$< 0.5\n$\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}h$, and less than 5% for all $k$ modes. The quadrupole moment\nof the TPCF or power spectrum is almost zero down to $s$ = 10\n$h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ or all $k$ modes, indicating an effective correction of\nthe spatial anisotropy caused by the RSD effect. We demonstrate that on large\nscales, without additional training with new data, our network is adaptable to\ndifferent cosmological models, and mock galaxy samples at high redshifts and\nhigh biases, achieving less than 10% error for scales greater than 15\n$h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$. As it is sensitive to large-scale densities, it does not\nmanage to remove Fingers of God in large clusters, but works remarkably well at\nrecovering real-space galaxy positions elsewhere. Our scheme provides a novel\nway to predict the peculiar velocity of individual galaxies, to eliminate the\nRSD effect directly in future large galaxy surveys, and to reconstruct the 3-D\ncosmic velocity field accurately.",

Recent spatially resolved\nobservations show the importance of gaining a more comprehensive view of the\ncircumstellar chemistry, but a comparative study of the intricate interplay\nbetween chemistry and physics is still difficult because observational details\nsuch as frequencies and angular resolutions are rarely comparable. Aiming to\novercome these deficiencies, ATOMIUM is an ALMA Large Programme to study the\nphysics and chemistry of the circumstellar envelopes of a diverse set of\noxygen-rich evolved stars under homogeneous observing conditions at three\nangular resolutions between ~0.02\"-1.4\". Here we summarize the molecular\ninventory of these sources, and the correlations between stellar parameters and\nmolecular content. Seventeen oxygen-rich or S-type asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars have been observed in several tunings with\nALMA Band 6, targeting a range of molecules to probe the circumstellar envelope\nand especially the chemistry of dust formation close to the star. We\nsystematically assigned the molecular carriers of the spectral lines and\nmeasured their spectroscopic parameters and the angular extent of the emission\nof each line from integrated intensity maps. Across the ATOMIUM sample, we\ndetect 291 transitions of 24 different molecules and their isotopologues. This\nincludes several first detections in oxygen-rich AGB/RSG stars: PO v=1, SO2\nv1=1 and v2=2, and several high energy H2O transitions. We also find several\nfirst detections in S-type AGB stars: vibrationally excited HCN v2=2,3 and SiS\nv=4,5,6, as well as first detections of the molecules SiC, AlCl, and AlF in W\nAql...",

Our method\ninvolves the analysis of a specific mode correlation of a photon-pair, which is\nindependent of the mode used for image construction, to check security. Through\nthis analysis, we can identify both the targeted image region by the attack and\nthe type of spoofing attack, enabling reconstruction of the true image. A\nproof-of-principle demonstration employing polarization-correlation of a\nphoton-pair is provided, showcasing successful image reconstruction even under\nthe condition of spoofing signals 2000 times stronger than the true signals.

Although there exist ways for model pruning or distillation, it is\ntypically required to perform a full round of model training or finetuning\nprocedure in order to obtain a smaller model that satisfies the model size or\ncomplexity constraints. Motivated by recent works on dynamic neural networks,\nwe propose a simple way to train a large network and flexibly extract a\nsubnetwork from it given a model size or complexity constraint during\ninference. We introduce a new way to allow a large model to be trained with\ndynamic depth and width during the training phase, and after the large model is\ntrained we can select a subnetwork from it with arbitrary depth and width\nduring the inference phase with a relatively better performance compared to\ntraining the subnetwork independently from scratch. Experiment results on a\nmusic source separation model show that our proposed method can effectively\nimprove the separation performance across different subnetwork sizes and\ncomplexities with a single large model, and training the large model takes\nsignificantly shorter time than training all the different subnetworks.",

This\npaper introduces DBCopilot, a framework that addresses these challenges by\nemploying a compact and flexible copilot model for routing across massive\ndatabases. Specifically, DBCopilot decouples the text-to-SQL process into\nschema routing and SQL generation, leveraging a lightweight\nsequence-to-sequence neural network-based router to formulate database\nconnections and navigate natural language questions through databases and\ntables. The routed schemas and questions are then fed into LLMs for efficient\nSQL generation. Furthermore, DBCopilot also introduced a reverse\nschema-to-question generation paradigm, which can learn and adapt the router\nover massive databases automatically without requiring manual intervention.\nExperimental results demonstrate that DBCopilot is a scalable and effective\nsolution for real-world text-to-SQL tasks, providing a significant advancement\nin handling large-scale schemas.",

To address the intense heat and\nelectromagnetic loads that occur during a disruption, a shattered pellet\ninjection (SPI) system will be employed. The penetration and assimilation\n(ionized material that stays inside the plasma volume) of the injected material\nis influenced by various SPI parameters, including the fragment sizes, speeds,\nand composition of the shattered fragments. An SPI system was installed on the\nASDEX Upgrade tokamak to study the effect of the aforementioned parameters. In\nthis thesis, 1.5D simulations with the INDEX code have been utilised to conduct\nparametric scans, thus examining the influence of fragment sizes, velocities,\nand pellet composition on the efficacy of disruption mitigation.\n  When injecting only deuterium, I found material assimilation to be limited to\nthe edge of the plasma with larger and faster fragments leading to higher\nassimilation. For mixed deuterium/neon injections, again, larger and faster\nfragments enabled higher assimilation. The amount of assimilated neon increased\nwith increasing injected neon amounts but saturated for larger neon fraction\npellets. I also carried out comparisons with previous experimental results of\npenetration, material assimilation and pre-TQ duration. Previous experimental\nresults for pure deuterium injections indicated that larger and faster\nfragments exhibit greater penetration, aligning with findings from the\nsimulations. Simulated material assimilation trends for pure deuterium\ninjections were also found to be qualitatively similar to the experiments.\nNonetheless, a major difference in the quantitative assimilation values was\nidentified, likely associated with the experimental assimilation criterion.",

We first propose a\ndual-graph mechanism to obtain motion priors, with a coarse deformation graph\nfor effective initialization and a fine-grained Gaussian graph to enforce\nsubsequent constraints. Then, we utilize a 4D Gaussian optimization scheme with\nadaptive spatial-temporal regularizers to effectively balance the non-rigid\nprior and Gaussian updating. We also present a companion compression scheme\nwith residual compensation for immersive experiences on various platforms. It\nachieves a substantial compression rate of approximately 25 times, with less\nthan 2MB of storage per frame.

            "summary": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred extensive\nresearch into LLM-related Prompt investigations, such as Instruction Learning\n(IL), In-context Learning (ICL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). These approaches\naim to improve LLMs' responses by enabling them to provide concise statements\nor examples for deeper contemplation when addressing questions. However,\nindependent thinking by LLMs can introduce variability in their thought\nprocesses, leading to potential inaccuracies. In response, our study seeks to\nbridge the gap between LLM and human-like thinking processes, recognizing that\ntext comprehension begins with understanding individual words. To tackle this\nchallenge, we have expanded the CoT method to cater to a specific domain. Our\napproach, known as \"Think from Words\" (TFW), initiates the comprehension\nprocess at the word level and then extends it to encompass the entire text. We\nalso propose \"TFW with Extra word-level information\" (TFW Extra), augmenting\ncomprehension with additional word-level data. To assess our methods, we employ\ntext classification on six Japanese datasets comprising text-level and\nword-level elements. Our findings not only validate the effectiveness of TFW\nbut also shed light on the impact of various word-level information types on\nLLMs' text comprehension, offering insights into their potential to cause\nmisinterpretations and errors in the overall comprehension of the final text.",

They are designed to mimic the perceptual\nbehaviour of human observers and usually reflect structures found in natural\nsignals. This motivates their use as loss functions for training generative\nmodels such that models will learn to capture the structure held in the metric.\nWe take this idea to the extreme in the audio domain by training a compressive\nautoencoder to reconstruct uniform noise, in lieu of natural data.

A prerequisite for realistic and sharp crop image\ngeneration is the integration of multiple growth-influencing conditions in a\nmodel, such as an image of an initial growth stage, the associated growth time,\nand further information about the field treatment. We present a two-stage\nframework consisting first of an image prediction model and second of a growth\nestimation model, which both are independently trained. The image prediction\nmodel is a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (CWGAN). In\nthe generator of this model, conditional batch normalization (CBN) is used to\nintegrate different conditions along with the input image. This allows the\nmodel to generate time-varying artificial images dependent on multiple\ninfluencing factors of different kinds. These images are used by the second\npart of the framework for plant phenotyping by deriving plant-specific traits\nand comparing them with those of non-artificial (real) reference images. For\nvarious crop datasets, the framework allows realistic, sharp image predictions\nwith a slight loss of quality from short-term to long-term predictions.\nSimulations of varying growth-influencing conditions performed with the trained\nframework provide valuable insights into how such factors relate to crop\nappearances, which is particularly useful in complex, less explored crop\nmixture systems. Further results show that adding process-based simulated\nbiomass as a condition increases the accuracy of the derived phenotypic traits\nfrom the predicted images. This demonstrates the potential of our framework to\nserve as an interface between an image- and process-based crop growth model.",

This paper proposes a novel method for high-quality\nface capture, featuring an easy-to-use system and the capability to model the\ncomplete face with skin, mouth interior, hair, and eyes. We reconstruct facial\ngeometry and appearance from a single co-located smartphone flashlight sequence\ncaptured in a dim room where the flashlight is the dominant light source (e.g.\nrooms with curtains or at night). To model the complete face, we propose a\nnovel hybrid representation to effectively model both eyes and other facial\nregions, along with novel techniques to learn it from images.

This hinders the model to comprehend the\nfine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this\nproblem, we contribute a new benchmark named \\textbf{UFineBench} for text-based\nperson retrieval with ultra-fine granularity.\n  Firstly, we construct a new \\textbf{dataset} named UFine6926. We collect a\nlarge number of person images and manually annotate each image with two\ndetailed textual descriptions, averaging 80.8 words each. The average word\ncount is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of\nstandard in-domain evaluation, we also propose a special \\textbf{evaluation\nparadigm} more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation\nset with cross domains, cross textual granularity and cross textual styles,\nnamed UFine3C, and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval\nability, named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover, we propose CFAM, a\nmore efficient \\textbf{algorithm} especially designed for text-based person\nretrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by\nadopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match\nmechanism.\n  With standard in-domain evaluation, CFAM establishes competitive performance\nacross various datasets, especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926.\nFurthermore, by evaluating on UFine3C, we demonstrate that training on our\nUFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with\nother coarse-grained datasets.

Whereas previous tensor completion work primarily\nfocuses on low-rank completion methods, we propose a novel graph-based\ndiffusion approach to the problem.

Such\ngraph data are inherently becoming more and more streaming, entailing\ncontinuous insertions and deletions of edges. A butterfly (i.e., 2x2 bi-clique)\nis the smallest non-trivial cohesive structure that plays a crucial role.\nCounting such butterfly patterns in streaming bipartite graphs is a core\nproblem in applications such as dense subgraph discovery and anomaly detection.\nYet, existing approximate solutions consider insert-only streams and, thus,\nachieve very low accuracy in fully dynamic bipartite graph streams that involve\nboth insertions and deletions of edges. Adapting them to consider deletions is\nnot trivial either, because different sampling schemes and new accuracy\nanalyses are required. In this paper, we propose Abacus, a novel approximate\nalgorithm that counts butterflies in the presence of both insertions and\ndeletions by utilizing sampling. We prove that Abacus always delivers unbiased\nestimates of low variance. Furthermore, we extend Abacus and devise a parallel\nmini-batch variant, namely, Parabacus, which counts butterflies in parallel.\nParabacus counts butterflies in a load-balanced manner using versioned samples,\nwhich results in significant speedup and is thus ideal for critical\napplications in the streaming environment. We evaluate Abacus/Parabacus using a\ndiverse set of real bipartite graphs and assess its performance in terms of\naccuracy, throughput, and speedup. The results indicate that our proposal is\nthe first capable of efficiently providing accurate butterfly counts in the\nmost generic setting, i.e., a fully dynamic graph streaming environment that\nentails both insertions and deletions.

We target $Z$+jet and\ndijet events as respective quark- and gluon-enriched mixtures and derive\nsamples both from data taken in 2011 at 7 TeV, and from Monte Carlo. CWoLa and\nTopicFlow models are trained on real data and compared to fully-supervised\nclassifiers trained on simulation. In order to obtain estimates for the\ndiscrimination power in real data, we consider three different estimates of the\nquark/gluon mixture fractions in the data. Compared to when the models are\nevaluated on simulation, we find reversed rankings for the fully- and\nweakly-supervised approaches. Further, these rankings based on data are robust\nto the estimate of the mixture fraction in the test set. Finally, we use\nTopicFlow to smooth statistical fluctuations in the small testing set, and to\nprovide uncertainty on the performance in real data.",

            "summary": "We introduce Gaussian-Flow, a novel point-based approach for fast dynamic\nscene reconstruction and real-time rendering from both multi-view and monocular\nvideos. In contrast to the prevalent NeRF-based approaches hampered by slow\ntraining and rendering speeds, our approach harnesses recent advancements in\npoint-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically, a novel Dual-Domain\nDeformation Model (DDDM) is proposed to explicitly model attribute deformations\nof each Gaussian point, where the time-dependent residual of each attribute is\ncaptured by a polynomial fitting in the time domain, and a Fourier series\nfitting in the frequency domain. The proposed DDDM is capable of modeling\ncomplex scene deformations across long video footage, eliminating the need for\ntraining separate 3DGS for each frame or introducing an additional implicit\nneural field to model 3D dynamics. Moreover, the explicit deformation modeling\nfor discretized Gaussian points ensures ultra-fast training and rendering of a\n4D scene, which is comparable to the original 3DGS designed for static 3D\nreconstruction. Our proposed approach showcases a substantial efficiency\nimprovement, achieving a $5\\times$ faster training speed compared to the\nper-frame 3DGS modeling. In addition, quantitative results demonstrate that the\nproposed Gaussian-Flow significantly outperforms previous leading methods in\nnovel view rendering quality.

Specifically, a so-called \\emph{appropriate\nbehavior} involves the right agent performing the right actions at the right\ntime under certain conditions.

In a broad sense, for\nthe security and safety issue, behavioral authentication is not only an\ninnovative and promising method due to its inherent advantages but also a\ncritical and fundamental problem due to the ubiquity of behavior generation and\nthe necessity of behavior regulation in any system. By this classification,\nthis review provides a comprehensive examination of the background and\npreliminaries of behavioral authentication. It further summarizes existing\nresearch based on their respective focus areas and characteristics.

However their huge model size and the consequent demand for\ncomputational and memory resources also pose challenges to model deployment.\nCurrently, 4-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) has achieved some success in\nLLMs, reducing the memory footprint by approximately 75% compared to FP16\nmodels, albeit with some accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose SmoothQuant+,\nan accurate and efficient 4-bit weight-only PTQ that requires no additional\ntraining, which enables lossless in accuracy for LLMs for the first time. Based\non the fact that the loss of weight quantization is amplified by the activation\noutliers, SmoothQuant+ smoothes the activation outliers by channel before\nquantization, while adjusting the corresponding weights for mathematical\nequivalence, and then performs group-wise 4-bit weight quantization for linear\nlayers. We have integrated SmoothQuant+ into the vLLM framework, an advanced\nhigh-throughput inference engine specially developed for LLMs, and equipped it\nwith an efficient W4A16 CUDA kernels, so that vLLM can seamlessly support\nSmoothQuant+ 4-bit weight quantization. Our results show that, with\nSmoothQuant+, the Code Llama-34B model can be quantized and deployed on a A100\n40GB GPU, achieving lossless accuracy and a throughput increase of 1.9 to 4.0\ntimes compared to the FP16 model deployed on two A100 40GB GPUs. Moreover, the\nlatency per token is only 68% of the FP16 model deployed on two A100 40GB GPUs.\nThis is the state-of-the-art 4-bit weight quantization for LLMs as we know.",

            "updated": "2023-12-06T11:05:11Z",

            "summary": "Backdoor attacks, representing an emerging threat to the integrity of deep\nneural networks, have garnered significant attention due to their ability to\ncompromise deep learning systems clandestinely. While numerous backdoor attacks\noccur within the digital realm, their practical implementation in real-world\nprediction systems remains limited and vulnerable to disturbances in the\nphysical world. Consequently, this limitation has given rise to the development\nof physical backdoor attacks, where trigger objects manifest as physical\nentities within the real world. However, creating the requisite dataset to\ntrain or evaluate a physical backdoor model is a daunting task, limiting the\nbackdoor researchers and practitioners from studying such physical attack\nscenarios. This paper unleashes a recipe that empowers backdoor researchers to\neffortlessly create a malicious, physical backdoor dataset based on advances in\ngenerative modeling. Particularly, this recipe involves 3 automatic modules:\nsuggesting the suitable physical triggers, generating the poisoned candidate\nsamples (either by synthesizing new samples or editing existing clean samples),\nand finally refining for the most plausible ones. As such, it effectively\nmitigates the perceived complexity associated with creating a physical backdoor\ndataset, transforming it from a daunting task into an attainable objective.\nExtensive experiment results show that datasets created by our \"recipe\" enable\nadversaries to achieve an impressive attack success rate on real physical world\ndata and exhibit similar properties compared to previous physical backdoor\nattack studies. This paper offers researchers a valuable toolkit for studies of\nphysical backdoors, all within the confines of their laboratories.",

            "summary": "There are more than 200 moons in our Solar System, but their relatively small\nradii make similarly sized extrasolar moons very hard to detect with current\ninstruments. The best exomoon candidates so far are two nearly Neptune-sized\nbodies orbiting the Jupiter-sized transiting exoplanets Kepler-1625 b and\nKepler-1708 b, but their existence has been contested. Here we reanalyse the\nHubble and Kepler data used to identify the two exomoon candidates employing\nnested sampling and Bayesian inference techniques coupled with a fully\nautomated photodynamical transit model. We find that the evidence for the\nKepler-1625 b exomoon candidate comes almost entirely from the shallowness of\none transit observed with Hubble. We interpret this as a fitting artifact in\nwhich a moon transit is used to compensate for the unconstrained stellar limb\ndarkening. We also find much lower statistical evidence for the exomoon\ncandidate around Kepler-1708 b than previously reported. We suggest that visual\nevidence of the claimed exomoon transits is corrupted by stellar activity in\nthe Kepler light curve. Our injection-retrieval experiments of simulated\ntransits in the original Kepler data reveal false positive rates of 10.9% and\n1.6% for Kepler-1625 b and Kepler-1708 b, respectively. Moreover, genuine\ntransit signals of large exomoons would tend to exhibit much higher Bayesian\nevidence than these two claims. We conclude that neither Kepler-1625 b nor\nKepler-1708 b are likely to be orbited by a large exomoon.",

Complex 3D motions of the cylinder with respect to the wall\noccur during bouncing, including multi-contact-points between the cylinder and\nthe bottom as well as cavitation.\n  We investigate numerical modelling of an idealized situation (2D infinite\ncylinder falling parallel to the wall) with 2D simulations where the fluid\nequations of motion were coupled to the particle equation of motion through an\nImmersed Boundary Method. The particle equation of motion is coupled to an\nelastic force to model bouncing, requiring a parameterization of the cut-off\nlength (interpreted as a roughness) and the contact time (associated with the\ncontact elasticity) used here to capture the experimental observations. The\nsimulations confirmed that i) the departure of the coefficient of restitution\nfrom 0 is strictly dependent on the apparent roughness and ii) the coefficient\nof restitution depends on the contact time.\n  Finally, we model the coefficient of restitution as the product of two\ncontributions to the mechanical loss of energy: the collision-to-terminal\nvelocity ratio ($V_c/V_t$) of the approach-phase and the rebound-to-collision\nvelocity ratio ($-V_r/V_c$) of the contact-phase. This leads to a reasonably\ngood prediction of the coefficient of restitution in the intermediate regime in\n$St$. This suggests the relevance of lumping the complex details of physical\nphenomena involved during contact into a simple concept based on the contact\napparent roughness and elasticity.",

However, with\nthe rise of voice cloning technology, attackers have the potential to easily\nimpersonate a specific person by utilizing his publicly released audio without\nany permission. Therefore, it becomes significant to detect any potential\nmisuse of the released audio content and protect its timbre from being\nimpersonated. To this end, we introduce a novel concept, \"Timbre Watermarking\",\nwhich embeds watermark information into the target individual's speech,\neventually defeating the voice cloning attacks. To ensure the watermark is\nrobust to the voice cloning model's learning process, we design an end-to-end\nvoice cloning-resistant detection framework. The core idea of our solution is\nto embed and extract the watermark in the frequency domain in a temporally\ninvariant manner. To acquire generalization across different voice cloning\nattacks, we modulate their shared process and integrate it into our framework\nas a distortion layer. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed timbre\nwatermarking can defend against different voice cloning attacks, exhibit strong\nresistance against various adaptive attacks (e.g., reconstruction-based removal\nattacks, watermark overwriting attacks), and achieve practicality in real-world\nservices such as PaddleSpeech, Voice-Cloning-App, and so-vits-svc.

Current autonomous driving datasets can broadly be categorized into\ntwo generations. The first-generation autonomous driving datasets are\ncharacterized by relatively simpler sensor modalities, smaller data scale, and\nis limited to perception-level tasks. KITTI, introduced in 2012, serves as a\nprominent representative of this initial wave. In contrast, the\nsecond-generation datasets exhibit heightened complexity in sensor modalities,\ngreater data scale and diversity, and an expansion of tasks from perception to\nencompass prediction and control. Leading examples of the second generation\ninclude nuScenes and Waymo, introduced around 2019. This comprehensive review,\nconducted in collaboration with esteemed colleagues from both academia and\nindustry, systematically assesses over seventy open-source autonomous driving\ndatasets from domestic and international sources. It offers insights into\nvarious aspects, such as the principles underlying the creation of high-quality\ndatasets, the pivotal role of data engine systems, and the utilization of\ngenerative foundation models to facilitate scalable data generation.\nFurthermore, this review undertakes an exhaustive analysis and discourse\nregarding the characteristics and data scales that future third-generation\nautonomous driving datasets should possess. It also delves into the scientific\nand technical challenges that warrant resolution.

            "summary": "The error exponent of fixed-length lossy source coding was established by\nMarton. Ahlswede showed that this exponent can be discontinuous at a rate $R$,\ndepending on the source distribution $P$ and the distortion measure $d(x,y)$.\nThe reason for the discontinuity in the error exponent is that there exists a\ndistortion measure $d(x,y)$ and a distortion level $\\Delta$ such that the\nrate-distortion function $R(\\Delta|P)$ is neither concave nor quasi-concave\nwith respect to $P$. Arimoto's algorithm for computing the error exponent in\nlossy source coding is based on Blahut's parametric representation of the error\nexponent. However, Blahut's parametric representation is a lower convex\nenvelope of Marton's exponent, and the two do not generally agree. A major\ncontribution of this paper is to provide a parametric representation that\nperfectly matches the inverse function of Marton's exponent, thereby preventing\nthe problems arising from the above-mentioned non-concavity of $R(\\Delta|P)$.\nFor fixed parameters, an optimal distribution can be obtained using Arimoto's\nalgorithm. By performing a nonconvex optimization over the parameters, the\ninverse function of Marton's exponent is obtained.",

Whereas F\\\"orster theory relies on weak coupling between\nchromophores, and Redfield theory assumes the electronic excitations to be\nweakly coupled to fast chromophore vibrations, MASH is free from any\nperturbative or Markovian approximations. We illustrate this with an example\napplication to the rate of energy transfer in a Frenkel-exciton dimer, showing\nthat MASH interpolates correctly between the opposing regimes in which the\nF\\\"orster and Redfield results are reliable. We then compare the three methods\nfor a realistic model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex with a structured\nvibrational spectral density and static disorder in the excitation energies. In\nthis case there are no exact results for comparison so we use MASH to assess\nthe validity of F\\\"orster and Redfield theories. We find that F\\\"orster theory\nis the more accurate of the two on the picosecond timescale, as has been shown\npreviously for a simpler model of this particular light-harvesting complex.

These tasks can be effectively\napproached as image forecasting problems using computer vision models. Vector\nquantization (VQ) is a well-known method for discrete representation that\nimproves the latent space, leading to enhanced generalization and transfer\nlearning capabilities. One of the main challenges in using VQ for\nspatiotemporal forecasting is how to balance between keeping enough details and\nremoving noises from the original patterns for better generalization. We\naddress this challenge by developing sparse vector quantization, or {\\bf SVQ}\nfor short, that leverages sparse regression to make better trade-off between\nthe two objectives. The main innovation of this work is to approximate sparse\nregression by a two-layer MLP and a randomly fixed or learnable matrix,\ndramatically improving its computational efficiency. Through experiments\nconducted on diverse datasets in multiple fields including weather forecasting,\ntraffic flow prediction, and video forecasting, we unequivocally demonstrate\nthat our proposed method consistently enhances the performance of base models\nand achieves state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks.",

Through a novel annotation\nprocedure, we extend the Ego4D dataset by adding manually labeled Egocentric\nAction Scene Graphs offering a rich set of annotations designed for long-from\negocentric video understanding. We hence define the EASG generation task and\nprovide a baseline approach, establishing preliminary benchmarks.

This paper\nrepresents an advancement in the analysis of point cloud data in four\ndirections. Firstly, it introduces the novel task of NCD for point cloud\nsemantic segmentation. Secondly, it demonstrates that directly transposing the\nonly existing NCD method for 2D image semantic segmentation to 3D data yields\nsuboptimal results. Thirdly, a new NCD approach based on online clustering,\nuncertainty estimation, and semantic distillation is presented. Lastly, a novel\nevaluation protocol is proposed to rigorously assess the performance of NCD in\npoint cloud semantic segmentation.

Strong evidence for the charge exchange origin of this transient\ndiffuse emission is provided by prominent non-thermal emission lines at\nenergies of $\\rm O^{7+}$, $\\rm Ne^{9+}$, $\\rm Mg^{11+}$, $\\rm Si^{12+}$, $\\rm\nSi^{13+}$. Especially, a 0.53 keV emission line that most likely arises from\nthe $\\rm N^{5+}$ $1s^1 5p^1 \\to 1s^2$ transition is detected. Previously, the\nforecastability of SWCX occurrence with proton flares has been disputed. In\nthis particular event, we found that the SWCX signal coincided with the arrival\nof the magnetic cloud inside CME, triggered with a time delay after the proton\nflux fluctuation as the CME shock front passed through the Earth. Moreover, a\nspacecraft orbital modulation in SWCX light curve suggests that the emission\narises close to the Earth. The line of sight was found to always pass through\nthe northern magnetospheric cusp. The SWCX intensity was high when the line of\nsight passed the dusk side of the cusp, suggesting an azimuthal anisotropy in\nthe flow of solar-wind ions inside the cusp. An axisymmetric SWCX emission\nmodel is found to underestimate the observed peak intensity by a factor of\nabout 50. We suggest this discrepancy is related to the azimuthal anisotropy of\nthe solar-wind flow in the cusp.",

The challenge arises from\nthe limited data availability and the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI\nsignals, leading to a low-precision task of fMRI-to-image retrieval.\nState-of-the-art MindEye remarkably improves fMRI-to-image retrieval\nperformance by leveraging a deep MLP with a high parameter count orders of\nmagnitude, i.e., a 996M MLP Backbone per subject, to align fMRI embeddings to\nthe final hidden layer of CLIP's vision transformer. However, significant\nindividual variations exist among subjects, even within identical experimental\nsetups, mandating the training of subject-specific models. The substantial\nparameters pose significant challenges in deploying fMRI decoding on practical\ndevices, especially with the necessitating of specific models for each subject.\nTo this end, we propose Lite-Mind, a lightweight, efficient, and versatile\nbrain representation network based on discrete Fourier transform, that\nefficiently aligns fMRI voxels to fine-grained information of CLIP. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that Lite-Mind achieves an impressive 94.3%\nfMRI-to-image retrieval accuracy on the NSD dataset for Subject 1, with 98.7%\nfewer parameters than MindEye. Lite-Mind is also proven to be able to be\nmigrated to smaller brain datasets and establishes a new state-of-the-art for\nzero-shot classification on the GOD dataset.

            "summary": "The ubiquity of offensive content on social media is a growing cause for\nconcern among companies and government organizations. Recently,\ntransformer-based models such as BERT, XLNET, and XLM-R have achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance in detecting various forms of offensive content\n(e.g. hate speech, cyberbullying, and cyberaggression). However, the majority\nof these models are limited in their capabilities due to their encoder-only\narchitecture, which restricts the number and types of labels in downstream\ntasks. Addressing these limitations, this study presents the first pre-trained\nmodel with encoder-decoder architecture for offensive language identification\nwith text-to-text transformers (T5) trained on two large offensive language\nidentification datasets; SOLID and CCTK. We investigate the effectiveness of\ncombining two datasets and selecting an optimal threshold in semi-supervised\ninstances in SOLID in the T5 retraining step. Our pre-trained T5 model\noutperforms other transformer-based models fine-tuned for offensive language\ndetection, such as fBERT and HateBERT, in multiple English benchmarks.\nFollowing a similar approach, we also train the first multilingual pre-trained\nmodel for offensive language identification using mT5 and evaluate its\nperformance on a set of six different languages (German, Hindi, Korean,\nMarathi, Sinhala, and Spanish). The results demonstrate that this multilingual\nmodel achieves a new state-of-the-art on all the above datasets, showing its\nusefulness in multilingual scenarios. Our proposed T5-based models will be made\nfreely available to the community.",

            "summary": "With the accelerated advancement of IoT, diverse devices are ubiquitously\ndeployed in environments. Building on this, Web of Things (WoT) further\nintegrates fragmented device services and provides unified interfaces using\nstandardized Web technologies, promoting the development and deployment of WoT\napplications to sense and regulate the environment. However, disparate WoT\napplications independently control devices in the WoT environment, causing\ninterference among devices and with the environment. This results in device\nbehaviors that deviate from user expectations, causing violations of the user's\ndesired environment properties. The intricate interplay of applications, user\nactivities, and environment changes makes identifying and resolving potential\nviolations a complex task. In this paper, we introduce EnvGuard, an\nenvironment-centric approach for property description, violation\nidentification, and resolution in WoT environment. EnvGuard proposes a\nconceptual schema to model the relationship between device services and\nenvironment context, and automatically extends the conceptual schema into a\nspecific environment representation based on device and space information.\nFurthermore, EnvGuard employs a template-based approach, enabling users to\ndescribe spatial and temporal properties based on the abstract device effects\non the environment, and translating properties description into formal\nexpressions. EnvGuard adopts a hybrid model checking method to respectively\nidentify the spatial and temporal violations, and a resolution strategy that\nalign with user intention is proposed to resolve violations. We evaluate\nEnvGuard through user studies and our proposed dataset, which is constructed by\ncollecting real-world data from a laboratory WoT environment and manually\nlabeling ten types of violations. The results confirm the usability,\nfeasibility and efficiency of EnvGuard.",

Due to the complex branch\nmorphological structure of trees themselves and the occlusions from tree stems,\nbranches and foliage, it is difficult to recreate a complete three-dimensional\ntree model from a two-dimensional image by conventional photogrammetric\nmethods. In this study, based on tree images collected by various cameras in\ndifferent ways, the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) method was used for\nindividual tree reconstruction and the exported point cloud models are compared\nwith point cloud derived from photogrammetric reconstruction and laser scanning\nmethods. The results show that the NeRF method performs well in individual tree\n3D reconstruction, as it has higher successful reconstruction rate, better\nreconstruction in the canopy area, it requires less amount of images as input.\nCompared with photogrammetric reconstruction method, NeRF has significant\nadvantages in reconstruction efficiency and is adaptable to complex scenes, but\nthe generated point cloud tends to be noisy and low resolution. The accuracy of\ntree structural parameters (tree height and diameter at breast height)\nextracted from the photogrammetric point cloud is still higher than those of\nderived from the NeRF point cloud. The results of this study illustrate the\ngreat potential of NeRF method for individual tree reconstruction, and it\nprovides new ideas and research directions for 3D reconstruction and\nvisualization of complex forest scenes.",

The emerging\nfield of graph signal processing (GSP) promises to analyse spectral\ncharacteristics of these multivariate signals, while at the same time taking\nthe spatial structure between the time signals into account. A central idea in\nGSP is the graph Fourier transform, which projects a multivariate signal onto\nfrequency-ordered graph Fourier modes, and can therefore be regarded as a\nspatial analog of the temporal Fourier transform. This chapter derives and\ndiscusses key concepts in GSP, with a specific focus on how the various\nconcepts relate to one another. The experimental section focuses on the role of\ngraph frequency in data classification, with applications to neuroimaging. To\naddress the limited sample size of neurophysiological datasets, we introduce a\nminimalist simulation framework that can generate arbitrary amounts of data.\nUsing this artificial data, we find that lower graph frequency signals are less\nsuitable for classifying neurophysiological data as compared to higher graph\nfrequency signals. Finally, we introduce a baseline testing framework for GSP.\nEmploying this framework, our results suggest that GSP applications may\nattenuate spectral characteristics in the signals, highlighting current\nlimitations of GSP for neuroimaging.",

            "summary": "Controlling energy consumption in buildings through demand response (DR) has\nbecome increasingly important to reduce global carbon emissions and limit\nclimate change. In this paper, we specifically focus on controlling the heating\nsystem of a residential building to optimize its energy consumption while\nrespecting user's thermal comfort. Recent works in this area have mainly\nfocused on either model-based control, e.g., model predictive control (MPC), or\nmodel-free reinforcement learning (RL) to implement practical DR algorithms. A\nspecific RL method that recently has achieved impressive success in domains\nsuch as board games (go, chess) is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Yet, for\nbuilding control it has remained largely unexplored. Thus, we study MCTS\nspecifically for building demand response. Its natural structure allows a\nflexible optimization that implicitly integrate exogenous constraints (as\nopposed, for example, to conventional RL solutions), making MCTS a promising\ncandidate for DR control problems. We demonstrate how to improve MCTS control\nperformance by incorporating a Physics-informed Neural Network (PiNN) model for\nits underlying thermal state prediction, as opposed to traditional purely\ndata-driven Black-Box approaches. Our MCTS implementation aligned with a PiNN\nmodel is able to obtain a 3% increment of the obtained reward compared to a\nrule-based controller; leading to a 10% cost reduction and 35% reduction on\ntemperature difference with the desired one when applied to an artificial price\nprofile. We further implemented a Deep Learning layer into the Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch technique using a neural network that leads the tree search through more\noptimal nodes. We then compared this addition with its Vanilla version, showing\nthe improvement in computational cost required.",

Key findings reveal that\neffective knowledge integration requires reading texts from multiple\nperspectives, especially in instructional formats. We utilize text augmentation\nto tackle the scarcity of specialized texts, including style conversions and\ntranslations. Hyperparameter optimization proves crucial, with different size\nmodels (7b, 13b, and 70b) reasonably undergoing additional training. Validating\nour methods, we construct a dataset of 65,000 scientific papers. Although we\nhave succeeded in partially embedding knowledge, the study highlights the\ncomplexities and limitations of incorporating specialized information into\nLLMs, suggesting areas for further improvement.",

In this model, resulting intrinsic ellipticity\ncorrelations are typically present on small scales, but neither observations\nnor simulations have found empirical evidence; instead, simulations point at\nthe possibility that alignments of disc galaxies follow a similar alignment\nmodel as elliptical galaxies, but with a weaker alignment amplitude. In our\narticle we make the case for the theory of linear alignments resulting from\ntidal distortions of the galactic disc, investigate the physical properties of\nthis model and derive the resulting angular ellipticity spectra, as they would\nappear as a contribution to weak gravitational lensing in surveys such as\nEuclid's. We discuss in detail on the statistical and physical properties of\ntidally induced alignments in disc galaxies, as they are relevant for\nmitigation of alignment contamination in weak lensing data, comment on the\nconsistency between the alignment amplitude in spiral and elliptical galaxies\nand finally, estimate their observability with a Euclid-like survey.",

            "summary": "Large and rich data is a prerequisite for effective training of deep neural\nnetworks. However, the irregularity of point cloud data makes manual annotation\ntime-consuming and laborious. Self-supervised representation learning, which\nleverages the intrinsic structure of large-scale unlabelled data to learn\nmeaningful feature representations, has attracted increasing attention in the\nfield of point cloud research. However, self-supervised representation learning\noften suffers from model collapse, resulting in reduced information and\ndiversity of the learned representation, and consequently degrading the\nperformance of downstream tasks. To address this problem, we propose\nPointMoment, a novel framework for point cloud self-supervised representation\nlearning that utilizes a high-order mixed moment loss function rather than the\nconventional contrastive loss function. Moreover, our framework does not\nrequire any special techniques such as asymmetric network architectures,\ngradient stopping, etc. Specifically, we calculate the high-order mixed moment\nof the feature variables and force them to decompose into products of their\nindividual moment, thereby making multiple variables more independent and\nminimizing the feature redundancy. We also incorporate a contrastive learning\napproach to maximize the feature invariance under different data augmentations\nof the same point cloud. Experimental results show that our approach\noutperforms previous unsupervised learning methods on the downstream task of 3D\npoint cloud classification and segmentation.",

The timely and accurate prediction of CWHTs' destinations and dwell times\nplay a key role in effective environmental management. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a prediction method based on an interpretable\nactivity-based model, input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM), and validate it\non 300 CWHTs in Chengdu, China. Contextual factors are considered in the model\nto improve its prediction power. Results show that the IOHMM outperforms\nseveral baseline models, including Markov chains, linear regression, and long\nshort-term memory. Factors influencing the predictability of CWHTs'\ntransportation activities are also explored using linear regression models.\nResults suggest the proposed model holds promise in assisting authorities by\npredicting the upcoming transportation activities of CWHTs and administering\nintervention in a timely and effective manner.",

We analysed the eRASS:4 data to study the distribution\nand the spectral properties of the hot interstellar plasma and the bright\nstellar sources in the Carina nebula. Spectral extraction regions of the\ndiffuse emission were defined based on X-ray spectral morphology and\nmulti-wavelength data. The spectra were fit with a combination of thermal and\nnon-thermal emission models. X-ray bright point sources in the Carina nebula\nare the colliding wind binary $\\eta$ Car, several O stars, and Wolf-Rayet (WR)\nstars. We extracted the spectrum of the brightest stellar sources, which can be\nwell fit with a multi-component thermal plasma model. The spectra of the\ndiffuse emission in the brighter parts of the Carina nebula is well reproduced\nby two thermal models, a lower-temperature component ($\\sim$0.2 keV) and a\nhigher-temperature component (0.6 - 0.8 keV). An additional non-thermal\ncomponent dominates the emission above $\\sim$1 keV in the central region around\n$\\eta$ Car and the other massive stars. Significant orbital variation of the\nX-ray flux was measured for $\\eta$ Car, WR22 and WR25. $\\eta$ Car requires an\nadditional time-variable thermal component in the spectral model, which is\nassociated to the wind-wind-collision zone. Properties like temperature,\npressure, and luminosity of the X-ray emitting plasma in the Carina nebula\nderived from the eROSITA data are consistent with theoretical calculations of\nemission from superbubbles. It confirms that the X-ray emission is caused by\nthe hot plasma inside the Carina nebula which has been shocked-heated by the\nstellar winds of the massive stars, in particular, of $\\eta$ Car.",

            "summary": "6-DoF object-agnostic grasping in unstructured environments is a critical yet\nchallenging task in robotics. Most current works use non-optimized approaches\nto sample grasp locations and learn spatial features without concerning the\ngrasping task. This paper proposes GraNet, a graph-based grasp pose generation\nframework that translates a point cloud scene into multi-level graphs and\npropagates features through graph neural networks. By building graphs at the\nscene level, object level, and grasp point level, GraNet enhances feature\nembedding at multiple scales while progressively converging to the ideal\ngrasping locations by learning. Our pipeline can thus characterize the spatial\ndistribution of grasps in cluttered scenes, leading to a higher rate of\neffective grasping. Furthermore, we enhance the representation ability of\nscalable graph networks by a structure-aware attention mechanism to exploit\nlocal relations in graphs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe large-scale GraspNet-1Billion benchmark, especially in grasping unseen\nobjects (+11.62 AP). The real robot experiment shows a high success rate in\ngrasping scattered objects, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach in unstructured environments.",

            "summary": "Diabetes encompasses a complex landscape of glycemic control that varies\nwidely among individuals. However, current methods do not faithfully capture\nthis variability at the meal level. On the one hand, expert-crafted features\nlack the flexibility of data-driven methods; on the other hand, learned\nrepresentations tend to be uninterpretable which hampers clinical adoption. In\nthis paper, we propose a hybrid variational autoencoder to learn interpretable\nrepresentations of CGM and meal data. Our method grounds the latent space to\nthe inputs of a mechanistic differential equation, producing embeddings that\nreflect physiological quantities, such as insulin sensitivity, glucose\neffectiveness, and basal glucose levels. Moreover, we introduce a novel method\nto infer the glucose appearance rate, making the mechanistic model robust to\nunreliable meal logs. On a dataset of CGM and self-reported meals from\nindividuals with type-2 diabetes and pre-diabetes, our unsupervised\nrepresentation discovers a separation between individuals proportional to their\ndisease severity. Our embeddings produce clusters that are up to 4x better than\nnaive, expert, black-box, and pure mechanistic features. Our method provides a\nnuanced, yet interpretable, embedding space to compare glycemic control within\nand across individuals, directly learnable from in-the-wild data.",

We present a general\nformula for the electron EDM, without specifying the structure of the dark\nsectors, and discuss the current constraints on various dark sector models. It\nis noteworthy that even in the case of a CP-conserving 2HDM, the resulting\nelectron EDM is capable of reaching the current experimental limit, with CP\nviolation arising exclusively from the dark sectors. Furthermore, we introduce\na heavy dark sector (HDS) approximation for the analytic calculation of the\nEDM, assuming that the dark sector particles are much heavier than the physical\nstates in the 2HDM.

            "summary": "Most deep learning-based point cloud processing methods are supervised and\nrequire large scale of labeled data. However, manual labeling of point cloud\ndata is laborious and time-consuming. Self-supervised representation learning\ncan address the aforementioned issue by learning robust and generalized\nrepresentations from unlabeled datasets. Nevertheless, the embedded features\nobtained by representation learning usually contain redundant information, and\nmost current methods reduce feature redundancy by linear correlation\nconstraints. In this paper, we propose PointJEM, a self-supervised\nrepresentation learning method applied to the point cloud field. PointJEM\ncomprises an embedding scheme and a loss function based on joint entropy. The\nembedding scheme divides the embedding vector into different parts, each part\ncan learn a distinctive feature. To reduce redundant information in the\nfeatures, PointJEM maximizes the joint entropy between the different parts,\nthereby rendering the learned feature variables pairwise independent. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on multiple\ndatasets. The results demonstrate that our method can significantly reduce\nfeature redundancy beyond linear correlation. Furthermore, PointJEM achieves\ncompetitive performance in downstream tasks such as classification and\nsegmentation.",

            "summary": "The spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) has recently spread from its\nnative range to several other countries and forecasts predict that it may\nbecome a global invasive pest. In particular, since its confirmed presence in\nthe United States in 2014 it has established itself as a major invasive pest in\nthe Mid-Atlantic region where it is damaging both naturally occurring and\ncommercially important farmed plants. Quarantine zones have been introduced to\ncontain the infestation, but the spread to new areas continues. At present the\npathways and drivers of spread are not well-understood. In particular, several\nhuman activity related factors have been proposed to contribute to the spread;\nhowever, which features of the current spread can be attributed to these\nfactors remains unclear. Here we collect county level data on infestation\nstatus and four human activity related factors and use statistical methods to\ndetermine whether there is evidence for an association between the factors and\ninfestation. Then we construct a mechanistic network model based on the factors\nfound to be associated with infestation and use it to simulate local spread. We\nfind that the model reproduces key features of the spread 2014 to 2021. In\nparticular, the growth of the main infestation region and the opening of spread\ncorridors in the westward and southwestern directions is consistent with data\nand the model accurately forecasts the correct infestation status at the county\nlevel in 2021 with $81\\%$ accuracy. We then use the model to forecast the\nspread up to 2025 in a larger region. Given that this model is based on a few\nhuman activity related factors that can be targeted, it may prove useful in\ninforming management and further modeling efforts related to the current\nspotted lanternfly infestation in the US and potentially for current and future\ninvasions elsewhere globally.",

While termination\nanalysis has been studied for many years, existing methods have limited\nscalability and are only effective on small programs. To address this issue, we\npropose a practical termination checking technique, called EndWatch, for\ndetecting non-termination caused by infinite loops through testing.\nSpecifically, we introduce two methods to generate non-termination oracles\nbased on checking state revisits, i.e., if the program returns to a previously\nvisited state at the same program location, it does not terminate. The\nnon-termination oracles can be incorporated into testing tools (e.g., AFL used\nin this paper) to detect non-termination in large programs. For linear loops,\nwe perform symbolic execution on individual loops to infer State Revisit\nConditions (SRCs) and instrument SRCs into target loops. For non-linear loops,\nwe instrument target loops for checking concrete state revisits during\nexecution. We evaluated EndWatch on standard benchmarks with small-sized\nprograms and real-world projects with large-sized programs. The evaluation\nresults show that EndWatch is more effective than the state-of-the-art tools on\nstandard benchmarks (detecting 87% of non-terminating programs while the best\nbaseline detects only 67%), and useful in detecting non-termination in\nreal-world projects (detecting 90% of known non-termination CVEs and 4 unknown\nbugs).",

            "summary": "Generic `toxicity' classifiers continue to be used for evaluating the\npotential for harm in natural language generation, despite mounting evidence of\ntheir shortcomings. We consider the challenge of measuring misogyny in natural\nlanguage generation, and argue that generic `toxicity' classifiers are\ninadequate for this task. We use data from two well-characterised `Incel'\ncommunities on Reddit that differ primarily in their degrees of misogyny to\nconstruct a pair of training corpora which we use to fine-tune two language\nmodels. We show that an open source `toxicity' classifier is unable to\ndistinguish meaningfully between generations from these models. We contrast\nthis with a misogyny-specific lexicon recently proposed by feminist\nsubject-matter experts, demonstrating that, despite the limitations of simple\nlexicon-based approaches, this shows promise as a benchmark to evaluate\nlanguage models for misogyny, and that it is sensitive enough to reveal the\nknown differences in these Reddit communities. Our preliminary findings\nhighlight the limitations of a generic approach to evaluating harms, and\nfurther emphasise the need for careful benchmark design and selection in\nnatural language evaluation.",

            "summary": "Given an object of interest, visual navigation aims to reach the object's\nlocation based on a sequence of partial observations. To this end, an agent\nneeds to 1) learn a piece of certain knowledge about the relations of object\ncategories in the world during training and 2) look for the target object based\non the pre-learned object category relations and its moving trajectory in the\ncurrent unseen environment. In this paper, we propose a Category Relation Graph\n(CRG) to learn the knowledge of object category layout relations and a\nTemporal-Spatial-Region (TSR) attention architecture to perceive the long-term\nspatial-temporal dependencies of objects helping the navigation. We learn prior\nknowledge of object layout, establishing a category relationship graph to\ndeduce the positions of specific objects. Subsequently, we introduced TSR to\ncapture the relationships of objects in temporal, spatial, and regions within\nthe observation trajectories. Specifically, we propose a Temporal attention\nmodule (T) to model the temporal structure of the observation sequence, which\nimplicitly encodes the historical moving or trajectory information. Then, a\nSpatial attention module (S) is used to uncover the spatial context of the\ncurrent observation objects based on the category relation graph and past\nobservations. Last, a Region attention module (R) shifts the attention to the\ntarget-relevant region. Based on the visual representation extracted by our\nmethod, the agent can better perceive the environment and easily learn superior\nnavigation policy. Experiments on AI2-THOR demonstrate our CRG-TSR method\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods regarding both effectiveness and\nefficiency. The code has been included in the supplementary material and will\nbe publicly available.",

To overcome these\ndrawbacks, we propose a feature augmentation method based on shape space\ntheory, i.e., Geodesic curve feature augmentation, called GCFA in brevity.\nFirst, we extract features from the image with the neural network model.

Finally,\nthe many generated features on the Geodesic curve are used to train the various\nmachine learning models. The GCFA module can be seamlessly integrated with most\nmachine learning methods.

            "summary": "Although many efforts have been made on decreasing the model complexity for\nspeaker verification, it is still challenging to deploy speaker verification\nsystems with satisfactory result on low-resource terminals. We design a\ntransformation module that performs feature partition and fusion to implement\nlightweight speaker verification. The transformation module consists of\nmultiple simple but effective operations, such as convolution, pooling, mean,\nconcatenation, normalization, and element-wise summation. It works in a\nplug-and-play way, and can be easily implanted into a wide variety of models to\nreduce the model complexity while maintaining the model error. First, the input\nfeature is split into several low-dimensional feature subsets for decreasing\nthe model complexity. Then, each feature subset is updated by fusing it with\nthe inter-feature-subsets correlational information to enhance its\nrepresentational capability. Finally, the updated feature subsets are\nindependently fed into the block (one or several layers) of the model for\nfurther processing. The features that are output from current block of the\nmodel are processed according to the steps above before they are fed into the\nnext block of the model. Experimental data are selected from two public speech\ncorpora (namely VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2). Results show that implanting the\ntransformation module into three models (namely AMCRN, ResNet34, and\nECAPA-TDNN) for speaker verification slightly increases the model error and\nsignificantly decreases the model complexity. Our proposed method outperforms\nbaseline methods on the whole in memory requirement and computational\ncomplexity with lower equal error rate. It also generalizes well across\ntruncated segments with various lengths.",

In\nthis work we show that the measured population-level redshift distribution of\nBBHs sheds light on the properties of their probable host galaxies.

We then constrain parameters of a physically motivated\npower-law delay-time distribution using GWTC-3 data, and self-consistently\ntrack galaxies in the \\textsc{UniverseMachine} simulations with this delay time\nmodel to infer the probable host galaxies of BBHs over a range of redshifts.

Pessimists believe that AIGC will replace humans in the\nfuture, and optimists think that it will further liberate productivity. Public\nemotions play a crucial role on social media platforms. They can provide\nvaluable insights into the public's opinions, attitudes, and behaviors. There\nis a lack of research on the analysis of social group emotions triggered by\nAIGC content, and even more on the cross-platform differences of group\nemotions. This study fills the research gap by connecting the theory of group\ndynamics with emotions in social media. Specifically, we develop a scientific\ngroup emotion calculation and visualization system based on chains of\ncommunication. The system is capable of crawling data in real time and\npresenting the current state of group emotions in a fine-grained manner. We\nthen analyze which group dynamic factors drive different public emotions\ntowards nine AIGC products on the three most popular social media platforms in\nChina. Finally, we obtain four main findings. First, Douyin is the only\nplatform with negative group emotion on emerging AI technologies. Second, Weibo\nusers prefer extreme emotions more than others. Third, the group emotion varies\nby education and age. It is negatively correlated with senior high school or\nlower and 25 or younger, and positively correlated with bachelor's degree or\nhigher and 26-35. Fourth, the group emotion polarization increases with more\nposts without comments and celebrity publishers. By analyzing the key dynamic\nfactors of group emotions to AIGC on various social media platforms, we can\nimprove our products and services, develop more effective marketing strategies,\nand create more accurate and effective AI models to solve complex problems.",

Scalable algorithms for learning kernel models need to be iterative\nin nature, but convergence can be slow due to poor conditioning. Spectral\npreconditioning is an important tool to speed-up the convergence of such\niterative algorithms for training kernel models. However computing and storing\na spectral preconditioner can be expensive which can lead to large\ncomputational and storage overheads, precluding the application of kernel\nmethods to problems with large datasets. A Nystrom approximation of the\nspectral preconditioner is often cheaper to compute and store, and has\ndemonstrated success in practical applications. In this paper we analyze the\ntrade-offs of using such an approximated preconditioner. Specifically, we show\nthat a sample of logarithmic size (as a function of the size of the dataset)\nenables the Nystrom-based approximated preconditioner to accelerate gradient\ndescent nearly as well as the exact preconditioner, while also reducing the\ncomputational and storage overheads.",

            "summary": "Continual learning addresses the problem of continuously acquiring and\ntransferring knowledge without catastrophic forgetting of old concepts. While\nhumans achieve continual learning via diverse neurocognitive mechanisms, there\nis a mismatch between cognitive properties and evaluation methods of continual\nlearning models. First, the measurement of continual learning models mostly\nrelies on evaluation metrics at a micro-level, which cannot characterize\ncognitive capacities of the model. Second, the measurement is method-specific,\nemphasizing model strengths in one aspect while obscuring potential weaknesses\nin other respects. To address these issues, we propose to integrate model\ncognitive capacities and evaluation metrics into a unified evaluation paradigm.\nWe first characterize model capacities via desiderata derived from cognitive\nproperties supporting human continual learning. The desiderata concern (1)\nadaptability in varying lengths of task sequence; (2) sensitivity to dynamic\ntask variations; and (3) efficiency in memory usage and training time\nconsumption. Then we design evaluation protocols for each desideratum to assess\ncognitive capacities of recent continual learning models. Experimental results\nshow that no method we consider has satisfied all the desiderata and is still\nfar away from realizing truly continual learning. Although some methods exhibit\nsome degree of adaptability and efficiency, no method is able to identify task\nrelationships when encountering dynamic task variations, or achieve a trade-off\nin learning similarities and differences between tasks. Inspired by these\nresults, we discuss possible factors that influence model performance in these\ndesiderata and provide guidance for the improvement of continual learning\nmodels.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel measure of\ndissimilarity, the mixture Cramer-Wold distance.

            "summary": "Semantic communications are expected to become the core new paradigms of the\nsixth generation (6G) wireless networks. Most existing works implicitly utilize\nchannel information for codecs training, which leads to poor communications\nwhen channel type or statistical characteristics change. To tackle this issue\nposed by various channels, a novel channel-transferable semantic communications\n(CT-SemCom) framework is proposed, which adapts the codecs learned on one type\nof channel to other types of channels. Furthermore, integrating the proposed\nframework and the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems\nintegrating non-orthogonal multiple access technologies, i.e., OFDM-NOMA\nsystems, a power allocation problem to realize the transfer from additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) channels to multi-subcarrier Rayleigh fading channels is\nformulated. We then design a semantics-similar dual transformation (SSDT)\nalgorithm to derive analytical solutions with low complexity. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed CT-SemCom framework with SSDT algorithm\nsignificantly outperforms the existing work w.r.t. channel transferability,\ne.g., the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of image transmission improves by\n4.2-7.3 dB under different variances of Rayleigh fading channels.",

To address\ndata scarcity and imbalance in MPP, some studies have adopted Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNN) as an encoder to extract commonalities from molecular graphs.\nHowever, these approaches often use a separate predictor for each task,\nneglecting the shared characteristics among predictors corresponding to\ndifferent tasks. In response to this limitation, we introduce the GNN-MoCE\narchitecture. It employs the Mixture of Collaborative Experts (MoCE) as\npredictors, exploiting task commonalities while confronting the homogeneity\nissue in the expert pool and the decision dominance dilemma within the expert\ngroup. To enhance expert diversity for collaboration among all experts, the\nExpert-Specific Projection method is proposed to assign a unique projection\nperspective to each expert. To balance decision-making influence for\ncollaboration within the expert group, the Expert-Specific Loss is presented to\nintegrate individual expert loss into the weighted decision loss of the group\nfor more equitable training. Benefiting from the enhancements of MoCE in expert\ncreation, dynamic expert group formation, and experts' collaboration, our model\ndemonstrates superior performance over traditional methods on 24 MPP datasets,\nespecially in tasks with limited data or high imbalance.",

We find that in general LMMs are not robust to visual adversarial\ninputs.

Notably, the LMMs evaluated demonstrated remarkable\nresilience to such attacks on the ScienceQA task with only an 8.10% drop in\nperformance compared to their visual counterparts which dropped 99.73%.

We hypothesize that students can better acquire the\nteacher's knowledge by matching the input gradient. Leveraging the observation\nthat adversarial training renders the model locally linear on the input space,\nwe employ Taylor approximation to effectively align gradients without directly\ncalculating them. Experimental results show that IGDM seamlessly integrates\nwith existing AD methods, significantly enhancing the performance of all AD\nmethods. Particularly, utilizing IGDM on the CIFAR-100 dataset improves the\nAutoAttack accuracy from 28.06% to 30.32% with the ResNet-18 model and from\n26.18% to 29.52% with the MobileNetV2 model when integrated into the SOTA\nmethod without additional data augmentation. The code will be made available.",

Mathematical\nmodelling of such games results in what's called a Bilevel Optimization\nproblem. There is an entire area of research dedicated to analyzing and solving\nBilevel Optimization problems which are often complex, and finding solutions\nfor such problems is known to be NP-Hard. A generalization of Stackelberg games\nis a Multilevel Stackelberg game where we may have nested leaders and\nfollowers, such that a follower is, in turn, a leader for all lower-level\nplayers. These problems are much more difficult to solve, and existing solution\napproaches typically require extensive cooperation between the players (which\ngenerally can't be assumed) or make restrictive assumptions about the structure\nof the problem. In this paper, we present a stochastic algorithm to approximate\nthe local equilibrium solutions for these Multilevel games. We then construct a\nfew examples of such Multilevel problems, including: a) a nested toll-setting\nproblem; and b) an adversarial initial condition determination problem for\nRobust Trajectory Optimization. We test our algorithm on our constructed\nproblems as well as some trilevel problems from the literature, and show that\nit is able to approximate the optimum solutions for these problems within a\nreasonable error margin. We also provide an asymptotic proof for the\nconvergence of the algorithm and empirically analyze its accuracy and\nconvergence speed for different parameters.

This paper proposes a scalable framework\nfor constructing a reinforcement learning policy bank that can perform RAN\noptimization across a large number of cell sites with varying traffic patterns.\nCentral to our framework is a novel application of anomaly detection techniques\nto assess the compatibility between sites (tasks) and the policy bank. This\nallows our framework to intelligently identify when a policy can be reused for\na task, and when a new policy needs to be trained and added to the policy bank.\nOur results show that our approach to compatibility assessment leads to an\nefficient use of computational resources, by allowing us to construct a\nperformant policy bank without exhaustively training on all tasks, which makes\nit applicable under real-world constraints.",

We introduce a zero-shot navigation\napproach, Vision-Language Frontier Maps (VLFM), which is inspired by human\nreasoning and designed to navigate towards unseen semantic objects in novel\nenvironments. VLFM builds occupancy maps from depth observations to identify\nfrontiers, and leverages RGB observations and a pre-trained vision-language\nmodel to generate a language-grounded value map. VLFM then uses this map to\nidentify the most promising frontier to explore for finding an instance of a\ngiven target object category. We evaluate VLFM in photo-realistic environments\nfrom the Gibson, Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D), and Matterport 3D (MP3D)\ndatasets within the Habitat simulator. Remarkably, VLFM achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on all three datasets as measured by success weighted\nby path length (SPL) for the Object Goal Navigation task. Furthermore, we show\nthat VLFM's zero-shot nature enables it to be readily deployed on real-world\nrobots such as the Boston Dynamics Spot mobile manipulation platform. We deploy\nVLFM on Spot and demonstrate its capability to efficiently navigate to target\nobjects within an office building in the real world, without any prior\nknowledge of the environment.

We show that this formulation also leads to a penalized\ndecomposition of the covariance (or Gram) matrix, $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}$. We\nintroduce empirical Bayes versions of these penalized problems, in which the\npenalties are determined by prior distributions that are estimated from the\ndata by maximum likelihood rather than cross-validation. The resulting\n\"Empirical Bayes Covariance Decomposition\" provides a principled and efficient\nsolution to the MTP in sparse PCA, and one that can be immediately extended to\nincorporate other structural assumptions (e.g. non-negative PCA).

            "summary": "A growing number of scholars and data scientists are conducting randomized\nexperiments to analyze causal relationships in network settings where units\ninfluence one another. A dominant methodology for analyzing these network\nexperiments has been design-based, leveraging randomization of treatment\nassignment as the basis for inference. In this paper, we generalize this\ndesign-based approach so that it can be applied to more complex experiments\nwith a variety of causal estimands with different target populations. An\nimportant special case of such generalized network experiments is a bipartite\nnetwork experiment, in which the treatment assignment is randomized among one\nset of units and the outcome is measured for a separate set of units. We\npropose a broad class of causal estimands based on stochastic intervention for\ngeneralized network experiments. Using a design-based approach, we show how to\nestimate the proposed causal quantities without bias, and develop conservative\nvariance estimators. We apply our methodology to a randomized experiment in\neducation where a group of selected students in middle schools are eligible for\nthe anti-conflict promotion program, and the program participation is\nrandomized within this group. In particular, our analysis estimates the causal\neffects of treating each student or his/her close friends, for different target\npopulations in the network. We find that while the treatment improves the\noverall awareness against conflict among students, it does not significantly\nreduce the total number of conflicts.",

A rich tapestry of atomic ordering influences the\nstructural phase transitions (SPTs), but there is little understanding of the\nmechanistic details of the phase transition. An atomistic level study was\nconducted to investigate the local structure of the 1$T$$'$ and $T_d$ phases of\nMoTe${_2}$ by using the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) technique. While the\naverage structure exhibits an SPT and co-existence of phases as a function of\ntemperature, the local structure shows the suppression of SPT at short-range\nordering, and the sample remains in the monoclinic (1$T$$'$) phase at all\nmeasured temperatures. A sharp PDF peak observed at short distances indicated a\nstrong atom-atom correlation between the Mo and Te atoms within the\nMo-octahedra. In addition, a large box modeling of the PDF data indicated a\npreferential motion of Te atoms towards $c$-axis at all temperatures. The\nstructural defects, such as stacking faults, likely result in the co-existence\nof phases in the average structure and suppress the local SPT of MoTe$_2$.\nThese results are stepping stones in understanding the long-debated origins of\nstructural, vibrational, and electronic properties of MoTe$_2$ and similar\ntransition metal dichalcogenides.",

The lack of understanding of what actually\nconstitutes good views for NeRF makes it difficult to actively plan a sequence\nof views that yield the maximal reconstruction quality. We propose Surrogate\nObjectives for Active Radiance Fields (SOAR), which is a set of interpretable\nfunctions that evaluates the goodness of views using geometric and photometric\nvisual cues - surface coverage, geometric complexity, textural complexity, and\nray diversity. Moreover, by learning to infer the SOAR scores from a deep\nnetwork, SOARNet, we are able to effectively select views in mere seconds\ninstead of hours, without the need for prior visits to all the candidate views\nor training any radiance field during such planning. Our experiments show\nSOARNet outperforms the baselines with $\\sim$80x speed-up while achieving\nbetter or comparable reconstruction qualities.

We illustrate the case with a\nlevel-three operator, and derive the corresponding form of the monodromy\nproblem. We solve the monodromy problem perturbatively and numerically; and\ncheck that it agrees with the standard monodromy method, despite the fact that\nthe two versions of the monodromy problem do not seem to be related in any\nobvious way.

In a double-layer scheme, the\nelectrons in an ultrathin solid foil are first pushed out by an intense laser\ndriver and then interact with the laser reflected off a second foil to form a\nhigh-density relativistic electron sheet with vanishing transverse momentum.\nHowever, the repulsion between these concentrated electrons can increase the\nthickness of the layer, reducing both its density and subsequently the coherent\nTBS. Here, we present a systematic study on the evolution of the flying\nelectron layer and find that its resulting thickness is determined by the\ninterplay between the intrinsic space-charge expansion and the velocity\ncompression induced by the drive laser. How the laser driver, the target areal\ndensity, the reflector and the collision laser intensity affect the properties\nof the produced X-rays is explored. Multi-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulations indicate that employing this scheme in the nonlinear regime has the\npotential to stably produce soft X-rays with several GW peak power in hundreds\nof TW ultrafast laser facilities.

While\nnumerous constraints and regularization terms have been proposed in the\nliterature to promote fairness in machine learning tasks, most of these methods\nare not amenable to stochastic optimization due to the complex and nonlinear\nstructure of constraints and regularizers. Here, the term \"stochastic\" refers\nto the ability of the algorithm to work with small mini-batches of data.\nMotivated by the limitation of existing literature, this paper presents a\nunified stochastic optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization\nbased on f-divergence measures (f-FERM). The proposed stochastic algorithm\nenjoys theoretical convergence guarantees. In addition, our experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs offered by f-FERM\nfor almost all batch sizes (ranging from full-batch to batch size of one).\nMoreover, we show that our framework can be extended to the case where there is\na distribution shift from training to the test data. Our extension is based on\na distributionally robust optimization reformulation of f-FERM objective under\n$L_p$ norms as uncertainty sets. Again, in this distributionally robust\nsetting, f-FERM not only enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees but also\noutperforms other baselines in the literature in the tasks involving\ndistribution shifts.

In CAFE, we propose a fast and lightweight sketch data\nstructure, named HotSketch, to capture feature importance and report hot\nfeatures in real time. For each reported hot feature, we assign it a unique\nembedding. For the non-hot features, we allow multiple features to share one\nembedding by using hash embedding technique. Guided by our design philosophy,\nwe further propose a multi-level hash embedding framework to optimize the\nembedding tables of non-hot features. We theoretically analyze the accuracy of\nHotSketch, and analyze the model convergence against deviation. Extensive\nexperiments show that CAFE significantly outperforms existing embedding\ncompression methods, yielding 3.92% and 3.68% superior testing AUC on Criteo\nKaggle dataset and CriteoTB dataset at a compression ratio of 10000x. The\nsource codes of CAFE are available at GitHub.",

            "summary": "As the backbone of the fifth-generation (5G) cellular network, massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) encounters a significant challenge in\npractical applications: how to deploy a large number of antenna elements within\nlimited spaces. Recently, holographic communication has emerged as a potential\nsolution to this issue. It employs dense antenna arrays and provides a\ntractable model. Nevertheless, some challenges must be addressed to actualize\nthis innovative concept. One is the mutual coupling among antenna elements\nwithin an array. When the element spacing is small, near-field coupling becomes\nthe dominant factor that strongly restricts the array performance. Another is\nthe polarization of electromagnetic waves. As an intrinsic property, it was not\nfully considered in the previous channel modeling of holographic communication.\nThe third is the lack of real-world experiments to show the potential and\npossible defects of a holographic communication system. In this paper, we\npropose an electromagnetic channel model based on the characteristics of\nelectromagnetic waves. This model encompasses the impact of mutual coupling in\nthe transceiver sides and the depolarization in the propagation environment.\nFurthermore, by approximating an infinite array, the performance restrictions\nof large-scale dense antenna arrays are also studied theoretically to exploit\nthe potential of the proposed channel. In addition, numerical simulations and a\nchannel measurement experiment are conducted. The findings reveal that within\nlimited spaces, the coupling effect, particularly for element spacing smaller\nthan half of the wavelength, is the primary factor leading to the inflection\npoint for the performance of holographic communications.",

Recently, task-oriented semantic\ncommunications have been proposed for low-latency inference with limited\nbandwidth. Although transmitting only task-related information does protect a\ncertain level of user privacy, adversaries could apply model inversion\ntechniques to reconstruct the raw data or extract useful information, thereby\ninfringing on users' privacy. To mitigate privacy infringement, this paper\nproposes an information bottleneck and adversarial learning (IBAL) approach to\nprotect users' privacy against model inversion attacks. Specifically, we\nextract task-relevant features from the input based on the information\nbottleneck (IB) theory. To overcome the difficulty in calculating the mutual\ninformation in high-dimensional space, we derive a variational upper bound to\nestimate the true mutual information. To prevent data reconstruction from\ntask-related features by adversaries, we leverage adversarial learning to train\nencoder to fool adversaries by maximizing reconstruction distortion.\nFurthermore, considering the impact of channel variations on privacy-utility\ntrade-off and the difficulty in manually tuning the weights of each loss, we\npropose an adaptive weight adjustment method. Numerical results demonstrate\nthat the proposed approaches can effectively protect privacy without\nsignificantly affecting task performance and achieve better privacy-utility\ntrade-offs than baseline methods.",

            "summary": "Deep learning based intrusion detection systems (DL-based IDS) have emerged\nas one of the best choices for providing security solutions against various\nnetwork intrusion attacks. However, due to the emergence and development of\nadversarial deep learning technologies, it becomes challenging for the adoption\nof DL models into IDS. In this paper, we propose a novel IDS architecture that\ncan enhance the robustness of IDS against adversarial attacks by combining\nconventional machine learning (ML) models and Deep Learning models. The\nproposed DLL-IDS consists of three components: DL-based IDS, adversarial\nexample (AE) detector, and ML-based IDS. We first develop a novel AE detector\nbased on the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID). Then, we exploit the low\nattack transferability between DL models and ML models to find a robust ML\nmodel that can assist us in determining the maliciousness of AEs. If the input\ntraffic is detected as an AE, the ML-based IDS will predict the maliciousness\nof input traffic, otherwise the DL-based IDS will work for the prediction. The\nfusion mechanism can leverage the high prediction accuracy of DL models and low\nattack transferability between DL models and ML models to improve the\nrobustness of the whole system. In our experiments, we observe a significant\nimprovement in the prediction performance of the IDS when subjected to\nadversarial attack, achieving high accuracy with low resource consumption.",

            "summary": "Large-scale structure (LSS) surveys will increasingly provide stringent\nconstraints on our cosmological models. Recently, the density-marked\ncorrelation function (MCF) has been introduced, offering an easily computable\ndensity-correlation statistic. Simulations have demonstrated that MCFs offer\nadditional, independent constraints on cosmological models beyond the standard\ntwo-point correlation (2PCF). In this study, we apply MCFs for the first time\nto SDSS CMASS data, aiming to investigate the statistical information regarding\nclustering and anisotropy properties in the Universe and assess the performance\nof various weighting schemes in MCFs. Upon analyzing the CMASS data, we observe\nthat, by combining different weights ($\\alpha = [-0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.6]$), the MCFs\nprovide a tight and independent constraint on the cosmological parameter\n$\\Omega_m$, yielding $\\Omega_m = 0.293 \\pm0.006$ at the $1\\sigma$ level, which\nrepresents a significant reduction in the statistical error by a factor of 3.4\ncompared to that from 2PCF. Our constraint is consistent with recent findings\nfrom the small-scale clustering of BOSS galaxies \\cite{arXiv:2203.08999v2}\nwithin the 1$\\sigma$ level. However, we also find that our estimate is lower\nthan the Planck measurements by about 2.6$\\sigma$, indicating the potential\npresence of new physics beyond the standard cosmological model if all the\nsystematics are fully corrected. The method outlined in this study can be\nextended to other surveys and datasets, allowing for the constraint of other\ncosmological parameters. Additionally, it serves as a valuable tool for\nforthcoming emulator analysis on the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST).",

For\nthis, the anisotropic fluid distribution is considered as a seed source that is\nextended through the inclusion of a new gravitational source. The influence of\nthe later matter configuration is controlled by the decoupling parameter. We\nformulate the field equations corresponding to the total matter source that are\nthen decoupled into two distinct sets by implementing a transformation only on\nthe radial metric coefficient. Both of these under-determined sets correspond\nto their parent sources. Some well-behaved forms of the metric potentials are\ntaken into account to deal with the first set of equations. On the other hand,\nwe solve the second set corresponding to an additional source by taking\ndifferent constraints on the matter sector. We then consider the radius and\nmass of a compact star $4U~1820-30$ to analyze the physical feasibility of the\nresulting solutions for a particular modified model.

Most current studies\nconventionally apply linear scaling to all elemental abundances based on the\ngas-phase metallicity. However, these elements, including carbon and oxygen,\nare enriched differentially by stellar nucleosynthesis and the overall galactic\nchemical evolution, evident from $\\alpha$-enhancement in multiple galactic\nobservations such as starbursts, high-redshift star-forming galaxies, and\nlow-metallicity dwarfs. We perform astrochemical modeling to simulate the\nimpact of an $\\alpha$-enhanced ISM gas cloud on the abundances of the three\nphases of carbon (C$^+$, C, CO) dubbed as `the carbon cycle'. The ISM\nenvironmental parameters considered include two cosmic-ray ionization rates\n($\\zeta_{\\rm CR}=10^{-17}$ and $10^{-15}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$), two isotropic FUV\nradiation field strengths ($\\chi/\\chi_0=1$ and $10^2$), and (sub-)linear\ndust-to-gas relations against metallicity, mimicking the ISM conditions of\ndifferent galaxy types. In galaxies with [C/O] $<$ 0, CO, C and C$^+$ all\ndecrease in both abundances and emission, though with differential biases. The\nlow-$J$ CO emission is found to be the most stable tracer for the molecular\ngas, while C and C$^+$ trace H$_2$ gas only under limited conditions, in line\nwith recent discoveries of [CI]-dark galaxies. We call for caution when using\n[CII]~$158\\mu$m and [CI](1-0) as alternative H$_2$-gas tracers for both diffuse\nand dense gas with non-zero [C/O] ratios.",

For this purpose, we propose a heterogeneity measure that can\ncharacterize the impact of the heterogeneity of a system on its performance\nbehavior in terms of throughput or makespan. We develop a mathematical model to\ncharacterize a heterogeneous system in terms of its task and machine\nheterogeneity dimensions and then reduce it to a single value, called\nHomogeneous Equivalent Execution Time (HEET), which represents the execution\ntime behavior of the entire system. We used AWS EC2 instances to implement a\nreal-world machine learning inference system. Performance evaluation of the\nHEET score across different heterogeneous system configurations demonstrates\nthat HEET can accurately characterize the performance behavior of these\nsystems. In particular, the results show that our proposed method is capable of\npredicting the true makespan of heterogeneous systems without online\nevaluations with an average precision of 84%.

We find that 69 of\nthem appear in Schellekens' list of semi-simple $V_1$ structures of holomorphic\nCFT of central charge $24$, while $8$ of them correspond to the $N=1$\nstructures of holomorphic SCFT of central charge $12$ composed of $24$ chiral\nfermions.

            "summary": "Quantification of real-time informal feedback delivered by an experienced\nsurgeon to a trainee during surgery is important for skill improvements in\nsurgical training. Such feedback in the live operating room is inherently\nmultimodal, consisting of verbal conversations (e.g., questions and answers) as\nwell as non-verbal elements (e.g., through visual cues like pointing to\nanatomic elements). In this work, we leverage a clinically-validated\nfive-category classification of surgical feedback: \"Anatomic\", \"Technical\",\n\"Procedural\", \"Praise\" and \"Visual Aid\". We then develop a multi-label machine\nlearning model to classify these five categories of surgical feedback from\ninputs of text, audio, and video modalities. The ultimate goal of our work is\nto help automate the annotation of real-time contextual surgical feedback at\nscale. Our automated classification of surgical feedback achieves AUCs ranging\nfrom 71.5 to 77.6 with the fusion improving performance by 3.1%. We also show\nthat high-quality manual transcriptions of feedback audio from experts improve\nAUCs to between 76.5 and 96.2, which demonstrates a clear path toward future\nimprovements. Empirically, we find that the Staged training strategy, with\nfirst pre-training each modality separately and then training them jointly, is\nmore effective than training different modalities altogether. We also present\nintuitive findings on the importance of modalities for different feedback\ncategories. This work offers an important first look at the feasibility of\nautomated classification of real-world live surgical feedback based on text,\naudio, and video modalities.",

            "published": "2023-12-06T01:51:03Z",
            "summary": "Existing salient object detection methods are capable of predicting binary\nmaps that highlight visually salient regions. However, these methods are\nlimited in their ability to differentiate the relative importance of multiple\nobjects and the relationships among them, which can lead to errors and reduced\naccuracy in downstream tasks that depend on the relative importance of multiple\nobjects. To conquer, this paper proposes a new paradigm for saliency ranking,\nwhich aims to completely focus on ranking salient objects by their \"importance\norder\". While previous works have shown promising performance, they still face\nill-posed problems. First, the saliency ranking ground truth (GT) orders\ngeneration methods are unreasonable since determining the correct ranking order\nis not well-defined, resulting in false alarms. Second, training a ranking\nmodel remains challenging because most saliency ranking methods follow the\nmulti-task paradigm, leading to conflicts and trade-offs among different tasks.\nThird, existing regression-based saliency ranking methods are complex for\nsaliency ranking models due to their reliance on instance mask-based saliency\nranking orders. These methods require a significant amount of data to perform\naccurately and can be challenging to implement effectively. To solve these\nproblems, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the causes and proposes a\nwhole-flow processing paradigm of saliency ranking task from the perspective of\n\"GT data generation\", \"network structure design\" and \"training protocol\". The\nproposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the\nwidely-used SALICON set, as demonstrated by extensive experiments with fair and\nreasonable comparisons. The saliency ranking task is still in its infancy, and\nour proposed unified framework can serve as a fundamental strategy to guide\nfuture work.",

In this paper, we propose\nto replace image attribute labels with feature extractors. First, a novel\naesthetic attribute evaluation framework based on attribute features is\nproposed to predict attribute scores and overall scores. We call it the F2S\n(attribute features to attribute scores) model. We use networks from different\ntasks to provide attribute features to our F2S models. Then, we define an\naesthetic attribute contribution to describe the role of aesthetic attributes\nthroughout an image and use it with the attribute scores and the overall scores\nto train our F2S model. Sufficient experiments on publicly available datasets\ndemonstrate that our F2S model achieves comparable performance with those\ntrained on the datasets with fully-annotated aesthetic attribute score labels.\nOur method makes it feasible to learn meaningful attribute scores for various\naesthetic attribute sets in different types of images with only overall\naesthetic scores.",

In\nthis work, we consider stochastic and deterministic random walk models of\nsignalling molecules propagating and reacting within one-dimensional spatial\nnetworks with arbitrary node placement and connectivity. By taking a continuum\nlimit of the random walk models, we derive an inhomogeneous\nreaction--diffusion--advection equation, where diffusivity and advective\nvelocity depend on local node density and connectivity within the network. Our\nresults show that large spatial variations of molecule concentrations can be\ninduced by heterogeneous node distributions. Furthermore, we find that noise\nwithin the stochastic random walk model is directly influenced by node density.\nWe apply our models to consider signal propagation within the osteocyte network\nof bone, where signals propagating to the bone surface regulate bone formation\nand resorption processes. We investigate signal-to-noise ratios for different\ndamage detection scenarios and show that the location of perturbations to the\nnetwork can be detected by signals received at the network boundaries.",

One seminal work\ndue to Yurii Nesterov [Nes83a] established $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{L/\\mu})$\ngradient complexity for minimizing an $L$-smooth $\\mu$-strongly convex\nobjective. However, an ideal algorithm would adapt to the explicit complexity\nof a particular objective function and incur faster rates for simpler problems,\ntriggering our reconsideration of two defeats of existing optimization modeling\nand analysis. (i) The worst-case optimality is neither the instance optimality\nnor such one in reality. (ii) Traditional $L$-smoothness condition may not be\nthe primary abstraction/characterization for modern practical problems.\n  In this paper, we open up a new way to design and analyze gradient-based\nalgorithms with direct applications in machine learning, including linear\nregression and beyond. We introduce two factors $(\\alpha, \\tau_{\\alpha})$ to\nrefine the description of the degenerated condition of the optimization\nproblems based on the observation that the singular values of Hessian often\ndrop sharply. We design adaptive algorithms that solve simpler problems without\npre-known knowledge with reduced gradient or analogous oracle accesses. The\nalgorithms also improve the state-of-art complexities for several problems in\nmachine learning, thereby solving the open problem of how to design faster\nalgorithms in light of the known complexity lower bounds. Specially, with the\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$-nuclear norm bounded, we achieve an optimal\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mu^{-1/3})$ (v.s. $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mu^{-1/2})$)\ngradient complexity for linear regression.

            "summary": "Function merging is a pivotal technique for reducing code size by combining\nidentical or similar functions into a single function. While prior research has\nextensively explored this technique, it has not been assessed in conjunction\nwith function outlining and linker's identical code folding, despite\nsubstantial common ground. The traditional approaches necessitate the complete\nintermediate representation to compare functions. Consequently, none of these\napproaches offer a scalable solution compatible with separate compilations\nwhile achieving global function merging, which is critical for large app\ndevelopment. In this paper, we introduce our global function merger, leveraging\nglobal merge information from previous code generation runs to optimistically\ncreate merging instances within each module context independently. Notably, our\napproach remains sound even when intermediate representations change, making it\nwell-suited for distributed build environments. We present a comprehensive code\ngeneration framework that can run both the state-of-the-art global function\noutliner and our global function merger. These components complement each\nother, resulting in a positive impact on code size reduction. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that when integrating the global function merger with a\nstate-of-the-art global function outliner that is fully optimized with ThinLTO,\na further reduction of up to 3.5% in code size can be attained. This is in\naddition to the initial average reduction of 17.3% achieved through global\nfunction outlining for real-world iOS apps, all with minimal extra build time.",

The hourglass-shaped emission nebula NGC 6164/5 surrounds this star.\nThis nebula is presumed to originate from episodic mass-loss events of the\ncentral O-type star, but the detailed formation mechanism is not yet well\nunderstood. Grasping its three-dimensional structure is essential to uncover\nthe origin of this nebula. Here we report the high-resolution multi-object\nspectroscopic observation of NGC 6164/5 using the GIRAFFE on the 8.2m Very\nLarge Telescope. Integrated intensity maps constructed from several spectral\nlines delineate well the overall shape of this nebula, such as the two bright\nlobes and the inner gas region. The position-velocity diagrams show that the\ntwo bright lobes are found to be redshifted and blueshifted, respectively,\nwhile the inner region has multiple layers. We consider a geometric model\ncomposed of a bilateral outflow harboring nitrogen-enriched knots and expanding\ninner shells. Its spectral features are then simulated by using a Monte-Carlo\nradiative transfer technique for different sets of velocities. Some\nposition-velocity diagrams from simulations are very similar to the observed\nones. According to the model that best reproduces the observational data, the\ntwo bright lobes and the nitrogen-enriched knots are moving away from HD 148937\nat about 120 km s$^{-1}$. Their minimum kinematic age is estimated to be about\n7,500 years. We discuss possible formation mechanisms of this nebula in the\ncontext of binary interaction.",

            "summary": "Diffusion models have recently revolutionized the field of image synthesis\ndue to their ability to generate photorealistic images. However, one of the\nmajor drawbacks of diffusion models is that the image generation process is\ncostly. A large image-to-image network has to be applied many times to\niteratively refine an image from random noise. While many recent works propose\ntechniques to reduce the number of required steps, they generally treat the\nunderlying denoising network as a black box. In this work, we investigate the\nbehavior of the layers within the network and find that 1) the layers' output\nchanges smoothly over time, 2) the layers show distinct patterns of change, and\n3) the change from step to step is often very small. We hypothesize that many\nlayer computations in the denoising network are redundant. Leveraging this, we\nintroduce block caching, in which we reuse outputs from layer blocks of\nprevious steps to speed up inference. Furthermore, we propose a technique to\nautomatically determine caching schedules based on each block's changes over\ntimesteps. In our experiments, we show through FID, human evaluation and\nqualitative analysis that Block Caching allows to generate images with higher\nvisual quality at the same computational cost. We demonstrate this for\ndifferent state-of-the-art models (LDM and EMU) and solvers (DDIM and DPM).",

An attractive proposal to solve this problem is the $\\nu\np$-process, which can operate in neutrino-driven outflows in a core-collapse\nsupernova after the shock is launched. Years of detailed studies, however, have\ncast doubt over the ability of this process to generate sufficiently high\nabsolute and relative amounts of various $p$-nuclei. The $\\nu p$-process is\nalso thought to be excluded by arguments based on the long-lived radionuclide\n$^{92}$Nb. Here, we present explicit calculations, in which both the abundance\nratios and the absolute yields of the $p$-nuclei up to $A\\lesssim105$ are\nsuccessfully reproduced, even when using the modern (medium enhanced)\ntriple-$\\alpha$ reaction rates. The process is also shown to produce the\nnecessary amounts of $^{92}$Nb. The models are characterized by subsonic\noutflows and by the protoneutron star masses in the {$\\gtrsim1.7 M_\\odot$\nrange}.

            "summary": "Federated learning (FL) emerges as an effective collaborative learning\nframework to coordinate data and computation resources from massive and\ndistributed clients in training. Such collaboration results in non-trivial\nintellectual property (IP) represented by the model parameters that should be\nprotected and shared by the whole party rather than an individual user.\nMeanwhile, the distributed nature of FL endorses a malicious client the\nconvenience to compromise IP through illegal model leakage to unauthorized\nthird parties. To block such IP leakage, it is essential to make the IP\nidentifiable in the shared model and locate the anonymous infringer who first\nleaks it. The collective challenges call for \\emph{accountable federated\nlearning}, which requires verifiable ownership of the model and is capable of\nrevealing the infringer's identity upon leakage. In this paper, we propose\nDecodable Unique Watermarking (DUW) for complying with the requirements of\naccountable FL. Specifically, before a global model is sent to a client in an\nFL round, DUW encodes a client-unique key into the model by leveraging a\nbackdoor-based watermark injection. To identify the infringer of a leaked\nmodel, DUW examines the model and checks if the triggers can be decoded as the\ncorresponding keys. Extensive empirical results show that DUW is highly\neffective and robust, achieving over $99\\%$ watermark success rate for Digits,\nCIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets under heterogeneous FL settings, and\nidentifying the IP infringer with $100\\%$ accuracy even after common watermark\nremoval attempts.",

This variant of the\nideal intersection property potentially involves several subalgebras, and gives\na new method of verifying injectivity of representations of reduced groupoid\nC*-algebras.

            "summary": "3D scene representations have gained immense popularity in recent years.\nMethods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks\nsuch as novel view synthesis. In recent times, some work has emerged that aims\nto extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis, for semantically\naware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field\ndistillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major\nlimitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and\n(b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts\nreducing feature quality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown\nstate-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this\nwork, we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering, we\nenable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D\nfoundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively\nincorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework leads to warp-level\ndivergence. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert\nthis problem. Our proposed method is general, and our experiments showcase\nnovel view semantic segmentation, language-guided editing and segment anything\nthrough learning feature fields from state-of-the-art 2D foundation models such\nas SAM and CLIP-LSeg. Across experiments, our distillation method is able to\nprovide comparable or better results, while being significantly faster to both\ntrain and render. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first\nmethod to enable point and bounding-box prompting for radiance field\nmanipulation, by leveraging the SAM model.

The phase-resolved spectra corresponding to the\ntwo main peaks in the folded pulse profile differ significantly.

However, for both spectra, the best-fit values\nof photon indices for the power-law (PL) fit are noticeably larger than the\npreviously reported values. The hardest (Peak 1) spectrum has a photon index of\n$1.10\\pm0.15$ which is close to those measured for the bright inner jets of the\nPWN. We used the off-pulse interval to isolate pulsar emission and measure the\ncompact pulsar wind nebula (PWN) spectrum in hard X-rays. We also measured the\nspectrum from the south-western (SW) region of the PWN which is resolved by\nNuSTAR from the compact PWN. For both regions, we fit the NuSTAR spectra by\nthemselves and together with the Chandra X-ray Observatory spectra. We found\nthat the compact PWN spectrum requires a more complex model than a simple PL\nwith evidence for exponential cutoff in 50-80 keV.

With rapidly growing large scale\npublic sleep databases and advances in machine learning, significant progress\nhas been made toward automatic sleep staging. However, previous studies face\nsome critical problems in sleep studies; the heterogeneity of subjects'\nphysiological signals, the inability to extract meaningful information from\nunlabeled sleep signal data to improve predictive performances, the difficulty\nin modeling correlations between sleep stages, and the lack of an effective\nmechanism to quantify predictive uncertainty. In this study, we propose a\nneural network based automatic sleep staging model, named DREAM, to learn\ndomain generalized representations from physiological signals and models sleep\ndynamics. DREAM learns sleep related and subject invariant representations from\ndiverse subjects' sleep signal segments and models sleep dynamics by capturing\ninteractions between sequential signal segments and between sleep stages. In\nthe experiments, we demonstrate that DREAM outperforms the existing sleep\nstaging methods on three datasets. The case study demonstrates that our model\ncan learn the generalized decision function resulting in good prediction\nperformances for the new subjects, especially in case there are differences\nbetween testing and training subjects. The usage of unlabeled data shows the\nbenefit of leveraging unlabeled EEG data. Further, uncertainty quantification\ndemonstrates that DREAM provides prediction uncertainty, making the model\nreliable and helping sleep experts in real world applications.",

In order\nto improve the accuracy of the identification of essential proteins,\nresearchers attempted to obtain a refined PIN by combining multiple biological\ninformation to filter out some unreliable interactions in the PIN.\nUnfortunately, such approaches drastically reduce the number of nodes in the\nPIN after multiple refinements and result in a sparser PIN. It makes a\nconsiderable portion of essential proteins unidentifiable. In this paper, we\npropose a multi-layer refined network (MR-PIN) that addresses this problem.\nFirstly, four refined networks are constructed by respectively integrating\ndifferent biological information into the static PIN to form a multi-layer\nheterogeneous network. Then scores of proteins in each network layer are\ncalculated by the existing node ranking method, and the importance score of a\nprotein in the MR-PIN is evaluated in terms of the geometric mean of its scores\nin all layers. Finally, all nodes are sorted by their importance scores to\ndetermine their essentiality. To evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-layer\nrefined network model, we apply 16 node ranking methods on the MR-PIN, and\ncompare the results with those on the SPIN, DPIN and RDPIN. Then the predictive\nperformances of these ranking methods are validated in terms of the\nidentification number of essential protein at top100 - top600, sensitivity,\nspecificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F-measure,\naccuracy, Jackknife, ROCAUC and PRAUC.

We show that BERT outperforms dictionary-based\npredictions and Word2Vec-based predictions in terms of adjusted R-square in\nlogistic regression, k-nearest neighbor (kNN-5), and linear kernel support\nvector machine (SVM). Further, instead of pre-training the BERT model from\nscratch, we apply self-learning with confidence-based filtering to corporate\ndisclosure data (10-K). We achieve the accuracy rate of 91.56% and demonstrate\nthat the domain adaptation procedure brings a significant improvement in\nprediction accuracy.",

            "summary": "Verbal autopsy (VA) algorithms are routinely used to determine\nindividual-level causes of death (COD) in many low-and-middle-income countries,\nwhich are then aggregated to derive population-level cause-specific mortality\nfractions (CSMF), essential to informing public health policies. However, VA\nalgorithms frequently misclassify COD and introduce bias in CSMF estimates. A\nrecent method, VA-calibration, can correct for this bias using a VA\nmisclassification matrix estimated from paired data on COD from both VA and\nminimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) from the Child Health and Mortality\nPrevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network. Due to the limited sample size,\nCHAMPS data are pooled across all countries, implicitly assuming that the\nmisclassification rates are homogeneous.\n  In this research, we show that the VA misclassification matrices are\nsubstantially heterogeneous across countries, thereby biasing the\nVA-calibration. We develop a coherent framework for modeling country-specific\nmisclassification matrices in data-scarce settings. We first introduce a novel\nbase model based on two latent mechanisms: intrinsic accuracy and systematic\npreference to parsimoniously characterize misclassifications. We prove that\nthey are identifiable from the data and manifest as a form of invariance in\ncertain misclassification odds, a pattern evident in the CHAMPS data. Then we\nexpand from this base model, adding higher complexity and country-specific\nheterogeneity via interpretable effect sizes. Shrinkage priors balance the\nbias-variance tradeoff by adaptively favoring simpler models. We publish\nuncertainty-quantified estimates of VA misclassification rates for 6 countries.\nThis effort broadens VA-calibration's future applicability and strengthens\nongoing efforts of using VA for mortality surveillance.",

We collect a dataset of Facial Expression Reaction to Generated Images\n(FERGI) and show that the activations of multiple facial action units (AUs) are\nhighly correlated with user evaluations of the generated images. Specifically,\nAU4 (brow lowerer) is most consistently reflective of negative evaluations of\nthe generated image. This can be useful in two ways. Firstly, we can\nautomatically annotate user preferences between image pairs with substantial\ndifference in AU4 responses to them with an accuracy significantly\noutperforming state-of-the-art scoring models. Secondly, directly integrating\nthe AU4 responses with the scoring models improves their consistency with human\npreferences. Additionally, the AU4 response best reflects the user's evaluation\nof the image fidelity, making it complementary to the state-of-the-art scoring\nmodels, which are generally better at reflecting image-text alignment. Finally,\nthis method of automatic annotation with facial expression analysis can be\npotentially generalized to other generation tasks.

We perform simulations for\nthe 2D Ising model with ferromagnetic couplings both in the absence and in the\npresence of a magnetic field using a cluster spin-flip algorithm. We show that\nit is possible to extract genuine signature of Lee Yang and Fisher zeros of the\ntheory through the poles of magnetization and specific heat, using multi-point\nPad\\'{e} method. We extract the poles of magnetization using Pad\\'{e}\napproximants and compare their scaling with known results. We verify the circle\ntheorem associated to the well known behaviour of Lee Yang zeros. We present\nour finite volume scaling analysis of the zeros done at $T=T_c$ for a few\nlattice sizes, extracting to a very good precision the (combination of)\ncritical exponents $\\beta \\delta$. The computation at the critical temperature\nis performed after the latter has been determined via the study of Fisher\nzeros, thus extracting both $\\beta_c$ and the critical exponent $\\nu$. Results\nalready exist for extracting the critical exponents for the Ising model in 2\nand 3 dimensions making use of Fisher and Lee Yang zeros. In this work,\nmulti-point Pad\\'{e} is shown to be competitive with this respect and thus a\npowerful tool to study phase transitions.",

To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a two-step approach DreamInpainter. First, we compute dense subject\nfeatures to ensure accurate subject replication. Then, we employ a\ndiscriminative token selection module to eliminate redundant subject details,\npreserving the subject's identity while allowing changes according to other\nconditions such as mask shape and text prompts. Additionally, we introduce a\ndecoupling regularization technique to enhance text control in the presence of\nexemplar images.

This paper proposes a\nrandom subspace trust-region algorithm based on quadratic approximations.\nUnlike most of its precursors, this algorithm does not require any special form\nof objective function. We study the geometry of sample sets, the error bounds\nfor approximations, and the quality of subspaces. In particular, we provide a\ntechnique to construct $Q$-fully quadratic models, which is easy to analyze and\nimplement. We present an almost-sure global convergence result of our algorithm\nand give an upper bound on the expected number of iterations to find a\nsufficiently small gradient.

To help\nalleviate this challenging problem, we introduce a spectral graph wavelet\ncollaborative filtering framework for implicit feedback data, where users,\nitems and their interactions are represented as a bipartite graph.\nSpecifically, we first propose an adaptive transfer function by leveraging a\npower transform with the goal of stabilizing the variance of graph frequencies\nin the spectral domain. Then, we design a deep recommendation model for\nefficient learning of low-dimensional embeddings of users and items using\nspectral graph wavelets in an end-to-end fashion. In addition to capturing the\ngraph's local and global structures, our approach yields localization of graph\nsignals in both spatial and spectral domains, and hence not only learns\ndiscriminative representations of users and items, but also promotes the\nrecommendation quality. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated\nthrough extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, achieving\nbetter recommendation performance compared with strong baseline methods.",

            "summary": "Over this last year we have published four independent refereed studies\nconfirming the presence of a gravitational anomaly, from studying the relative\nvelocities and separations on the plane of the sky, $v_{2D}$ and $s_{2D}$\nrespectively, of wide binary stars observed by the {\\it Gaia} satellite. These\nstudies show results which are fully consistent with Newtonian dynamics in a\nhigh acceleration $s_{2D}<2000$ au regime, but which conclusively identify MOND\nphenomenology for the low acceleration $s_{2D}>2000$ au regime. These four\nstudies span a range of sample selection strategies and cover also a range of\nstatistical techniques, in all cases, results are consistent in identifying a\nchange in the effective value of the gravitational constant in the low\nacceleration $s_{2D}>2000$ au regime of $G \\to \\gamma G$ with $\\gamma=1.5 \\pm\n\\sigma_{\\gamma}$, with $0.06<\\sigma_{\\gamma}<0.2$, depending on the sample\nselection strategy and the statistical modelling implemented. Recently, a\ncontradictory study appeared, Banik et al. (2024) (originally arXiv:2311.03436\nin 2023), claiming a 19$\\sigma$ statistical preference of a purely Newtonian\nmodel over a MOND alternative, looking also at distributions of $v_{2D}$ and\n$s_{2D}$ for wide binaries from the {\\it Gaia} satellite, although only in the\n$s_{2D}>2000$ au regime. Inspection of said study readily shows the use of a\nstatistical treatment inconsistent with the error structure of the data used.\nRelated to the above, the best fit posterior physical parameters found in Banik\net al. (2024), show a lack of correlation with their inferred gravity index. In\nthis brief comment we expand upon the above to show that the results of Banik\net al. (2024) are not due to the physics of the problem being treated, but to\nthe methodological problems of that study.",

            "summary": "Neural radiance fields provide state-of-the-art view synthesis quality but\ntend to be slow to render. One reason is that they make use of volume\nrendering, thus requiring many samples (and model queries) per ray at render\ntime. Although this representation is flexible and easy to optimize, most\nreal-world objects can be modeled more efficiently with surfaces instead of\nvolumes, requiring far fewer samples per ray. This observation has spurred\nconsiderable progress in surface representations such as signed distance\nfunctions, but these may struggle to model semi-opaque and thin structures. We\npropose a method, HybridNeRF, that leverages the strengths of both\nrepresentations by rendering most objects as surfaces while modeling the\n(typically) small fraction of challenging regions volumetrically. We evaluate\nHybridNeRF against the challenging Eyeful Tower dataset along with other\ncommonly used view synthesis datasets. When comparing to state-of-the-art\nbaselines, including recent rasterization-based approaches, we improve error\nrates by 15-30% while achieving real-time framerates (at least 36 FPS) for\nvirtual-reality resolutions (2Kx2K).",

First, the perturbation expansion of the\nfrequency-dependent self-energy is nonconvergent at the exact self-energy in\nwide domains of frequency. Second, the Dyson equation with an odd-order\nself-energy has a qualitatively wrong shape and, as a result, most of their\nsatellite roots are complex and nonphysical. Third, the Dyson equation with an\neven-order self-energy has an exponentially increasing number of roots as the\nperturbation order is raised, which quickly exceeds the correct number of\nroots. Infinite partial summation of diagrams by vertex or edge modification\nexacerbates these problems. Not only does the nonconvergence render\nhigher-order perturbation theories useless for satellite roots, but it also\ncalls into question the validity of their combined use with the ans\\\"{a}tze\nrequiring the knowledge of all poles and residues.

However, most machine learning\nmethods are designed to improve a model's average performance on a chosen end\ntask without consideration for their impact on worst group error. Multitask\nlearning (MTL) is one such widely used technique. In this paper, we seek not\nonly to understand the impact of MTL on worst-group accuracy but also to\nexplore its potential as a tool to address the challenge of group-wise\nfairness. We primarily consider the common setting of fine-tuning a pre-trained\nmodel, where, following recent work (Gururangan et al., 2020; Dery et al.,\n2023), we multitask the end task with the pre-training objective constructed\nfrom the end task data itself. In settings with few or no group annotations, we\nfind that multitasking often, but not always, achieves better worst-group\naccuracy than Just-Train-Twice (JTT; Liu et al. (2021)) -- a representative\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO) method. Leveraging insights from\nsynthetic data experiments, we propose to modify standard MTL by regularizing\nthe joint multitask representation space. We run a large number of fine-tuning\nexperiments across computer vision and natural language and find that our\nregularized MTL approach consistently outperforms JTT on both worst and average\ngroup outcomes.

            "summary": "A nut graph is a simple graph for which the adjacency matrix has a single\nzero eigenvalue such that all non-zero kernel eigenvectors have no zero entry.\nIf the isolated vertex is excluded as trivial, nut graphs have seven or more\nvertices; they are connected, non-bipartite, and have no leaves. It is shown\nthat a nut graph $G$ always has at least one more edge orbit than it has vertex\norbits: $o_e(G) \\geq o_v(G) + 1$, with the obvious corollary that edge\ntransitive nut graphs do not exist. We give infinite familes of\nvertex-transitive nut graphs with two orbits of edges, and infinite families of\nnut graphs with two orbits of vertices and three of edges. Several\nconstructions for nut graphs from smaller starting graphs are known: double\nsubdivision of a bridge, four-fold subdivision of an edge, a construction for\nextrusion of a vertex with preservation of the degree sequence. To these we add\nmultiplier constructions that yield nut graphs from regular (not necessarily\nnut graph) parents. In general, constructions can have different effects on\nautomorphism group and counts of vertex and edge orbits, but in the case where\nthe automorphism group is `preserved', they can be used in a predictable way to\ncontrol vertex and edge orbit numbers.",

Theta Mus is X-ray bright and a nonthermal radio source as commonly\nobserved in massive colliding wind (CW) binaries. We present new Chandra X-ray\nobservations of Theta Mus which complement previous XMM-Newton observations.\nThe X-ray emission consists of a cool nearly steady weakly-absorbed plasma\ncomponent with broad redshifted emission lines located in an extended region\nfar from the SB system. Hotter plasma is also present traced by Fe XXV\nemission. The observed flux in the 2-5 keV range dropped significantly on a\ntimescale of less than 5 years. The flux decrease can be attributed to an\nincrease in absorption toward the hotter plasma which is likely located in the\nconfined wind interaction region of the short-period SB system. The X-ray\nemission of Theta Mus is remarkably similar to the WC+O binary gamma^2 Vel\nincluding carbon recombination spectral lines but both systems show unusual\nline centroid properties that challenge CW models.",

At the same time, effective policy-making requires knowledge of the\nuncertainty on such predictions, in order, for instance, to be able to ready\nhospitals and intensive care units for a worst-case scenario without needlessly\nwasting resources. In this work, we apply a novel and powerful computational\nmethod to the problem of learning probability densities on contagion parameters\nand providing uncertainty quantification for pandemic projections. Using a\nneural network, we calibrate an ODE model to data of the spread of COVID-19 in\nBerlin in 2020, achieving both a significantly more accurate calibration and\nprediction than Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based sampling schemes. The\nuncertainties on our predictions provide meaningful confidence intervals e.g.\non infection figures and hospitalisation rates, while training and running the\nneural scheme takes minutes where MCMC takes hours. We show convergence of our\nmethod to the true posterior on a simplified SIR model of epidemics, and also\ndemonstrate our method's learning capabilities on a reduced dataset, where a\ncomplex model is learned from a small number of compartments for which data is\navailable.",

Among all the ANNS algorithms,\ngraph-traversal-based ANNS achieves the highest recall rate.

To address this challenge, we present NDSearch, a near-data processing\n(NDP) solution for ANNS processing. NDSearch consists of a novel in-storage\ncomputing architecture, namely, SEARSSD, that supports the ANNS kernels and\nleverages logic unit (LUN)-level parallelism inside the NAND flash chips.\nNDSearch also includes a processing model that is customized for NDP and\ncooperates with SEARSSD. The processing model enables us to apply a two-level\nscheduling to improve the data locality and exploit the internal bandwidth in\nNDSEARCH, and a speculative searching mechanism to further accelerate the ANNS\nworkload. Our results show that NDSearch improves the throughput by up to\n31.7x, 14.6x, 7.4x, 2.9x over CPU, GPU, a state-of-the-art SmartSSD-only\ndesign, and DeepStore, respectively.

            "summary": "We present a novel Finite Volume (FV) scheme on unstructured polygonal meshes\nthat is provably compliant with the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the\nGeometric Conservation Law (GCL) at the same time. The governing equations are\nprovided by a subset of the class of symmetric and hyperbolic thermodynamically\ncompatible (SHTC) models. Our numerical method discretizes the equations for\nthe conservation of momentum, total energy, distortion tensor and thermal\nimpulse vector, hence accounting in one single unified mathematical formalism\nfor a wide range of physical phenomena in continuum mechanics. By means of two\nconservative corrections directly embedded in the definition of the numerical\nfluxes, the new schemes are proven to satisfy two extra conservation laws,\nnamely an entropy balance law and a geometric equation that links the\ndistortion tensor to the density evolution. As such, the classical mass\nconservation equation can be discarded. Firstly, the GCL is derived at the\ncontinuous level, and subsequently it is satisfied by introducing the new\nconcepts of general potential and generalized Gibbs relation. Once\ncompatibility of the GCL is ensured, thermodynamic compatibility is tackled in\nthe same manner, thus achieving the satisfaction of a local cell entropy\ninequality. The two corrections are orthogonal, meaning that they can coexist\nsimultaneously without interfering with each other. The compatibility of the\nnew FV schemes holds true at the semi-discrete level, and time integration of\nthe governing PDE is carried out relying on Runge-Kutta schemes. A large suite\nof test cases demonstrates the structure preserving properties of the schemes\nat the discrete level as well.",

            "summary": "The past year has witnessed the increasing popularity of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). Their unprecedented scale and associated high hardware cost have\nimpeded their broader adoption, calling for efficient hardware designs. With\nthe large hardware needed to simply run LLM inference, evaluating different\nhardware designs becomes a new bottleneck.\n  This work introduces LLMCompass, a hardware evaluation framework for LLM\ninference workloads. LLMCompass is fast, accurate, versatile, and able to\ndescribe and evaluate different hardware designs. LLMCompass includes a mapper\nto automatically find performance-optimal mapping and scheduling. It also\nincorporates an area-based cost model to help architects reason about their\ndesign choices. Compared to real-world hardware, LLMCompass' estimated latency\nachieves an average 10.4% error rate across various operators with various\ninput sizes and an average 4.1% error rate for LLM inference. With LLMCompass,\nsimulating a 4-NVIDIA A100 GPU node running GPT-3 175B inference can be done\nwithin 16 minutes on commodity hardware, including 26,400 rounds of the\nmapper's parameter search.\n  With the aid of LLMCompass, this work draws architectural implications and\nexplores new cost-effective hardware designs. By reducing the compute\ncapability or replacing High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with traditional DRAM,\nthese new designs can achieve as much as 3.41x improvement in performance/cost\ncompared to an NVIDIA A100, making them promising choices for democratizing\nLLMs.\n  LLMCompass is planned to be fully open-source.",

In this study, a robust yet fast computational method to predict and\nvisualize bone degradation has been developed.

Because of limited available experimental data and\nchallenges of obtaining new samples, a digital twin dataset of diverse and\ninitial bone-like microstructures was generated to train our TransVNet on the\nevolution of the 3D images through a previously developed degradation model for\nmicrogravity.",

            "summary": "We present the extended ALMA MaNGA QUEnching and STar formation survey, a\ncombination of the original 46 ALMaQUEST galaxies plus new ALMA observations\nfor a further 20 interacting galaxies. Three well-studied scaling relations are\nfit to the 19,999 star-forming spaxels in the extended sample, namely the\nresolved Schmidt-Kennicutt (rSK) relation, the resolved star forming main\nsequence (rSFMS) and the resolved molecular gas main sequence (rMGMS). We\nadditionally investigate the relationship between the dynamical equilibrium\npressure (PDE) and star formation rate surface density (Sigma_SFR), which we\nrefer to as the resolved PDE (rPDE) relation. Contrary to previous studies that\nhave focussed on normal star-forming galaxies and found an approximately linear\nrPDE relation, the presence of more vigourously star-forming galaxies in the\nextended ALMaQUEST sample reveals a marked turnover in the relation at high\npressures. Although the scatter around the linear fit to the rPDE relation is\nsimilar to the other three relations, a random forest analysis, which can\nextract non-linear dependences, finds that PDE is unambiguously more important\nthan either Sigma_H2 or Sigma_star for predicting Sigma_SFR. We compare the\nobserved rPDE relation to the prediction of the pressure-regulated\nfeedback-modulated (PRFM) model of star formation, finding that galaxies\nresiding on the global SFMS do indeed closely follow the rPDE relation\npredicted by the PRFM theory. However, galaxies above and below the global SFMS\nshow significant deviations from the model. Galaxies with high SFR are instead\nconsistent with models that include other contributions to turbulence in\naddition to the local star formation feedback.",

            "summary": "Since the advent of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC),\nthe requirements of low-latency applications tend to be completely\ncharacterized by a single pre-defined latency-reliability target. That is,\noperation is optimal whenever the pre-defined latency threshold is met but the\nsystem is assumed to be in error when the latency threshold is violated. This\nvision is severely limited and does not capture the real requirements of most\napplications, where multiple latency thresholds can be defined, together with\nincentives or rewards associated with meeting each of them. Such formulation is\na generalization of the single-threshold case popularized by URLLC and, in the\nasymptotic case, approximates to defining a cost for each point in the support\nof the latency distribution. In this paper, we explore the implications of\ndefining multiple latency targets on the design of access protocols and on the\noptimization of repetition-based access strategies in orthogonal and\nnon-orthogonal multiple access scenarios with users that present heterogeneous\ntraffic characteristics and requirements. We observe that the access strategies\nof the users can be effectively adapted to the requirements of the application\nby carefully defining the latency targets and the associated rewards.",

The\ndual-site experiment will employ an intense neutrino beam focused on a near and\na far detector as it aims to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and to make\nhigh-precision measurements of the PMNS matrix parameters, including the\nCP-violating phase. It will also stand ready to observe supernova neutrino\nbursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified\ntheory underlying the standard model.\n  The DUNE far detector implements liquid argon time-projection chamber\n(LArTPC) technology, and combines the many tens-of-kiloton fiducial mass\nnecessary for rare event searches with the sub-centimeter spatial resolution\nrequired to image those events with high precision. The addition of a photon\ndetection system enhances physics capabilities for all DUNE physics drivers and\nopens prospects for further physics explorations. Given its size, the far\ndetector will be implemented as a set of modules, with LArTPC designs that\ndiffer from one another as newer technologies arise.\n  In the vertical drift LArTPC design, a horizontal cathode bisects the\ndetector, creating two stacked drift volumes in which ionization charges drift\ntowards anodes at either the top or bottom. The anodes are composed of\nperforated PCB layers with conductive strips, enabling reconstruction in 3D.\nLight-trap-style photon detection modules are placed both on the cryostat's\nside walls and on the central cathode where they are optically powered.\n  This Technical Design Report describes in detail the technical\nimplementations of each subsystem of this LArTPC that, together with the other\nfar detector modules and the near detector, will enable DUNE to achieve its\nphysics goals.",

While conventional signal\nprocessing methods and deep learning algorithms have been proposed for this\ntask, their need to fine-tune threshold parameters for different datasets and\nlimited generalization restrict their utility in real-world applications. To\naddress these challenges, this study proposes a supervised voicing detection\nmodel that leverages recorded laryngograph data. The model is based on a\ndensely-connected convolutional recurrent neural network (DC-CRN), and trained\non data with reference voicing decisions extracted from laryngograph data sets.\nPretraining is also investigated to improve the generalization ability of the\nmodel. The proposed model produces robust voicing detection results,\noutperforming other strong baseline methods, and generalizes well to unseen\ndatasets. The source code of the proposed model with pretraining is provided\nalong with the list of used laryngograph datasets to facilitate further\nresearch in this area.",

We introduce a novel material for integrated photonics and\ninvestigate Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN) on Aluminum Nitride (AlN)\ntemplates as a platform for developing reconfigurable and on-chip nonlinear\noptical devices. AlGaN combines compatibility with standard fabrication\ntechnologies and high electro-optic modulation capabilities with reduced loss\nin a broad spectrum, making it a viable material for advanced photonic\napplications. We engineer and grow light-guiding photonic layers and fabricate\nwaveguides, directional couplers, and other on-chip devices. Our AlGaN ring\nresonators demonstrate tunability and high Q-factors due to the low-loss\nwaveguiding. The comprehensive platform paves the way for nonlinear photon-pair\ngeneration applications, on-chip nonlinear quantum frequency conversion, and\nfast electro-optic modulation for switching and routing.",

Our galvanostatic MPPT\nalgorithm ensures continuous and precise tracking achieving superior\noperational performance for high hysteresis PSCs.

Using recent non-perturbative\nmany-body techniques that are able to interpolate between the\nspin-fluctuation-dominated Slater regime at weak coupling and the Mott\ninsulator at strong-coupling, we obtain the momentum-resolved spectral function\nin the intermediate regime and disentangle the effects of antiferromagnetic\nfluctuations and local electronic correlations in the formation of an\ninsulating state. This allows us to identify the Slater and Heisenberg regimes\nin the phase diagram, which are separated by a crossover region of competing\nspatial and local electronic correlations. We identify the crossover regime by\ninvestigating the behavior of the local magnetic moment, shedding light on the\nformation of the insulating state at intermediate couplings.",

We aim to imbue Intelligent Tutoring Systems with this ability\nusing few-shot learning capability of Large Language Models. Our work proposes\na novel prompting technique, Assertion Enhanced Few-Shot Learning, to\nfacilitate the generation of accurate, detailed oriented educational\nexplanations. Our central hypothesis is that, in educational domain, few-shot\ndemonstrations are necessary but not a sufficient condition for quality\nexplanation generation. We conducted a study involving 12 in-service teachers,\ncomparing our approach to Traditional Few-Shot Learning. The results show that\nAssertion Enhanced Few-Shot Learning improves explanation accuracy by 15% and\nyields higher-quality explanations, as evaluated by teachers. We also conduct a\nqualitative ablation study to factor the impact of assertions to provide\neducator-friendly prompting guidelines for generating explanations in their\ndomain of interest.",

These evaluations are\ninterpretable and flexible, while avoiding many of the problems currently\nfacing cross-task evaluation. We apply this Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE)\nframework across multiple settings, including reinforcement learning, large\nlanguage models, and humans. In practice, we observe that VasE can be more\nrobust than popular evaluation frameworks (Elo and Nash averaging), discovers\nproperties in the evaluation data not evident from scores alone, and can\npredict outcomes better than Elo in a complex seven-player game.

Specifically, we explore the effective dynamical (time-dependent)\nlongitudinal coupling that arises when a solid-state qudit is adiabatically\nmodulated at small gate frequencies and amplitudes, in addition to a static\ndispersive interaction with the SC resonator. For the first time, we derive\nHamiltonians describing the longitudinal multi-level interactions in a general\ndispersive regime, encompassing both dynamical longitudinal and dispersive\ninteractions. These Hamiltonians smoothly transition between their adiabatic\nvalues, where the couplings of the n-th level are proportional to the level's\nenergy curvature concerning a qudit gate voltage, and the substantially larger\ndispersive values, which occur due to a resonant form factor. We provide\nseveral examples illustrating the transition from adiabatic to dispersive\ncoupling in different qubit systems, including the charge (1e DQD) qubit, the\ntransmon, the double quantum dot singlet-triplet qubit, and the triple quantum\ndot exchange-only qubit. In some of these qubits, higher energy levels play a\ncritical role, particularly when their qubit's dipole moment is minimal or\nzero. For an experimentally relevant scenario involving a spin-charge qubit\nwith magnetic field gradient coupled capacitively to a SC resonator, we\nshowcase the potential of these interactions.

This particularly impacts bright calibration stars, which appear\nlarger than their intrinsic shape, creating a flux-dependent point-spread\nfunction (PSF) that if left unmitigated, could make up a large fraction of the\nerror budget in Stage IV weak-lensing (WL) surveys such as the Legacy Survey of\nSpace and Time (LSST). In this paper, we analyze image measurements of flat\nfields and artificial stars taken at different illumination levels with the\nLSST Camera (LSSTCam) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in order to\nquantify this effect in the LSST Camera before and after a previously\nintroduced correction technique. We observe that the BFE evolves\nanisotropically as a function of flux due to higher-order BFEs, which violates\nthe fundamental assumption of this correction method. We then introduce a new\nsampling method based on a physically motivated model to account these\nhigher-order terms in the correction, and then we test the modified correction\non both datasets. We find that the new method corrects the effect in flat\nfields better than it corrects the effect in artificial stars which we conclude\nis the result of a unmodeled curl component of the deflection field by the\ncorrection.

The large mobilities persist even in thin films\nand nanowires of cadmium arsenide, suggesting the involvement of topological\nsurface states. However, computational studies of the surface states in this\nmaterial are lacking, in part due to the large 80-atom unit cell. Here we\npresent the computed Fermi arc surface states of a cadmium arsenide thin film,\nbased on a tight-binding model derived directly from the electronic structure.\nWe show that despite the close proximity of the Dirac points, the Fermi arcs\nare very long and straight, extending through nearly the entire Brillouin zone.\nThe shape and spin properties of the Fermi arcs suppress both back- and side-\nscattering at the surface, which we show by explicit integrals over the phase\nspace. The introduction of a small symmetry-breaking term, expected in a strong\nelectric field, gaps the electronic structure, creating a weak topological\ninsulator phase that exhibits similar transport properties.

            "summary": "Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to adapt a model trained on a source\ndomain to a target domain that undergoes distribution shift and contains\nsamples from novel classes outside the source domain. Source-free OSDA\n(SF-OSDA) techniques eliminate the need to access source domain samples, but\ncurrent SF-OSDA methods utilize only the known classes in the target domain for\nadaptation, and require access to the entire target domain even during\ninference after adaptation, to make the distinction between known and unknown\nsamples. In this paper, we introduce Unknown Sample Discovery (USD) as an\nSF-OSDA method that utilizes a temporally ensembled teacher model to conduct\nknown-unknown target sample separation and adapts the student model to the\ntarget domain over all classes using co-training and temporal consistency\nbetween the teacher and the student. USD promotes Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD)\nas an effective measure for known-unknown sample separation. Our\nteacher-student framework significantly reduces error accumulation resulting\nfrom imperfect known-unknown sample separation, while curriculum guidance helps\nto reliably learn the distinction between target known and target unknown\nsubspaces. USD appends the target model with an unknown class node, thus\nreadily classifying a target sample into any of the known or unknown classes in\nsubsequent post-adaptation inference stages. Empirical results show that USD is\nsuperior to existing SF-OSDA methods and is competitive with current OSDA\nmodels that utilize both source and target domains during adaptation.",

The subsequent movement of these electrons along magnetic\nfield lines will result in coherent curvature radiation. This short-lived radio\ntransients might accompany with the accretion process.

This in turn enhances and refines the\ncurrent state-of-the-art of automated algorithm selection. Specifically, I\nidentify and address current issues with the existing body of work to\nstrengthen the foundation that future work builds upon. Furthermore, the rise\nof deep learning offers ample opportunities for automated algorithm selection.\nIn several joint works, my colleagues and I developed and evaluated several\ndifferent methods that replace the existing methods to extract an informative\ninput.

At the brewing level, electrostatic\naggregation between particles affects liquid-solid accessibility, leading to\nvariable extraction quality. In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of\nfour charge mitigation strategies. Our data suggests that adding small amounts\nof water to whole beans pre-grinding, or bombarding the grounds with ions\nproduced from a high-voltage ionizer, are capable of de-electrifying the\ngranular flows. While these techniques helped reduce visible mess, only the\nstatic reduction through water inclusion was found to impact the brewing\nparameters in espresso format coffee. There, wetting coffee with less than 0.05\nmL / g resulted in a marked shift in particle size distribution, in part due to\npreventing clump formation and also liberating fine particles from sticking to\nthe grinder. With all other variables kept constant, this shift resulted at\nleast 15% higher coffee concentration for espresso prepared with darker roasts.\nThese findings have significant financial and sustainability implications, and\nencourage the widespread implementation of water use to de-electrify coffee\nduring grinding.",

Maximum\ndeparture from the alignment with the electric field occurs at low frequencies\ncharacteristic of induced-charge electrophoresis and at low voltages where\ngravity dominates the electrostatic and electrohydrodynamic torques. The\ndeparture of the interface from alignment with the electric field is shown to\ndecrease particle mobility through comparison of freely suspended Janus\nparticles subject only to electrical forcing and magnetized Janus particles in\nwhich magnetic torque is used to align the interface with the electric field.\nConsideration of the role of gravitational torque and particle-wall\ninteractions could account for some discrepancies between theory, numerics and\nexperiment in active matter systems.",

            "summary": "State of health (SOH) estimation for lithium-ion battery modules with cells\nconnected in parallel is a challenging problem, especially with cell-to-cell\nvariations. Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage\nanalysis (DVA) are effective at the cell level, but they cannot be directly\napplied to module-level SOH estimation, when only module-level measurements are\navailable. This paper proposes a new method and demonstrates that, with\nmultiple features systematically selected from the module-level ICA and DVA,\nthe module-level SOH can be estimated with high accuracy and confidence in the\npresence of cell-to-cell variations. First, a new information theory-based\nfeature selection algorithm is proposed to find an optimal set of features for\nmodule-level SOH estimation. Second, a new relevance vector regression\n(RVR)-based module-level SOH estimation model is proposed to provide both point\nestimates and three-sigma credible intervals while maintaining model sparsity.\nExperimental datasets are used to illustrate and evaluate the proposed method.\nWith more selected features incorporated, the proposed method achieves better\nestimation accuracy and higher confidence at the expense of higher model\ncomplexity. This trade-off is explored through a case study. When applied to a\nlarge experimental dataset, the proposed method and the resulting sparse model\nlead to module-level SOH estimates with 0.5% root-mean-square errors and 1.5%\naverage three-sigma values. With all the optimization and training processes\ncompleted offboard, the proposed method has low computational complexity for\nonboard implementations.",

A rich spectrum of inter-Landau-level transitions is revealed by\nthese measurements. The transitions follow a square-root-like dependence with\nmagnetic field, but the simple linear-band approximation is unable to\naccurately reproduce the observed behavior of the transitions in applied\nfields. We argue that the detected magneto-optical spectra should be related to\ncrossing hyperbolic bands, which form the W1 cones. We propose a model\nHamiltonian, which describes coupled hyperbolic bands and reproduces the shape\nof the relevant bands in NbAs. The magneto-optical spectra computed from this\nHamiltonian nicely reproduce our observations. We conclude that the\nhyperbolic-band approach is a minimal model to adequately describe the\nmagneto-optical response of NbAs and that the chiral (conical) bands do not\nexplicitly manifest themselves in the spectra.",

The $3.2-3.3~\\mu$m interval coincides\nwith the CH-stretching region for compact polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\n(PAHs). We focus on the 2M1747 spectrum. Its published optical depth spectrum\ncontains residual telluric transmission features, which arise from the 0.06\ndifference in mean airmasses between the observations of the source and its\ntelluric standard star. We corrected the published spectrum by adding the\nairmass residual optical depth spectrum. The corrected spectrum is well fit by\na superposition of four Gaussians. The absorption spectra of the other two\nsources were also fit by four Gaussians, with similar central wavelengths,\nwidths, and relative peak opacities. We associate the three longer wavelength\nGaussians covering the $3.23-3.31~\\mu$m interval with compact PAHs in positive,\nneutral, and negative charge states. We identify the shortest wavelength\nGaussian, near 3.21 $\\mu$m, with irregularly-shaped PAHs. Constraints imposed\nby spectral smoothness on the corrected 2M1747 spectrum, augmented by a PAH\ncluster formation model for post-asymptotic giant branch stars, suggests that\n$> 99$\\%\\ of the PAHs in the diffuse interstellar medium reside in small\nclusters.

Universal adversarial\nattack methods such as Fast Sign Gradient Method (FSGM) and Projected Gradient\nDescend (PGD) are popular for LiDAR object detection, but they are often\ndeficient compared to task-specific adversarial attacks. Additionally, these\nuniversal methods typically require unrestricted access to the model's\ninformation, which is difficult to obtain in real-world applications. To\naddress these limitations, we present a black-box Scaling Adversarial\nRobustness (ScAR) method for LiDAR object detection. By analyzing the\nstatistical characteristics of 3D object detection datasets such as KITTI,\nWaymo, and nuScenes, we have found that the model's prediction is sensitive to\nscaling of 3D instances. We propose three black-box scaling adversarial attack\nmethods based on the available information: model-aware attack,\ndistribution-aware attack, and blind attack. We also introduce a strategy for\ngenerating scaling adversarial examples to improve the model's robustness\nagainst these three scaling adversarial attacks.

            "summary": "The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum--classical\nvariational algorithm that produces an upper-bound estimate of the ground-state\nenergy of a Hamiltonian. As quantum computers become more powerful and go\nbeyond the reach of classical brute-force simulation, it is important to assess\nthe quality of solutions produced by them. Here we propose a dual variational\nquantum eigensolver (dual-VQE) that produces a lower-bound estimate of the\nground-state energy. As such, VQE and dual-VQE can serve as quality checks on\ntheir solutions; in the ideal case, the VQE upper bound and the dual-VQE lower\nbound form an interval containing the true optimal value of the ground-state\nenergy. The idea behind dual-VQE is to employ semi-definite programming duality\nto rewrite the ground-state optimization problem as a constrained maximization\nproblem, which itself can be bounded from below by an unconstrained\noptimization problem to be solved by a variational quantum algorithm. When\nusing a convex combination ansatz in conjunction with a classical generative\nmodel, the quantum computational resources needed to evaluate the objective\nfunction of dual-VQE are no greater than those needed for that of VQE. We\nsimulated the performance of dual-VQE on the transverse-field Ising model, and\nfound that, for the example considered, while dual-VQE training is slower and\nnoisier than VQE, it approaches the true value with error of order $10^{-2}$.",

There is no clear viable astrophysical\nsolution and, therefore, it might indicate the presence of new physics.\nRadiative decays of a relic neutrino $\\nu_i$ into a sterile neutrino $\\nu_{\\rm\ns}$, assumed to be quasi-degenerate, provide a solution that currently evades\nall constraints posed by different cosmological observations and reproduces\nvery well the ARCADE 2 data. We find a very good fit to the ARCADE 2 data with\nbest fit values $\\tau_i = 1.46 \\times 10^{21}\\,{\\rm s}$ and $\\Delta m_i = 4.0\n\\times 10^{-5}\\,{\\rm eV}$, where $\\tau_i$ is the lifetime and $\\Delta m_i$ is\nthe mass difference between the decaying active neutrino and the sterile\nneutrino. On the other hand, if relic neutrino decays do not explain ARCADE 2\ndata, then these place a stringent constraint $\\D m_i^{3/2} \\tau_i \\gtrsim 2\n\\times 10^{14}\\,{\\rm eV}^{3/2}\\,{\\rm s}$ in the range $1.4 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\n{\\rm eV} < \\D m_i < 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm eV}$.

This is in mild tension with the\neven stronger signal found by the EDGES collaboration, $T_{21} = -\n500^{+200}_{-500}\\,{\\rm mK} $, suggesting that this might have been\noverestimated, maybe receiving a contribution from some unidentified foreground\nsource.",

This quantity, known as the magnetotropic\nsusceptibility, $k$, relates to the second derivative of the free energy with\nrespect to the angle of rotation. We have used approximation-free,\nauxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations for a realistic model of\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and optimized the path integral to alleviate the negative\nsign problem. This allows us to reach temperatures down to $30~\\rm{K}$ -- an\nenergy scale below the dominant Kitaev coupling. We demonstrate that the\nmagnetotropic susceptibility in this model of $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ displays unique\nscaling, $k = Tf(B/T)$, with distinct scaling functions $f$ at high and low\ntemperatures. In comparison, for the XXZ Heisenberg model, the scaling $k =\nTf(B/T)$ breaks down at a temperature scale where the uniform spin\nsusceptibility deviates from the Curie law (i.e. at the energy scale of the\nexchange interactions) and never recovers at low temperatures. Our findings\nsuggest that correlations in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ lead to degrees of freedom that\nrespond isotropically to a magnetic field. One possible interpretation for the\napparent scale-invariance observed in experiments could be fractionalization of\nthe spin degrees of freedom in the extended Kitaev model.",

            "summary": "We present LooseControl to allow generalized depth conditioning for\ndiffusion-based image generation. ControlNet, the SOTA for depth-conditioned\nimage generation, produces remarkable results but relies on having access to\ndetailed depth maps for guidance. Creating such exact depth maps, in many\nscenarios, is challenging. This paper introduces a generalized version of depth\nconditioning that enables many new content-creation workflows. Specifically, we\nallow (C1) scene boundary control for loosely specifying scenes with only\nboundary conditions, and (C2) 3D box control for specifying layout locations of\nthe target objects rather than the exact shape and appearance of the objects.\nUsing LooseControl, along with text guidance, users can create complex\nenvironments (e.g., rooms, street views, etc.) by specifying only scene\nboundaries and locations of primary objects. Further, we provide two editing\nmechanisms to refine the results: (E1) 3D box editing enables the user to\nrefine images by changing, adding, or removing boxes while freezing the style\nof the image. This yields minimal changes apart from changes induced by the\nedited boxes. (E2) Attribute editing proposes possible editing directions to\nchange one particular aspect of the scene, such as the overall object density\nor a particular object. Extensive tests and comparisons with baselines\ndemonstrate the generality of our method. We believe that LooseControl can\nbecome an important design tool for easily creating complex environments and be\nextended to other forms of guidance channels.

In a hold-out set, the model accurately identifies notes\nwritten by these high-workload physicians, and also flags notes written in\nother high-fatigue settings: on overnight shifts, and after high patient\nvolumes. Model predictions also correlate with worse decision-making on at\nleast one important metric: yield of testing for heart attack is 18% lower with\neach standard deviation increase in model-predicted fatigue. Finally, the model\nindicates that notes written about Black and Hispanic patients have 12% and 21%\nhigher predicted fatigue than Whites -- larger than overnight vs. daytime\ndifferences. These results have an important implication for large language\nmodels (LLMs). Our model indicates that fatigued doctors write more predictable\nnotes.

            "summary": "In the canonical tachyonic resonance preheating scenario, only an order one\nfraction of energy density in the inflaton is transferred to radiation, due to\nbackreaction effects. One possible way to improve the energy transfer\nefficiency is to allow for the perturbative decays of the resonantly produced\ndaughter particles, which serve as the \"spillway\" to drain the direct decay\nproducts from inflaton and to reduce the backreaction. In this article, we\nstudy two observational consequences of spillway preheating. The first is on\nthe inflationary observables: the scalar spectrum tilt $n_s$ and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. The spillway scenario modifies the evolution of the\nequation of state between the end of inflation and the thermal big bang. As a\nresult, it affects the time elapsed from inflation to the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB), as well as the fits of inflationary models and their\ncorresponding prediction for $n_s$ and $r$. We map out the equation of state by\nsystematically scanning the parameter space of the spillway scenario, and show\nthat the most efficient spillway scenario predicts a bluer spectrum, compared\nto the tachyonic preheating scenario. Another consequence is the production of\nhigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). Comparing the simulation results with\nthose of tachyonic preheating, we find that the existence of spillways leads to\nsharper-peaked GW spectra with a mildly damped amplitude.",

            "summary": "While the robustness of Hawking radiation in the presence of UV Lorentz\nbreaking is well-established, the Unruh effect has posed a challenge, with a\nlarge literature concluding that even the low-energy restoration of Lorentz\ninvariance may not be sufficient to sustain this phenomenon. Notably, these\nprevious studies have primarily focused on Lorentz-breaking matter on a\nconventional Rindler wedge. In this work, we demonstrate that considering the\ncomplete structure of Lorentz-breaking gravity, specifically the presence of a\nhypersurface orthogonal aether field, leads to the selection of a new Rindler\nwedge configuration characterized by a uniformly accelerated aether flow. This\nuniform acceleration provides a reference scale for comparison with the\nLorentz-breaking one, thus ensuring the persistence of the Unruh effect in this\ncontext. We establish this by calculating the expected temperature using a\nBogolubov approach, and by analyzing the response of a uniformly accelerated\ndetector. We suggest that this resilience of the Unruh effect opens interesting\npossibilities towards future developments for using it as a tool to constrain\nLorentz breaking theories of gravity.",

In this paper a method is described that uses the\nfull information that is contained in the pixels just outside masked regions.\nThese edge pixels are extrapolated inwards, using iterative median filtering.\nThis leads to a smoothly varying spatial resolution within the filled-in\nregions, and ensures seamless transitions between masked pixels and good\npixels.

We present one of the highest signal-to-noise\nratio JWST NIRSpec/PRISM spectra of a little red dot, J0647_1045 at $z = 4.5321\n\\pm 0.0001$, and examine its NIRCam morphology, to differentiate the origin of\nthe UV and optical/NIR emission, and elucidate the nature of the little red dot\nphenomenon. J0647_1045 is unresolved ($r_e < 0.17$ kpc) in the three NIRCam\nlong-wavelength filters, but significantly extended ($r_e = 0.45 \\pm 0.06$ kpc)\nin the three short-wavelength filters, indicating a red compact source in a\nblue star-forming galaxy. The spectral continuum shows a clear change in slope,\nfrom blue in the optical/UV, to red in the restframe optical/NIR, consistent\nwith two distinct components, fit by power-laws with different attenuation:\n$A_V = 0.54 \\pm 0.01$ (UV) and $A_V = 5.7 \\pm 0.2$ (optical/NIR). Fitting the\nH$\\alpha$ line requires both broad (full width at half-maximum $\\sim 4300 \\pm\n300 km s^{-1}$) and narrow components, but none of the other emission lines,\nincluding H$\\beta$, show evidence of broadness. We calculate $A_V = 1.1 \\pm\n0.2$ from the Balmer decrement using narrow H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$, and $A_V >\n4.1 \\pm 0.2$ from broad H$\\alpha$ and upper limit on broad H$\\beta$, consistent\nwith the blue and red continuum attenuation respectively. Based on single-epoch\nH$\\alpha$ linewidth, the mass of the central black hole is $8 \\pm 1 \\times 10^8\nM_\\odot$. Our findings are consistent with a multi-component model, where the\noptical/NIR and broad lines arise from a highly obscured, spatially unresolved\nregion, likely a relatively massive active galactic nucleus, while the less\nobscured UV continuum and narrow lines arise, at least partly, from a small but\nspatially resolved star-forming host galaxy.",

We expand the linear polarization map in terms of\nspin-weighted spherical harmonics and recast it into the $E$-mode (parity even)\nand $B$-mode (parity odd) basis. We provide expressions for the\nminimum-variance estimators for the coefficients of that expansion and evaluate\nthe smallest detectable signal as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio with\nwhich the isotropic GW signal is detected and the number of pulsars in the\nsurvey. We evaluate the covariance between the estimators for the\nspherical-harmonic coefficients of the linear polarization $E$-modes and those\nfor the intensity anisotropy. We also show that there is no covariance between\nthe spherical-harmonic coefficients for the $B$-modes of the linear\npolarization and those for the circular polarization, even though both have the\nsame parity.

The model takes into account (i) the internal\ndensity structure of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), (ii) the heating associated\nboth to stars and to the active galactic nuclei (AGN), respectively producing\nphotodissociation regions (PDRs) and X-ray dominated regions (XDRs) within the\nGMCs, and (iii) the mass distribution of GMCs within the galaxy volume. The\nmodel needs, as input parameters, the radial profiles of molecular mass, far-UV\nflux and X-ray flux for a given galaxy, and it has two free parameters: the\nCO-to-H2 conversion factor $\\alpha_{CO}$, and the X-ray attenuation column\ndensity $N_H$. We test this model on a sample of 24 local ($z \\leq 0.06$)\nAGN-host galaxies, simulating their carbon monoxide spectral line energy\ndistribution (CO SLED). We compare the results with the available observations\nand calculate, for each galaxy, the best ($\\alpha_{CO}$, $N_H$) with a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithm, finding values consistent with those present in\nthe literature. We find a median $\\alpha_{CO} = 4.8$ M$_{\\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$\npc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$ for our sample. In all the modelled galaxies, we find the XDR\ncomponent of the CO SLED to dominate the CO luminosity from $J_{\\text{upp}}\n\\geq 4$. We conclude that, once a detailed distribution of molecular gas\ndensity is taken into account, PDR emission at mid-/high-$J$ becomes negligible\nwith respect to XDR.",

Here we present a Feshbach\nperspective on the origin of strong pairing in Fermi-Hubbard type models. We\nperform a theoretical analysis of interactions between charge carriers in doped\nMott insulators, modeled by a near-resonant two-channel scattering problem, and\nfind strong evidence for Feshbach-type interactions in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$\nchannel that can support strong pairing, consistent with the established\nphenomenology of cuprates. Existing experimental and numerical results on\nhole-doped cuprates lead us to conjecture the existence of a light, long-lived,\nlow-energy excited state of two holes with bipolaron character in these\nsystems, which enables near-resonant interactions and can thus provide a\nmicroscopic foundation for theories of high-temperature superconductivity\ninvolving strong attraction, as assumed e.g. in BEC-BCS crossover scenarios. To\nput our theory to a direct test we suggest to use coincidence angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (cARPES), pair-tunneling measurements or less direct\npump-probe experiments. The emergent Feshbach resonance we propose could also\nunderlie superconductivity in other doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, as\nrecently proposed for bilayer nickelates, highlighting its potential as a\nunifying strong-coupling pairing mechanism rooted in quantum magnetism.",

We find that, the\nexpected number of detectable IMBH binaries is $O(100)$ for LISA and AEDGE and\n$O(10)$ for AION in low-mass seeds scenarios and goes down to $O(10)$ for LISA\nand below one for AEDGE and AION in high-mass seed scenarios. This allows all\nof these observatories to probe the parameters of the seed model, in particular\nif at least a fraction of the SMBHs arise from a low-mass seed population.

Hereby, the key task is to understand\nwhat causes the appearance of superconductivity at comparatively high\ntemperatures upon hole doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator.\nRecently, it has been proposed that at strong coupling and low doping, the\nfundamental one- and two-hole meson-type constituents -- magnetic polarons and\nbipolaronic pairs -- likely realize an emergent Feshbach resonance producing\nnear-resonant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ interactions between charge carriers. Here, we\nprovide detailed calculations of the proposed scenario by describing the open\nand closed meson scattering channels in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model using a\ntruncated basis method. After integrating out the closed channel constituted by\nbipolaronic pairs, we find $d_{x^2-y^2}$ attractive interactions between open\nchannel magnetic polarons. The closed form of the derived interactions allows\nus analyze the resonant pairing interactions and we find enhanced (suppressed)\nattraction for hole (electron) doping in our model.

Although a simple nonlinear\ntransformation allows us to recover the well-known classical Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation, by combining a series of analytical results (in the limiting cases)\nand simulations (whenever the analytical treatment is unaffordable), we find an\nanalytical explanation to why the dynamics in the nonlinear \"classical\" regime\nis still strongly nonclassical. This is even more evident by establishing a\none-to-one comparison between the Bohmian trajectories associated with the\ncorresponding wave function and the classical trajectories that one should\nobtain.

We propose formulating PCR as a denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic process, mapping noisy transformations to the ground truth.\nHowever, using diffusion models for PCR has nontrivial challenges, such as\nadapting a generative model to a discriminative task and leveraging the\nestimated nonlinear transformation from the previous step. Instead of training\na diffusion model to directly map pure noise to ground truth, we map the\npredictions of an off-the-shelf PCR model to ground truth. The predictions of\noff-the-shelf models are often imperfect, especially in challenging cases where\nthe two points clouds have low overlap, and thus could be seen as noisy\nversions of the real rigid transformation. In addition, we transform the\nrotation matrix into a spherical linear space for interpolation between samples\nin the forward process, and convert rigid transformations into auxiliary\ninformation to implicitly exploit last-step estimations in the reverse process.\nAs a result, conditioned on time step, the denoising model adapts to the\nincreasing accuracy across steps and refines registrations.

            "summary": "How do two sets of images differ? Discerning set-level differences is crucial\nfor understanding model behaviors and analyzing datasets, yet manually sifting\nthrough thousands of images is impractical. To aid in this discovery process,\nwe explore the task of automatically describing the differences between two\n$\\textbf{sets}$ of images, which we term Set Difference Captioning. This task\ntakes in image sets $D_A$ and $D_B$, and outputs a description that is more\noften true on $D_A$ than $D_B$. We outline a two-stage approach that first\nproposes candidate difference descriptions from image sets and then re-ranks\nthe candidates by checking how well they can differentiate the two sets. We\nintroduce VisDiff, which first captions the images and prompts a language model\nto propose candidate descriptions, then re-ranks these descriptions using CLIP.\nTo evaluate VisDiff, we collect VisDiffBench, a dataset with 187 paired image\nsets with ground truth difference descriptions. We apply VisDiff to various\ndomains, such as comparing datasets (e.g., ImageNet vs. ImageNetV2), comparing\nclassification models (e.g., zero-shot CLIP vs. supervised ResNet), summarizing\nmodel failure modes (supervised ResNet), characterizing differences between\ngenerative models (e.g., StableDiffusionV1 and V2), and discovering what makes\nimages memorable. Using VisDiff, we are able to find interesting and previously\nunknown differences in datasets and models, demonstrating its utility in\nrevealing nuanced insights.",

In some cases, this can\nlead to conclusions which are driven by choice of parametrisation and priors\nrather than by data. The profile likelihood method provides a complementary\nfrequentist tool which can be used to investigate this effect.\n  In this paper, we present the code PROSPECT for computing profile likelihoods\nin cosmology.

            "summary": "Solving complex visual tasks such as \"Who invented the musical instrument on\nthe right?\" involves a composition of skills: understanding space, recognizing\ninstruments, and also retrieving prior knowledge. Recent work shows promise by\ndecomposing such tasks using a large language model (LLM) into an executable\nprogram that invokes specialized vision models. However, generated programs are\nerror-prone: they omit necessary steps, include spurious ones, and are unable\nto recover when the specialized models give incorrect outputs. Moreover, they\nrequire loading multiple models, incurring high latency and computation costs.\nWe propose Visual Program Distillation (VPD), an instruction tuning framework\nthat produces a vision-language model (VLM) capable of solving complex visual\ntasks with a single forward pass. VPD distills the reasoning ability of LLMs by\nusing them to sample multiple candidate programs, which are then executed and\nverified to identify a correct one. It translates each correct program into a\nlanguage description of the reasoning steps, which are then distilled into a\nVLM. Extensive experiments show that VPD improves the VLM's ability to count,\nunderstand spatial relations, and reason compositionally. Our VPD-trained\nPaLI-X outperforms all prior VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance\nacross complex vision tasks, including MMBench, OK-VQA, A-OKVQA, TallyQA, POPE,\nand Hateful Memes. An evaluation with human annotators also confirms that VPD\nimproves model response factuality and consistency. Finally, experiments on\ncontent moderation demonstrate that VPD is also helpful for adaptation to\nreal-world applications with limited data.",

Previous works focus on encoding existing algorithms into\nnetworks, which are interpretable by definition. However, focusing on encoding\nlimits the possibility of discovering new algorithms that humans have never\nstumbled upon, but that are nevertheless interpretable. In this work, we\nexplore the possibility of using hypernetworks to generate interpretable\nnetworks whose underlying algorithms are not yet known. The hypernetwork is\ncarefully designed such that it can control network complexity, leading to a\ndiverse family of interpretable algorithms ranked by their complexity. All of\nthem are interpretable in hindsight, although some of them are less intuitive\nto humans, hence providing new insights regarding how to \"think\" like a neural\nnetwork. For the task of computing L1 norms, hypernetworks find three\nalgorithms: (a) the double-sided algorithm, (b) the convexity algorithm, (c)\nthe pudding algorithm, although only the first algorithm was expected by the\nauthors before experiments. We automatically classify these algorithms and\nanalyze how these algorithmic phases develop during training, as well as how\nthey are affected by complexity control.

Moreover, we integrate the diffusion\nmodel into the teacher-student framework, so that the denoised bounding boxes\ncan be used to improve pseudo-label generation, as well as the entire\nsemi-supervised learning process. We conduct experiments on the ScanNet and SUN\nRGB-D benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance against existing methods. We also present\nextensive analysis to understand how our diffusion model design affects\nperformance in semi-supervised learning.",

            "summary": "In this era, the success of large language models and text-to-image models\ncan be attributed to the driving force of large-scale datasets. However, in the\nrealm of 3D vision, while remarkable progress has been made with models trained\non large-scale synthetic and real-captured object data like Objaverse and\nMVImgNet, a similar level of progress has not been observed in the domain of\nhuman-centric tasks partially due to the lack of a large-scale human dataset.\nExisting datasets of high-fidelity 3D human capture continue to be mid-sized\ndue to the significant challenges in acquiring large-scale high-quality 3D\nhuman data. To bridge this gap, we present MVHumanNet, a dataset that comprises\nmulti-view human action sequences of 4,500 human identities. The primary focus\nof our work is on collecting human data that features a large number of diverse\nidentities and everyday clothing using a multi-view human capture system, which\nfacilitates easily scalable data collection. Our dataset contains 9,000 daily\noutfits, 60,000 motion sequences and 645 million frames with extensive\nannotations, including human masks, camera parameters, 2D and 3D keypoints,\nSMPL/SMPLX parameters, and corresponding textual descriptions. To explore the\npotential of MVHumanNet in various 2D and 3D visual tasks, we conducted pilot\nstudies on view-consistent action recognition, human NeRF reconstruction,\ntext-driven view-unconstrained human image generation, as well as 2D\nview-unconstrained human image and 3D avatar generation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the performance improvements and effective applications enabled by\nthe scale provided by MVHumanNet. As the current largest-scale 3D human\ndataset, we hope that the release of MVHumanNet data with annotations will\nfoster further innovations in the domain of 3D human-centric tasks at scale.",

            "summary": "Horizontal gene transfer inference approaches are usually based on gene\nsequences: parametric methods search for patterns that deviate from a\nparticular genomic signature, while phylogenetic methods use sequences to\nreconstruct the gene and species trees. However, it is well-known that\nsequences have difficulty identifying ancient transfers since mutations have\nenough time to erase all evidence of such events. In this work, we ask whether\ncharacter-based methods can predict gene transfers. Their advantage over\nsequences is that homologous genes can have low DNA similarity, but still have\nretained enough important common motifs that allow them to have common\ncharacter traits, for instance the same functional or expression profile. A\nphylogeny that has two separate clades that acquired the same character\nindependently might indicate the presence of a transfer even in the absence of\nsequence similarity. We introduce perfect transfer networks, which are\nphylogenetic networks that can explain the character diversity of a set of taxa\nunder the assumption that characters have unique births, and that once a\ncharacter is gained it is rarely lost. Examples of such traits include\ntransposable elements, biochemical markers and emergence of organelles, just to\nname a few. We study the differences between our model and two similar models:\nperfect phylogenetic networks and ancestral recombination networks. Our goals\nare to initiate a study on the structural and algorithmic properties of perfect\ntransfer networks. We then show that in polynomial time, one can decide whether\na given network is a valid explanation for a set of taxa, and show how, for a\ngiven tree, one can add transfer edges to it so that it explains a set of taxa.\nWe finally provide lower and upper bounds on the number of transfers required\nto explain a set of taxa, in the worst case.",

To generate region and vessel ground-truths,\nwe used state-of-the-art automatic methods following manual correction of\ninaccurate segmentations, with foveal positions manually annotated.

We analysed segmentation agreement (AUC, Dice) and choroid metrics\nagreement (Pearson, Spearman, mean absolute error (MAE)) in internal and\nexternal test sets. We compared Choroidalyzer to two manual graders on a small\nsubset of external test images and examined cases of high error.\n  Results: Choroidalyzer took 0.299 seconds per image on a standard laptop and\nachieved excellent region (Dice: internal 0.9789, external 0.9749), very good\nvessel segmentation performance (Dice: internal 0.8817, external 0.8703) and\nexcellent fovea location prediction (MAE: internal 3.9 pixels, external 3.4\npixels).

In this paper we present several applications\nof delensing focused on testing theories of early-universe inflation with\nobservations of the CMB. We find that delensing the CMB results in improved\nparameter constraints for reconstructing the spectrum of primordial curvature\nfluctuations, probing oscillatory features in the primordial curvature\nspectrum, measuring the spatial curvature of the universe, and constraining\nseveral different models of isocurvature perturbations. In some cases we find\nthat delensing can recover almost all of the constraining power contained in\nunlensed spectra, and it will be a particularly valuable analysis technique to\nachieve further improvements in constraints for model parameters whose\nmeasurements are not expected to improve significantly when utilizing only\nlensed CMB maps from next-generation CMB surveys.

            "summary": "Objective: This study aimed to explore the associations between depression\nseverity and wearable-measured circadian rhythms, accounting for seasonal\nimpacts and quantifying seasonal changes in circadian rhythms.Materials and\nMethods: Data used in this study came from a large longitudinal mobile health\nstudy. Depression severity (measured biweekly using the 8-item Patient Health\nQuestionnaire [PHQ-8]) and behaviors (monitored by Fitbit) were tracked for up\nto two years. Twelve features were extracted from Fitbit recordings to\napproximate circadian rhythms. Three nested linear mixed-effects models were\nemployed for each feature: (1) incorporating the PHQ-8 score as an independent\nvariable; (2) adding the season variable; and (3) adding an interaction term\nbetween season and the PHQ-8 score. Results: This study analyzed 10,018 PHQ-8\nrecords with Fitbit data from 543 participants. Upon adjusting for seasonal\neffects, higher PHQ-8 scores were associated with reduced activity, irregular\nbehaviors, and delayed rhythms. Notably, the negative association with daily\nstep counts was stronger in summer and spring than in winter, and the positive\nassociation with the onset of the most active continuous 10-hour period was\nsignificant only during summer. Furthermore, participants had shorter and later\nsleep, more activity, and delayed circadian rhythms in summer compared to\nwinter. Discussion and Conclusions: Our findings underscore the significant\nseasonal impacts on human circadian rhythms and their associations with\ndepression and indicate that wearable-measured circadian rhythms have the\npotential to be the digital biomarkers of depression.",

Two vertices are chosen randomly, with rate $(2N)^{-1}$, and an edge is\n(i) established if each vertex belongs to a tree; (ii) established with\nprobability $p$ if only one vertex belongs to a tree; (iii) an attempt fails if\nboth vertices belong to unicyclic components. This densification process\ngenerates random graphs with simple components, viz., trees and unicycles. In\nthe $N\\to\\infty$ limit, the fraction of vertices in unicycles vanishes when\n$t\\leq 1$ and becomes positive when $t>1$. A similar phase transition occurs in\nclassical random graphs where all attempts to add an edge are successful. When\n$N\\to\\infty$ and $t<1$, classical random graphs are simple. In the\nsupercritical phase, a classical random graph contains a (complex) giant\ncomponent that eventually engulfs all finite components and continues to\ndensify forever, or until the graph becomes complete if loops and multiple\nedges are forbidden. The evolution of simple random graphs freezes when trees\ndisappear, and only unicycles remain.",

            "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive experimental and numerical investigation\ninto the control of boundary layers using porous bleed systems. The study\nfocuses on both supersonic and subsonic flow regimes, as well as on the control\nof shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions. By simplifying this complex problem\ninto two separate scenarios, the research establishes the necessity of\nindividually characterizing bleed systems for both supersonic and subsonic flow\nregimes due to variations in the flow topology within the bleed holes. In\nsupersonic conditions, a strong agreement between experimental and numerical\nresults validates the effectiveness of porous bleed in controlling boundary\nlayers. Notably, three-dimensional effects are experimentally demonstrated, and\nvariations of the boundary-layer profiles along the span are the first time\nexperimentally proven. The study extends its scope to subsonic flows, revealing\nthat while boundary-layer bleeding enhances flow momentum near the wall, mass\nremoval induces a decrease in momentum in the outer boundary layer and external\nflow. The research also explores shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction control,\nachieving a remarkable alignment between simulations and experiments. The\nfindings endorse the use of Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations for\nstudying porous bleed systems in various flow conditions, providing valuable\ninsights to enhance bleed models, especially in the context of\nshock-wave/boundary-layer interaction control.",

However, are they usable as large-scale data generators,\ne.g., to improve tasks in the perception stack, like semantic segmentation? We\ninvestigate this question in the context of autonomous driving, and answer it\nwith a resounding \"yes\". We propose an efficient data generation pipeline\ntermed DGInStyle. First, we examine the problem of specializing a pretrained\nLDM to semantically-controlled generation within a narrow domain. Second, we\ndesign a Multi-resolution Latent Fusion technique to overcome the bias of LDMs\ntowards dominant objects. Third, we propose a Style Swap technique to endow the\nrich generative prior with the learned semantic control. Using DGInStyle, we\ngenerate a diverse dataset of street scenes, train a domain-agnostic semantic\nsegmentation model on it, and evaluate the model on multiple popular autonomous\ndriving datasets. Our approach consistently increases the performance of\nseveral domain generalization methods, in some cases by +2.5 mIoU compared to\nthe previous state-of-the-art method without our generative augmentation\nscheme.

Despite recent efforts to enable LMMs to support grounding, their\ncapabilities for grounding and chat are usually separate, and their chat\nperformance drops dramatically when asked to ground. The problem is the lack of\na dataset for grounded visual chat (GVC). Existing grounding datasets only\ncontain short captions. To address this issue, we have created GVC data that\nallows for the combination of grounding and chat capabilities. To better\nevaluate the GVC capabilities, we have introduced a benchmark called\nGrounding-Bench. Additionally, we have proposed a model design that can support\nGVC and various types of visual prompts by connecting segmentation models with\nlanguage models. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms\nother LMMs on Grounding-Bench. Furthermore, our model achieves competitive\nperformance on classic grounding benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g and Flickr30K\nEntities.

These tools are employed for a variety\nof reasons such as noise reduction, visualization, and to lower computational\ncosts. However, there is a fundamental issue that is highly discussed in other\nmodeling problems, but almost entirely ignored in the dimension reduction\nliterature: overfitting. If we interpret data as a combination of signal and\nnoise, prior works judge dimension reduction techniques on their ability to\ncapture the entirety of the data, i.e. both the signal and the noise. In the\ncontext of other modeling problems, techniques such as feature-selection,\ncross-validation, and regularization are employed to combat overfitting, but no\nsuch precautions are taken when performing dimension reduction. In this paper,\nwe present a framework that models dimension reduction problems in the presence\nof noise and use this framework to explore the role perplexity and number of\nneighbors play in overfitting data when applying t-SNE and UMAP. We also\npresent a workflow others may use to calibrate perplexity or number of\nneighbors in the presence of noise.",

A very\nlarge nuclear network of 524 nuclear species extending up to Bi has been\nadopted. Our main findings may be summarized as follows: a) rotating models\nabove Z=0 are able to produce nuclei up to the neutron closure shell at N=50,\nand in a few cases up to N=82; b) rotation drastically inhibits the penetration\nof the He convective shell in the H rich mantle, phenomenon often found in zero\nmetallicity non rotating massive stars; c) vice versa rotation favors the\npenetration of the O convective shell in the C rich layers with the consequence\nof altering significantly the yields of the products of the C, Ne, and O\nburning; d) none of the models that reach the critical velocity while in H\nburning, loses more the 1 M$_{\\odot}$ in this phase; e) conversely, almost all\nmodels able to reach their Hayashi track exceed the Eddington luminosity and\nlose dynamically almost all their H rich mantle.\n  These models suggest that rotating massive stars may have contributed\nsignificantly to the synthesis of the heavy nuclei in the first phase of\nenrichment of the interstellar medium, i.e., at early times.",

            "summary": "Automatically determining the position of every slice in a CT scan is a basic\nyet powerful capability allowing fast retrieval of region of interest for\nvisual inspection and automated analysis. Unlike conventional localization\napproaches which work at the slice level, we directly localize only a fraction\nof the slices and and then fit a linear model which maps slice index to its\nestimated axial anatomical position based on those slices. The model is then\nused to assign axial position to every slices of the scan. This approach proves\nto be both computationally efficient, with a typical processing time of less\nthan a second per scan (regardless of its size), accurate, with a typical\nmedian localization error of 1 cm, and robust to different noise sources,\nimaging protocols, metal induced artifacts, anatomical deformations etc.\nAnother key element of our approach is the introduction of a mapping confidence\nscore. This score acts as a fail safe mechanism which allows a rejection of\nunreliable localization results in rare cases of anomalous scans. Our algorithm\nsets new State Of The Art results in terms of localization accuracy. It also\noffers a decrease of two orders of magnitude in processing time with respect to\nall published processing times. It was designed to be invariant to various scan\nresolutions, scan protocols, patient orientations, strong artifacts and various\ndeformations and abnormalities. Additionally, our algorithm is the first one to\nthe best of our knowledge which supports the entire body from head to feet and\nis not confined to specific anatomical region. This algorithm was tested on\nthousands of scans and proves to be very reliable and useful as a preprocessing\nstage for many applications.",

First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of\nlight as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the\nmaximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the\nentanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of\ncompatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family\nof dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again\nindependent on the R\\'enyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the\nentanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties\nto find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these\ncircuits.",

Since its introduction, it has been implemented, extended, and\nmodernized by major online experimentation platforms. Many researchers and\npractitioners often interpret CUPED as a regression adjustment. In this\narticle, we clarify its similarities and differences to regression adjustment\nand present CUPED as a more general augmentation framework which is closer to\nthe spirit of the 2013 paper. We show that the augmentation view naturally\nleads to cleaner developments of variance reduction beyond simple average\nmetrics, including ratio metrics and percentile metrics. Moreover, the\naugmentation view can go beyond using pre-experiment data and leverage\nin-experiment data, leading to significantly larger variance reduction. We\nfurther introduce metric decomposition using approximate null augmentation\n(ANA) as a mental model for in-experiment variance reduction. We study it under\nboth a Bayesian framework and a frequentist optimal proxy metric framework.\nMetric decomposition arises naturally in conversion funnels, so this work has\nbroad applicability.",

However, a significant challenge in\ndiffusion-based methods is ensuring that the generated sensor data preserve\nboth intra-world consistency and inter-sensor coherence. To address these\nchallenges, we combine an additional explicit world volume and propose the\nWorld Volume-aware Multi-camera Driving Scene Generator (WoVoGen). This system\nis specifically designed to leverage 4D world volume as a foundational element\nfor video generation. Our model operates in two distinct phases: (i)\nenvisioning the future 4D temporal world volume based on vehicle control\nsequences, and (ii) generating multi-camera videos, informed by this envisioned\n4D temporal world volume and sensor interconnectivity.

In this paper we study the full counting statistics\nof particle number in one dimensional interacting Bose and Fermi gases which\nhave been quenched far from equilibrium. In particular we consider the time\nevolution of the Lieb-Liniger and Gaudin-Yang models quenched from a\nBose-Einstein condensate initial state and calculate the full counting\nstatistics of the particle number within a subsystem. We show that the scaled\ncumulants of the charge in the initial state and at long times are simply\nrelated and in particular the latter are independent of the model parameters.\nUsing the quasi-particle picture we obtain the full time evolution of the\ncumulants and find that although their endpoints are fixed, the finite time\ndynamics depends strongly on the model parameters. We go on to construct the\nscaled cumulant generating functions and from this determine the limiting\ncharge probability distributions at long time which are shown to exhibit\ndistinct non-trivial and non-Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations.",

            "summary": "Despite the recent progress in text-to-video generation, existing studies\nusually overlook the issue that only spatial contents but not temporal motions\nin synthesized videos are under the control of text. Towards such a challenge,\nthis work presents a practical system, named LivePhoto, which allows users to\nanimate an image of their interest with text descriptions. We first establish a\nstrong baseline that helps a well-learned text-to-image generator (i.e., Stable\nDiffusion) take an image as a further input. We then equip the improved\ngenerator with a motion module for temporal modeling and propose a carefully\ndesigned training pipeline to better link texts and motions. In particular,\nconsidering the facts that (1) text can only describe motions roughly (e.g.,\nregardless of the moving speed) and (2) text may include both content and\nmotion descriptions, we introduce a motion intensity estimation module as well\nas a text re-weighting module to reduce the ambiguity of text-to-motion\nmapping. Empirical evidence suggests that our approach is capable of well\ndecoding motion-related textual instructions into videos, such as actions,\ncamera movements, or even conjuring new contents from thin air (e.g., pouring\nwater into an empty glass). Interestingly, thanks to the proposed intensity\nlearning mechanism, our system offers users an additional control signal (i.e.,\nthe motion intensity) besides text for video customization.",

Beyond\nthis, we demonstrate that properties such as shape, size, location, motion,\netc., can also be edited in videos. Our key insight is that the keyframe\ntransformations of the specific internal feature (e.g., edge maps of objects or\nhuman pose), can easily propagate to other frames to provide generation\nguidance. We thus propose MagicStick, a controllable video editing method that\nedits the video properties by utilizing the transformation on the extracted\ninternal control signals. In detail, to keep the appearance, we inflate both\nthe pretrained image diffusion model and ControlNet to the temporal dimension\nand train low-rank adaptions (LORA) layers to fit the specific scenes. Then, in\nediting, we perform an inversion and editing framework. Differently, finetuned\nControlNet is introduced in both inversion and generation for attention\nguidance with the proposed attention remix between the spatial attention maps\nof inversion and editing. Yet succinct, our method is the first method to show\nthe ability of video property editing from the pre-trained text-to-image model.\nWe present experiments on numerous examples within our unified framework. We\nalso compare with shape-aware text-based editing and handcrafted motion video\ngeneration, demonstrating our superior temporal consistency and editing\ncapability than previous works.

            "summary": "This paper studies a diffusion control problem motivated by challenges faced\nby public health agencies who run clinics to serve the public. A key challenge\nfor these agencies is to motivate individuals to participate in the services\nprovided. They must manage the flow of (voluntary) participants so that the\nclinic capacity is highly utilized, but not overwhelmed. The organization can\ndeploy costly promotion activities to increase the inflow of participants.\nIdeally, the system manager would like to have enough participants waiting in a\nqueue to serve as many individuals as possible and efficiently use clinic\ncapacity. However, if too many participants sign up, resulting in a long wait,\nparticipants may become irritated and hesitate to participate again in the\nfuture. We develop a diffusion model of managing participant inflow mechanisms.\nEach mechanism corresponds to choosing a particular drift rate parameter for\nthe diffusion model. The system manager seeks to balance three different costs\noptimally: i) a linear holding cost that captures the congestion concerns; ii)\nan idleness penalty corresponding to wasted clinic capacity and negative impact\non public health, and iii) costs of promotion activities. We show that a\nnested-threshold policy for deployment of participant inflow mechanisms is\noptimal under the long-run average cost criterion. In this policy, the system\nmanager progressively deploys mechanisms in increasing order of cost, as the\nnumber of participants in the queue decreases. We derive explicit formulas for\nthe queue length thresholds that trigger each promotion activity, providing the\nsystem manager with guidance on when to use each mechanism.",

We study its symmetry\nresolution for two disjoint intervals in the ground state of the massless Dirac\nfermion field theory, extending previous results for the case of adjacent\nintervals. By applying the replica trick, this problem boils down to compute\nthe charged moments of the realignment matrix. We show that, for two disjoint\nintervals, they correspond to the partition function of the theory on a torus\nwith a non-contractible charged loop. This confers a great advantage compared\nto the negativity based on the partial transposition, for which the Riemann\nsurfaces generated by the replica trick have higher genus. This result empowers\nus to carry out the replica limit, yielding analytic expressions for the\nsymmetry-resolved CCNR negativity. Furthermore, these expressions provide also\nthe symmetry decomposition of other related quantities such as the operator\nentanglement of the reduced density matrix or the reflected entropy.",

            "summary": "With the rapid growth in the scale of pre-trained foundation models,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques have gained significant attention,\namong which Adapter Tuning is the most widely used. Despite achieving\nefficiency, Adapter Tuning still underperforms full fine-tuning, and the\nperformance improves at the cost of an increase in parameters. Recent efforts\naddress this issue by pruning the original adapters, but it also introduces\ntraining instability and suboptimal performance on certain datasets. Motivated\nby this, we propose Mixture of Sparse Adapters, or MoSA, as a novel Adapter\nTuning method to fully unleash the potential of each parameter in the adapter.\nWe first split the standard adapter into multiple non-overlapping modules, then\nstochastically activate modules for sparse training, and finally merge them to\nform a complete adapter after tuning. In this way, MoSA can achieve\nsignificantly better performance than standard adapters without any additional\ncomputational or storage overhead. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical\nsparse strategy to better leverage limited training data. Extensive experiments\non a series of 27 visual tasks demonstrate that MoSA consistently outperforms\nother Adapter Tuning methods as well as other baselines by a significant\nmargin. Furthermore, in two challenging scenarios with low-resource and\nmulti-task settings, MoSA achieves satisfactory results, further demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of our design.

To\nachieve detailed control, we propose a unified framework to jointly inject\ncontrol signals into the existing text-to-video model. Our model consists of a\njoint encoder and adaptive cross-attention layers. By optimizing the encoder\nand the inserted layer, we adapt the model to generate videos that are aligned\nwith both text prompts and fine-grained control. Compared to existing methods\nrelying on dense control signals such as edge maps, we provide a more intuitive\nand user-friendly interface to allow object-level fine-grained control. Our\nmethod achieves controllability of object appearances without finetuning, which\nreduces the per-subject optimization efforts for the users.

This paper\nintroduces MPerceiver: a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that\nharnesses Stable Diffusion (SD) priors to enhance adaptiveness,\ngeneralizability and fidelity for all-in-one image restoration. Specifically,\nwe develop a dual-branch module to master two types of SD prompts: textual for\nholistic representation and visual for multiscale detail representation. Both\nprompts are dynamically adjusted by degradation predictions from the CLIP image\nencoder, enabling adaptive responses to diverse unknown degradations. Moreover,\na plug-in detail refinement module improves restoration fidelity via direct\nencoder-to-decoder information transformation. To assess our method, MPerceiver\nis trained on 9 tasks for all-in-one IR and outperforms state-of-the-art\ntask-specific methods across most tasks. Post multitask pre-training,\nMPerceiver attains a generalized representation in low-level vision, exhibiting\nremarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities in unseen tasks. Extensive\nexperiments on 16 IR tasks and 26 benchmarks underscore the superiority of\nMPerceiver in terms of adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity.",

To address this issue and\ninvestigate the applicability of large language models (LLMs) in CQA\nsimulation, we propose a simulation framework that employs zero-shot learner\nLLMs for simulating teacher-student interactions. Our framework involves two\nLLMs interacting on a specific topic, with the first LLM acting as a student,\ngenerating questions to explore a given search topic. The second LLM plays the\nrole of a teacher by answering questions and is equipped with additional\ninformation, including a text on the given topic. We implement both the student\nand teacher by zero-shot prompting the GPT-4 model. To assess the effectiveness\nof LLMs in simulating CQA interactions and understand the disparities between\nLLM- and human-generated conversations, we evaluate the simulated data from\nvarious perspectives. We begin by evaluating the teacher's performance through\nboth automatic and human assessment. Next, we evaluate the performance of the\nstudent, analyzing and comparing the disparities between questions generated by\nthe LLM and those generated by humans. Furthermore, we conduct extensive\nanalyses to thoroughly examine the LLM performance by benchmarking\nstate-of-the-art reading comprehension models on both datasets. Our results\nreveal that the teacher LLM generates lengthier answers that tend to be more\naccurate and complete. The student LLM generates more diverse questions,\ncovering more aspects of a given topic.",

            "summary": "Adversarial attacks have highlighted the vulnerability of classifiers based\non machine learning for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target\nRecognition (ATR) tasks. An adversarial attack perturbs SAR images of on-ground\ntargets such that the classifiers are misled into making incorrect predictions.\nHowever, many existing attacking techniques rely on arbitrary manipulation of\nSAR images while overlooking the feasibility of executing the attacks on\nreal-world SAR imagery. Instead, adversarial attacks should be able to be\nimplemented by physical actions, for example, placing additional false objects\nas scatterers around the on-ground target to perturb the SAR image and fool the\nSAR ATR.\n  In this paper, we propose the On-Target Scatterer Attack (OTSA), a\nscatterer-based physical adversarial attack. To ensure the feasibility of its\nphysical execution, we enforce a constraint on the positioning of the\nscatterers. Specifically, we restrict the scatterers to be placed only on the\ntarget instead of in the shadow regions or the background. To achieve this, we\nintroduce a positioning score based on Gaussian kernels and formulate an\noptimization problem for our OTSA attack. Using a gradient ascent method to\nsolve the optimization problem, the OTSA can generate a vector of parameters\ndescribing the positions, shapes, sizes and amplitudes of the scatterers to\nguide the physical execution of the attack that will mislead SAR image\nclassifiers. The experimental results show that our attack obtains\nsignificantly higher success rates under the positioning constraint compared\nwith the existing method.",

The connection\nprovides an effective way of developing new multiple testing procedures by\naggregating or assembling e-values resulting from the BH and BC procedures and\ntheir use in different subsets of the data. In particular, we propose new\nmultiple testing methodologies in three applications, including a hybrid\napproach that integrates the BH and BC procedures, a multiple testing procedure\naimed at ensuring a new notion of fairness by controlling both the group-wise\nand overall false discovery rates (FDR), and a structure adaptive multiple\ntesting procedure that can incorporate external covariate information to boost\ndetection power. One notable feature of the proposed methods is that we use a\ndata-dependent approach for assigning weights to e-values, significantly\nenhancing the efficiency of the resulting e-BH procedure. The construction of\nthe weights is non-trivial and is motivated by the leave-one-out analysis for\nthe BH and BC procedures. In theory, we prove that the proposed e-BH procedures\nwith data-dependent weights in the three applications ensure finite sample FDR\ncontrol.

            "summary": "Few-shot image classification aims to learn an image classifier using only a\nsmall set of labeled examples per class. A recent research direction for\nimproving few-shot classifiers involves augmenting the labelled samples with\nsynthetic images created by state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models.\nFollowing this trend, we propose Diversified in-domain synthesis with efficient\nfine-tuning (DISEF), a novel approach which addresses the generalization\nchallenge in few-shot learning using synthetic data. DISEF consists of two main\ncomponents. First, we propose a novel text-to-image augmentation pipeline that,\nby leveraging the real samples and their rich semantics coming from an advanced\ncaptioning model, promotes in-domain sample diversity for better\ngeneralization. Second, we emphasize the importance of effective model\nfine-tuning in few-shot recognition, proposing to use Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) for joint adaptation of the text and image encoders in a Vision Language\nModel. We validate our method in ten different benchmarks, consistently\noutperforming baselines and establishing a new state-of-the-art for few-shot\nclassification.
