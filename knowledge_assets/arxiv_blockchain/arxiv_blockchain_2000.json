            "summary": "Today's world is a globalized and connected one, where people are\nincreasingly moving around and interacting with a greater number of services\nand devices of all kinds, including those that allow them to monitor their\nhealth. However, each company, institution or health system usually store its\npatients' data in an isolated way. Although this approach can have some\nbenefits related with privacy, security, etc., it also implies that each one of\nthem generates different, incomplete and possibly contradictory views of a\npatient's health data, losing part of the value that this information could\nbring to the patient. That is the reason why researchers from all over the\nworld are determined to replace the current institution-centered health systems\nwith new patient-centered ones. In these new systems, all the health\ninformation of a patient is integrated into a unique global vision. However,\nsome questions are still unanswered. Specifically, who should store and\nmaintain the information of a given patient and how should this information be\nmade available for other systems. To address this situation, this work proposes\na new solution towards making the Personal Health Trajectory of patients\navailable for both, the patients themselves and health institutions. By using\nthe concept of blockchains' federation and web services access to the global\nvision of a person health can be granted to existing and new solutions. To\ndemonstrate the viability of the proposal, an implementation is provided\nalongside the obtained results in a potential scenario.",

Hyperledger Fabric is currently one of the most wide-spread\npermissioned blockchain systems and is heavily promoted both in industry and\nacademia. Due to its optimistic concurrency model, the transaction failure\nrates in Fabric can become a bottleneck. While there is active research to\nreduce failures, there is a lack of understanding on their root cause and,\nconsequently, a lack of guidelines on how to configure Fabric optimally for\ndifferent scenarios. To close this gap, in this paper, we first introduce a\nformal definition of the different types of transaction failures in Fabric.\nThen, we develop a comprehensive testbed and benchmarking system,\nHyperLedgerLab, along with four different chaincodes that represent realistic\nuse cases and a chaincode/workload generator. Using HyperLedgerLab, we conduct\nexhaustive experiments to analyze the impact of different parameters of Fabric\nsuch as block size, endorsement policies, and others, on transaction failures.\nWe further analyze three recently proposed optimizations from the literature,\nFabric++, Streamchain and FabricSharp, and evaluate under which conditions they\nreduce the failure rates. Finally, based on our results, we provide\nrecommendations for Fabric practitioners on how to configure the system and\nalso propose new research directions.",

Even when there is enough network\nbandwidth, the CPU cost of serialization and deserialization of the messages\nlimits the throughput and increases the latency of the protocols.

By utilizing core\nBlockchain principles, we ensure that the collected data is immutable and\ntamper-proof while preserving data provenance and non-repudiation. To realize\nBBox-IoT, we designed and implemented a novel chain-based hash signature scheme\nwhich only requires hashing operations and removes all synchronicity\ndependencies between signer and verifier. Our approach enables low-SWaP devices\nto authenticate removing reliance on clock synchronization. Our evaluation\nresults show that BBox-IoT is practical in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)\nenvironments: even devices equipped with 16MHz micro-controllers and 2KB memory\ncan broadcast their collected data without requiring heavy cryptographic\noperations or synchronicity assumptions. Finally, when compared to industry\nstandard ECDSA, our approach is two and three orders of magnitude faster for\nsigning and verification operations respectively.

Although\nblockchain-based IoT access control schemes have been the most popular ones,\nthey suffer from several significant limitations, such as high monetary cost\nand low throughput of processing access requests. To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper proposes a novel IoT access control scheme by combining\nthe fee-less IOTA technology and the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based\nEncryption (CP-ABE) technology. To control the access to a resource, a token,\nwhich records access permissions to this resource, is encrypted by the CP-ABE\ntechnology and uploaded to the IOTA Tangle (i.e., the underlying database of\nIOTA). Any user can fetch the encrypted token from the Tangle, while only those\nwho can decrypt this token are authorized to access the resource. In this way,\nthe proposed scheme enables not only distributed, fee-less and scalable access\ncontrol thanks to the IOTA but also fine-grained attribute-based access control\nthanks to the CP-ABE. We show the feasibility of our scheme by implementing a\nproof-of-concept prototype system and evaluate its performance in terms of\naccess request processing throughput.",

Credit networks arise naturally in many\nfinancial systems, including the recent construct of payment channel networks\nin blockchain systems. An important performance metric for these networks is\ntheir transaction throughput. However, predicting the throughput of a credit\nnetwork is nontrivial. Unlike traditional communication channels, credit\nchannels can become imbalanced; they are unable to support more transactions in\na given direction once the credit limit has been reached. This potential for\nimbalance creates a complex dependency between a network's throughput and its\ntopology, path choices, and the credit balances (state) on every channel. Even\nworse, certain combinations of these factors can lead the credit network to\ndeadlocked states where no transactions can make progress. In this paper, we\nstudy the relationship between the throughput of a credit network and its\ntopology and credit state. We show that the presence of deadlocks completely\ncharacterizes a network's throughput sensitivity to different credit states.\nAlthough we show that identifying deadlocks in an arbitrary topology is\nNP-hard, we propose a peeling algorithm inspired by decoding algorithms for\nerasure codes that upper bounds the severity of the deadlock. We use the\npeeling algorithm as a tool to compare the performance of different topologies\nas well as to aid in the synthesis of topologies robust to deadlocks.",

We introduce design patterns to classify the platforms. We\ncategorize possible use cases by identifying the structure among applications,\nand organize the functional, performance, operational and legal requirements\nfor each such case.\n  Based on the categorization and criteria, we evaluated and compared the\nfollowing platforms: Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Iroha, Hyperledger Indy,\nEthereum, Quorum/Hyperledger Besu, Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, Corda and BBc-1. We\nhave tried to be fair in our evaluations and comparisons, but we also expect to\nprovoke discussion.\n  The intended readers for this document is anyone involved in development of\napplication systems who wants to understand blockchain and their platforms,\nincluding non-engineers and non-technologists. The assessments in this document\nwill allow readers to understand the technological requirements for the\nblockchain platforms, to question existing technologies, and to choose the\nappropriate platforms for the applications they envision. The comparisons\nhopefully will also be useful as a guide for designing new technologies.",

            "summary": "Goods trade is a supply chain transaction that involves shippers buying goods\nfrom suppliers and carriers providing goods transportation. Shippers are issued\ninvoices from suppliers and carriers. Shippers carry out goods receiving and\ninvoice processing before payment processing of bills for suppliers and\ncarriers, where invoice processing includes tasks like processing claims and\nadjusting the bill payments. Goods receiving involves verification of received\ngoods by the Shipper's receiving team. Invoice processing is carried out by the\nShipper's accounts payable team, which in turn is verified by the accounts\nreceivable teams of suppliers and carriers. This paper presents a\nblockchain-based accounts payable system that generates claims for the\ndeficiency in the goods received and accordingly adjusts the payment in the\nbills for suppliers and carriers. Primary motivations for these supply chain\norganizations to adopt blockchain-based accounts payable systems are to\neliminate the process redundancies (accounts payable vs. accounts receivable),\nto reduce the number of disputes among the transacting participants, and to\naccelerate the accounts payable processes via optimizations in the claims\ngeneration and blockchain-based dispute reconciliation.",

Thus, most\nblockchain technologies assume an environment with a fast and stable network.\nHowever, in some blockchain-based systems, e.g., supply chain management (SCM)\nsystems, some Internet of Things (IOT) nodes can only rely on the low-quality\nnetwork sometimes to achieve consensus. Thus, it is critical to understand the\napplicability of existing consensus algorithms in such environments. We\nperformed a systematic mapping study to evaluate and compare existing consensus\nmechanisms' capability to provide integrity and security with varying network\nproperties. Our study identified 25 state-of-the-art consensus algorithms from\npublished and preprint literature. We categorized and compared the consensus\nalgorithms qualitatively based on established performance and integrity metrics\nand well-known blockchain security issues. Results show that consensus\nalgorithms rely on the synchronous network for correctness cannot provide the\nexpected integrity. Such consensus algorithms may also be vulnerable to\ndistributed-denial-of-service (DDOS) and routing attacks, given limited network\nthroughput. Conversely, asynchronous consensus algorithms, e.g.,\nHoney-BadgerBFT, are deemed more robust against many of these attacks and may\nprovide high integrity in asynchrony events.",

            "summary": "Decentralized finance, i.e., DeFi, has become the most popular type of\napplication on many public blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) in recent years.\nCompared to the traditional finance, DeFi allows customers to flexibly\nparticipate in diverse blockchain financial services (e.g., lending, borrowing,\ncollateralizing, exchanging etc.) via smart contracts at a relatively low cost\nof trust. However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces a large attack\nsurface, which is a severe threat to the security of participants funds. In\nthis paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE, a real-time attack detection system for DeFi\nprojects on the Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE are\ntwofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified based on an\nautomatic security analysis process, which performs symbolic reasoning on the\ndata flow of important service states, e.g., asset price, and checks whether\nthey can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is\ninstalled offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only to\nthat project but other associated projects as well are collected for further\nsecurity analysis. A potential attack is flagged if a violation is detected on\na critical invariant configured in BLOCKEYE, e.g., Benefit is achieved within a\nvery short time and way much bigger than the cost. We applied BLOCKEYE in\nseveral popular DeFi projects and managed to discover potential security\nattacks that are unreported before.

            "summary": "In this paper, we investigate two methods that allow us to automatically\ncreate profitable DeFi trades, one well-suited to arbitrage and the other\napplicable to more complicated settings. We first adopt the Bellman-Ford-Moore\nalgorithm with DEFIPOSER-ARB and then create logical DeFi protocol models for a\ntheorem prover in DEFIPOSER-SMT. While DEFIPOSER-ARB focuses on DeFi\ntransactions that form a cycle and performs very well for arbitrage,\nDEFIPOSER-SMT can detect more complicated profitable transactions. We estimate\nthat DEFIPOSER-ARB and DEFIPOSER-SMT can generate an average weekly revenue of\n191.48ETH (76,592USD) and 72.44ETH (28,976USD) respectively, with the highest\ntransaction revenue being 81.31ETH(32,524USD) and22.40ETH (8,960USD)\nrespectively. We further show that DEFIPOSER-SMT finds the known economic bZx\nattack from February 2020, which yields 0.48M USD. Our forensic investigations\nshow that this opportunity existed for 69 days and could have yielded more\nrevenue if exploited one day earlier. Our evaluation spans 150 days, given 96\nDeFi protocol actions, and 25 assets.\n  Looking beyond the financial gains mentioned above, forks deteriorate the\nblockchain consensus security, as they increase the risks of double-spending\nand selfish mining. We explore the implications of DEFIPOSER-ARB and\nDEFIPOSER-SMT on blockchain consensus. Specifically, we show that the trades\nidentified by our tools exceed the Ethereum block reward by up to 874x. Given\noptimal adversarial strategies provided by a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we\nquantify the value threshold at which a profitable transaction qualifies as\nMiner ExtractableValue (MEV) and would incentivize MEV-aware miners to fork the\nblockchain. For instance, we find that on Ethereum, a miner with a hash rate of\n10% would fork the blockchain if an MEV opportunity exceeds 4x the block\nreward.",

            "summary": "Network function virtualization (NFV) is a promising technology to make 5G\nnetworks flexible and agile. NFV decreases operators' OPEX and CAPEX by\ndecoupling the physical hardware from the functions they perform. In NFV,\nusers' service request can be viewed as a service function chain (SFC)\nconsisting of several virtual network functions (VNFs) which are connected\nthrough virtual links. Resource allocation in NFV is done through a centralized\nauthority called NFV Orchestrator (NFVO). This centralized authority suffers\nfrom some drawbacks such as single point of failure and security. Blockchain\n(BC) technology is able to address these problems by decentralizing resource\nallocation. The drawbacks of NFVO in NFV architecture and the exceptional BC\ncharacteristics to address these problems motivate us to focus on NFV resource\nallocation to users' SFCs without the need for an NFVO based on BC technology.\nTo this end, we assume there are two types of users: users who send SFC\nrequests (SFC requesting users) and users who perform mining process (miner\nusers). For SFC requesting users, we formulate NFV resource allocation (NFV-RA)\nproblem as a multi-objective problem to minimize the energy consumption and\nutilized resource cost, simultaneously.",

The purpose of\nour solution is to prevent users from saturating the system, and can be\ndescribed as rate-limiting. The system should be censorship resistant: it\nshould not be possible for submissions to be excluded because of the content\nitself, or for users to be excluded based on what they submit.\n  We first discuss a solution based on a single, centralized rate-limiter that\nis censorship resistant and anonymous, then we extend this to a fully\ndecentralized blockchain-based system and present methods to make it economical\nand scalable.",

There are\nvarious versions of zk-SNARK, among them, Quadratic Arithmetic Program\n(QAP)-based zk-SNARK has been widely used in practice, specially in Blockchain\ntechnology. This is attributed to two desirable features; its fixed-size proof\nand the very light computation load of the verifier. However, the computation\nload of the prover in QAP-based zkSNARKs, is very heavy, even-though it is\ndesigned to be very efficient. This load can be beyond the prover's computation\npower to handle, and has to be offloaded to some external servers. In the\nexisting offloading solutions, either (i) the load of computation, offloaded to\neach sever, is a fraction of the prover's primary computation (e.g., DZIK),\nhowever the servers need to be trusted, (ii) the servers are not required to be\ntrusted, but the computation complexity imposed to each one is the same as the\nprover's primary computation (e.g., Trinocchio). In this paper, we present a\nscheme, which has the benefits of both solutions. In particular, we propose a\nsecure multi-party proof generation algorithm where the prover can delegate its\ntask to $N $ servers, where (i) even if a group of $T \\in \\mathbb{N}$ servers,\n$T\\le N$, collude, they cannot gain any information about the secret value $v$,\n(ii) the computation complexity of each server is less than $1/(N-T)$ of the\nprover's primary computation. The design is such that we don't lose the\nefficiency of the prover's algorithm in the process of delegating the tasks to\nexternal servers.",

A new paradigm, combined with decades of research in BFT SMR\nand blockchain (namely chained-BFT, or cBFT), has emerged for directly\nconstructing blockchain protocols. Chained-BFT protocols have a unifying\npropose-vote scheme instead of multiple different voting phases with a set of\nvoting and commit rules to guarantee safety and liveness. However, distinct\nvoting and commit rules impose varying impacts on performance under different\nworkloads, network conditions, and Byzantine attacks. Therefore, a fair\ncomparison of the proposed protocols poses a challenge that has not yet been\naddressed by existing work.\n  We fill this gap by studying a family of cBFT protocols with a two-pronged\nsystematic approach. First, we present an evaluation framework, Bamboo, for\nquick prototyping of cBFT protocols and that includes helpful benchmarking\nfacilities. To validate Bamboo, we introduce an analytic model using queuing\ntheory which also offers a back-of-the-envelope guide for dissecting these\nprotocols. We build multiple cBFT protocols using Bamboo and we are the first\nto fairly compare three representatives (i.e., HotStuff, two-chain HotStuff,\nand Streamlet). We evaluated these protocols under various parameters and\nscenarios, including two Byzantine attacks that have not been widely discussed\nin the literature. Our findings reveal interesting trade-offs (e.g.,\nresponsiveness vs. forking-resilience) between different cBFT protocols and\ntheir design choices, which provide developers and researchers with insights\ninto the design and implementation of this protocol family.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that has rapidly grown in\npopularity in recent years. Usually, the complete history of Bitcoin blockchain\ndata must be queried to acquire variables with economic meaning. This task has\nrecently become increasingly difficult, as there are over 1.6 billion\nhistorical transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is thus important to\nquery Bitcoin transaction data in a way that is more efficient and provides\neconomic insights. We apply cohort analysis that interprets Bitcoin blockchain\ndata using methods developed for population data in the social sciences.\nSpecifically, we query and process the Bitcoin transaction input and output\ndata within each daily cohort. This enables us to create datasets and\nvisualizations for some key Bitcoin transaction indicators, including the daily\nlifespan distributions of spent transaction output (STXO) and the daily age\ndistributions of the cumulative unspent transaction output (UTXO). We provide a\ncomputationally feasible approach for characterizing Bitcoin transactions that\npaves the way for future economic studies of Bitcoin.",

Such versatile applicability gives incentive for more malware attacks. In\nthis paper, we propose a framework which continuously aggregates multiple user\ntrained models on non-overlapping data into single model. Specifically for\nmalware detection task, (i) we propose a novel user (local) neural network\n(LNN) which trains on local distribution and (ii) then to assure the model\nauthenticity and quality, we propose a novel smart contract which enable\naggregation process over blokchain platform. The LNN model analyzes various\nstatic and dynamic features of both malware and benign whereas the smart\ncontract verifies the malicious applications both for uploading and downloading\nprocesses in the network using stored aggregated features of local models. In\nthis way, the proposed model not only improves malware detection accuracy using\ndecentralized model network but also model efficacy with blockchain. We\nevaluate our approach with three state-of-the-art models and performed deep\nanalyses of extracted features of the relative model.",

Sharding\nis to be understood broadly as techniques for dynamically partitioning nodes in\na blockchain system into subsets (shards) that perform storage, communication,\nand computation tasks without fine-grained synchronization with each other.\nDespite much recent research on sharding blockchains, much remains to be\nexplored in the design space of these systems. Towards that aim, we conduct a\nsystematic analysis of existing sharding blockchain systems and derive a\nconceptual decomposition of their architecture into functional components and\nthe underlying assumptions about system models and attackers they are built on.\nThe functional components identified are node selection, epoch randomness, node\nassignment, intra-shard consensus, cross-shard transaction processing, shard\nreconfiguration, and motivation mechanism. We describe interfaces,\nfunctionality, and properties of each component and show how they compose into\na sharding blockchain system. For each component, we systematically review\nexisting approaches, identify potential and open problems, and propose future\nresearch directions. We focus on potential security attacks and performance\nproblems, including system throughput and latency concerns such as confirmation\ndelays. We believe our modular architectural decomposition and in-depth\nanalysis of each component, based on a comprehensive literature study, provides\na systematic basis for conceptualizing state-of-the-art sharding blockchain\nsystems, proving or improving security and performance properties of\ncomponents, and developing new sharding blockchain system designs.",

This research paper introduces\nthe development of an intelligent Threat Defense system, employing Blockchain\nFederated Learning, which seeks to fully upgrade the way passive intelligent\nsystems operate, aiming at implementing an Advanced Adaptive Cooperative\nLearning (AACL) mechanism for smart cities networks. The AACL is based on the\nmost advanced methods of computational intelligence while ensuring privacy and\nanonymity for participants and stakeholders. The proposed framework combines\nFederated Learning for the distributed and continuously validated learning of\nthe tracing algorithms. Learning is achieved through encrypted smart contracts\nwithin the blockchain technology, for unambiguous validation and control of the\nprocess. The aim of the proposed Framework is to intelligently classify smart\ncities networks traffic derived from Industrial IoT (IIoT) by Deep Content\nInspection (DCI) methods, in order to identify anomalies that are usually due\nto Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks.",

            "summary": "This thesis proposes techniques aiming to make blockchain technologies and\nsmart contract platforms practical by improving their scalability, latency, and\nprivacy. This thesis starts by presenting the design and implementation of\nChainspace, a distributed ledger that supports user defined smart contracts and\nexecute user-supplied transactions on their objects. The correct execution of\nsmart contract transactions is publicly verifiable. Chainspace is scalable by\nsharding state; it is secure against subsets of nodes trying to compromise its\nintegrity or availability properties through Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).\nThis thesis also introduces a family of replay attacks against sharded\ndistributed ledgers targeting cross-shard consensus protocols; they allow an\nattacker, with network access only, to double-spend resources with minimal\nefforts. We then build Byzcuit, a new cross-shard consensus protocol that is\nimmune to those attacks and that is tailored to run at the heart of Chainspace.\nNext, we propose FastPay, a high-integrity settlement system for pre-funded\npayments that can be used as a financial side-infrastructure for Chainspace to\nsupport low-latency retail payments. This settlement system is based on\nByzantine Consistent Broadcast as its core primitive, foregoing the expenses of\nfull atomic commit channels (consensus). The resulting system has extremely\nlow-latency for both confirmation and payment finality. Finally, this thesis\nproposes Coconut, a selective disclosure credential scheme supporting\ndistributed threshold issuance, public and private attributes,\nre-randomization, and multiple unlinkable selective attribute revelations. It\nensures authenticity and availability even when a subset of credential issuing\nauthorities are malicious or offline, and natively integrates with Chainspace\nto enable a number of scalable privacy-preserving applications.",

            "summary": "Smart contracts have been plagued by security incidents, which resulted in\nsubstantial financial losses. Given numerous research efforts in addressing the\nsecurity issues of smart contracts, we wondered how software practitioners\nbuild security into smart contracts in practice. We performed a mixture of\nqualitative and quantitative studies with 13 interviewees and 156 survey\nrespondents from 35 countries across six continents to understand\npractitioners' perceptions and practices on smart contract security. Our study\nuncovers practitioners' motivations and deterrents of smart contract security,\nas well as how security efforts and strategies fit into the development\nlifecycle. We also find that blockchain platforms have a statistically\nsignificant impact on practitioners' security perceptions and practices of\nsmart contract development. Based on our findings, we highlight future research\ndirections and provide recommendations for practitioners.",

Contracts in SigVM can emit signal events, on which other contracts\ncan listen. Once an event is triggered, corresponding handler functions are\nautomatically executed as signal transactions. We build an end-to-end\nblockchain platform SigChain and a contract language compiler SigSolid to\nrealize the potential of SigVM. Experimental results show that our benchmark\napplications can be reimplemented with SigVM in an autonomous way, eliminating\nthe dependency on unreliable mechanisms like off-chain relay servers.

            "summary": "Electing democratic representatives via voting has been a common mechanism\nsince the 17th century. However, these mechanisms raise concerns about\nfairness, privacy, vote concealment, fair calculations of tally, and proxies\nvoting on their behalf for the voters. Ballot voting, and in recent times,\nelectronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by\nrelying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols\nalso assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as\npresidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of\ndistributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \\proto.\nThere are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe\nthat these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting\nstage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN\npreserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids\ndouble voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly\nsmall. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is\ncomparable to most of the existing cost of elections.",

Ethereum's current\nfee mechanism is implemented via a first-price auction that results in\nunpredictable fees as well as other inefficiencies. EIP-1559 is a recent,\nimproved proposal that introduces a number of innovative features such as a\ndynamically adaptive base fee that is burned, instead of being paid to the\nminers. Despite intense interest in understanding its properties, several basic\nquestions such as whether and under what conditions does this protocol\nself-stabilize have remained elusive thus far.\n  We perform a thorough analysis of the resulting fee market dynamic mechanism\nvia a combination of tools from game theory and dynamical systems. We start by\nproviding bounds on the step-size of the base fee update rule that suffice for\nglobal convergence to equilibrium via Lyapunov arguments. In the negative\ndirection, we show that for larger step-sizes instability and even formally\nchaotic behavior are possible under a wide range of settings. We complement\nthese qualitative results with quantitative bounds on the resulting range of\nbase fees.

Sharing of Industrial data including\nprivate data exchange at every stage between supply chain partners helps to\nimprove product quality, enable future forecast, and enhance management\nactivities. However, the existing data sharing and querying mechanism in\nHyperledger fabric is not suitable for supply chain environment in IIoT because\nthe queries are evaluated on actual data stored on ledger which consists of\nsensitive information such as business secrets, and special discounts offered\nto retailers and individuals. To solve this problem, we propose a differential\nprivacy-based permissioned blockchain using Hyperledger fabric to enable\nprivate data sharing in supply chain in IIoT (DH-IIoT). We integrate\ndifferential privacy into the chaindcode (smart contract) of Hyperledger fabric\nto achieve privacy preservation. As a result, the query response consists of\nperturbed data which protects the sensitive information in the ledger. The\nproposed work (DH-IIoT) is evaluated by simulating a permissioned blockchain\nusing Hyperledger fabric. We compare our differential privacy integrated\nchaincode of Hyperledger fabric with the default chaincode setting of\nHyperledger fabric for supply chain scenario. The results confirm that the\nproposed work maintains 96.15% of accuracy in the shared data while guarantees\nthe protection of sensitive ledger's data.",

In order to achieve a cost-effective reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions and to combat climate change, the European Union (EU)\nintroduced an Emissions Trading System (ETS) where organizations can buy or\nreceive emission allowances as needed. The current ETS is a centralized one,\nconsisting of a set of complex rules. It is currently administered at the\norganizational level and is used for fixed-point sources of pollution such as\nfactories, power plants, and refineries. However, the current ETS cannot\nefficiently cope with vehicle mobility, even though vehicles are one of the\nprimary sources of CO2 and NOx emissions. In this study, we propose a new\ndistributed Blockchain-based emissions allowance trading system called B-ETS.\nThis system enables transparent and trustworthy data exchange as well as\ntrading of allowances among vehicles, relying on vehicle-to-vehicle\ncommunication. In addition, we introduce an economic incentive-based mechanism\nthat appeals to individual drivers and leads them to modify their driving\nbehavior in order to reduce emissions. The efficiency of the proposed system is\nstudied through extensive simulations, showing how increased vehicle\nconnectivity can lead to a reduction of the emissions generated from those\nvehicles. We demonstrate that our method can be used for full life-cycle\nmonitoring and fuel economy reporting. This leads us to conjecture that the\nproposed system could lead to important behavioral changes among the drivers",

            "summary": "Payment channel networks, such as Bitcoin's Lightning Network, promise to\nimprove the scalability of blockchain systems by processing the majority of\ntransactions off-chain. Due to the design, the positioning of nodes in the\nnetwork topology is a highly influential factor regarding the experienced\nperformance, costs, and fee revenue of network participants. As a consequence,\ntoday's Lightning Network is built around a small number of highly-connected\nhubs. Recent literature shows the centralizing tendencies to be\nincentive-compatible and at the same time detrimental to security and privacy.\nThe choice of attachment strategies therefore becomes a crucial factor for the\nfuture of such systems. In this paper, we provide an empirical study on the\n(local and global) impact of various attachment strategies for payment channel\nnetworks. To this end, we introduce candidate strategies from the field of\ngraph theory and analyze them with respect to their computational complexity as\nwell as their repercussions for end users and service providers. Moreover, we\nevaluate their long-term impact on the network topology.",

When the number of\nblockchains increases, it is difficult for blockchains to form a single star\ntopology or a fully connected topology. Meanwhile, different from legacy\nnetworks, the propagation method is required to keep the data validity. Thus,\nthe blockchain topology and associated propagation methods are two key issues,\nwhich should be ensured during the propagation. In this paper, we first propose\nthe confirmation-based propagation method to keep the validity of the\ncross-chain data. The confirmation method is to seal the cross-chain\ntransaction synchronized from other blockchains. Second, we point out that a\nvalid topology requires blockchains to be strongly connected. With this\nrequirement, we propose several topologies, which match different connection\nscenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed methods can securely\npropagate the cross-chain data and the connection way is flexible.",

In this paper, we present AGSOLT (Automated\nGenerator of Solidity Test Suites).

To test AGSOLT, we compared a random search\nalgorithm and a genetic algorithm on a set of 36 real-world smart contracts.

We compare\nconventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences\nof voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if\nwell-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite\ndifferent outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we\nobtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f\n, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f\ntakes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,\nwhile vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,\ndelegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than\nconventional voting.

            "summary": "The enormous power consumption of Bitcoin has led to undifferentiated\ndiscussions in science and practice about the sustainability of blockchain and\ndistributed ledger technology in general. However, blockchain technology is far\nfrom homogeneous - not only with regard to its applications, which now go far\nbeyond cryptocurrencies and have reached businesses and the public sector, but\nalso with regard to its technical characteristics and, in particular, its power\nconsumption. This paper summarizes the status quo of the power consumption of\nvarious implementations of blockchain technology, with special emphasis on the\nrecent 'Bitcoin Halving' and so-called 'zk-rollups'. We argue that although\nBitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains do indeed consume a lot of power,\nalternative blockchain solutions with significantly lower power consumption are\nalready available today, and new promising concepts are being tested that could\nfurther reduce in particular the power consumption of large blockchain networks\nin the near future. From this we conclude that although the criticism of\nBitcoin's power consumption is legitimate, it should not be used to derive an\nenergy problem of blockchain technology in general. In many cases in which\nprocesses can be digitised or improved with the help of more energy-efficient\nblockchain variants, one can even expect net energy savings.",

One popular example of this trend is Hyperledger\nFabric. Compared to public permissionless blockchains, it promises improved\nperformance and provides certain features that address key requirements of\nenterprises. However, also permissioned blockchains are still not as scalable\nas centralized systems, and due to the scarcity of theoretical results and\nempirical data, their real-world performance cannot be predicted with the\nnecessary precision. We intend to address this issue by conducting an in-depth\nperformance analysis of Hyperledger Fabric. The paper presents a detailed\ncompilation of various performance characteristics using an enhanced version of\nthe Distributed Ledger Performance Scan (DLPS). Researchers and practitioners\nalike can use the various performance properties identified and discussed as\nguidelines to better configure and implement their Hyperledger Fabric network.\nLikewise, they are encouraged to use the DLPS framework to conduct their\nmeasurements.",

A relevant issue within this scope is the clinical\ntrial process. Monitoring and ensuring the integrity of trial data using the\ntraditional system is not always feasible. The search for a vaccine against the\ncoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 illustrates this situation. The scientific credibility\nof findings from several vaccines' clinical trials contributed to distorted\nperceptions concerning the benefits and risks of the drug. This scenario is\nideal for applying technologies such as Blockchain and Smart Contracts in\nhealthcare issues. This paper proposes a protocol based on Smart Contracts,\nnamed VaccSC, to enable transparency, accounting, and confidentiality to Phase\nIII of vaccine experiments. The protocol was implemented in Solidity language,\nand results show that the VaccSC enables double-blindness, randomization, and\nthe auditability of clinical data, even in the presence of dishonest\nparticipants.",

The advantage for users is that the funds are not in\ncustody of a centralized external entity. However, these exchanges are prone to\nmanipulative behavior. In this paper, we illustrate how wash trading activity\ncan be identified on two of the first popular limit order book-based\ndecentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain, IDEX and EtherDelta. We\nidentify a lower bound of accounts and trading structures that meet the legal\ndefinitions of wash trading, discovering that they are responsible for a wash\ntrading volume in equivalent of 159 million U.S. Dollars. While self-trades and\ntwo-account structures are predominant, complex forms also occur. We quantify\nthese activities, finding that on both exchanges, more than 30\\% of all traded\ntokens have been subject to wash trading activity. On EtherDelta, 10% of the\ntokens have almost exclusively been wash traded. All data is made available for\nfuture research. Our findings underpin the need for countermeasures that are\napplicable in decentralized systems.",

The\nintegration of technology into society also results in an increasing desire to\ncontrol who and what has access to sensitive information, especially for\nvulnerable people including children and the elderly. With blockchain coming in\nto the picture as a technology that can revolutionise the world, it is now\npossible to have an immutable audit trail of locational data over time. By\ncontrolling the process through inexpensive equipment in the home, it is\npossible to control whom has access to such personal data. This paper presents\na blockchain based family security system for tracking the location of\nconsenting family members' smart phones. The locations of the family members'\nsmart phones are logged and stored in a private blockchain which can be\naccessed through a node installed in the family home on a computer. The data\nfor the whereabouts of family members stays within the family unit and does not\ngo to any third party. The system is implemented in a small scale (one miner\nand two other nodes) and the technical feasibility is discussed along with the\nlimitations of the system. Further research will cover the integration of the\nsystem into a smart home environment, and ethical implementations of tracking,\nespecially of vulnerable people, using the immutability of blockchain.",

            "summary": "Peer-to-peer (p2p) content delivery is promising to provide benefits like\ncost-saving and scalable peak-demand handling in comparison with conventional\ncontent delivery networks (CDNs) and complement the decentralized storage\nnetworks such as Filecoin. However, reliable p2p delivery requires proper\nenforcement of delivery fairness, i.e., the deliverers should be rewarded\naccording to their in-time delivery. Unfortunately, most existing studies on\ndelivery fairness are based on non-cooperative game-theoretic assumptions that\nare arguably unrealistic in the ad-hoc p2p setting. We for the first time put\nforth the expressive yet still minimalist securities for p2p content delivery,\nand give two efficient solutions FairDownload and FairStream via the blockchain\nfor p2p downloading and p2p streaming scenarios, respectively. Our designs not\nonly guarantee delivery fairness to ensure deliverers be paid (nearly)\nproportional to his in-time delivery, but also ensure the content consumers and\ncontent providers to be fairly treated. The fairness of each party can be\nguaranteed when the other two parties collude to arbitrarily misbehave.\nMoreover, the systems are efficient in the sense of attaining asymptotically\noptimal on-chain costs and optimal deliverer communication. We implement the\nprotocols to build the prototype systems atop the Ethereum Ropsten network.\nExtensive experiments done in LAN and WAN settings showcase their high\npracticality.",

In the past decade, blockchain\ntechnology has seen many novel applications ranging from the banking industry\nto real estate. However, in order to be adopted universally, blockchain systems\nmust be scalable to support a high volume of transactions. As we increase the\nthroughput of the DL system, the underlying peer-to-peer network might face\nmultiple levels of challenges to keep up with the requirements. Due to varying\nnetwork capacities, the slower nodes would be at a relative disadvantage\ncompared to the faster ones, which could negatively impact their revenue. In\norder to quantify their relative advantage or disadvantage, we introduce two\nmeasures of network fairness, $p_f$, the probability of frontrunning and\n$\\alpha_f$, the publishing fairness. We show that as we scale the blockchain,\nboth these measures deteriorate, implying that the slower nodes face a\ndisadvantage at higher throughputs. It results in the faster nodes getting more\nthan their fair share of the reward while the slower nodes (slow in terms of\nnetwork quality) get less. Thus, fairness and scalability in blockchain systems\ndo not go hand in hand.\n  In a setting with rational miners, lack of fairness causes miners to deviate\nfrom the \"longest chain rule\" or undercut, which would reduce the blockchain's\nresilience against byzantine adversaries. Hence, fairness is not only a\ndesirable property for a blockchain system but also essential for the security\nof the blockchain and any scalable blockchain protocol proposed must ensure\nfairness.",

            "summary": "Recent works have proposed new Byzantine consensus algorithms for blockchains\nbased on epidemics, a design which enables highly scalable performance at a low\ncost. These methods however critically depend on a secure random peer sampling\nservice: a service that provides a stream of random network nodes where no\nattacking entity can become over-represented. To ensure this security property,\ncurrent epidemic platforms use a Proof-of-Stake system to select peer samples.\nHowever such a system limits the openness of the system as only nodes with\nsignificant stake can participate in the consensus, leading to an oligopoly\nsituation. Moreover, this design introduces a complex interdependency between\nthe consensus algorithm and the cryptocurrency built upon it. In this paper, we\npropose a radically different security design for the peer sampling service,\nbased on the distribution of IP addresses to prevent Sybil attacks. We propose\na new algorithm, $\\scriptstyle{BASALT}$, that implements our design using a\nstubborn chaotic search to counter attackers' attempts at becoming\nover-represented. We show in theory and using Monte Carlo simulations that\n$\\scriptstyle{BASALT}$ provides samples which are extremely close to the\noptimal distribution even in adversarial scenarios such as tentative Eclipse\nattacks. Live experiments on a production cryptocurrency platform confirm that\nthe samples obtained using $\\scriptstyle{BASALT}$ are equitably distributed\namongst nodes, allowing for a system which is both open and where no single\nentity can gain excessive power.",

This\nposition paper elaborates on the theory of distributed systems to advance a\nclear definition of blockchain that allows us to clarify its role in the IoT.\nThis definition inextricably binds together three elements that, as a whole,\nprovide the blockchain with those unique features that distinguish it from\nother distributed ledger technologies: immutability, transparency and\nanonimity. We note however that immutability comes at the expense of remarkable\nresource consumption, transparency demands no confidentiality and anonymity\nprevents user identification and registration. This is in stark contrast to the\nrequirements of most IoT applications that are made up of resource constrained\ndevices, whose data need to be kept confidential and users to be clearly known.\nBuilding on the proposed definition, we derive new guidelines for selecting the\nproper distributed ledger technology depending on application requirements and\ntrust models, identifying common pitfalls leading to improper applications of\nthe blockchain.

We embrace the simplicity through two steps: first, we formulate a\nsimple runtime mechanism to deal with conflicts called concurrency delegation.\nThis method is much simpler and has less overhead, particularly in scenarios\nwhere conflicting transactions are relatively rare. Moreover, to further reduce\nthe number of conflicting transactions, we propose using static annotations\nattached to each transaction, provided by the programmer. These annotations are\npseudo-static: they are static with respect to the lifetime of the transaction,\nand therefore are free to use information such as the origin and parameters of\nthe transaction. We propose a distributor component that can use the output of\nthis pseudo-static annotations and use them to effectively distribute\ntransactions between threads in the least-conflicting way. We name the outcome\nof a system combining concurrency delegation and pseudo-static annotations as\nSonicChain. We evaluate SonicChain for both validation and authoring tasks\nagainst a common workload in blockchains, namely, balance transfers, and\nobserve that it performs expectedly well while introducing very little overhead\nand additional complexity to the system.",

Using first-party empirical data to\nanalyze behavior and establish predictions yields us the ability to base\nin-depth analyses on particular individuals and reduce our dependence on\ngeneralizations. Modern mobile and embedded devices provide a wealth of sensors\nand means for collecting and tracking individualized data. Applying these\nassets to the realm of insurance (which is a statistically backed endeavor at\nheart) is certainly nothing new; yet doing so in a way that is privacy-driven\nand secure has not been a central focus of implementers. Existing data-driven\ninsurance technologies require a certain level of trust in the data tracking\nagency (i.e. insurer) to not misuse, mishandle, or over-collect user data.\nSmart contracts and blockchain technology provide us an opportunity to\nre-balance these systems such that the blockchain itself is a trusted agent\nwhich both insurers and the insured can confide in. We propose a \"Smart Auto\nInsurance\" system that minimizes data sharing while simultaneously providing\nquality-of-life improvements to both sides.

            "summary": "Modern mathematics is built on the idea that proofs should be translatable\ninto formal proofs, whose validity is an objective question, decidable by a\ncomputer. Yet, in practice, proofs are informal and may omit many details. An\nagent considers a proof valid if they trust that it could be expanded into a\nmachine-verifiable proof. A proof's validity can thus become a subjective\nmatter and lead to a debate, which may be difficult to settle. Hence, while the\nconcept of valid proof is well-defined, the process to establish validity is\nitself a complex multi-agent problem.\n  We introduce the SPRIG protocol. SPRIG allows agents to propose and verify\nsuccinct and informative proofs in a decentralized fashion; the trust is\nestablished by agents being able to request more details in the proof steps;\ndebates, if they arise, must isolate details of proofs and, if they persist, go\ndown to machine-level details, where they are automatically settled. A\nstructure of bounties and stakes is set to incentivize agents to act in good\nfaith.\n  We propose a game-theoretic discussion of SPRIG, showing how agents with\nvarious types of information interact, leading to a proof tree with an\nappropriate level of detail and to the invalidation of wrong proofs, and we\ndiscuss resilience against various attacks. We then analyze a simplified model,\ncharacterize its equilibria and compute the agents' level of trust.\n  SPRIG is designed to run as a smart contract on a blockchain platform. This\nallows anonymous agents to participate in the verification debate, and to\ncontribute with their information. The smart contract mediates the\ninteractions, settles debates, and guarantees that bounties and stakes are paid\nas specified.\n  SPRIG enables new applications, such as the issuance of bounties for open\nproblems, and the creation of derivatives markets, allowing agents to inject\nmore information pertaining to proofs.",

However, independent of the amount being sent, public blockchain-based\ncryptocurrencies suffer from high transaction waiting times and fees. These\ndrawbacks hinder the wide use of cryptocurrencies by masses. To address these\nchallenges, payment channel network concept is touted as the most viable\nsolution to be used for micro-payments. The idea is exchanging the ownership of\nmoney by keeping the state of the accounts locally. The users inform the\nblockchain rarely, which decreases the load on the blockchain. Specifically,\npayment channel networks can provide transaction approvals in seconds by\ncharging a nominal fee proportional to the payment amount. Such attraction on\npayment channel networks inspired many recent studies which focus on how to\ndesign them and allocate channels such that the transactions will be secure and\nefficient. However, as payment channel networks are emerging and reaching large\nnumber of users, privacy issues are becoming more relevant that raise concerns\nabout exposing not only individual habits but also businesses' revenues. In\nthis paper, we first propose a categorization of the existing payment networks\nformed on top of blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies. After discussing several\nemerging attacks on user/business privacy in these payment channel networks, we\nqualitatively evaluate them based on a number of privacy metrics that relate to\nour case.

Numerous solutions have been proposed since the\nemergence of Bitcoin to achieve this goal.

Therefore, in this paper, we critically review the existing\nintegration approaches and cryptocurrency designs that strive to enable\nmicro-payments among consumer devices. We identify and discuss solutions under\nthree main categories; direct integration, payment channel network and new\ncryptocurrency design. The first approach utilizes a full node to interact with\nthe payment system. Offline channel payment is suggested as a second layer\nsolution to solve the scalability issue and enable instant payment with low\nfee. New designs converge to semi-centralized scheme and focuson lightweight\nconsensus protocol that does not require highcomputation power which might mean\nloosening the initial designchoices in favor of scalability.

In a malicious reorg, an attacker withholds their blocks and\nattestations before releasing them at an opportune time in order to force a\nchain reorganization, which they can take advantage of by double-spending or\nfront-running transactions. To execute a finality delay an attacker uses\ndelayed block releases and withholding of attestations to increase the mean and\nvariance of the time it takes blocks to become finalized. This impacts the\nefficiency and predictability of the system. We provide a probabilistic and\ncost analysis for each of these attacks, considering a validator with 30% of\nthe total stake.",

            "summary": "With the rapid development of blockchain, Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols\nhave attracted revived interest recently. To overcome the theoretical bounds of\nByzantine fault tolerance, many protocols attempt to use Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE) to prevent equivocation and improve performance and\nscalability. However, due to the broken quorum intersection assumption caused\nby the reduction of the replica number, the improvement is mostly at the cost\nof increased communication complexity which prevents existing TEE-based\nprotocols to be applied to large-scale blockchain systems. In this paper, we\npropose TBFT, an efficient Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol in the partial\nsynchrony setting, which has O(n) message complexity in both normal-case and\nview-change. Compared to previous protocols, TBFT uses TEE-assisted primitives\nto limit more types of malicious behaviors of replicas rather than preventing\nequivocation only, thereby reducing the latency and communication complexity of\nclients and replicas. Besides, we also introduce lightweight cryptographic\nprimitives including a novel leader election mechanism and an efficient voting\nmessage aggregation mechanism for better security and performance. We evaluate\nTBFT via systematic analysis and experiments, and the results show that TBFT\nhas better performance and scalability compared to other protocols.",

We show that the distribution of shortest paths in\nsuch a network can be modeled using a normal distribution\n$\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2).$ We determine statistical estimators for\n$\\mu,\\sigma$ via multivariate models.

Therefore, integrating blockchain\nin a decentralized VPP network emerged as a new paradigm, and recent\nexperiments over this integration have shown fruitful results. However, this\ndecentralization also suffers with energy management, trust, reliability, and\nefficiency issues due to the dynamic nature of DERs. In order to overcome this,\nin this paper, we first work over providing an efficient energy management\nstrategy for VPP to enhance demand response, then we propose an energy oriented\ntrading and block mining protocol and name it as proof of energy market (PoEM).\nTo enhance it further, we integrate differential privacy in PoEM and propose a\nPrivate PoEM (PPoEM) model.

Such an approach further exacerbates cybersecurity concerns constantly\nraised by numerous incidents of security and privacy attacks resulting in data\nleakage and identity theft, among others. These have, in turn, forced the\ncreation of stricter security and privacy-related regulations and have eroded\nthe trust in cyberspace. In particular, security-related services and\ninfrastructures, such as Certificate Authorities (CAs) that provide digital\ncertificate services and Third-Party Authorities (TPAs) that provide\ncryptographic key services, are critical components for establishing trust in\ncrypto-based privacy-preserving applications and services. To address such\ntrust issues, various transparency frameworks and approaches have been recently\nproposed in the literature. This paper proposes TAB framework that provides\ntransparency and trustworthiness of third-party authority and third-party\nfacilities using blockchain techniques for emerging crypto-based\nprivacy-preserving applications. TAB employs the Ethereum blockchain as the\nunderlying public ledger and also includes a novel smart contract to automate\naccountability with an incentive mechanism that motivates users to participate\nin auditing, and punishes unintentional or malicious behaviors. We implement\nTAB and show through experimental evaluation in the Ethereum official test\nnetwork, Rinkeby, that the framework is efficient.

These bounds hold for infinite-horizon executions and\ndecay exponentially with the security parameter. In particular, we show that\nthe longest-chain protocol has good security guarantees when delays are\nsporadically large and possibly unbounded, which is reflective of real-world\nnetwork conditions.",

Drone missions will increasingly rely on drone collaboration, which\nrequires the drones to reduce communication complexity and be controlled in a\ndecentralized fashion. Blockchain technology becomes a must in industrial\napplications because it provides decentralized data, accessibility,\nimmutability, and irreversibility. Therefore, Blockchain makes data public for\nall drones and enables drones to log information concerning world states, time,\nlocation, resources, delivery data, and drone relation to all neighbors drones.\nThis paper introduces decentralized independent multi-drones to accomplish the\ntask collaboratively. Improving blockchain with a consensus algorithm can\nimprove network partitioning and scalability in order to combat COVID-19. The\nmulti-drones task is to combat COVID-19 via monitoring and detecting, social\ndistancing, sanitization, data analysis, delivering goods and medical supplies,\nand announcement while avoiding collisions with one another. We discuss End to\nEnd (E2E) delivery application of combination blockchain and multi-drone in\ncombating COVID-19 and beyond future pandemics.

We apply this consensus algorithm to construct a high-performance\nblockchain system, called \\textit{Sphinx}. We implement the system with 32k+\nlines of code including all components like consensus/P2P/ledger/etc. The\nevaluations show that Sphinx can reach a peak throughput of 43k TPS (with 8\nfull nodes), which is significantly faster than current blockchain systems such\nas Ethereum given the same experimental environment.

These\nplatforms are autonomously managed by users using decentralized consensus\nprotocols in a cryptocurrency ecosystem. The deep integration of social\nnetworks and blockchains in these platforms provides potential for numerous\ncross-domain research studies that are of interest to both the research\ncommunities. However, it is challenging to process and analyze large volumes of\nraw Steemit data as it requires specialized skills in both software engineering\nand blockchain systems and involves substantial efforts in extracting and\nfiltering various types of operations. To tackle this challenge, we collect\nover 38 million blocks generated in Steemit during a 45 month time period from\n2016/03 to 2019/11 and extract ten key types of operations performed by the\nusers. The results generate SteemOps, a new dataset that organizes more than\n900 million operations from Steemit into three sub-datasets namely (i)\nsocial-network operation dataset (SOD), (ii) witness-election operation dataset\n(WOD) and (iii) value-transfer operation dataset (VOD).

Particularly, we first introduce a\nfederated-blockchain system together with a cross-chain transfer protocol to\nfacilitate the secure and decentralized transfer of tokens between chains. We\nthen develop a novel PoS-based consensus mechanism for FedChain, which can\nsatisfy strict security requirements, prevent various blockchain-specific\nattacks, and achieve a more desirable performance compared to those of other\nexisting consensus mechanisms. Moreover, a Stackelberg game model is developed\nto examine and address the problem of centralization in the FedChain system.\nFurthermore, the game model can enhance the security and performance of\nFedChain. By analyzing interactions between the stakeholders and chain\noperators, we can prove the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium and find\nthe exact formula for this equilibrium. These results are especially important\nfor the stakeholders to determine their best investment strategies and for the\nchain operators to design the optimal policy to maximize their benefits and\nsecurity protection for FedChain. Simulations results then clearly show that\nthe FedChain framework can help stakeholders to maximize their profits and the\nchain operators to design appropriate parameters to enhance FedChain's security\nand performance.",

            "summary": "The paths leading to future networks are pointing towards a data-driven\nparadigm to better cater to the explosive growth of mobile services as well as\nthe increasing heterogeneity of mobile devices, many of which generate and\nconsume large volumes and variety of data. These paths are also hampered by\nsignificant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning,\nand network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building\ndistributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a\ndistributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology\nof cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in\ncomputer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is\nconsidered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and\nanalytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network\ncontrol, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many\nimportant challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain\ncan be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a\nsurvey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain\ntechnologies in computer networks, and identify challenges and potential\nsolutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs. We identify\napplication scenarios in which future blockchain-empowered DDNs could improve\nthe efficiency and security, and generally the effectiveness of network\nservices.",

Such solutions allow\nblockchains to support asset and data transfer, resulting in the development of\ninnovative applications.\n  This paper proposes a novel blockchain interoperability solution for\npermissioned blockchains based on the publish/subscribe architecture. We\nimplemented a prototype of this platform to show the feasibility of our design.\nWe evaluate our solution by implementing examples of the different publisher\nand subscriber networks, such as Hyperledger Besu, which is an Ethereum client,\nand two different versions of Hyperledger Fabric. We present a performance\nanalysis of the whole network that indicates its limits and bottlenecks.\nFinally, we discuss the extensibility and scalability of the platform in\ndifferent scenarios. Our evaluation shows that our system can handle a\nthroughput in the order of the hundreds of transactions per second.",

            "summary": "Pool block withholding attack is performed among mining pools in digital\ncryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Instead of mining honestly, pools can be\nincentivized to infiltrate their own miners into other pools. These\ninfiltrators report partial solutions but withhold full solutions, share block\nrewards but make no contribution to block mining. The block withholding attack\namong mining pools can be modeled as a non-cooperative game called \"the miner's\ndilemm\", which reduces effective mining power in the system and leads to\npotential systemic instability in the blockchain. However, existing literature\non the game-theoretic properties of this attack only gives a preliminary\nanalysis, e.g., an upper bound of 3 for the pure price of anarchy (PPoA) in\nthis game, with two pools involved and no miner betraying. Pure price of\nanarchy is a measurement of how much mining power is wasted in the miner's\ndilemma game. Further tightening its upper bound will bring us more insight\ninto the structure of this game, so as to design mechanisms to reduce the\nsystemic loss caused by mutual attacks. In this paper, we give a tight bound of\n(1, 2] for the pure price of anarchy. Moreover, we show the tight bound holds\nin a more general setting, in which infiltrators may betray.We also prove the\nexistence and uniqueness of pure Nash equilibrium in this setting. Inspired by\nexperiments on the game among three mining pools, we conjecture that similar\nresults hold in the N-player miner's dilemma game (N>=2).",

            "summary": "Blockchain technology has been envisaged to commence an era of decentralised\napplications and services (DApps) without the need for a trusted intermediary.\nSuch DApps open a marketplace in which services are delivered to end-users by\ncontributors which are then incentivised by cryptocurrencies in an automated,\npeer-to-peer, and trustless fashion. However, blockchain, consolidated by smart\ncontracts, only ensures on-chain data security, autonomy and integrity of the\nbusiness logic execution defined in smart contracts. It cannot guarantee the\nquality of service of DApps, which entirely depends on the services'\nperformance. Thus, there is a critical need for a trust system to reduce the\nrisk of dealing with fraudulent counterparts in a blockchain network. These\nreasons motivate us to develop a fully decentralised trust framework deployed\non top of a blockchain platform, operating along with DApps in the marketplace\nto demoralise deceptive entities while encouraging trustworthy ones. The trust\nsystem works as an underlying decentralised service providing a feedback\nmechanism for end-users and maintaining trust relationships among them in the\necosystem accordingly. We believe this research fortifies the DApps ecosystem\nby introducing an universal trust middleware for DApps as well as shedding\nlight on the implementation of a decentralised trust system.",

            "summary": "Decentralization has been widely acknowledged as a core virtue of\nblockchains. However, in the past, there have been few measurement studies on\nmeasuring and comparing the actual level of decentralization between existing\nblockchains using multiple metrics and granularities. This paper presents a new\ncomparison study of the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the\ntwo most prominent blockchains, with various decentralization metrics and\ndifferent granularities within the time dimension. Specifically, we measure the\ndegree of decentralization in the two blockchains during 2019 by computing the\ndistribution of mining power with three metrics (Gini coefficient, Shannon\nentropy, and Nakamoto coefficient) as well as three granularities (days, weeks,\nand months). Our measurement results with different metrics and granularities\nreveal the same trend that, compared with each other, the degree of\ndecentralization in Bitcoin is higher, while the degree of decentralization in\nEthereum is more stable. To obtain the cross-interval information missed in the\nfixed window based measurements, we propose the sliding window based\nmeasurement approach. The corresponding results demonstrate that the use of\nsliding windows could reveal additional cross-interval information overlooked\nby the fixed window based measurements, thus enhancing the effectiveness of\nmeasuring decentralization in terms of continuous trends and abnormal\nsituations. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can\nfacilitate future studies of decentralization in blockchains.",

            "summary": "Federated Learning is a promising machine learning paradigm when multiple\nparties collaborate to build a high-quality machine learning model.\nNonetheless, these parties are only willing to participate when given enough\nincentives, such as a fair reward based on their contributions. Many studies\nexplored Shapley value based methods to evaluate each party's contribution to\nthe learned model. However, they commonly assume a semi-trusted server to train\nthe model and evaluate the data owners' model contributions, which lacks\ntransparency and may hinder the success of federated learning in practice. In\nthis work, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework and a\nprotocol to transparently evaluate each participant's contribution. Our\nframework protects all parties' privacy in the model building phase and\ntransparently evaluates contributions based on the model updates. The\nexperiment with the handwritten digits dataset demonstrates that the proposed\nmethod can effectively evaluate the contributions.",

            "summary": "This paper presents an architecture of a Personal Information Management\nSystem, in which individuals can define the access to their personal data by\nmeans of smart contracts. These smart contracts, running on the Ethereum\nblockchain, implement access control lists and grant immutability, traceability\nand verifiability of the references to personal data, which is stored itself in\na (possibly distributed) file system. A distributed authorization mechanism is\ndevised, where trust from multiple network nodes is necessary to grant the\naccess to the data. To this aim, two possible alternatives are described: a\nSecret Sharing scheme and Threshold Proxy Re-Encryption scheme. The performance\nof these alternatives is experimentally compared in terms of execution time.\nThreshold Proxy Re-Encryption appears to be faster in different scenarios, in\nparticular when increasing message size, number of nodes and the threshold\nvalue, i.e. number of nodes needed to grant the data disclosure.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we propose a polar coding based scheme for set reconciliation\nbetween two network nodes. The system is modeled as a well-known Slepian-Wolf\nsetting induced by a fixed number of deletions. The set reconciliation process\nis divided into two phases: 1) a deletion polar code is employed to help one\nnode to identify the possible deletion indices, which may be larger than the\nnumber of genuine deletions; 2) a lossless compression polar code is then\ndesigned to feedback those indices with minimum overhead. Our scheme can be\nviewed as a generalization of polar codes to some emerging network-based\napplications such as the package synchronization in blockchains. Some\nconnections with the existing schemes based on the invertible Bloom lookup\ntables (IBLTs) and network coding are also observed and briefly discussed.",

            "summary": "Blockchain is built on a peer-to-peer network that relies on frequent\ncommunications among the distributively located nodes. In particular, the\nconsensus mechanisms (CMs), which play a pivotal role in blockchain, are\ncommunication resource-demanding and largely determines blockchain security\nbound and other key performance metrics such as transaction throughput, latency\nand scalability. Most blockchain systems are designed in a stable wired\ncommunication network running in advanced devices under the assumption of\nsufficient communication resource provision. However, it is envisioned that the\nmajority of the blockchain node peers will be connected through the wireless\nnetwork in the future. Constrained by the highly dynamic wireless channel and\nscarce frequency spectrum, communication can significantly affect blockchain's\nkey performance metrics. Hence, in this paper, we present wireless blockchain\nnetworks (WBN) under various commonly used CMs and we answer the question of\nhow much communication resource is needed to run such a network. We first\npresent the role of communication in the four stages of the blockchain\nprocedure. We then discuss the relationship between the communication resource\nprovision and the WBNs performance, for three of the most used blockchain CMs\nnamely, Proof-of-Work (PoW), practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) and\nRaft. Finally, we provide analytical and simulated results to show the impact\nof the communication resource provision on blockchain performance.",

This paper proposes Reactive Routing and Payment Protocol (R2P2) to\nincentivise mobile devices to contribute idle networking resources and gain\nmonetary returns. The routing and payment protocol is developed for Named-Data\nNetwork (NDN) because its content-centric nature can better support the\nintermittent and ephemeral communication requirements in ad-hoc networks.\nBlockchain is used as the settlement platform for transactions between devices\nbecause of its neutrality, robustness and trust. R2P2 is still an on-going\nproject. The content of this paper focuses on the design of R2P2.",

            "summary": "Private blockchain networks are used by enterprises to manage decentralized\nprocesses without trusted mediators and without exposing their assets publicly\non an open network like Ethereum. Yet external parties that cannot join such\nnetworks may have a compelling need to be informed about certain data items on\ntheir shared ledgers along with certifications of data authenticity; e.g., a\nmortgage bank may need to know about the sale of a mortgaged property from a\nnetwork managing property deeds. These parties are willing to compensate the\nnetworks in exchange for privately sharing information with proof of\nauthenticity and authorization for external use. We have devised a novel and\ncryptographically secure protocol to effect a fair exchange between rational\nnetwork members and information recipients using a public blockchain and atomic\nswap techniques. Using our protocol, any member of a private blockchain can\natomically reveal private blockchain data with proofs in exchange for a\nmonetary reward to an external party if and only if the external party is a\nvalid recipient. The protocol preserves confidentiality of data for the\nrecipient, and in addition, allows it to mount a challenge if the data turns\nout to be inauthentic. We also formally analyze the security and privacy of\nthis protocol, which can be used in a wide array of practical scenarios",

Indeed, the process, which is very\ncostly in terms of time and intellectual investment, not only is not\nremunerated by the journals but is also not openly recognized by the academic\ncommunity as a relevant scientific output for a researcher. Therefore,\nscientific dissemination is affected in timeliness, quality, and fairness.\nHere, to solve this issue, we propose a blockchain-based incentive system that\nrewards scientists for peer-reviewing other scientists' work and that builds up\ntrust and reputation. We designed a privacy-oriented protocol of smart\ncontracts called Ants-Review that allows authors to issue a bounty for open\nanonymous peer-reviews on Ethereum. If requirements are met, peer-reviews will\nbe accepted and paid by the approver proportionally to their assessed quality.\nTo promote ethical behavior and inclusiveness the system implements a gamified\nmechanism that allows the whole community to evaluate the peer-reviews and vote\nfor the best ones.",

It also supports the execution of code through\nblockchain's smart contracts, adding automation of actions to the network with\nhigh trustability. However, as smart contracts are visible by anybody on the\nnetwork, the business data and logic may be at risk, thus companies could be\nreluctant to use such technology. This paper aims to propose a pattern that\nallows the execution of automatable legal contract clauses, where its execution\nstates are stored in an on-chain smart-contract and the logic needed to enforce\nit wraps it off-chain. An engine completes this pattern by running a business\nprocess that corresponds to the legal contract. We then propose a pattern-based\nsolution based on a real-life use case: transportation of refrigerated goods.\nWe argue that this pattern guarantees companies pseudonymity and data\nconfidentiality while ensuring that an audit trail can be reconstituted through\nthe blockchain smart-contract to identify misbehavior or errors.

            "summary": "We present Saguaro, a permissioned blockchain system designed specifically\nfor edge computing networks. Saguaro leverages the hierarchical structure of\nedge computing networks to reduce the overhead of wide-area communication by\npresenting several techniques. First, Saguaro proposes coordinator-based and\noptimistic protocols to process cross-domain transactions with low latency\nwhere the lowest common ancestor of the involved domains coordinates the\nprotocol or detects inconsistency. Second, data are collected over hierarchy\nenabling higher-level domains to aggregate their sub-domain data. Finally,\ntransactions initiated by mobile edge devices are processed without relying on\nhigh-level fog and cloud servers. Our experimental results across a wide range\nof workloads demonstrate the scalability of Saguaro in supporting a range of\ncross-domain and mobile transactions.",

However,\nits scalability still has limitations in terms of throughput and broadcast\ndelay as the network and the amount of transaction data increase. To improve\nscalability of blockchain networks, we propose a novel approach named PiChu\nthat accelerates block propagation in blockchain networks by pipelining and\nverifying chunks of a block in parallel. Accelerating block propagation reduces\nthe mining interval and chance of fork occurring, which in turn increases\nthroughput. Our approach can be applied to the blockchain networks either\ndirectly or with a minor modification to the consensus. Through an extensive\nand large scale simulations, we validate that the proposed PiChu scheme\nsignificantly enhances the scalability of blockchain networks. For instance, a\n64 MB block can be broadcasted in just 80 seconds in a blockchain network with\na million nodes. The efficiency of PiChu broadcasting increases with bigger\nblock sizes and a larger number of nodes in the network.",

In general, the\nquestion is to identify which countries are offering the most suitable\nconditions to host their blockchain-based activities and implement their\ninnovative projects. The Blockchain Readiness Index (BRI) provides a numerical\nmetric (referred to as the blockchain readiness score) in measuring the\nmaturity/readiness levels of a country in adopting blockchain and\ncryptocurrencies. In doing so, BRI leverages on techniques from information\nretrieval to algorithmically derive an index ranking for a set of countries.\nThe index considers a range of indicators organized under five pillars:\nGovernment Regulation, Research, Technology, Industry, and User Engagement. In\nthis paper, we further extent BRI with the capability of deriving the index -\nat the country level - even in the presence of missing information for the\nindicators. In doing so, we are proposing two weighting schemes namely, linear\nand sigmoid weighting for refining the initial estimates for the indicator\nvalues.

            "summary": "Consensus protocols have traditionally been studied in a setting where all\nparticipants are known to each other from the start of the protocol execution.\nIn the parlance of the 'blockchain' literature, this is referred to as the\npermissioned setting. What differentiates Bitcoin from these previously studied\nprotocols is that it operates in a permissionless setting, i.e. it is a\nprotocol for establishing consensus over an unknown network of participants\nthat anybody can join, with as many identities as they like in any role. The\narrival of this new form of protocol brings with it many questions. Beyond\nBitcoin, what can we prove about permissionless protocols in a general sense?\nHow does recent work on permissionless protocols in the blockchain literature\nrelate to the well-developed history of research on permissioned protocols in\ndistributed computing?\n  To answer these questions, we describe a formal framework for the analysis of\nboth permissioned and permissionless systems. Our framework allows for\n\"apples-to-apples\" comparisons between different categories of protocols and,\nin turn, the development of theory to formally discuss their relative merits. A\nmajor benefit of the framework is that it facilitates the application of a rich\nhistory of proofs and techniques in distributed computing to problems in\nblockchain and the study of permissionless systems. Within our framework, we\nthen address the questions above. We consider the Byzantine Generals Problem as\na formalisation of the problem of reaching consensus, and address a programme\nof research that asks, \"Under what adversarial conditions, and for what types\nof permissionless protocol, is consensus possible?\" We prove a number of\nresults for this programme, our main result being that deterministic consensus\nis not possible for decentralised permissionless protocols. To close, we give a\nlist of eight open questions.",

However, relying on a\ncentralized server for model aggregation, standard FL is vulnerable to server\nmalfunctions, untrustworthy server, and external attacks. To address this\nissue, we propose a decentralized FL framework by integrating blockchain into\nFL, namely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL). In\na round of the proposed BLADE-FL, each client broadcasts the trained model to\nother clients, aggregates its own model with received ones, and then competes\nto generate a block before its local training of the next round. We evaluate\nthe learning performance of BLADE-FL, and develop an upper bound on the global\nloss function. Then we verify that this bound is convex with respect to the\nnumber of overall aggregation rounds K, and optimize the computing resource\nallocation for minimizing the upper bound. We also note that there is a\ncritical problem of training deficiency, caused by lazy clients who plagiarize\nothers' trained models and add artificial noises to disguise their cheating\nbehaviors. Focusing on this problem, we explore the impact of lazy clients on\nthe learning performance of BLADE-FL, and characterize the relationship among\nthe optimal K, the learning parameters, and the proportion of lazy clients.\nBased on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we show that the experimental\nresults are consistent with the analytical ones. To be specific, the gap\nbetween the developed upper bound and experimental results is lower than 5%,\nand the optimized K based on the upper bound can effectively minimize the loss\nfunction.",

            "summary": "In this work, we consider community detection in blockchain networks. We\nspecifically take the Bitcoin network and Ethereum network as two examples,\nwhere community detection serves in different ways. For the Bitcoin network, we\nmodify the traditional community detection method and apply it to the\ntransaction social network to cluster users with similar characteristics. For\nthe Ethereum network, on the other hand, we define a bipartite social graph\nbased on the smart contract transactions. A novel community detection algorithm\nwhich is designed for low-rank signals on graph can help find users'\ncommunities based on user-token subscription. Based on these results, two\nstrategies are devised to deliver on-chain advertisements to those users in the\nsame community. We implement the proposed algorithms on real data. By adopting\nthe modified clustering algorithm, the community results in the Bitcoin network\nis basically consistent with the ground-truth of betting site community which\nhas been announced to the public. At the meanwhile, we run the proposed\nstrategy on real Ethereum data, visualize the results and implement an\nadvertisement delivery on the Ropsten test net.",

By mid-decade, with full\ncountry wide deployment, there will be almost 1.3 billion smart meters in place\n[1]. Collection of fine grained energy usage data by these smart meters\nprovides numerous advantages such as energy savings for customers with use of\ndemand optimization, a billing system of higher accuracy with dynamic pricing\nprograms, bidirectional information exchange ability between end-users for\nbetter consumer-operator interaction, and so on. However, all these perks\nassociated with fine grained energy usage data collection threaten the privacy\nof users. With this technology, customers' personal data such as sleeping\ncycle, number of occupants, and even type and number of appliances stream into\nthe hands of the utility companies and can be subject to misuse. This research\npaper addresses privacy violation of consumers' energy usage data collected\nfrom smart meters and provides a novel solution for the privacy protection\nwhile allowing benefits of energy data analytics. First, we demonstrate the\nsuccessful application of occupancy detection attacks using a deep neural\nnetwork method that yields high accuracy results. We then introduce Adversarial\nMachine Learning Occupancy Detection Avoidance with Blockchain (AMLODA-B)\nframework as a counter-attack by deploying an algorithm based on the Long Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) model into the standardized smart metering infrastructure to\nprevent leakage of consumers personal information. Our privacy-aware approach\nprotects consumers' privacy without compromising the correctness of billing and\npreserves operational efficiency without use of authoritative intermediaries.",

This leaves the following research questions we\naddress in this paper: (1) are conventional (i.e., order books), secure (i.e.,\nresistant to front-running and price manipulation) and fully decentralized\nexchanges feasible on a public blockchain like Ethereum, (2) what is the\nperformance profile, and (3) how much do Layer 2 techniques (e.g., Arbitrum)\nincrease performance? To answer these questions, we implement, benchmark, and\nexperiment with an Ethereum-based call market exchange called Lissy.

Similarly, smart contracts began to carry more value, making them\nappealing targets for attackers. As a result, they started to become victims of\nattacks, costing millions of dollars. In response to these attacks, both\nacademia and industry proposed a plethora of tools to scan smart contracts for\nvulnerabilities before deploying them on the blockchain. However, most of these\ntools solely focus on detecting vulnerabilities and not attacks, let alone\nquantifying or tracing the number of stolen assets. In this paper, we present\nHorus, a framework that empowers the automated detection and investigation of\nsmart contract attacks based on logic-driven and graph-driven analysis of\ntransactions. Horus provides quick means to quantify and trace the flow of\nstolen assets across the Ethereum blockchain. We perform a large-scale analysis\nof all the smart contracts deployed on Ethereum until May 2020. We identified\n1,888 attacked smart contracts and 8,095 adversarial transactions in the wild.\nOur investigation shows that the number of attacks did not necessarily decrease\nover the past few years, but for some vulnerabilities remained constant.\nFinally, we also demonstrate the practicality of our framework via an in-depth\nanalysis on the recent Uniswap and Lendf.me attacks.",

            "summary": "Modern blockchains support a variety of distributed applications beyond\ncryptocurrencies, including smart contracts -- which let users execute\narbitrary code in a distributed and decentralized fashion. Regardless of their\nintended application, blockchain platforms implicitly assume consensus for the\ncorrect execution of a smart contract, thus requiring that all transactions are\ntotally ordered. It was only recently recognized that consensus is not\nnecessary to prevent double-spending in a cryptocurrency (Guerraoui et al.,\nPODC'19), contrary to common belief. This result suggests that current\nimplementations may be sacrificing efficiency and scalability because they\nsynchronize transactions much more tightly than actually needed. In this work,\nwe study the synchronization requirements of Ethereum's ERC20 token contract,\none of the most widely adopted smart contacts. Namely, we model a\nsmart-contract token as a concurrent object and analyze its consensus number as\na measure of synchronization power. We show that the richer set of methods\nsupported by ERC20 tokens, compared to standard cryptocurrencies, results in\nstrictly stronger synchronization requirements. More surprisingly, the\nsynchronization power of ERC20 tokens depends on the object's state and can\nthus be modified by method invocations. To prove this result, we develop a\ndedicated framework to express how the object's state affects the needed\nsynchronization level. Our findings indicate that ERC20 tokens, as well as\nother token standards, are more powerful and versatile than plain\ncryptocurrencies, and are subject to dynamic requirements. Developing specific\nsynchronization protocols that exploit these dynamic requirements will pave the\nway towards more robust and scalable blockchain platforms.",

For example, a rational miner with a 10% hashrate will fork Ethereum\nif a BEV opportunity exceeds 4x the block reward.\n  However, related work is currently missing quantitative insights on past BEV\nextraction to assess the practical risks of BEV objectively. In this work, we\nallow to quantify the BEV danger by deriving the USD extracted from sandwich\nattacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange arbitrage. We estimate that\nover 32 months, BEV yielded 540.54M USD in profit, divided among 11,289\naddresses when capturing 49,691 cryptocurrencies and 60,830 on-chain markets.\nThe highest BEV instance we find amounts to 4.1M USD, 616.6x the Ethereum block\nreward.\n  Moreover, while the practitioner's community has discussed the existence of\ngeneralized trading bots, we are, to our knowledge, the first to provide a\nconcrete algorithm.

With a shifting marker of the Genesis Block, data can be\ndeleted from the beginning of a blockchain. In this way, the technology of the\nblockchain becomes fully transactional. The concept is independent of a\nspecific block structure, network structure, or consensus algorithm. Moreover,\nthis functionality can be adapted to current blockchains to solve multiple\nproblems related to scalability. This approach enables the transfer of\nblockchain technology to further fields of application, among others in the\narea of Industry 4.0 and Product Life-cycle Management.",

            "summary": "The private chain-based Internet of Things (IoT) system ensures the security\nof cross-organizational data sharing. As a widely used consensus model in\nprivate chains, the leader-based state-machine replication (SMR) model meets\nthe performance bottleneck in IoT blockchain applications, where\nnontransactional sensor data are generated on a scale. We analyzed IoT private\nchain systems and found that the leader maintains too many connections due to\nhigh latency and client request frequency, which results in lower consensus\nperformance and efficiency.\n  To meet this challenge, we propose a novel solution for maintaining low\nrequest latency and high transactions per second (TPS): replicate\nnontransactional data by followers and confirm by the leader to achieve\nnonconfliction SMR, rather than all by the leader. Our solution, named Leader\nConfirmation Replication (LCR), uses the newly proposed future log and\nconfirmation signal to achieve nontransactional data replication on the\nfollowers, thereby reducing the leader's network traffic and the request\nlatency of transactional data. In addition, the generation replication strategy\nis designed to ensure the reliability and consistency of LCR when meeting\nmembership changes. We evaluated LCR with various cluster sizes and network\nlatencies. Experimental results show that in ms-network latency (2-30)\nenvironments, the TPS of LCR is 1.4X-1.9X higher than Raft, the transactional\ndata response time is reduced by 40%-60%, and the network traffic is reduced by\n20%-30% with acceptable network traffic and CPU cost on the followers. In\naddition, LCR shows high portability and availability since it does not change\nthe number of leaders or the election process.",

Sophisticated applications, like\ncryptocurrencies, need distributed ledgers to function. Distributed ledgers,\nsuch as blockchains and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), employ consensus\nprotocols to add data in the form of blocks. However, such protocols are\ndesigned for resourceful devices that are interconnected via the Internet.\nMoreover, existing distributed ledgers are not deployable to D2D ecosystems\nsince their storage needs are continuously increasing. In this work, we\nintroduce and analyse Mneme, a DAG-based distributed ledger that can be\nmaintained solely by mobile devices. Mneme utilizes two novel consensus\nprotocols: Proof-of-Context (PoC) and Proof-of-Equivalence (PoE). PoC employs\nusers' context to add data on Mneme. PoE is executed periodically to summarize\ndata and produce equivalent blocks that require less storage. We analyze\nMneme's security and justify the ability of PoC and PoE to guarantee the\ncharacteristics of distributed ledgers: persistence and liveness. Furthermore,\nwe analyze potential attacks from malicious users and prove that the\nprobability of a successful attack is inversely proportional to the square of\nthe number of mobile users who maintain Mneme.",

            "summary": "In most websites, the online rating system provides the ratings of products\nand services to users. Lack of trust in data integrity and its manipulation has\nhindered fulfilling user satisfaction. Since existing online rating systems\ndeal with a central server, all rating data is stored on the central server.\nTherefore, all rating data can be removed, modified, and manipulated by the\nsystem manager to change the ratings in favor of the service or product\nprovider. In this paper, an online rating system using distributed ledger\ntechnologies has been presented as the proposed system to solve all the\nweaknesses of current systems. Distributed ledger technologies are completely\ndecentralized and there is no centralization on them by any institution.\nDistributed ledger technologies have different variants. Among distributed\nledger technologies, blockchain technology has been used in the proposed rating\nsystem because of its support for smart contracts. In the proposed online\nrating system, the Ethereum platform has been chosen from different blockchain\nplatforms that have a public permission network. In this system, the raters\ncannot rate unless they submit a request to the system and be authorized to\ntake part in the online product rating process. The important feature of the\nEthereum platform is its support for smart contracts, which can be used to\nwrite the rating contract in the Solidity language. Also, using Proof of\nAuthority consensus mechanisms, all rating transactions are approved by the\nsurveyors. Since in the real Ethereum system, each rating transaction is sent\nto the network by the raters, some gas must be paid for each rating\ntransaction. However, since this method is expensive, TestNet blockchain can be\nused in the rating system. Finally, the proposed rating system was used for\nrating the restaurants of a website and its features were tested.",

This paper develops a novel\nblockchain-based transactive energy management system for IoT-aided smart\nhomes. We consider a holistic set of options for smart homes to participate in\ntransactive energy. Smart homes can interact with the grid to perform vertical\ntransactions, e.g., feeding in extra solar energy to the grid and providing\ndemand response service to alleviate the grid load. Smart homes can also\ninteract with peer users to perform horizontal transactions, e.g., peer-to-peer\nenergy trading. However, conventional transactive energy management method\nsuffers from the drawbacks of low efficiency, privacy leakage, and single-point\nfailure. To address these challenges, we develop a privacy-preserving\ndistributed algorithm that enables users to optimally manage their energy\nusages in parallel via the smart contract on the blockchain. Further, we design\nan efficient blockchain system tailored for IoT devices and develop the smart\ncontract to support the holistic transactive energy management system. Finally,\nwe evaluate the feasibility and performance of the blockchain-based transactive\nenergy management system through extensive simulations and experiments. The\nresults show that the blockchain-based transactive energy management system is\nfeasible on practical IoT devices and reduces the overall cost by 25%.",

In\ncontrast to Nakamoto Consensus where any block obtains higher assurance as\nburied deeper in the blockchain, in BFT SMR, any committed block is secure has\na fixed resilience threshold. In this paper, we investigate strengthened fault\ntolerance (SFT) in BFT SMR under partial synchrony, which provides gradually\nincreased resilience guarantees (like Nakamoto Consensus) during an optimistic\nperiod when the network is synchronous and the number of Byzantine faults is\nsmall. Moreover, the committed blocks can tolerate more than one-third (up to\ntwo-thirds) corruptions even after the optimistic period. Compared to the prior\nbest solution Flexible BFT which requires quadratic message complexity, our\nsolution maintains the linear message complexity of state-of-the-art BFT SMR\nprotocols and requires only marginal bookkeeping overhead.

To resolve these\nrobustness issues of FL, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based\ndecentralized FL framework, termed VBFL, by exploiting two mechanisms in a\nblockchained architecture. First, we introduced a novel decentralized\nvalidation mechanism such that the legitimacy of local model updates is\nexamined by individual validators. Second, we designed a dedicated\nproof-of-stake consensus mechanism where stake is more frequently rewarded to\nhonest devices, which protects the legitimate local model updates by increasing\ntheir chances of dictating the blocks appended to the blockchain. Together,\nthese solutions promote more federation within legitimate devices, enabling\nrobust FL. Our emulation results of the MNIST classification corroborate that\nwith 15% of malicious devices, VBFL achieves 87% accuracy, which is 7.4x higher\nthan Vanilla FL.",

To address these three challenges, we propose an online multi-item double\nauction (MIDA) mechanism, where IoT devices are buyers and edge servers are\nsellers. In order to achieve the truthfulness, the participants' private\ninformation is at risk of being exposed by inference attack, which may lead to\nmalicious manipulation of the market by adversaries. Then, we improve our MIDA\nmechanism based on differential privacy to protect sensitive information from\nbeing leaked. It interferes with the auction results slightly but guarantees\nprivacy protection with high confidence. Besides, we upgrade our\nprivacy-preserving MIDA mechanism such that adapting to more complex and\nrealistic scenarios. In the end, the effectiveness and correctness of\nalgorithms are evaluated and verified by theoretical analysis and numerical\nsimulations.",

Many security analysis tools have been created to detect such\nvulnerabilities, but their performance decreases drastically when codes to be\nanalyzed are being rewritten. In this paper, we propose Eth2Vec, a\nmachine-learning-based static analysis tool for vulnerability detection, with\nrobustness against code rewrites in smart contracts. Existing\nmachine-learning-based static analysis tools for vulnerability detection need\nfeatures, which analysts create manually, as inputs. In contrast, Eth2Vec\nautomatically learns features of vulnerable Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\nbytecodes with tacit knowledge through a neural network for language\nprocessing. Therefore, Eth2Vec can detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts by\ncomparing the code similarity between target EVM bytecodes and the EVM\nbytecodes it already learned. We conducted experiments with existing open\ndatabases, such as Etherscan, and our results show that Eth2Vec outperforms the\nexisting work in terms of well-known metrics, i.e., precision, recall, and\nF1-score. Moreover, Eth2Vec can detect vulnerabilities even in rewritten codes.",

Nonetheless, the time complexity of bilinear pairing\nis $O(n^3)$, making it a very time-consuming operation, especially for\nresource-constrained IoT devices. Secure outsourcing of bilinear pairing has\nbeen studied in recent years to enable computationally weak devices to securely\noutsource the bilinear pairing to untrustworthy cloud servers. However, the\nstate-of-art algorithms often require to pre-compute and store some values,\nwhich results in storage burden for devices. In the Internet of Things, devices\nare generally with very limited storage capacity. Thus, the existing algorithms\ndo not fit the IoT well. In this paper, we propose a secure outsourcing\nalgorithm of bilinear pairings, which does not require pre-computations. In the\nproposed algorithm, the outsourcer side's efficiency is significantly improved\ncompared with executing the original bilinear pairing operation. At the same\ntime, the privacy of the input and output is ensured. Also, we apply the\nEthereum blockchain in our outsourcing algorithm to enable fair payments, which\nensures that the cloud server gets paid only when he correctly accomplished the\noutsourced work.

            "summary": "There has been recently a lot of progress in designing efficient partially\nsynchronous BFT consensus protocols that are meant to serve as core consensus\nengines for Proof of Stake blockchain systems. While the state-of-the-art\nsolutions attain virtually optimal performance under this theoretical model,\nthere is still room for improvement, as several practical aspects of such\nsystems are not captured by this model. Most notably, during regular execution,\ndue to financial incentives in such systems, one expects an overwhelming\nfraction of nodes to honestly follow the protocol rules and only few of them to\nbe faulty, most likely due to temporary network issues. Intuitively, the fact\nthat almost all nodes behave honestly should result in stronger confidence in\nblocks finalized in such periods, however it is not the case under the\nclassical model, where finality is binary.\n  We propose Highway, a new consensus protocol that is safe and live in the\nclassical partially synchronous BFT model, while at the same time offering\npractical improvements over existing solutions. Specifically, block finality in\nHighway is not binary but is expressed by fraction of nodes that would need to\nbreak the protocol rules in order for a block to be reverted. During periods of\nhonest participation finality of blocks might reach well beyond 1/3 (as what\nwould be the maximum for classical protocols), up to even 1 (complete\ncertainty). Having finality defined this way, Highway offers flexibility with\nrespect to the configuration of security thresholds among nodes running the\nprotocol, allowing nodes with lower thresholds to reach finality faster than\nthe ones requiring higher levels of confidence.",

To solve these problems, this paper proposes\nSG-PBFT: a secure and highly efficient PBFT consensus algorithm for Internet of\nVehicles, which is based on a distributed blockchain structure. The distributed\nstructure can reduce the pressure on the central server and decrease the risk\nof single-node attacks. The SG-PBFT consensus algorithm improves the\ntraditional PBFT consensus algorithm by using a score grouping mechanism to\nachieve a higher consensus efficiency. The experimental result shows that our\nmethod can greatly improve the consensus efficiency and prevent single-node\nattacks. Specifically, when the number of consensus nodes reaches 1000, the\nconsensus time of our algorithm is only about 27% of what is required for the\nstate-of-the-art consensus algorithm (PBFT).

Numerous applications for blockchains and cryptocurrencies\nare now envisioned for purposes ranging from inventory control to banking\napplications. Naturally, in order to mine in an economically viable way,\nregions where energy is plentiful and cheap, e.g., close to hydroelectric\nplants, are sought. The possibility of converting energy into cash, however,\nalso opens up opportunities for a new kind of cyber attack aimed at illegally\nmining cryptocurrencies by stealing energy.

            "summary": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) lays a new paradigm for the concept of\nIndustry 4.0 and paves an insight for new industrial era. Nowadays smart\nmachines and smart factories use machine learning/deep learning based models\nfor incurring intelligence. However, storing and communicating the data to the\ncloud and end device leads to issues in preserving privacy. In order to address\nthis issue, federated learning (FL) technology is implemented in IIoT by the\nresearchers nowadays to provide safe, accurate, robust and unbiased models.\nIntegrating FL in IIoT ensures that no local sensitive data is exchanged, as\nthe distribution of learning models over the edge devices has become more\ncommon with FL. Therefore, only the encrypted notifications and parameters are\ncommunicated to the central server. In this paper, we provide a thorough\noverview on integrating FL with IIoT in terms of privacy, resource and data\nmanagement. The survey starts by articulating IIoT characteristics and\nfundamentals of distributive and FL. The motivation behind integrating IIoT and\nFL for achieving data privacy preservation and on-device learning are\nsummarized. Then we discuss the potential of using machine learning, deep\nlearning and blockchain techniques for FL in secure IIoT. Further we analyze\nand summarize the ways to handle the heterogeneous and huge data. Comprehensive\nbackground on data and resource management are then presented, followed by\napplications of IIoT with FL in healthcare and automobile industry. Finally, we\nshed light on challenges, some possible solutions and potential directions for\nfuture research.",

The most convenient and\ngood quality - price ratio should be chosen for the feed of animals. Blockchain\nis used in a virtual space to store and share information over a network of\nusers. This is done using the open source Hyperledger Fabric platform. The\ntransactions can be viewed by all the other users in real time. These\ntransactions are stored as JSONs inside CouchDB NoSQL database which supports\nqueries on a large volume of data. When using this technology, the farmer can\nknow with whom the supplier for animal feed collaborated with. The history of\nthe transactions are not saved in just one place. In this way, it is more\ndifficult to hack and provide implausible information. An e-learning platform\nwas created where the farm's user can post information, respectively new blocks\nabout the animal's birth, vaccinations, medicines, including the location of\nthe livestock. The same e-learning platform is accessible from the mobile\nphone. By using the blockchain technology, anyone, including the client from\nthe shop can know a lot about the origin of the products. Fake origins of food\nare much more difficult to hide. Fraud is also limited. The system monitored\nthe traceability of dairy products inside a Romanian farm. Data about fodder\nprovider and quality, cow productive performances and health and dairy products\nprocess were obtained and analyzed by students who will become specialists at\nall the levels of the food chain. Blockchain is the technology which in case of\na dairy products contamination, the origin of the farm is traced in just a\ncouple of seconds. In this way just a batch of dairy products is removed from\ndistribution, leading to the reduction of food waste.",

Despite its strong protection for\nsecurity and privacy, the current Bitcoin blockchain can only support a low\nnumber of transactions per second (TPS). In this work, we redesign the current\nBitcoin's networking protocol to increase TPS without changing vital components\nin its consensus-building protocol. In particular, we improve the compact-block\nrelaying protocol to enable the propagation of blocks containing a massive\nnumber of transactions without inducing extra propagation latencies. Our\nimprovements consist of (i) replacing the existing store-and-forward\ncompact-block relaying scheme with a cut-through compact-block relaying scheme;\n(ii) exploiting rateless erasure codes for P2P networks to increase\nblock-propagation efficiency. Since our protocols only need to rework the\ncurrent Bitcoin's networking protocol and does not modify the data structures\nand crypto-functional components, they can be seamlessly incorporated into the\nexisting Bitcoin blockchain. To validate our designs, we perform analysis on\nour protocols and implement a Bitcoin network simulator on NS3 to run different\nblock propagation protocols. The analysis and experimental results confirm that\nour new block propagation protocols could increase the TPS of the Bitcoin\nblockchain by 100x without compromising security and consensus-building.",

It\nfinds wide applications, especially in distributed environments, where entities\nsuch as wireless sensors need to be certain of the authenticity of the server.\nAs contemporary blockchain techniques that address post-quantum concerns have\nnot been designed, in this study, we investigate a blockchain in the\npost-quantum setting and seek to discover how it can resist attacks from\nquantum computing. In addition, traditional proof of work (PoW)-based consensus\nprotocols such as Bitcoin cannot supply memory mining, and the transaction\ncapacity of each block in a blockchain is limited and needs to be expanded.\nThus, a new post-quantum proof of work (post-quantum PoW) consensus algorithm\nfor security and privacy of smart city applications is proposed. It can be used\nto not only protect a blockchain under a quantum computing attack compared to\nexisting classical hash-based PoW algorithms but also to supply memory mining.\nMeanwhile, an identity-based post-quantum signature is embedded into a\ntransaction process to construct lightweight transactions. Subsequently, we\nprovide a detailed description on the execution of the post-quantum lightweight\ntransaction in a blockchain. Overall, this work can help enrich the research on\nfuture post-quantum blockchain and support the construction or architecture of\nemerging blockchain-based smart cities.",

            "summary": "A proof of work (PoW) is an important cryptographic construct enabling a\nparty to convince others that they invested some effort in solving a\ncomputational task. Arguably, its main impact has been in the setting of\ncryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain protocol, which\nreceived significant attention in recent years due to its potential for various\napplications as well as for solving fundamental distributed computing questions\nin novel threat models. PoWs enable the linking of blocks in the blockchain\ndata structure and thus the problem of interest is the feasibility of obtaining\na sequence (chain) of such proofs. In this work, we examine the hardness of\nfinding such chain of PoWs against quantum strategies. We prove that the chain\nof PoWs problem reduces to a problem we call multi-solution Bernoulli search,\nfor which we establish its quantum query complexity. Effectively, this is an\nextension of a threshold direct product theorem to an average-case unstructured\nsearch problem. Our proof, adding to active recent efforts, simplifies and\ngeneralizes the recording technique of Zhandry (Crypto'19). As an application,\nwe revisit the formal treatment of security of the core of the Bitcoin\nconsensus protocol, the Bitcoin backbone (Eurocrypt'15), against quantum\nadversaries, while honest parties are classical and show that protocol's\nsecurity holds under a quantum analogue of the classical ``honest majority''\nassumption. Our analysis indicates that the security of Bitcoin backbone is\nguaranteed provided the number of adversarial quantum queries is bounded so\nthat each quantum query is worth $O(p^{-1/2})$ classical ones, where $p$ is the\nsuccess probability of a single classical query to the protocol's underlying\nhash function. Somewhat surprisingly, the wait time for safe settlement in the\ncase of quantum adversaries matches the safe settlement time in the classical\ncase.",

The vehicular crowdsourcing service (VCS), for\nexample, can provide immediate and timely feedback to the user regarding\nreal-time transportation information.

Distinguishing trusted information from numerous sources is the key to\na reliable VCS platform. This paper proposes a solution to this problem called\n\"RC-chain\", a reputation-based crowdsourcing framework built on a blockchain\nplatform (Hyperledger Fabric). We first establish the blockchain-based platform\nto support the management of crowdsourcing trading and user-reputation\nevaluating activities. A reputation model, the Trust Propagation \\& Feedback\nSimilarity (TPFS), then calculates the reputation values of participants and\nreveals any malicious behavior accordingly. Finally, queueing theory is used to\nevaluate the blockchain-based platform and optimize the system performance.

Satellite spectrum is a scarce resource that\nrequires highly efficient management schemes for optimized sharing by network\nusers. However, spectrum sharing is vulnerable to attacks by malicious protocol\nparticipants. In order to ensure efficient spectrum management in the face of\ndishonest satellite users or cyber attackers, it is important for spectrum\nsharing mechanism to provide transparency and traceability of the trading\nprocess so as to enable the system to detect, and hence eliminate, unauthorized\naccess by malicious users. We address these requirements by proposing the use\nof blockchain which, apart from its ability to provide transparency and\ntraceability, ensures an immutable means for keeping track of user trading\nreputation. Besides, in order to address the practical constraints of\nheterogeneous user nodes, we also propose the use of edge computing to support\nusers with limited computing power. In this paper, we propose a\nblockchain-based spectrum trading framework and, based on which, a multibeam\nsatellite spectrum sharing algorithm for interference pricing and heterogeneous\nspectrum demands is devised to improve the efficiency of satellite spectrum. By\nleveraging on the system characteristics of blockchain, a dynamic spectrum\nsharing mechanism with traceability, openness and transparency for whole\ntrading process is presented. Numerical results are also provided to evaluate\nthe system benefits and spectrum pricing of the proposed mechanism.",

First, we customize an incentive mechanism based on Bayesian game\ntheory which ensures that joining providers at a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium will\nprovide truthful (not meaningless) predictions. Second, working jointly with\nthe incentive mechanism, we employ truth discovery algorithms to aggregate\ntruthful but possibly inaccurate predictions for boosting prediction accuracy.\nThird, providers can locally deploy their models and their predictions are\nsecurely aggregated inside TEEs.

In\nthis paper, we first propose a specific architecture model with three software\nlayers to anonymous cryptocurrencies. Next, we introduce definitions of\nfundamental privacy properties (Pfitzmann's anonymity, unlinkability, and\npseudonymity) and comprehensively analyze each privacy property for each\narchitecture layer of anonymous cryptocurrencies to establish a privacy\nevaluation policy for anonymous cryptocurrencies. Finally, we fairly compare\nthe privacy of current leading anonymous cryptocurrencies (e.g., Zerocash,\nCryptoNote, and Mimblewimble) using the privacy evaluation policy.",

            "summary": "Epidemic situations typically demand intensive data collection and management\nfrom different locations/entities within a strict time constraint. Such demand\ncan be fulfilled by leveraging the intensive and easy deployment of the\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices. The management and containment of such\nsituations also rely on cross-organizational and national collaboration. Thus,\nthis paper proposes an Intelligent-Health (I-Health) system that aims to\naggregate diverse e-health entities in a unique national healthcare system by\nenabling swift, secure exchange and storage of medical data. In particular, we\ndesign an automated patients monitoring scheme, at the edge, which enables the\nprompt discovery, remote monitoring, and fast emergency response for critical\nmedical events, such as emerging epidemics. Furthermore, we develop a\nblockchain optimization model that aims to optimize medical data sharing\nbetween different health entities to provide effective and secure health\nservices. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our system, in adapting to\ndifferent critical events, while highlighting the benefits of the proposed\nI-Health system.",

            "summary": "Recent advancements in the cloud computing domain have resulted in huge\nstrides toward simplifying the procurement of hardware and software for diverse\nneeds. By moving enterprise workloads to managed cloud offerings (private,\npublic, hybrid), customers are delegating mundane tasks and labor-intensive\nmaintenance activities related to network connectivity, procurement of cloud\nresource, application deployment, software patches, and upgrades, etc., This\noften translates to benefits such as high availability and reduced cost. The\npopularity of container and micro-services-based deployment has made Kubernetes\nthe de-facto standard to deliver applications. However, even with Kubernetes\norchestration, cloud service providers frequently have operational scalability\nissues due to lack of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD)\nautomation and increased demand for human operators when managing a large\nnumber of software deployments across multiple data centers/availability zones.\nKubernetes solves this in a novel way by creating and managing custom\napplications using Operators. Agile methodology advocates incremental CICD\nwhich are adopted by cloud providers. However, ironically, it is this same\ncontinuous delivery feature of application updates, Kubernetes cluster\nupgrades, etc., that is also a bane to cloud providers. In this paper, we will\ndemonstrate the use of IBM open-source project Razee as a scalable continuous\ndeployment framework to deploy open-source RStudio and Nginx Operators. We will\ndiscuss how IBM Watson SaaS application Operator, Blockchain applications, and\nKubernetes resources updates, etc., can be deployed similarly and the use of\nOperators to perform application life cycle management. We assert that using\nRazee in conjunction with Operators on Kubernetes simplifies application life\ncycle management and increases scalability.",

            "summary": "Protecting secrets is a key challenge in our contemporary information-based\nera. In common situations, however, revealing secrets appears unavoidable, for\ninstance, when identifying oneself in a bank to retrieve money. In turn, this\nmay have highly undesirable consequences in the unlikely, yet not unrealistic,\ncase where the bank's security gets compromised. This naturally raises the\nquestion of whether disclosing secrets is fundamentally necessary for\nidentifying oneself, or more generally for proving a statement to be correct.\nDevelopments in computer science provide an elegant solution via the concept of\nzero-knowledge proofs: a prover can convince a verifier of the validity of a\ncertain statement without facilitating the elaboration of a proof at all. In\nthis work, we report the experimental realisation of such a zero-knowledge\nprotocol involving two separated verifier-prover pairs. Security is enforced\nvia the physical principle of special relativity, and no computational\nassumption (such as the existence of one-way functions) is required. Our\nimplementation exclusively relies on off-the-shelf equipment and works at both\nshort (60 m) and long distances ($\\geqslant$400 m) in about one second. This\ndemonstrates the practical potential of multi-prover zero-knowledge protocols,\npromising for identification tasks and blockchain applications such as\ncryptocurrencies or smart contracts.",

            "summary": "Payment channels networks drastically increase the throughput and hence\nscalability of blockchains by performing transactions \\emph{off-chain}. In an\noff-chain payment, parties deposit coins in a channel and then perform\ntransactions without invoking the global consensus mechanism of the blockchain.\nHowever, the transaction value is limited by the capacity of the channel, i.e.,\nthe amount of funds available on a channel. These funds decrease when a\ntransaction is sent and increase when a transaction is received on the channel.\nRecent research indicates that there is an imbalance between sending and\nreceiving transactions, which leads to channel depletion in the sense that one\nof these operations becomes impossible over time due to the lack of available\nfunds.\n  We incentivize the balanced use of payment channels through fees. Whereas the\ncurrent fee model depends solely on the transaction value, our fee policies\nencourage transactions that have a positive effect on the balance in a channel\nand discourage those that have a negative effect. This paper first defines\nnecessary properties of fee strategies. Then, it introduces two novel fees\nstrategies that provably satisfy all necessary properties. Our extensive\nsimulation study reveals that these incentives increase the effectiveness of\npayments by $8\\%$ to $19\\%$.",

            "summary": "There exist many forms of Blockchain finality conditions, from deterministic\nto probabilistic terminations. To favor availability against consistency in the\nface of partitions, most blockchains only offer probabilistic eventual\nfinality: blocks may be revoked after being appended to the blockchain, yet\nwith decreasing probability as they sink deeper into the chain. Other\nblockchains favor consistency by leveraging the immediate finality of\nConsensus-a block appended is never revoked-at the cost of additional\nsynchronization. In this paper, we focus on necessary and sufficient conditions\nto implement a blockchain with deterministic eventual finality, which ensures\nthat selected main chains at different processes share a common increasing\nprefix. This is a much weaker form of finality that allows us to provide a\nsolution in an asynchronous system subject to unlimited number of byzantine\nfailures. We study stronger forms of eventual finality as well and show that it\nis unfortunately impossible to provide a bounded displacement. By bounded\ndisplacement we mean that the (unknown) number of blocks that can be revoked\nfrom the current blockchain is bounded. This problem reduces to consensus or\neventual consensus depending on whether the bound is known or not. We also show\nthat the classical selection mechanism, such as in Bitcoin, that appends blocks\nat the longest chain is not compliant with a solution to eventual finality.",

It also\npresents an optimized Cluster Head Selection (CHS) algorithm for selecting a\nCluster Head (CH) among the clusters that efficiently saves energy. Besides, a\ndecentralized and secured Blockchain approach has been introduced that allows\nmore prominent security and privacy to the desired condominium network. Our\nproposed approach has also the ability to detect attacks in an IoT environment.\nEventually, this article evaluates the performance of the proposed architecture\nusing different parameters (e.g., throughput, packet arrival rate, and response\ntime). The proposed approach outperforms the existing OF-Based SDN. DistB-Condo\nhas better throughput on average, and the bandwidth (Mbps) much higher than the\nOF-Based SDN approach in the presence of attacks. Also, the proposed model has\nan average response time of 5% less than the core model.",

However, limitations on high latency and low scalability retard their\nadoptions and applications in classic designs. Reconstructed blockchain systems\nhave been proposed to avoid the consumption of competitive transactions caused\nby linear sequenced blocks. These systems, instead, structure\ntransactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and\nconsequently re-build upper layer components including consensus, incentives,\n\\textit{etc.} The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast\nconfirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high\nscalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly\ncompromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that\nsummarises the DAG technique. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of\nKnowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of DAG-based blockchain\nsystems. Through deconstructing open-sourced systems and reviewing academic\nresearches, we conclude the main components and featured properties of systems,\nand provide the approach to establish a DAG. With this in hand, we analyze the\nsecurity and performance of several leading systems, followed by discussions\nand comparisons with concurrent (scaling blockchain) techniques. We further\nidentify open challenges to highlight the potentiality of DAG-based solutions\nand indicate their promising directions for future research.",

For the case where providers change prices\nsynchronously, we approach the problem through contextual multi-armed bandits\nand Reinforcement Learning methods like Q-learning either applied directly to\nthe bandit maximization problem or indirectly to approximate the Gittins\nindices that are known to yield the optimal provider selection policy. For a\nsimulated scenario corresponding to a practical use case, our agent shows a\n$20-41\\%$ QoE improvement over random provider selection under various demand,\nprice and mobility conditions.\n  We implemented a prototype spectrum market using LTE networks and eSIM\ntechology and deployed it on a testbed, using a blockchain to implement the\nledger where bandwidth purchase transactions are recorded.

            "summary": "Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have made payment transactions\npossible without a trusted third party, but they have a scalability issue due\nto their consensus mechanisms. Payment networks have emerged to overcome this\nlimitation by executing transactions outside of the blockchain, which is why\nthese are referred to as off-chain transactions. In order to establish a\npayment channel between two users, the users lock their deposits in the\nblockchain, and then they can pay each other through the channel. Furthermore,\npayment networks support multi-hop payments that allow users to transfer their\nbalances to other users who are connected to them via multiple channels.\nHowever, multi-hop payments are hard to be accomplished, as they are heavily\ndependent on routing users on a payment path from a sender to a receiver.\nAlthough routing hubs can make multi-hop payments more practical and efficient,\nthey need a lot of collateral locked for a long period and have privacy issues\nin terms of payment history.\n  We propose RouTEE, a secure payment routing hub that is fully feasible\nwithout the hub's deposit. Unlike existing payment networks, RouTEE provides\nhigh balance liquidity, and details about payments are concealed from hosts by\nleveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs). RouTEE is designed to make\nrational hosts behave honestly, by introducing a new routing fee scheme and a\nsecure settlement method. Moreover, users do not need to monitor the blockchain\nin real-time or run full nodes. They can participate in RouTEE by simply\nverifying block headers through light clients; furthermore, having only one\nchannel with RouTEE is sufficient to interact with other users. Our\nimplementation demonstrates that RouTEE is highly efficient and outperforms\nLightning Network that is the state-of-the-art payment network.",

In the case of proof-of-work (PoW),\ncurrently used by the most prominent systems, the cost is due to spent\ncomputation. In this paper, we characterize the security investment of miners\nin terms of its cost in fiat money. This enables comparison of security\nallocations across PoW blockchains that generally use different PoW algorithms\nand reward miners in different cryptocurrency units. We prove that there exists\na unique allocation equilibrium, depending on market prices only, that is\nachieved by both strategic miners (who contemplate the actions of others) and\nby miners seeking only short-term profit. In fact, the latter will unknowingly\ncompensate for any attempt to deliberately shift security allocation away from\nequilibrium.\n  Our conclusions are supported analytically through the development of a\nMarkov decision process, game theoretical analysis, and derivation of no\narbitrage conditions. We corroborate those results with empirical evidence from\nmore than two years of blockchain and price data. Overall agreement is strong.\nWe show that between January 1, 2018 and August 1, 2020, market prices\npredicted security allocation between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash with error less\nthan 0.6%. And from the beginning of October 2019, until August 1, 2020, market\nprices predicted security allocation between Bitcoin and Litecoin with error of\n0.45%. These results are further corroborated by our establishment of\nGranger-causality between change in market prices and change in security\nallocation.\n  To demonstrate the practicality of our results, we describe a trustless\noracle that leverages the equilibrium to estimate the price ratios of PoW\ncryptocurrencies from on-chain information only.",

The high degree of fragmentation and the reliance on\nthird-party financial institutions has pushed the physical and financial supply\nchains apart.

The as-built data captured by unmanned aerial and ground\nvehicles was passed to an autonomous smart contract-based method that utilizes\ncrypto-currencies and crypto tokens for payment settlement; the resulting\npayment datasets, written to the Ethereum blockchain, were analyzed in terms of\ntheir integration of product and cash flow.

            "summary": "We present Egalitarian BFT (EBFT), a simple and high-performance framework of\nBFT consensus protocols for decentralized systems like blockchains. The key\ninnovation in EBFT is egalitarian block generation: nodes randomly and\nnon-interactively propose blocks containing client transactions, rather than\nrelying on a leader to do so. Apart from deterministic safety and liveness\nguarantees standard in BFT protocols, the egalitarian design provides two novel\nfeatures: (i) EBFT is resilient to attacks targeting the leader, such as\nbribery and targeted DoS attacks, and (ii) EBFT does not require any fail-over\nprotocol to detect and replace the faulty leader. EBFT consists of three\nprotocols: EBFT-Syn for synchronous networks, EBFT-PSyn for partially\nsynchronous networks, and EBFT-Turbo that builds on EBFT for high performance.\n  We implement EBFT and evaluate its performance on AWS. To compare EBFT with\nstate-of-the-art BFT protocols, we build EBFT-PSyn based on Bamboo, an\nopen-source platform for prototyping partially synchronous BFT protocols. We\nevaluate EBFT-PSyn and HotStuff on EC2 with up to 16 nodes. The evaluation\nshows that EBFT-PSyn achieves better throughput and latency than HotStuff. To\ndemonstrate its simplicity and practicality, we build EBFT on the Go version of\nBitcoin, btcd. We implemented EBFT-Syn, EBFT-PSyn and EBFT-Turbo in about 920\nLoCs in total. This indicates that EBFT can be built on top of existing\nblockchains with relatively little effort. We evaluate these protocols on EC2\ninstances with up to 256 nodes. Our evaluation shows that EBFT-Syn (resp.\nEBFT-PSyn) achieves a latency of 6 (resp. 1) seconds, and an optimized version\nof EBFT-PSyn processes up to 3.6k transactions per second and has a latency of\n8 seconds.",

            "summary": "Federated learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning approach, has\ndrawn a great amount of attention in recent years. FL shows an inherent\nadvantage in privacy preservation, since users' raw data are processed locally.\nHowever, it relies on a centralized server to perform model aggregation.\nTherefore, FL is vulnerable to server malfunctions and external attacks. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework by integrating blockchain into FL,\nnamely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL), to\nenhance the security of FL. The proposed BLADE-FL has a good performance in\nterms of privacy preservation, tamper resistance, and effective cooperation of\nlearning. However, it gives rise to a new problem of training deficiency,\ncaused by lazy clients who plagiarize others' trained models and add artificial\nnoises to conceal their cheating behaviors. To be specific, we first develop a\nconvergence bound of the loss function with the presence of lazy clients and\nprove that it is convex with respect to the total number of generated blocks\n$K$. Then, we solve the convex problem by optimizing $K$ to minimize the loss\nfunction. Furthermore, we discover the relationship between the optimal $K$,\nthe number of lazy clients, and the power of artificial noises used by lazy\nclients. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed framework using the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our analytical\nresults are shown to be consistent with the experimental results. In addition,\nthe derived optimal $K$ achieves the minimum value of loss function, and in\nturn the optimal accuracy performance.",

Although the debate about the medical\nand ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been\nless inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes.\nThese schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and\nvaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes\nhave involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized\nIdentifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web\nConsortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity\nstandards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents\nthat have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the\nquestionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity\npassports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of `cryptography\ntheater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to\nallay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization.\nDeployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases\nlike immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity\ntotalitarianism.",

This paper closes this gap and makes two\ncontributions. It first provides a detailed, abstract description of the\nprotocol, which has been derived from the source code.

These threshold-guarded algorithms have the\nfollowing features: (1) up to $t$ of processes may crash or behave Byzantine;\n(2) the correct processes count messages and make progress when they receive\nsufficiently many messages, e.g., at least $t+1$; (3) the number $n$ of\nprocesses in the system is a parameter, as well as the number $t$ of faults;\nand (4) the parameters are restricted by a resilience condition, e.g., $n >\n3t$. Traditionally, these algorithms were implemented in distributed systems\nwith up to ten participating processes. Nowadays, they are implemented in\ndistributed systems that involve hundreds or thousands of processes. To make\nsure that these algorithms are still correct for that scale, it is imperative\nto verify them for all possible values of the parameters.",

The emerging blockchain technology\nhas the enormous potential to provide effective interventions in various\ndevelopmental sectors, including Agriculture, Education, Health, and\nTransportation. In these sectors, mediators have been considered as one of the\nimpediments for developmental work. Blockchain technology facilitates\npeer-to-peer business transactions, thus eliminating the role of mediators.\nHence, the blockchain technology is emerging as an alternative to conventional\nmediator-centred solutions adopting client-server based Internet technologies.\nA combination of blockchain technology with other technologies can be used to\naddress domain-specific challenges. For example, the combination of blockchain\ntechnology and Internet-of-Thing (IoT) has the potential to monitor the usage\nof scarce resources such as the level of ground-water and amount of energy\nconsumption. The aims of this chapter are twofold. Firstly, it describes the\nprimary building blocks of blockchain technology. Secondly, it illustrates\nvarious use-case scenarios of blockchain technology in the fields of\nAgriculture, Energy Health and others.",

Business process view integration attempts to\nproduce an integrated view from different views of the same model, facilitating\nthe management of models. To study trends around business process view\nintegration, we conduct a systematic literature review to summarize findings\nsince the 1970s, up to its potential novel applications. With a starting corpus\nof 798 documents, this survey draws up a systematic inventory of solutions used\nin academia and in the industry. By narrowing it down to 51 articles, we\ndiscuss in-depth 15 business process integration techniques papers. After that,\nwe classify existing solutions according to their practicality. Our study shows\nthat most integrated views are constructed by annotation, using formal merging\nrules. Finally, we explore possible future research directions. We highlight\nthe application of view integration to the blockchain research area, where\nstakeholders can have different views on the same blockchain.

            "summary": "Smart contracts - computer protocols that regulate the exchange of\ncrypto-assets in trustless environments - have become popular with the spread\nof blockchain technologies. A landmark security property of smart contracts is\nliquidity: in a non-liquid contract, it may happen that some assets remain\nfrozen, i.e. not redeemable by anyone. The relevance of this issue is witnessed\nby recent liquidity attacks to Ethereum, which have frozen hundreds of USD\nmillions. We address the problem of verifying liquidity on BitML, a DSL for\nsmart contracts with a secure compiler to Bitcoin, featuring primitives for\ncurrency transfers, contract renegotiation and consensual recursion. Our main\nresult is a verification technique for liquidity. We first transform the\ninfinite-state semantics of BitML into a finite-state one, which focusses on\nthe behaviour of a chosen set of contracts, abstracting from the moves of the\ncontext. With respect to the chosen contracts, this abstraction is sound, i.e.\nif the abstracted contract is liquid, then also the concrete one is such. We\nthen verify liquidity by model-checking the finite-state abstraction. We\nimplement a toolchain that automatically verifies liquidity of BitML contracts\nand compiles them to Bitcoin, and we assess it through a benchmark of\nrepresentative contracts.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system invented by Nakamoto in\n2008. While it has attracted much research interest, its exact latency and\nsecurity properties remain open. Existing analyses provide security and latency\n(or confirmation time) guarantees that are too loose for practical use. In fact\nthe best known upper bounds are several orders of magnitude larger than a lower\nbound due to a well-known private-mining attack. This paper describes a\ncontinuous-time model for blockchains and develops a rigorous analysis that\nyields close upper and lower bounds for the latency--security trade-off. For\nexample, when the adversary controls 10\\% of the total mining power and the\nblock propagation delays are within 10 seconds, a Bitcoin block is secured with\nless than $10^{-3}$ error probability if it is confirmed after four hours, or\nwith less than $10^{-9}$ error probability if confirmed after ten hours. These\nconfirmation times are about two hours away from their corresponding lower\nbounds. To establish such close bounds, the blockchain security question is\nreduced to a race between the Poisson adversarial mining process and a renewal\nprocess formed by a certain species of honest blocks. The moment generation\nfunctions of relevant renewal times are derived in closed form. The general\nformulas from the analysis are then applied to study the latency--security\ntrade-off of several well-known proof-of-work longest-chain cryptocurrencies.\nGuidance is also provided on how to set parameters for different purposes.",

            "summary": "Decentralized blockchain platforms have enabled the secure exchange of\ncrypto-assets without the intermediation of trusted authorities. To this\npurpose, these platforms rely on a peer-to-peer network of byzantine nodes,\nwhich collaboratively maintain an append-only ledger of transactions, called\nblockchain. Transactions represent the actions required by users, e.g. the\ntransfer of some units of crypto-currency to another user, or the execution of\na smart contract which distributes crypto-assets according to its internal\nlogic. Part of the nodes of the peer-to-peer network compete to append\ntransactions to the blockchain. To do so, they group the transactions sent by\nusers into blocks, and update their view of the blockchain state by executing\nthese transactions in the chosen order. Once a block of transactions is\nappended to the blockchain, the other nodes validate it, re-executing the\ntransactions in the same order. The serial execution of transactions does not\ntake advantage of the multi-core architecture of modern processors, so\ncontributing to limit the throughput. In this paper we develop a theory of\ntransaction parallelism for blockchains, which is based on static analysis of\ntransactions and smart contracts. We illustrate how blockchain nodes can use\nour theory to parallelize the execution of transactions. Initial experiments on\nEthereum show that our technique can improve the performance of nodes.",

From the developer's\nperspective, serverless architectures allow reducing management efforts since\napplications are composed using provider-managed components, e.g.,\nDatabase-as-a-Service (DBaaS) and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offerings.\nBlockchains are distributed systems designed to enable collaborative scenarios\ninvolving multiple untrusted parties. It seems that the decentralized\npeer-to-peer nature of blockchains makes it interesting to consider them in\nserverless architectures, since resource allocation and management tasks are\nnot required to be performed by users. Moreover, considering their useful\nproperties of ensuring transaction's immutability and facilitating accountable\ninteractions, blockchains might enhance the overall guarantees and capabilities\nof serverless architectures. Therefore, in this work, we analyze how the\nblockchain technology and smart contracts fit into the serverless picture and\nderive a set of scenarios in which they act as different component types in\nserverless architectures. Furthermore, we formulate the implementation\nrequirements that have to be fulfilled to successfully use blockchains and\nsmart contracts in these scenarios. Finally, we investigate which existing\ntechnologies enable these scenarios, and analyze their readiness and\nsuitability to fulfill the formulated requirements.",

            "summary": "Data privacy and sharing has always been a critical issue when trying to\nbuild complex deep learning-based systems to model data. Facilitation of a\ndecentralized approach that could take benefit from data across multiple nodes\nwhile not needing to merge their data contents physically has been an area of\nactive research. In this paper, we present a solution to benefit from a\ndistributed data setup in the case of training deep learning architectures by\nmaking use of a smart contract system. Specifically, we propose a mechanism\nthat aggregates together the intermediate representations obtained from local\nANN models over a blockchain. Training of local models takes place on their\nrespective data. The intermediate representations derived from them, when\ncombined and trained together on the host node, helps to get a more accurate\nsystem. While federated learning primarily deals with the same features of data\nwhere the number of samples being distributed on multiple nodes, here we are\ndealing with the same number of samples but with their features being\ndistributed on multiple nodes. We consider the task of bank loan prediction\nwherein the personal details of an individual and their bank-specific details\nmay not be available at the same place. Our aggregation mechanism helps to\ntrain a model on such existing distributed data without having to share and\nconcatenate together the actual data values. The obtained performance, which is\nbetter than that of individual nodes, and is at par with that of a centralized\ndata setup makes a strong case for extending our technique across other\narchitectures and tasks. The solution finds its application in organizations\nthat want to train deep learning models on vertically partitioned data.",

Candidates and observers can indicate that the election\nwas free and fair by exposing their keys, which are used by the system to\ndecrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a\nlayer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to\ndecode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their\nkeys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without\ncompromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,\ntheir vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees.

A location proof is a digital\ncertificate of the geographical location of a user, which can be used to access\nvarious LBS. However, a user full control over a device allows the tampering of\nlocation proof. Initially, to resist false proofs, two-party trusted\ncentralized location proof systems (LPS) were introduced to aid the users in\ngenerating secure location proofs mutually. However, two-party protocols\nsuffered from the collusion attacks by the participants of the protocol.\nConsequently, many witness-oriented LPS have emerged to mitigate collusion\nattacks in two-party protocols. However, witness-oriented LPS presented the\npossibility of three-way collusion attacks (involving the user, location\nauthority, and the witness). The three-way collusion attacks are inevitable in\nall existing witness-oriented schemes. To mitigate the inability to resist\nthree-way collusion of existing schemes, in this paper, we introduce a\ndecentralized consensus protocol called as MobChain, where the selection of a\nwitness and location authority is achieved through a distributed consensus of\nnodes in an underlying P2P network of a private blockchain. The persistent\nprovenance data over the blockchain provides strong security guarantees, as a\nresult, the forging and manipulation become impractical. MobChain provides\nsecure location provenance architecture, relying on decentralized decision\nmaking for the selection of participants of the protocol to resist three-way\ncollusion problem. Our prototype implementation and comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art solutions show that MobChain is computationally efficient,\nhighly available while improving the security of LPS.",

However,\nhigh mobility of vehicles and dynamic wireless channel condition make it\nchallenge to design an optimal content caching policy. Further, with much\nsensitive personal information, vehicles may be not willing to caching their\ncontents to an untrusted caching provider. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is\nan emerging technique to solve the problem with high-dimensional and\ntime-varying features. Permission blockchain is able to establish a secure and\ndecentralized peer-to-peer transaction environment. In this paper, we integrate\nDRL and permissioned blockchain into vehicular networks for intelligent and\nsecure content caching. We first propose a blockchain empowered distributed\ncontent caching framework where vehicles perform content caching and base\nstations maintain the permissioned blockchain. Then, we exploit the advanced\nDRL approach to design an optimal content caching scheme with taking mobility\ninto account. Finally, we propose a new block verifier selection method,\nProof-of-Utility (PoU), to accelerate block verification process. Security\nanalysis shows that our proposed blockchain empowered content caching can\nachieve security and privacy protection. Numerical results based on a real\ndataset from Uber indicate that the DRL-inspired content caching scheme\nsignificantly outperforms two benchmark policies.",

            "summary": "Emerging technologies such as digital twins and 6th Generation mobile\nnetworks (6G) have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence in\nIndustrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin and 6G\nbridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust instant\nwireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy, federated\nlearning has been regarded as a promising solution for deploying distributed\ndata processing and learning in wireless networks. However, unreliable\ncommunication channels, limited resources, and lack of trust among users,\nhinder the effective application of federated learning in IIoT. In this paper,\nwe introduce the Digital Twin Wireless Networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital\ntwins into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and\ncomputation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered\nfederated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing,\nwhich improves the reliability and security of the system, and enhances data\nprivacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the\nproposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by\njointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and\nbandwidth allocation. We exploit multi-agent reinforcement learning to find an\noptimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset show\nthat the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared\nto benchmark learning method.",

Hadoop has become\nthe primary choice for mainstream platforms used by stakeholders to process big\ndata. Thereafter, the security of Hadoop platform has arisen tremendous\nattention worldwide. In this paper, we mainly concentrate on enforcing access\ncontrol on users to ensure platform security. First, we leverage access proxy\nintegrated with attribute-based access control (ABAC) model to implement\nfront-end authorization, which can fully reflect and cope with the flexible\nnature of the complex access control process in Hadoop platform, as well as can\nrelease back-end resources from complex authorization process through access\nproxy. Moreover, in order to ensure the fine-granularity of authorization, the\naccess proxy maintains a list composed of trust threshold value provided by\neach resource according to its importance. The access proxy interacts with the\nblockchain network to obtain the user's trust evaluation value, which serves as\nan important basis for dynamic authorization determination. More specifically,\nblockchain network works together on-chain and off-chain modes. The user's\nhistorical behavior data is stored off-chain, and the corresponding hash value\nis anchored on-chain. Consequently, the user's trust value is evaluated based\non his historical behavior stored on the blockchain platform. Meanwhile, the\nauthenticity of user behavior data can be guaranteed, thereby ensuring the\nreliability of trust assessment results. Our experiment demonstrates that the\nproposed model can dynamically and flexibly adjust user permissions to ensure\nthe security of the platform, while time and money are consumed within a\nreasonable range.",

While the initial model might belong solely to the actor bringing it to\nthe network for training, determining the ownership of the trained model\nresulting from Federated Learning remains an open question. In this paper we\nexplore how Blockchains (in particular Ethereum) can be used to determine the\nevolving ownership of a model trained with Federated Learning.\n  Firstly, we use the step-by-step evaluation metric to assess the relative\ncontributivities of participants in a Federated Learning process. Next, we\nintroduce 2CP, a framework comprising two novel protocols for Blockchained\nFederated Learning, which both reward contributors with shares in the final\nmodel based on their relative contributivity. The Crowdsource Protocol allows\nan actor to bring a model forward for training, and use their own data to\nevaluate the contributions made to it. Potential trainers are guaranteed a fair\nshare of the resulting model, even in a trustless setting. The Consortium\nProtocol gives trainers the same guarantee even when no party owns the initial\nmodel and no evaluator is available.\n  We conduct experiments with the MNIST dataset that reveal sound\ncontributivity scores resulting from both Protocols by rewarding larger\ndatasets with greater shares in the model. Our experiments also showed the\nnecessity to pair 2CP with a robust model aggregation mechanism to discard low\nquality inputs coming from model poisoning attacks.",

Yet, in reality,\nthere is no easy way for MLaaS providers, especially for startups, to collect\nsufficiently well-trained models from individual developers, due to the lack of\nincentives. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by building up a model\nmarketplace, called as Golden Grain, to facilitate model sharing, which\nenforces the fair model-money swapping process between individual developers\nand MLaaS providers. Specifically, we deploy the swapping process on the\nblockchain, and further introduce a blockchain-empowered model benchmarking\nprocess for transparently determining the model prices according to their\nauthentic performances, so as to motivate the faithful contributions of\nwell-trained models. Especially, to ease the blockchain overhead for model\nbenchmarking, our marketplace carefully offloads the heavy computation and\ndesigns a secure off-chain on-chain interaction protocol based on a trusted\nexecution environment (TEE), for ensuring both the integrity and authenticity\nof benchmarking.

Then, the average AoI, the AoI violation probability, and the peak AoI\nviolation probability are derived in a closed form so as to quantify the\nperformance of BeMN. Furthermore, a simplified form is derived for the AoI\nviolation probability, and it is shown that this quantity can capture the upper\nor lower bound of the actual AoI violation probability. Simulation results show\nthat each BeMN parameters (i.e., target successful transmission probability,\nblock size, and timeout) can have conflicting effects on the AoI-related\nperformance. Subsequently, design insights are provided to maintain the\nfreshness of the status data in BeMN. Then, experimental results with a real\nHyperledger Fabric platform further validate the accuracy of our modeling and\nanalysis.",

            "summary": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) offers an infrastructure made of smart\nmedical equipment and software applications for health services. Through the\ninternet, the IoMT is capable of providing remote medical diagnosis and timely\nhealth services. The patients can use their smart devices to create, store and\nshare their electronic health records (EHR) with a variety of medical personnel\nincluding medical doctors and nurses. However, unless the underlying\ncombination within IoMT is secured, malicious users can intercept, modify and\neven delete the sensitive EHR data of patients. Patients also lose full control\nof their EHR since most health services within IoMT are constructed under a\ncentralized platform outsourced in the cloud. Therefore, it is appealing to\ndesign a decentralized, auditable and secure EHR system that guarantees\nabsolute access control for the patients while ensuring privacy and security.\nUsing the features of blockchain including decentralization, auditability and\nimmutability, we propose a secure EHR framework which is mainly maintained by\nthe medical centers. In this framework, the patients' EHR data are encrypted\nand stored in the servers of medical institutions while the corresponding hash\nvalues are kept on the blockchain. We make use of security primitives to offer\nauthentication, integrity and confidentiality of EHR data while access control\nand immutability is guaranteed by the blockchain technology. The security\nanalysis and performance evaluation of the proposed framework confirms its\nefficiency.",

This paper aims to consider a new protocol,\nSecure-Repair-Blockchain (SRB), which aims to decrease the storage cost at the\nminers. In addition, SRB also decreases the bootstrapping cost, which allows\nfor new miners to easily join a sharded blockchain. In order to reduce storage,\ncoding-theoretic techniques are used in SRB. In order to decrease the amount of\ndata that is transferred to the new node joining a shard, the concept of exact\nrepair secure regenerating codes is used. The proposed blockchain protocol\nachieves lower storage than those that do not use coding, and achieves lower\nbootstrapping cost as compared to the different baselines.",

Although the use\nof blockchain is often discussed, it is simply a recording system, so there is\na risk that false records may be written to it.\n  As a solution, we propose a design in which a digitally signing,\nlocation-constrained and tamper-evident reader atomically writes an evidence to\nblockchain along with its reading and writing a tag.\n  By semi-formal modeling, we confirmed that the confidentiality and integrity\nof the information can be maintained throughout the system, and digitally\nsigned data can be verified later despite possible compromise of private keys\nor signature algorithms, or expiration of public key certificates. We also\nintroduce a prototype design to show that our proposal is viable.\n  This makes it possible to trace authentic logistics information using\ninexpensive passive RFID tags.

However, the development of secure IoT solutions is\ngetting a long way lagged behind, making us exposed to common unauthorized\naccesses that may bring malicious attacks and unprecedented danger to our daily\nlife. Overprivilege attack, a widely reported phenomenon in IoT that accesses\nunauthorized or excessive resources, is notoriously hard to prevent, trace and\nmitigate. To tackle this challenge, we propose Tokoin-Based Access Control\n(TBAC), an accountable access control model enabled by blockchain and Trusted\nExecution Environment (TEE) technologies, to offer fine-graininess, strong\nauditability, and access procedure control for IoT. TBAC materializes the\nvirtual access power into a definite-amount and secure cryptographic coin\ntermed \"tokoin\" (token+coin), and manages it using atomic and accountable\nstate-transition functions in a blockchain. We also realize access procedure\ncontrol by mandating every tokoin a fine-grained access policy defining who is\nallowed to do what at when in where by how. The tokoin is peer-to-peer\ntransferable, and can be modified only by the resource owner when necessary. We\nfully implement TBAC with well-studied cryptographic primitives and blockchain\nplatforms and present a readily available APP for regular users. We also\npresent a case study to demonstrate how TBAC is employed to enable autonomous\nin-home cargo delivery while guaranteeing the access policy compliance and home\nowner's physical security by regulating the physical behaviors of the\ndeliveryman.",

We present\nthe Smart Corpus' design and its initial implementation and we show how the\ndata-set of smart contracts' source code in a variety of programming languages\ncan be queried and processed, get useful information on smart contracts and\ntheir software metrics. The Smart Corpus aims to create a smart-contracts'\nrepository where smart contracts data (source code, ABI and byte-code) are\nfreely and immediately available and also classified based on the main software\nmetrics identified in the scientific literature. Smart-contracts source code\nhas been validated by EtherScan and each contract comes with its own associated\nsoftware metrics as computed by the freely available software PASO.

            "summary": "With upcoming blockchain infrastructures, world-spanning Byzantine consensus\nis getting practical and necessary. In geographically distributed systems, the\npace at which consensus is achieved is limited by the heterogenous latencies of\nconnections between replicas. If deployed on a wide-area network,\nconsensus-based systems benefit from weighted replication, an approach that\nutilizes extra replicas and assigns higher voting power to well connected\nreplicas. This enables more choice in quorum formation and replicas can\nleverage proportionally smaller quorums to advance, thus decreasing consensus\nlatency. However, the system needs a solution to autonomously adjust to its\nenvironment if network conditions change or faults occur. We present Adaptive\nWide-Area REplication (AWARE), a mechanism which improves the geographical\nscalability of consensus with nodes being widely spread across the world.\nEssentially, AWARE is an automated and dynamic voting weight tuning and leader\npositioning scheme, which supports the emergence of fast quorums in the system.\nIt employs a reliable self-monitoring process and provides a prediction model\nseeking to minimize the system's consensus latency. In experiments using\nseveral AWS EC2 regions, AWARE dynamically optimizes consensus latency by\nself-reliantly finding a fast weight configuration yielding latency gains\nobserved by clients located across the globe.",

            "summary": "Received wisdom portrays digital records as guaranteeing perpetuity; as the\nNew York Times wrote a decade ago: \"the web means the end of forgetting\". The\nreality however is that digital records suffer similar risks of access loss as\nthe analogue versions they replace. Often this risk is outsourced to\nspecialised third parties. Common use cases include Personal Information\nManagement (PIM): e.g. calendars, diaries, tasks, etc. Frequently these are\noutsourced at two removes - firstly by the individual to their employer (e.g.\nusing a company system) and then by their employer to an external provider. So\nenters a new risk: organisational change; by the time the information is\nrequired the organisational chain that links user to data may be broken: the\nemployer transitions to a different provider, the employee leaves the company,\nthe IS provider pivots to new offerings. The advent of Distributed Ledger\nTechnology (DLT) could help mitigate these risks; and has led to a\nre-evaluation of the relationship between data creation and ownership. Although\nDLT is an imprecise term, it typically involves data storage across\norganisationally separate entities in a cryptographically secure form; and\ntherefore could present a partial solution to the risk. This project presents\nthe first research that applies DLT to the field of PIM, furthering design\nscience state of the art by a novel implementation of a calendar application on\nthe Ethereum blockchain. It also extends current research in utilising DLT in\ndigital preservation, namely by enacting a continuum approach within a DL that\nallows for transfer of ownership of digital objects as they transition from\nindividual to collective relevance. Finally it provides guidelines for future\nuse of DLT within digital preservation.",

Our solution creatively\nintegrates coding-theoretic designs inside of Merkle tree commitments to\nguarantee efficient and tamper-proof reconstruction; this solution is distinct\nfrom Asynchronous Verifiable Information Dispersal (in guaranteeing efficient\nproofs of malformed coding) and Coded Merkle Tree (which only provides\nguarantees for random corruption as opposed to our guarantees for worst-case\ncorruption). We implement ACeD with full functionality in 6000 lines of Rust\ncode, integrate the functionality as a smart contract into Ethereum via a\nhigh-performance implementation demonstrating up to 10,000 transactions per\nsecond in throughput and 6000x reduction in gas cost on the Ethereum testnet\nKovan.",

Second, we employ\ndistributed storage techniques in the propagation of blocks, improving latency\nunder restricted bandwidth.

            "summary": "Blockchain is an incrementally updated ledger maintained by distributed nodes\nrather than centralized organizations. The current blockchain technology faces\nscalability issues, which include two aspects: low transaction throughput and\nhigh storage capacity costs. This paper studies the blockchain structure based\non state sharding technology, and mainly solves the problem of non-scalability\nof block chain storage. This paper designs and implements the blockchain state\nsharding scheme, proposes a specific state sharding data structure and\nalgorithm implementation, and realizes a complete blockchain structure so that\nthe blockchain has the advantages of high throughput, processing a large number\nof transactions and saving storage costs. Experimental results show that a\nblockchain network with more than 100,000 nodes can be divided into 1024\nshards. A blockchain network with this structure can process 500,000\ntransactions in about 5 seconds. If the consensus time of the blockchain is\nabout 10 seconds, and the block generation time of the blockchain system of the\nsharding mechanism is 15 seconds, the transaction throughput can reach 33,000\ntx/sec. Experimental results show that the throughput of the proposed protocol\nincreases with the increase of the network node size. This confirms the\nscalability of the blockchain structure based on sharding technology.",

With the help of the latest\nstatistical physics methods the non-linear correlations and multiscale\ncharacteristics of the cryptocurrency market are analyzed. In the last part the\nco-evolution of the correlation structure among the 100 cryptocurrencies having\nthe largest capitalization is retraced. The detailed topology of cryptocurrency\nnetwork on the Binance platform from bitcoin perspective is also considered.\nFinally, an interesting observation on the Covid-19 pandemic impact on the\ncryptocurrency market is presented and discussed: recently we have witnessed a\n\"phase transition\" of the cryptocurrencies from being a hedge opportunity for\nthe investors fleeing the traditional markets to become a part of the global\nmarket that is substantially coupled to the traditional financial instruments\nlike the currencies, stocks, and commodities.\n  The main contribution is an extensive demonstration that structural\nself-organization in the cryptocurrency markets has caused the same to attain\ncomplexity characteristics that are nearly indistinguishable from the Forex\nmarket at the level of individual time-series. However, the cross-correlations\nbetween the exchange rates on cryptocurrency platforms differ from it. The\ncryptocurrency market is less synchronized and the information flows more\nslowly, which results in more frequent arbitrage opportunities. The methodology\nused in the review allows the latter to be detected, and lead-lag relationships\nto be discovered.",

The approach eliminates the reliance on the centralized and heavily\nintermediated mechanisms of existing payment applications. The construction\nprogress is stored in a distributed manner using content addressable file\nsharing; it is broadcasted to a smart contract which automates the on-chain\npayment settlements and the transfer of lien rights. The method was\nsuccessfully used for processing payments to 7 subcontractors in two commercial\nconstruction projects where progress monitoring was performed using a\ncamera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle\n(UGV) equipped with a laser scanner. The results show promise for the method's\npotential for increasing the frequency, granularity, and transparency of\npayments.

            "summary": "The on-demand mobility market, including ridesharing, is becoming\nincreasingly important with e-hailing fares growing at a rate of approximately\n130% per annum since 2013. By increasing utilization of existing vehicles and\nempty seats, ridesharing can provide many benefits including reduced traffic\ncongestion and environmental impact from vehicle usage and production. However,\nthe safety of riders and drivers has become of paramount concern and a method\nfor privacy-preserving identity verification between untrusted parties is\nessential for protecting users. To this end, we propose a novel\nprivacy-preserving identity verification system, extending zero-knowledge proof\n(ZKP) and blockchain for use in ridesharing applications. We design a\npermissioned blockchain network to perform the ZKP verification of a driver's\nidentity, which also acts as an immutable ledger to store ride logs and ZKP\nrecords. For the ZKP module, we design a protocol to facilitate user\nverification without requiring the exchange of any private information. We\nprototype the proposed system on the Hyperledger Fabric platform, with the\nHyperledger Ursa cryptography library, and conduct extensive experimentation.\nTo measure the prototype's performance, we utilize the Hyperledger Caliper\nbenchmark tool to perform extensive analysis and the results show that our\nsystem is suitable for use in real-world ridesharing applications.",

            "summary": "Longest-chain blockchain protocols, such as Bitcoin, guarantee liveness even\nwhen the number of actively participating users is variable, i.e., they are\nadaptive. However, they are not safe under network partitions, i.e., they do\nnot guarantee finality. On the other hand, classical blockchain protocols, like\nPBFT, achieve finality but not adaptivity. Indeed, the CAP theorem in the\ncontext of blockchains asserts that no protocol can simultaneously offer both\nadaptivity and finality.\n  We propose a new blockchain protocol, called the checkpointed longest chain,\nthat offers individual users the choice between finality and adaptivity instead\nof imposing it at a system-wide level. This protocol's salient feature is that\nit supports two distinct confirmation rules: one that guarantees adaptivity and\nthe other finality. The more optimistic adaptive rule always confirms blocks\nthat are marked as finalized by the more conservative rule, and may possibly\nconfirm more blocks during variable participation levels. Clients (users) make\na local choice between the confirmation rules as per their personal preference,\nwhile miners follow a fixed block proposal rule that is consistent with both\nconfirmation rules. The proposed protocol has the additional benefit of\nintrinsic validity: the finalized blocks always lie on a single blockchain, and\ntherefore miners can attest to the validity of transactions while proposing\nblocks. Our protocol builds on the notion of a finality gadget, a popular\ntechnique for adding finality to longest-chain protocols.",

As a result, current\nresearch and development in this field is focused mainly on smart contract\napplications that use on-chain smart contracts. We argue that there is a large\nclass of smart contract applications where on-TTP smart contracts are a better\nalternative. The problem with on-chain smart contracts is that the fully\ndecentralised model and indelible append-only data model followed by\nblockchains introduces several engineering problems that are hard to solve. In\nthese situations, the inclusion of a TTP (assuming that the application can\ntolerate its inconveniences) instead of a blockchain to host the smart contract\nsimplifies the problems and offers pragmatic solutions. The intention and\ncontribution of this paper is to shed some light on this issue.

            "summary": "Smart contract-enabled blockchains allow building decentralized applications\nin which mutually-distrusted parties can work together. Recently, oracle\nservices emerged to provide these applications with real-world data feeds.\nUnfortunately, these capabilities have been used for malicious purposes under\nwhat is called criminal smart contracts. A few works explored this dark side\nand showed a variety of such attacks. However, none of them considered\ncollaborative attacks against targets that reside outside the blockchain\necosystem. In this paper, we bridge this gap and introduce a smart\ncontract-based framework that allows a sponsor to orchestrate a collaborative\nattack among (pseudo)anonymous attackers and reward them for that. While all\nprevious works required a technique to quantify an attacker's individual\ncontribution, which could be infeasible with respect to real-world targets, our\nframework avoids that. This is done by developing a novel scheme for trustless\ncollaboration through betting. That is, attackers bet on an event (i.e., the\nattack takes place) and then work on making that event happen (i.e., perform\nthe attack). By taking DDoS as a usecase, we formulate attackers' interaction\nas a game, and formally prove that these attackers will collaborate in\nproportion to the amount of their bets in the game's unique equilibrium. We\nalso model our framework and its reward function as an incentive mechanism and\nprove that it is a strategy proof and budget-balanced one. Finally, we conduct\nnumerical simulations to demonstrate the equilibrium behavior of our framework.",

The latter is provided by IoT devices\nauthorizing the SC to issue payment to a distributor when the required\nconditions are met. These conditions include the requirement for a distributor\nto generate a zero-knowledge proof, generated with a novel proving system\ncalled zk-SNARKs. Compared with related work, CrowdPatching protocol offers\nthree main advantages. First, the number of distributors can scale indefinitely\nby enabling the addition of new distributors at any time after the initial\ndistribution by manufacturers (i.e., redistribution among the distributor\nnetwork). The latter is not possible in existing protocols and is not account\nfor. Secondly, we leverage the recent common integration of gateway or Hub in\nIoT deployments in our protocol to make CrowdPatching feasible even for the\nmore constraint IoT devices.

This regulation model\naims to protect users' data from misusage and leakage and allow users to\nrequest an explanation from companies when needed. In pandemic situations, such\nas the COVID-19 and Ebola outbreak, the action related to sharing health data\nbetween different organizations is/ was crucial to develop a significant\nmovement to avoid the massive infection and decrease the number of deaths.\nHowever, the data subject, i.e., the users, should have the right to request\nthe purpose of data use, anonymization, and data deletion. In this sense,\npermissioned blockchain technology emerges to empower users to get their rights\nproviding data ownership, transparency, and security through an immutable,\nunified, and distributed database ruled by smart contracts. The governance\nmodel discussed in blockchain applications is usually regarding the first layer\ngovernance, i.e., public and permissioned models. However, this discussion is\ntoo superficial, and they do not cover compliance with the data regulations.\nTherefore, in order to organize the relationship between data owners and the\nstakeholders, i.e., companies and governmental entities, we developed a second\nlayer data governance model for permissioned blockchains based on the\nGovernance Analytical Framework principles applied in pandemic situations\npreserving the users' privacy and their duties.

A set of results and findings are obtained, which provide new\ninsight into understanding the transaction and traffic characteristics of\nBitcoin. As a highlight, the validity of several hypotheses/assumptions used in\nthe literature is examined with measurement for the first time.",

            "summary": "The availability-finality dilemma says that blockchain protocols cannot be\nboth available under dynamic participation and safe under network partition.\nSnap-and-chat protocols have recently been proposed as a resolution to this\ndilemma. A snap-and-chat protocol produces an always available ledger\ncontaining a finalized prefix ledger which is always safe and catches up with\nthe available ledger whenever network conditions permit. In contrast to\nexisting handcrafted finality gadget based designs like Ethereum 2.0's\nconsensus protocol Gasper, snap-and-chat protocols are constructed as a\nblack-box composition of off-the-shelf BFT and longest chain protocols. In this\npaper, we consider system aspects of snap-and-chat protocols and show how they\ncan provide two important features: 1) accountability, 2) support of light\nclients. Through this investigation, a deeper understanding of the strengths\nand challenges of snap-and-chat protocols is gained.",

It might result in a\nhigh risk to individual and health information handling rights and\nopportunities unless there is a palatable defense. Reasonable security\nstandards are needed to protect electronic health records (EHR). All personal\ndata handling needs adequate explanation. Maintaining access to medical data\neven in the developing world would favor health and well-being across the\nworld. Unfortunately, there are still countries that hinder the portability of\nmedical records. Numerous occurrences have shown that it still takes weeks for\nthe medical data to be ported from one general physician (GP) to another. Cross\nborder portability is nearly impossible due to the lack of technical\ninfrastructure and standardization. We demonstrate the difficulty of the\nportability of medical records with some example case studies as a\ncollaborative engagement exercise through a data mapping process to describe\nhow different people and datapoints interact and evaluate EHR portability\ntechniques. We then propose a blockchain-based EHR system that allows secure,\nand cross border sharing of medical data.

            "summary": "In today's world, social networks have become one of the primary sources for\ncreation and propagation of news. Social news aggregators are one of the actors\nin this area in which users post news items and use positive or negative votes\nto indicate their preference toward a news item. News items will be ordered and\ndisplayed according to their aggregated votes. This approach suffers from\nseveral problems raging from being prone to the dominance of the majority to\ndifficulty in discerning between correct and fake news, and lack of incentive\nfor honest behaviors. In this paper, we propose a graph-based news aggregator\nin which instead of voting on the news items, users submit their votes on the\nrelations between pairs of news items. More precisely, if a user believes two\nnews items support each other, he will submit a positive vote on the link\nbetween the two items, and if he believes that two news items undermine each\nother, he will submit a negative vote on the corresponding link. This approach\nhas mainly two desirable features: (1) mitigating the effect of personal\npreferences on voting, (2) connection of new items to endorsing and disputing\nevidence. This approach helps the newsreaders to understand different aspects\nof a news item better. We also introduce an incentive layer that uses\nblockchain as a distributed transparent manager to encourages users to behave\nhonestly and abstain from adversary behaviors. The incentive layer takes into\naccount that users can have different viewpoints toward news, enabling users\nfrom a wide range of viewpoints to contribute to the network and benefit from\nits rewards. In addition, we introduce a protocol that enables us to prove\nfraud in computations of the incentive layer model on the blockchain.\nUltimately, we will analyze the fraud proof protocol and examine our incentive\nlayer on a wide range of synthesized datasets.",

A blockchain\nensures that all entities in the voting system have the same view of the\nactions made by others due to its immutability and append-only features. The\nexisting remote blockchain-based boardroom voting solution called Open Voting\nNetwork (OVN) provides the privacy of votes, universal & End-to-End\nverifiability, and perfect ballot secrecy; however, it supports only two\nchoices and lacks robustness enabling recovery from stalling participants.\n  We present BBB-Voting, an equivalent blockchain-based approach for\ndecentralized voting such as OVN, but in contrast to it, BBB-Voting supports\n1-out-of-$k$ choices and provides robustness that enables recovery from\nstalling participants. We make a cost-optimized implementation using an\nEthereum-based environment respecting Ethereum Enterprise Alliance standards,\nwhich we compare with OVN and show that our work decreases the costs for voters\nby 13.5% in normalized gas consumption. Finally, we show how BBB-Voting can be\nextended to support the number of participants limited only by the expenses\npaid by the authority and the computing power to obtain the tally.",

In this paper, we propose a\nblockchain based decentralized framework for detecting coordinated replay\nattacks with full privacy of sensor data. We develop a Bayesian inference\nmechanism employing locally reported attack probabilities that is tailor made\nfor a blockchain framework. We compare our framework to a traditional\ndecentralized algorithm based on the broadcast gossip framework both\ntheoretically as well as empirically.

As they allow processing\ntransactions off-chain, payment channel networks are referred to as second\nlayer technology, while the blockchain is the first layer. We uncouple payment\nchannel networks from blockchains and look at them as first-class citizens.\nThis brings up the question what model payment channel networks require as\nfirst layer. In response, we formalize a model (called RFL Model) for a first\nlayer below a payment channel network. While transactions are globally made\navailable by a blockchain, the RFL Model only provides the reduced property\nthat a transaction is delivered to the users being affected by a transaction.\nWe show that the reduced model's properties still suffice to implement payment\nchannels. By showing that the RFL Model can not only be instantiated by the\nBitcoin blockchain but also by trusted third parties like banks, we show that\nthe reduction widens the design space for the first layer. Further, we show\nthat the stronger property provided by blockchains allows for optimizations\nthat can be used to reduce the time for locking collateral during payments over\nmultiple hops in a payment channel network.",

Clearly, this introduces barriers\nto the adoption of the technology by the enterprise world, where preserving the\nprivacy of the business data is a necessity. Previous efforts to bring privacy\nand blockchains together either still leak partial information, are restricted\nin their functionality or use costly mechanisms like zk-SNARKs. In this paper,\nwe propose the Multi-Shard Private Transaction (MSPT) protocol, a novel\nprivacy-preserving protocol for permissioned blockchains, which relies only on\nsimple cryptographic primitives and targeted dissemination of information to\nachieve atomicity and high performances.",

            "summary": "Large commercial buildings are complex cyber-physical systems containing\nexpensive and critical equipment that ensure the safety and comfort of their\nnumerous occupants. Yet occupant and visitor access to spaces and equipment\nwithin these buildings are still managed through unsystematic, inefficient, and\nhuman-intensive processes. As a standard practice, long-term building occupants\nare given access privileges to rooms and equipment based on their\norganizational roles, while visitors have to be escorted by their hosts. This\napproach is conservative and inflexible. In this paper, we describe a\nmethodology that can flexibly and securely manage building access privileges\nfor long-term occupants and short-term visitors alike, taking into account the\nrisk associated with accessing each space within the building. Our methodology\nrelies on blockchain smart contracts to describe, grant, audit, and revoke\nfine-grained permissions for building occupants and visitors, in a\ndecentralized fashion. The smart contracts are specified through a process that\nleverages the information compiled from Brick and BOT models of the building.\nWe illustrate the proposed method through a typical application scenario in the\ncontext of a real office building and argue that it can greatly reduce the\nadministration overhead, while, at the same time, providing fine-grained,\nauditable access control.",

            "summary": "To mitigate the scalability problem of decentralized cryptocurrencies such as\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the payment channel, which allows two parties to perform\nsecure coin transfers without involving the blockchain, has been proposed. The\npayment channel increases the transaction throughput of two parties to a level\nthat is only limited by their network bandwidth. Recent proposals focus on\nextending the two-party payment channel to the N-party payment hub.\nUnfortunately, none of them can achieve efficiency, flexibility in the absence\nof a trusted third-party. In this paper, we propose Garou, a secure N-party\npayment hub that allows multiple parties to perform secure off-chain coin\ntransfers. Except in the case of disputes, participants within the payment hub\ncan make concurrent and direct coin transfers with each other without the\ninvolvement of the blockchain or any third-party intermediaries. This allows\nGarou to achieve both high-performance and flexibility. Garou also guarantees\nthat an honest party always maintains its balance security against strong\nadversarial capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of the Garou protocol,\nwe develop a proof of concept prototype for the Ethereum network. Our\nevaluation results show that the maximum transaction throughput of Garou is 20\ntimes higher than that of state-of-art payment hubs.",

Therefore, analysis of multiple security data can provide\ncomprehensive and system-wide anomaly detection in industrial networks. In this\npaper, we propose an anomaly detection framework for ICSs that consists of two\nstages: i) blockchain-based log management where the logs of ICS devices are\ncollected in a secure and distributed manner, and ii) multi-source anomaly\ndetection where the blockchain logs are analysed using multi-source deep\nlearning which in turn provides a system wide anomaly detection method.\n  We validated our framework using two ICS datasets: a factory automation\ndataset and a Secure Water Treatment (SWAT) dataset. These datasets contain\nphysical and network level normal and abnormal traffic. The performance of our\nnew framework is compared with single-source machine learning methods. The\nprecision of our framework is 95% which is comparable with single-source\nanomaly detectors.",

By executing FL, a set of agents can jointly train a model without\nsharing their datasets with each other, or a third-party. This makes FL\nparticularly suitable for settings where data privacy is desired.\n  At the same time, concealing training data gives attackers an opportunity to\ninject backdoors into the trained model. It has been shown that an attacker can\ninject backdoors to the trained model during FL, and then can leverage the\nbackdoor to make the model misclassify later. Several works tried to alleviate\nthis threat by designing robust aggregation functions. However, given more\nsophisticated attacks are developed over time, which by-pass the existing\ndefenses, we approach this problem from a complementary angle in this work.\nParticularly, we aim to discourage backdoor attacks by detecting, and punishing\nthe attackers, possibly after the end of training phase.\n  To this end, we develop a hybrid blockchain-based FL framework that uses\nsmart contracts to automatically detect, and punish the attackers via monetary\npenalties. Our framework is general in the sense that, any aggregation\nfunction, and any attacker detection algorithm can be plugged into it. We\nconduct experiments to demonstrate that our framework preserves the\ncommunication-efficient nature of FL, and provide empirical results to\nillustrate that it can successfully penalize attackers by leveraging our novel\nattacker detection algorithm.",

Light nodes are vulnerable to data availability\n(DA) attacks where a malicious node hides an invalid portion of the block from\nthe light nodes. Recently, a technique based on erasure codes called Coded\nMerkle Tree (CMT) was proposed by Yu et al. that enables light nodes to detect\na DA attack with high probability. The CMT is constructed using LDPC codes for\nfast decoding but can fail to detect a DA attack if a malicious node hides a\nsmall stopping set of the code. To combat this, Yu et al. used well-studied\ntechniques to design random LDPC codes with high minimum stopping set size.\nAlthough effective, these codes are not necessarily optimal for this\napplication. In this paper, we demonstrate a more specialized LDPC code design\nto improve the security against DA attacks. We achieve this goal by providing a\ndeterministic LDPC code construction that focuses on concentrating stopping\nsets to a small group of variable nodes rather than only eliminating stopping\nsets. We design these codes by modifying the Progressive Edge Growth algorithm\ninto a technique called the entropy-constrained PEG (EC-PEG) algorithm. This\nnew method demonstrates a higher probability of detecting DA attacks and allows\nfor good codes at short lengths.",

Despite being lightweight, Blockene provides a\nhigh throughput of transactions and scales to a large number of participants.\nBlockene consumes negligible battery and data in smartphones, enabling millions\nof users to participate in the blockchain without incentives, to secure\ntransactions with their collective honesty. Blockene achieves these properties\nwith a novel split-trust design based on delegating storage and gossip to\nuntrusted nodes.\n  We show, with a prototype implementation, that Blockene provides throughput\nof 1045 transactions/sec, and runs with very low resource usage on smartphones,\npointing to a new paradigm for building secure, decentralized applications.",

            "summary": "In Tendermint blockchains, the proof-of-stake mechanism and the underlying\nconsensus algorithm entail a dynamic fault model that implies that the active\nvalidators (nodes that sign blocks) may change over time, and a quorum of these\nvalidators is assumed to be correct only for a limited period of time (called\ntrusting period). The changes of the validator set are under control of the\nblockchain application, and are committed in every block. In order to check\nwhat is the state of the blockchain application at some height h, one needs to\nknow the validator set at that height so that one can verify the corresponding\ndigital signatures and hashes. A naive way of determining the validator set for\nheight h requires one to: (i) download all blocks before h, (ii) verify blocks\nby checking digital signatures and hashes and (iii) execute the corresponding\ntransactions so the changes in the validator sets are reproduced. This can\npotentially be very slow and computationally and data intensive.\n  In this paper we formalize the dynamic fault model imposed by Tendermint, and\ndescribe a light client protocol that allows to check the state of the\nblockchain application that, in realistic settings, reduces significantly the\namount of data needed to be downloaded, and the number of required\ncomputationally expensive signature verification operations. In addition to\nmathematical proofs, we have formalized the light client protocol in TLA+, and\nchecked safety and liveness with the APALACHE model checker.",

            "summary": "Hyperledger Fabric is a prominent and flexible solution for building\npermissioned distributed ledger platforms. Access control and identity\nmanagement relies on a Membership Service Provider (MSP) whose cryptographic\ninterface only handles standard PKI methods for authentication: RSA and ECDSA\nclassical signatures. Also, MSP-issued credentials may use only one signature\nscheme, tying the credential-related functions to classical single-signature\nprimitives. RSA and ECDSA are vulnerable to quantum attacks, with an ongoing\npost-quantum standardization process to identify quantum-safe drop-in\nreplacements. In this paper, we propose a redesign of Fabric's\ncredential-management procedures and related specifications in order to\nincorporate hybrid digital signatures, protecting against both classical and\nquantum attacks using one classical and one quantum-safe signature. We create\nPQFabric, an implementation of Fabric with hybrid signatures that integrates\nwith the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library. Our implementation offers complete\ncrypto-agility, with the ability to perform live migration to a hybrid\nquantum-safe blockchain and select any existing OQS signature algorithm for\neach node. We perform comparative benchmarks of PQFabric with each of the NIST\ncandidates and alternates, revealing that long public keys and signatures lead\nto an increase in hashing time that is sometimes comparable to the time spent\nsigning or verifying messages itself. This is a new and potentially significant\nissue in the migration of blockchains to post-quantum signatures.",

In comparison, a decentralized\napproach based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enables data trading\nwhile ensuring trust, security, and privacy.

The size of the bitcoin\nblockchain is growing linearly with transactions. We propose a new block\nstructure to represent the state of a blockchain also called UTXO set by\nincluding an accumulator of a state in the block header and proofs of knowledge\nfor inclusion and deletion of the transactions of the current block in the\nblock. In our scheme, the miners periodically release a snapshot of the\nblockchain state. The other full nodes in the network, securely prune the\nhistorical blocks after attaining the required number of confirmations for the\nsnapshot block, which in turn confirms the snapshot of the state through an\naccumulator specified in the block header and proofs inside the block. The\nsecure and periodic pruning of the old blocks, reduce the synchronization time\nfor a new node joining into the network. The simulation results demonstrate a\nsignificant reduction in the storage space of a full node and bootstrapping\ncost of the new nodes.",

In the first approach, a\nmathematical model has derived for optimal transaction throughput for PoW based\nlongest chain rule blockchain. In this approach, the blockchain Peer-to-Peer\n(P2P) network is considered as Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi random network topology. This\napproach is however limited by the block creation rate, the results suggest\nthat the rate beyond an optimal point can result in unfairness in the system.\nThe second approach is a new consensus protocol proposed by considering the\nledger as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) called blockDAG instead of a chain of\nblocks. In this framework, we follow a two-step strategy that makes the system\nrobust enough to handle the double-spend attacks. The first step involves the\ndevelopment of an unsupervised learning graph clustering algorithm for\nseparating the blocks created by an attacker. In the second step, the attackers\nblocks are eliminated and the remaining blocks are arranged in topological\norder by honest clients which makes the blockDAG system suitable for smart\ncontract applications found in Internet of Things (IoT) services.

Equally motivating, they will be able to barter and\nre-introduce to the economy items that they no longer need such as, books,\ngarden tools, and bikes which are normally kept and wasted in garages and\nsheds. We argue that most of the pieces of technology needed for building a\nbarter system are now available, including blockchains, smart contracts,\ncryptography, secure multiparty computations and fair exchange protocols.\nHowever, additional research is needed to refine and integrate the pieces\ntogether.

            "summary": "Today's world is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, as one of the\ngreatest challenges of the 21st century. During the lockdown caused by this\ndisease, many financial losses have been inflicted on people and all\nindustries. One of the fastest ways to save these industries from the COVID-19\nis to provide a reliable solution for people's health assessment. In this\narticle, blockchain technology is used to propose a model which provides and\nvalidates the health certificates for people who travel or present in society.\nFor this purpose, we take advantage of blockchain features in protecting\npeople's privacy. Since a variety of antibody and human health proving tests\nagainst the virus are developing, this study tries simultaneously to design an\nintegrated and secure system to meet the authenticity and accuracy of different\npeople's health certificates for the companies requiring these certifications.\nIn this system, on the one hand, there are qualified laboratories that are\nresponsible for performing standard testing and also providing results to the\nsystem controller. Finally, people are considered as the end-user of the\nsystem. To provide test information for the entities, the mechanism of KYC\ntokens will be used based on the Stellar private blockchain network. In this\nmechanism, the user will buy a certain amount of KYC tokens from the system\ncontroller. These tokens are charged in the user's wallet, and the user can\nsend these tokens from his wallet to any destination company, to exchange the\nencrypted health certificate information. Finally, considering the appropriate\nplatform provided by blockchain technology and the requirement of a reliable\nand accurate solution for issuing health certificates during the Covid-19\npandemic or any other disease, this article offers a solution to meet the\nrequirements.",

Robots are a promising technology for providing many tasks such as\nspraying, disinfection, cleaning, treating, detecting high body\ntemperature/mask absence, and delivering goods and medical supplies\nexperiencing an epidemic COVID-19. For combating COVID-19, many heterogeneous\nand homogenous robots are required to perform different tasks for supporting\ndifferent purposes in the quarantine area.

Blockchain technology can manage\nmulti-robot collaboration in a decentralized fashion, improve the interaction\namong them to exchange information, share representation, share goals, and\ntrust. We highlight the challenges and provide the tactical solutions enabled\nby integrating blockchain and multi-robot collaboration to combat COVID-19\npandemic.

            "summary": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming more and more popular in our daily life,\nwhich replaces traditional fuel vehicles to reduce carbon emissions and protect\nthe environment. EVs need to be charged, but the number of charging piles in a\nCharging Station (CS) is limited and charging is usually more time-consuming\nthan fueling. According to this scenario, we propose a secure and efficient\ncharging scheduling system based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-blockchain\nand double auction mechanism. In a smart area, it attempts to assign EVs to the\navailable CSs in the light of their submitted charging requests and status\ninformation. First, we design a lightweight charging scheduling framework that\nintegrates DAG-blockchain and modern cryptography technology to ensure security\nand scalability during performing scheduling and completing tradings. In this\nprocess, a constrained multi-item double auction problem is formulated because\nof the limited charging resources in a CS, which motivates EVs and CSs in this\narea to participate in the market based on their preferences and statuses. Due\nto this constraint, our problem is more complicated and harder to achieve\ntruthfulness as well as system efficiency compared to the existing double\nauction model. To adapt to it, we propose two algorithms, namely Truthful\nMechanism for Charging (TMC) and Efficient Mechanism for Charging (EMC), to\ndetermine an assignment between EVs and CSs and pricing strategies. Then, both\ntheoretical analysis and numerical simulations show the correctness and\neffectiveness of our proposed algorithms.",

The P2P network topologies of popular blockchains such as Bitcoin and\nEthereum, therefore, deserve our highest attention. The current Ethereum\nblockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan) focus on the tracking of block and\ntransaction records but omit the characterization of the underlying P2P\nnetwork. This work presents the Ethereum Network Analyzer (Ethna), a tool that\nprobes and analyzes the P2P network of the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin\nthat adopts an unstructured P2P network, Ethereum relies on the Kademlia DHT to\nmanage its P2P network. Therefore, the existing analytical methods for\nBitcoin-like P2P networks are not applicable to Ethereum. Ethna implements a\nnovel method that accurately measures the degrees of Ethereum nodes.\nFurthermore, it incorporates an algorithm that derives the latency metrics of\nmessage propagation in the Ethereum P2P network. We ran Ethna on the Ethereum\nMainnet and conducted extensive experiments to analyze the topological features\nof its P2P network. Our analysis shows that the Ethereum P2P network possesses\na certain effect of small-world networks, and the degrees of nodes follow a\npower-law distribution that characterizes scale-free networks.",

Due to\nits credibility and tamper resistance, blockchain has been applied to copyright\nprotection. Previous works mainly utilized blockchain for reliable copyright\ninformation storage or copyrighted digital media trading. As far as we know,\nthe problem of credible copyright detection has not been addressed. In this\npaper, we propose a credible copyright detection architecture based on the\nblockchain, called DCDChain. In this architecture, the detection agency first\ndetects copyrights off the chain, then uploads the detection records to the\nblockchain. Since data on the blockchain are publicly accessible, media\nproviders can verify the correctness of the copyright detection, and appeal to\na smart contract if there is any dissent. The smart contract then arbitrates\nthe disputes by verifying the correctness of detection on the chain. The\ndetect-verify-and-arbitrate mechanism guarantees the credibility of copyright\ndetection. Security analysis and experimental simulations show that the digital\ncopyright detection architecture is credible, secure and efficient. The\nproposed credible copyright detection scheme is highly important for copyright\nprotection. The future work is to improve the scheme by designing more\neffective locality sensitive hash algorithms for various digital media.",

Although\nblockchain has commonly been used as the operational model behind\ncryptocurrency, it has far more foreseeable utilities in domains like\nhealthcare, where efficient data flow is highly demanded. Particularly,\nblockchain and related technologies have been touted as foundational\ntechnologies for addressing healthcare interoperability challenges, such as\npromoting effective communications and securing data exchanges across various\nhealthcare systems. Despite the increasing interests in leveraging blockchain\ntechnology to improve healthcare infrastructures, a major gap in literature is\nthe lack of available recommendations for concrete architectural styles and\ndesign considerations for creating blockchain-based apps and systems with a\nhealthcare focus. This research provides two contributions to bridge the gap in\nexisting research. First, we introduce a pattern sequence for designing\nblockchain-based healthcare systems focused on secure and at-scale data\nexchange. Our approach adapts traditional software patterns and proposes novel\npatterns that take into account both the technical requirements specific to\nhealthcare systems and the implications of these requirements on naive\nblockchain-based solutions. Second, we provide a pattern-oriented reference\narchitecture using an example application of the pattern sequence for guiding\nsoftware developers to design interoperable (on the technical level) healthcare\nIT systems atop blockchain-based infrastructures. The reference architecture\nfocuses on minimizing storage requirements on-chain, preserving the privacy of\nsensitive information, facilitating scalable communications, and maximizing\nevolvability of the system.",

            "summary": "Recent attacks exploiting errors in smart contract code had devastating\nconsequences thereby questioning the benefits of this technology. It is\ncurrently highly challenging to fix errors and deploy a patched contract in\ntime. Instant patching is especially important since smart contracts are always\nonline due to the distributed nature of blockchain systems. They also manage\nconsiderable amounts of assets, which are at risk and often beyond recovery\nafter an attack. Existing solutions to upgrade smart contracts depend on manual\nand error-prone processes. This paper presents a framework, called EVMPatch, to\ninstantly and automatically patch faulty smart contracts. EVMPatch features a\nbytecode rewriting engine for the popular Ethereum blockchain, and\ntransparently/automatically rewrites common off-the-shelf contracts to\nupgradable contracts. The proof-of-concept implementation of EVMPatch\nautomatically hardens smart contracts that are vulnerable to integer\nover/underflows and access control errors, but can be easily extended to cover\nmore bug classes. Our extensive evaluation on 14,000 real-world (vulnerable)\ncontracts demonstrate that our approach successfully blocks attack transactions\nlaunched on these contracts, while keeping the intended functionality of the\ncontract intact. We perform a study with experienced software developers,\nshowing that EVMPatch is practical, and reduces the time for converting a given\nSolidity smart contract to an upgradable contract by 97.6 %, while ensuring\nfunctional equivalence to the original contract.",

As a result, clients with limited resources, called light nodes, cannot\nverify transactions independently and must trust full nodes, making them\nvulnerable to security attacks. Motivated by this problem, we ask a fundamental\nquestion: can light nodes securely validate without any full nodes? We answer\naffirmatively by proposing CoVer, a decentralized protocol that allows a group\nof light nodes to collaboratively verify blocks even under a dishonest\nmajority, achieving the same level of security for block validation as full\nnodes while only requiring a fraction of the work. In particular, work per node\nscales down proportionally with the number of participants (up to a log\nfactor), resulting in computation, communication, and storage requirements that\nare sublinear in block size. Our main contributions are light-node-only\nprotocols for fraud proofs and data availability.",

Although it seems attractive to employ tokens as\ncountermeasures for cryptocurrency leakage, Mosaic is a specific token for the\nNew Economy Movement (NEM) cryptocurrency and is not employed for other\nblockchain systems or cryptocurrencies. Moreover, although some volunteers\ntracked leaked NEM using Mosaic in the CoinCheck incident, it would be better\nto verify that the volunteers can be trusted. Simultaneously, if someone (e.g.,\nwho stole cryptocurrencies) can identify the volunteers, then that person or\norganization may be targets of them.\n  In this paper, we propose an anonymous trust-marking scheme on blockchain\nsystems that is universally applicable to any cryptocurrency. In our scheme,\nentities called token admitters are allowed to generate tokens adding\ntrustworthiness or untrustworthiness to addresses. Anyone can anonymously\nverify whether these tokens were issued by a token admitter. Simultaneously,\nonly the designated auditor and no one else, including nondesignated auditors,\ncan identify the token admitters. Our scheme is based on accountable ring\nsignatures and commitment, and is implemented on an elliptic curve called\nCurve25519, and we confirm that both cryptographic tools are efficient.\nMoreover, we also confirm that our scheme is applicable to Bitcoin, Ethereum,\nand NEM.",

In this paper, we present the\nfirst in-depth empirical analysis of liquidations on protocols for loanable\nfunds (PLFs). We examine Compound, one of the most widely used PLFs, for a\nperiod starting from its conception to September 2020. We analyze participants'\nbehavior and risk-appetite in particular, to elucidate recent developments in\nthe dynamics of the protocol. Furthermore, we assess how this has changed with\na modification in Compound's incentive structure and show that variations of\nonly 3% in an asset's dollar price can result in over 10m USD becoming\nliquidable. To further understand the implications of this, we investigate the\nefficiency of liquidators. We find that liquidators' efficiency has improved\nsignificantly over time, with currently over 70% of liquidable positions being\nimmediately liquidated.

However recent studies have observed a trend\nof increased centralization in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nAs this increased centralization has an impact the security of the blockchain,\nit is crucial that it is measured, towards adequate control. This research\nderives an initial taxonomy of centralization present in decentralized\nblockchains through rigorous synthesis using a systematic literature review.\nThis is followed by iterative refinement through expert interviews. We\nsystematically analyzed 89 research papers published between 2009 and 2019. Our\nstudy contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the\nmultiple definitions and measurements of centralization in the literature. We\nidentify different aspects of centralization and propose an encompassing\ntaxonomy of centralization concerns. This taxonomy is based on empirically\nobservable and measurable characteristics. It consists of 13 aspects of\ncentralization classified over six architectural layers Governance Network\nConsensus Incentive Operational and Application. We also discuss how the\nimplications of centralization can vary depending on the aspects studied.

Many applications such as intelligent autonomous\nself-driving, smart agriculture and industrial solutions, and self-learning\nmultimedia content filtering and sharing have become attainable through\ncooperative, distributed and decentralized systems, namely, volunteer\ncomputing. This article introduces a blockchain-enabled resource sharing and\nservice composition solution through volunteer computing. Device resource,\ncomputing, and intelligence capabilities are advertised in the environment to\nbe made discoverable and available for sharing with the aid of blockchain\ntechnology. Incentives in the form of on-demand service availability are given\nto resource and service providers to ensure fair and balanced cooperative\nresource usage. Blockchains are formed whenever a service request is initiated\nwith the aid of fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) devices to ensure secure\ncommunication and service delivery for the participants. Using both volunteer\ncomputing techniques and tactile internet architectures, we devise a fast and\nreliable service provisioning framework that relies on a reinforcement learning\ntechnique. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve high\nreward distribution, increased number of blockchain formations, reduced delays,\nand balanced resource usage among participants, under the premise of high IoT\ndevice availability.",

            "summary": "Increasing awareness of privacy-preserving has led to a strong focus on\nanonymous systems protecting anonymity. By studying early schemes, we summarize\nsome intractable problems of anonymous systems. Centralization setting is a\nuniversal problem since most anonymous system rely on central proxies or\npresetting nodes to forward and mix messages, which compromises users' privacy\nin some way. Besides, availability becomes another important factor limiting\nthe development of anonymous system due to the large requirement of additional\nadditional resources (i.e. bandwidth and storage) and high latency. Moreover,\nexisting anonymous systems may suffer from different attacks including\nabominable Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, Distributed Denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attacks and so on. In this context, we first come up with a\nBlockChain-based Mix-Net (BCMN) protocol and theoretically demonstrate its\nsecurity and anonymity. Then we construct a concrete dynamic self-organizing\nBlockChain-based MIX anonymous system (BCMIX). In the system, users and mix\nnodes utilize the blockchain transactions and their addresses to negotiate keys\nwith each other, which can resist the MitM attacks. In addition, we design an\nIP sharding algorithm to mitigate Sybil attacks. To evaluate the BCMIX system,\nwe leverage the distribution of mining pools in the real world to test the\nsystem's performance and ability to resistant attacks. Compared with other\nsystems, BCMIX provides better resilience to known attacks, while achieving low\nlatency anonymous communication without significant bandwidth or storage\nresources.",

Thus, we first propose an intelligent ultra-dense\nedge computing (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) into 5G ultra-dense edge computing networks. First, we show\nthe architecture of the framework. Then, in order to achieve real-time and low\noverhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies,\nwe design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (\\textit{2Ts-DRL})\napproach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process,\nrespectively. The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay\nand network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading,\nresource allocation and service caching placement. We also leverage federated\nlearning (FL) to train the \\textit{2Ts-DRL} model in a distributed manner,\naiming to protect the edge devices' data privacy.

Researchers have been combining new technologies to make eHealth systems\nwork better for patients. The Blockchain-based eHealth system becomes popular\nbecause of its unique distributed tamper-resistant and privacy-preserving\nfeatures. However, due to the security issues of the blockchain system, there\nare many security risks in eHealth systems utilizing the blockchain technology.\ni.e. 51% attacks can destroy blockchain-based systems. Besides, trivial\ntransactions and frequent calls of smart contracts in the blockchain system\nbring additional costs and security risks to blockchain-based eHealth systems.\nWorse still, electronic medical records (EMRs) are controlled by medical\ninstitutions rather than patients, which causes privacy leakage issues. In this\npaper, we propose a medical data Sharing and Privacy-preserving eHealth system\nbased on blockChain technology (SPChain). We combine RepuCoin with the\nSNARKs-based chameleon hash function to resist underlying blockchain attacks,\nand design a new chain structure to make microblocks contribute to the weight\nof blockchain. The system allows patients to share their EMRs among different\nmedical institutions in a privacy-preserving way.

These fundamental differences have\nhindered \"apples-to-apples\" comparisons between different categories of\nblockchain protocols and, in turn, the development of theory to formally\ndiscuss their relative merits.\n  This paper presents a parsimonious abstraction sufficient for capturing and\ncomparing properties of many well-known permissionless blockchain protocols,\nsimultaneously capturing essential properties of both proof-of-work (PoW) and\nproof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, and of both longest-chain-type and BFT-type\nprotocols. Our framework blackboxes the precise mechanics of the user selection\nprocess, allowing us to isolate the properties of the selection process that\nare significant for protocol design.\n  We demonstrate the utility of our general framework with several concrete\nresults:\n  1. We prove a CAP-type impossibility theorem asserting that liveness with an\nunknown level of participation rules out security in a partially synchronous\nsetting.\n  2. Delving deeper into the partially synchronous setting, we prove that a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for security is the production of\n\"certificates,\" meaning stand-alone proofs of block confirmation.\n  3. Restricting to synchronous settings, we prove that typical protocols with\na known level of participation (including longest chain-type PoS protocols) can\nbe adapted to provide certificates, but those with an unknown level of\nparticipation cannot.\n  4.

However, the traditional FL framework heavily relies\non a single central server and may fall apart if such a server behaves\nmaliciously.

            "summary": "In order to accommodate the ever-growing data from various, possibly\nindependent, sources and the dynamic nature of data usage rates in practical\napplications, modern cloud data storage systems are required to be scalable,\nflexible, and heterogeneous. The recent rise of the blockchain technology is\nalso moving various information systems towards decentralization to achieve\nhigh privacy at low costs. While codes with hierarchical locality have been\nintensively studied in the context of centralized cloud storage due to their\neffectiveness in reducing the average reading time, those for decentralized\nstorage networks (DSNs) have not yet been discussed. In this paper, we propose\na joint coding scheme where each node receives extra protection through the\ncooperation with nodes in its neighborhood in a heterogeneous DSN with any\ngiven topology. This work extends and subsumes our prior work on coding for\ncentralized cloud storage. In particular, our proposed construction not only\npreserves desirable properties such as scalability and flexibility, which are\ncritical in dynamic networks, but also adapts to arbitrary topologies, a\nproperty that is essential in DSNs but has been overlooked in existing works.",

All departments may turn to logs to determine the cause of the\nissue and find the party at fault. The party at fault may be motivated to\ntamper with the logs to hide their role. We argue that the critical nature of\nCloud logs calls for immutability and verification mechanism without the\npresence of a single trusted party.\n  This paper proposes such a mechanism by describing a blockchain-based log\nstorage system, called Logchain, which can be integrated with existing private\nand public blockchain solutions. Logchain uses the immutability feature of\nblockchain to provide a tamper-resistance platform for log storage.\nAdditionally, we propose a hierarchical structure to address blockchains'\nscalability issues. To validate the mechanism, we integrate Logchain into\nEthereum and IBM Blockchain. We show that the solution is scalable and perform\nthe analysis of the cost of ownership to help a reader select an implementation\nthat would address their needs.\n  The Logchain's scalability improvement on a blockchain is achieved without\nany alteration of blockchains' fundamental architecture.

The large datasets\nrequired are generally proprietary; predictions are often sold on a per-query\nbasis; and published models can quickly become out of date without effort to\nacquire more data and maintain them. Published proposals to provide models and\ndata for free for certain tasks include Microsoft Research's Decentralized and\nCollaborative AI on Blockchain. The framework allows participants to\ncollaboratively build a dataset and use smart contracts to share a continuously\nupdated model on a public blockchain. The initial proposal gave an overview of\nthe framework omitting many details of the models used and the incentive\nmechanisms in real world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate the use of\nseveral models and configurations in order to propose best practices when using\nthe Self-Assessment incentive mechanism so that models can remain accurate and\nwell-intended participants that submit correct data have the chance to profit.\nWe have analyzed simulations for each of three models: Perceptron, Na\\\"ive\nBayes, and a Nearest Centroid Classifier, with three different datasets:\npredicting a sport with user activity from Endomondo, sentiment analysis on\nmovie reviews from IMDB, and determining if a news article is fake. We compare\nseveral factors for each dataset when models are hosted in smart contracts on a\npublic blockchain: their accuracy over time, balances of a good and bad user,\nand transaction costs (or gas) for deploying, updating, collecting refunds, and\ncollecting rewards. A free and open source implementation for the Ethereum\nblockchain and simulations written in Python is provided at\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/0xDeCA10B.

However, there are critical issues to be addressed before its\nwidespread deployment, such as transaction efficiency, bandwidth bottleneck,\nand security. Techniques are being explored to tackle these issues. Stochastic\nmodeling, as one of these techniques, has been applied to analyze a variety of\nblockchain characteristics, but there is a lack of a comprehensive survey on\nit. In this survey, we aim to fill the gap and review the stochastic models\nproposed to address common issues in blockchain. Firstly, this paper provides\nthe basic knowledge of blockchain technology and stochastic models. Then,\naccording to different objects, the stochastic models for blockchain analysis\nare divided into network-oriented and application-oriented (mainly refer to\ncryptocurrency). The network-oriented stochastic models are further classified\ninto two categories, namely, performance and security. About the\napplication-oriented stochastic models, the widest adoption mainly concentrates\non the price prediction of cryptocurrency. Moreover, we provide analysis and\ncomparison in detail on every taxonomy and discuss the strengths and weaknesses\nof the related works to serve guides for further researches. Finally,\nchallenges and future research directions are given to apply stochastic\nmodeling approaches to study blockchain. By analyzing and classifying the\nexisting researches, we hope that our survey can provide suggestions for the\nresearchers who are interested in blockchain and good at using stochastic\nmodels as a tool to address problems.",

We study the rate at which an\nattacker can execute reorgs in the Tezos Proof-of-Stake protocol. As an\nexample, an attacker with 40% of the staking power is able to execute a\n20-block malicious reorg at an average rate of once per day, and the attack\nprobability increases super-linearly as the staking power grows beyond 40%.\nMoreover, an attacker of the Tezos protocol knows in advance when an attack\nopportunity will arise, and can use this knowledge to arrange transactions to\ndouble-spend. We show that in particular cases, the Tezos protocol can be\nadjusted to protect against deep reorgs. For instance, we demonstrate protocol\nparameters that reduce the rate of length-20 reorg opportunities for a 40%\nattacker by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a trade-off between\noptimizing for robustness to deep reorgs (costly deviations that may be net\nprofitable because they enable double-spends) and robustness to selfish mining\n(mining deviations that result in typically short reorgs that are profitable\neven without double-spends). That is, the parameters that optimally protect\nagainst one make the other attack easy. Finally, we develop a method that\nmonitors the Tezos blockchain health with respect to malicious reorgs using\nonly publicly available information.",

However, we discovered an attack\nin the standard synchronous network model, highlighting a general difficulty\nwith existing finality-gadget-based designs. We present a construction of\nprovably secure ebb-and-flow protocols with optimal resilience.

            "summary": "5G-enabled drones have potential applications in a variety of both military\nand civilian settings (e.g., monitoring and tracking of individuals in\ndemonstrations and/or enforcing of social / physical distancing during\npandemics such as COVID-19). Such applications generally involve the collection\nand dissemination of (massive) data from the drones to remote data centres for\nstorage and analysis, for example via 5G networks. Consequently, there are\nsecurity and privacy considerations underpinning 5G-enabled drone\ncommunications. We posit the potential of leveraging blockchain to facilitate\nprivacy preservation, and therefore in this article we will review existing\nblockchain-based solutions after introducing the architecture for 5G-enabled\ndrone communications and blockchain. We will also review existing legislation\nand data privacy regulations that need to be considered in the design of\nblockchain-based solutions, as well as identifying potential challenges and\nopen issues which will hopefully inform future research agenda.",

To tackle these issues, in\nthis paper, we present a blockchain-based platform architecture for multimedia\ndata management.

This paper\ntherefore proposes a distributed and reliable access control framework for\nsmart cities by combining the blockchain smart contract technology and the\nAttribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model. The framework consists of one\nPolicy Management Contract (PMC) for managing the ABAC policies, one Subject\nAttribute Management Contract (SAMC) for managing the attributes of subjects\n(i.e., entities accessing resources), one Object Attribute Management Contract\n(OAMC) for managing the attributes of objects (i.e., resources being accessed),\nand one Access Control Contract (ACC) for performing the access control. To\nshow the feasibility of the proposed framework, we construct a local private\nEthereum blockchain system to implement the four smart contracts and also\nconduct experiments to evaluate the monetary cost as well as to compare the\nproposed framework with an existing Access Control List (ACL)-based scheme. The\nexperimental results show that although the proposed scheme consumes more money\nthan the ACL-based scheme at the deployment stage, it introduces less monetary\ncost during the system running especially for large-scale smart cities.",

Therefore,\nensuring smart contracts are bug-free and well-designed before deploying them\nto the blockchain is extremely important. A contract defect is an error, flaw\nor fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or\nunexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Detecting and removing\ncontract defects can avoid potential bugs and make programs more robust. Our\nprevious work defined 20 contract defects for smart contracts and divided them\ninto five impact levels. According to our classification, contract defects with\nseriousness level between 1-3 can lead to unwanted behaviors, e.g., a contract\nbeing controlled by attackers. In this paper, we propose DefectChecker, a\nsymbolic execution-based approach and tool to detect eight contract defects\nthat can cause unwanted behaviors of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain\nplatform. DefectChecker can detect contract defects from smart contracts\nbytecode. We compare DefectChecker with key previous works, including Oyente,\nMythril and Securify by using an open-source dataset. Our experimental results\nshow that DefectChecker performs much better than these tools in terms of both\nspeed and accuracy. We also applied DefectChecker to 165,621 distinct smart\ncontracts on the Ethereum platform. We found that 25,815 of these smart\ncontracts contain at least one of the contract defects that belongs to impact\nlevel 1-3, including some real-world attacks.",

However, in conventional IIoT device failure\ndetection, client devices need to upload raw data to the central server for\nmodel training, which might lead to disclosure of sensitive business data.\nTherefore, in this paper, to ensure client data privacy, we propose a\nblockchain-based federated learning approach for device failure detection in\nIIoT. First, we present a platform architecture of blockchain-based federated\nlearning systems for failure detection in IIoT, which enables verifiable\nintegrity of client data. In the architecture, each client periodically creates\na Merkle tree in which each leaf node represents a client data record, and\nstores the tree root on a blockchain. Further, to address the data\nheterogeneity issue in IIoT failure detection, we propose a novel centroid\ndistance weighted federated averaging (CDW\\_FedAvg) algorithm taking into\naccount the distance between positive class and negative class of each client\ndataset. In addition, to motivate clients to participate in federated learning,\na smart contact based incentive mechanism is designed depending on the size and\nthe centroid distance of client data used in local model training. A prototype\nof the proposed architecture is implemented with our industry partner, and\nevaluated in terms of feasibility, accuracy and performance. The results show\nthat the approach is feasible, and has satisfactory accuracy and performance.",

            "summary": "Advancements in distributed ledger technologies are rapidly driving the rise\nof decentralized crowdsourcing systems on top of open smart contract platforms\nlike Ethereum. While decentralized blockchain-based crowdsourcing provides\nnumerous benefits compared to centralized solutions, current implementations of\ndecentralized crowdsourcing suffer from fundamental scalability limitations by\nrequiring all participants to pay a small transaction fee every time they\ninteract with the blockchain. This increases the cost of using decentralized\ncrowdsourcing solutions, resulting in a total payment that could be even higher\nthan the price charged by centralized crowdsourcing platforms. This paper\nproposes a novel suite of protocols called NF-Crowd that resolves the\nscalability issue by reducing the lower bound of the total cost of a\ndecentralized crowdsourcing project to O(1). NF-Crowd is a highly reliable\nsolution for scaling decentralized crowdsourcing. We prove that as long as\nparticipants of a project powered by NF-Crowd are rational, the O(1) lower\nbound of cost could be reached regardless of the scale of the crowd. We also\ndemonstrate that as long as at least one participant of a project powered by\nNF-Crowd is honest, the project cannot be aborted and the results are\nguaranteed to be correct. We design NF-Crowd protocols for a representative\ntype of project named crowdsourcing contest with open community review\n(CC-OCR). We implement the protocols over the Ethereum official test network.\nOur results demonstrate that NF-Crowd protocols can reduce the cost of running\na CC-OCR project to less than $2 regardless of the scale of the crowd,\nproviding a significant cost benefit in adopting decentralized crowdsourcing\nsolutions.",

That is, in contrast to uniform removing of edges as in DropEdge,\nfollowing the Girvan-Newman algorithm, we detect network periphery structures\nusing information on edge betweenness and then remove edges according to their\nbetweenness centrality. Our experimental results on semi-supervised node\nclassification tasks demonstrate that the LFGCN coupled with P-DropEdge\naccelerates the training task, increases stability and further improves\npredictive accuracy of learned graph topology structure.

On the\nother hand, when there are considerable research and development on service\ndiscovery and service recommendation, most of the related work are centralized\nand thus suffers inherent shortages of the centralized systems, e.g.,\nadv-driven, lack at trust, transparence and fairness. In this paper, we propose\na ServiceNet - a peer-to-peer (P2P) service network for service discovery and\nservice recommendation. ServiceNet is inspired by blockchain technology and\naims at providing an open, transparent and self-growth, and self-management\nservice ecosystem. The paper will present the basic idea, an architecture\ndesign of the prototype, and an initial implementation and performance\nevaluation the prototype design.",

            "summary": "Ethereum is the largest blockchain platform that supports smart contracts.\nUsers deploy smart contracts by publishing the smart contract's bytecode to the\nblockchain. Since the data in the blockchain cannot be modified, even if these\ncontracts contain bugs, it is not possible to patch deployed smart contracts\nwith code updates. Moreover, there is currently neither a comprehensive\nclassification framework for Ethereum smart contract bugs, nor detailed\ncriteria for detecting bugs in smart contracts, making it difficult for\ndevelopers to fully understand the negative effects of bugs and design new\napproaches to detect bugs. In this paper, to fill the gap, we first collect as\nmany smart contract bugs as possible from multiple sources and divide these\nbugs into 9 categories by extending the IEEE Standard Classification for\nSoftware Anomalies. Then, we design the criteria for detecting each kind of\nbugs, and construct a dataset of smart contracts covering all kinds of bugs.\nWith our framework and dataset, developers can learn smart contract bugs and\ndevelop new tools to detect and locate bugs in smart contracts. Moreover, we\nevaluate the state-of-the-art tools for smart contract analysis with our\ndataset and obtain some interesting findings: 1) Mythril, Slither and Remix are\nthe most worthwhile combination of analysis tools. 2) There are still 10 kinds\nof bugs that cannot be detected by any analysis tool.",

So each media\nrecording has its own unique blockchain, with each block holding information\ndescribing the media segment. The problem of verifying the integrity of the\nmedia is recast to traversing the blockchain, block-by-block, and\nsegment-by-segment of the media.

In\nparticular, we propose and develop a novel tool named GLASER, which analyzes\nthe State DataBase of Ethereum to discover five kinds of erasable accounts. The\nexperimental results show that GLASER can accurately reveal 508,482 erasable\naccounts and these accounts lead to users wasting more than 106 million\ndollars.

Subdividing a blockchain ledger into shards\npromises to greatly increase transaction throughput with minimal loss of\nsecurity. However, the organization and type of the transactions also affects\nthe ledger's efficiency, which is increased by wallet agents transacting in a\nsingle shard whenever possible while collectively distributing their\ntransactions uniformly across the available shards. Since there is no central\nauthority to enforce these properties, the only means of achieving them is to\ndesign the system such that it is in agents' interest to act in a way that\nbenefits overall throughput. We show that our proposed pricing policy does\nexactly this by inducing a potential game for the agents, where the potential\nfunction relates directly to ledger throughput. Simulations demonstrate that\nthis policy leads to near-optimal throughput under a variety of conditions.",

Their self-enforcing and event-driven\nfeatures make some online activities possible without a trusted third party.\nNevertheless, problems such as miscellaneous attacks, privacy leakage, and low\nprocessing rates pre-vent them from being widely applied. Various schemes and\ntools have been proposed to facilitate the construction and execution of secure\nsmart contracts. However, a comprehensive survey for these proposals is absent,\nhindering new researchers and developers from a quick start. This paper surveys\nthe literature and online resources on smart contract construction and\nexecution over the period 2008-2020. We divide the studies into three\ncategories: (1) design paradigms that give examples and patterns on contract\nconstruction, (2) design tools that facilitate the development of secure smart\ncontracts, and (3) extensions and alternatives that improve the privacy or\nefficiency of the system. We start by grouping the relevant construction\nschemes into the first two categories. We then review the execution mechanisms\nin the last category and further divide the state-of-the-art solutions into\nthree classes: private contracts with extra tools, off-chain channels, and\nextensions on core functionalities. Finally, we summarize several challenges\nand identify future research directions toward developing secure,\nprivacy-preserving, and efficient smart contracts.",

We\nadvance such threats to generate greater reward advantage to the attackers\nwhile undermining the other miners and introduce the share withholding attack\n(SWH). SWH withholds shares to increase the attacker's reward payout within the\npool, in contrast to the prior threats withholding blocks, and rather builds on\nthe block-withholding threats in order to exploit the information about the\nimpending block submission timing, challenging the popularly established\nassumption that the block submission time is completely random and unknown to\nminers. We analyze SWH's incentive compatibility and the vulnerability scope by\nidentifying the critical systems and environmental parameters which determine\nthe attack's impact. Our results show that SWH in conjunction with block\nwithholding yield unfair reward advantage at the expense of the\nprotocol-complying victim miners and that a rational miner will selfishly\nlaunch SWH to maximize its reward profit.

            "summary": "The growing trend of sharing news/contents, through social media platforms\nand the World Wide Web has been seen to impact our perception of the truth,\naltering our views about politics, economics, relationships, needs and wants.\nThis is because of the growing spread of misinformation and disinformation\nintentionally or unintentionally by individuals and organizations. This trend\nhas grave political, social, ethical, and privacy implications for society due\nto 1) the rapid developments in the field of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep\nLearning (DL) algorithms in creating realistic-looking yet fake digital content\n(such as text, images, and videos), 2) the ability to customize the content\nfeeds and to create a polarized so-called \"filter-bubbles\" leveraging the\navailability of the big-data. Therefore, there is an ethical need to combat the\nflow of fake content. This paper attempts to resolve some of the aspects of\nthis combat by presenting a high-level overview of TRUSTD, a blockchain and\ncollective signature-based ecosystem to help content creators in getting their\ncontent backed by the community, and to help users judge on the credibility and\ncorrectness of these contents.",

            "summary": "Steemit is a blockchain-based social media platform, where authors can get\nauthor rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies called STEEM and SBD (Steem\nBlockchain Dollars) if their posts are upvoted. Interestingly, curators (or\nvoters) can also get rewards by voting others' posts, which is called a\ncuration reward. A reward is proportional to a curator's STEEM stakes.\nThroughout this process, Steemit hopes \"good\" content will be automatically\ndiscovered by users in a decentralized way, which is known as the\nProof-of-Brain (PoB). However, there are many bot accounts programmed to post\nautomatically and get rewards, which discourages real human users from creating\ngood content. We call this type of bot a posting bot. While there are many\npapers that studied bots on traditional centralized social media platforms such\nas Facebook and Twitter, we are the first to study posting bots on a\nblockchain-based social media platform. Compared with the bot detection on the\nusual social media platforms, the features we created have an advantage that\nposting bots can be detected without limiting the number or length of posts. We\ncan extract the features of posts by clustering distances between blog data or\nreplies. These features are obtained from the Minimum Average Cluster from\nClustering Distance between Frequent words and Articles (MAC-CDFA), which is\nnot used in any of the previous social media research. Based on the enriched\nfeatures, we enhanced the quality of classification tasks. Comparing the\nF1-scores, the features we created outperformed the features used for bot\ndetection on Facebook and Twitter.",

The\nproposed scheme can enforce an autonomic incentive management mechanism to any\ntype of self-organizing networks such as self-organizing clouds, ad-hoc\nnetworks, self-organizing federated cloud networks, self-organizing federated\nlearning networks, and self-organizing D2D networks to name a few. Considering\nthe distributed nature of these self-organizing networks and the Ethereum\nblockchain network, a distributed agent-based methodology is materialized in\nthe proposed framework.

            "summary": "Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize manufacturing industries. For\nexample, several supply-chain use-cases may benefit from transparent asset\ntracking and automated processes using smart contracts. Several real-world\ndeployments exist where the transparency aspect of a blockchain is both an\nadvantage and a disadvantage at the same time. The exposure of assets and\nbusiness interaction represent critical risks. However, there are typically no\nconfidentiality guarantees to protect the smart contract logic as well as the\nprocessed data. Trusted execution environments (TEE) are an emerging technology\navailable in both edge or mobile-grade processors (e.g., Arm TrustZone) and\nserver-grade processors (e.g., Intel SGX). TEEs shield both code and data from\nmalicious attackers. This practical experience report presents TZ4Fabric, an\nextension of Hyperledger Fabric to leverage Arm TrustZone for the secure\nexecution of smart contracts. Our design minimizes the trusted computing base\nexecuted by avoiding the execution of a whole Hyperledger Fabric node inside\nthe TEE, which continues to run in untrusted environment. Instead, we restrict\nit to the execution of only the smart contract. The TZ4Fabric prototype\nexploits the open-source OP-TEE framework, as it supports deployments on cheap\nlow-end devices (e.g., Raspberry Pis). Our experimental results highlight the\nperformance trade-off due to the additional security guarantees provided by Arm\nTrustZone. TZ4Fabric will be released as open-source.",

Although traditional custody\nservice is typically endorsed by centralized authorities, decentralized custody\nscheme has become technically feasible since the emergence of digital assets,\nand furthermore, it is greatly needed by new applications such as blockchain\nand DeFi (Decentralized Finance).\n  In this work, we propose a framework of decentralized asset custody scheme\nthat is able to support a large number of custodians and safely hold customer\nassets of multiple times the value of the total security deposit. The proposed\ncustody scheme distributes custodians and assets into many custodian groups via\ncombinatorial designs, where each group fully controls the assigned assets.\nSince every custodian group is small, the overhead cost is significantly\nreduced. The liveness is also improved because even a single alive group would\nbe able to process transactions.\n  The security of this custody scheme is guaranteed under the rational\nadversary model, such that any adversary corrupting a bounded fraction of\ncustodians cannot move assets more than the security deposit paid. We further\nanalyze the security and performance of our constructions from both theoretical\nand experimental sides and give explicit examples with concrete numbers and\nfigures for a better understanding of our results.",

In this paper, we present a novel proposal for a\nBlockchain-based advertising platform that provides: a system for privacy\npreserving user profiling, privately requesting ads from the advertising\nsystem, the billing mechanisms for presented and clicked ads, the advertising\nsystem that uploads ads to the cloud according to profiling interests, various\ntypes of transactions to enable advertising operations in Blockchain-based\nnetwork, and the method that allows a cloud system to privately compute the\naccess policies for various resources (such as ads, mobile user profiles). Our\nmain goal is to design a decentralized framework for targeted ads, which\nenables private delivery of ads to users whose behavioral profiles accurately\nmatch the presented ads, defined by the ad system. We implement a POC of our\nproposed framework i.e. a Bespoke Miner and experimentally evaluate various\ncomponents of Blockchain-based in-app advertising system, implementing various\ncritical components; such as, evaluating user profiles, implementing access\npolicies, encryption and decryption of users' profiles.

            "summary": "Attracted by the inherent security and privacy protection of the blockchain,\nincorporating blockchain into Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely studied\nin these years. However, the mining process requires high computational power,\nwhich prevents IoT devices from directly participating in blockchain\nconstruction. For this reason, edge computing service is introduced to help\nbuild the IoT blockchain, where IoT devices could purchase computational\nresources from the edge servers. In this paper, we consider the case that IoT\ndevices also have other tasks that need the help of edge servers, such as data\nanalysis and data storage. The profits they can get from these tasks is closely\nrelated to the amounts of resources they purchased from the edge servers. In\nthis scenario, IoT devices will allocate their limited budgets to purchase\ndifferent resources from different edge servers, such that their profits can be\nmaximized. Moreover, edge servers will set \"best\" prices such that they can get\nthe biggest benefits. Accordingly, there raise a pricing and budget allocation\nproblem between edge servers and IoT devices. We model the interaction between\nedge servers and IoT devices as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game,\nwhose objective is to reach the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE). We prove the\nexistence and uniqueness of the SE point, and design efficient algorithms to\nreach the SE point. In the end, we verify our model and algorithms by\nperforming extensive simulations, and the results show the correctness and\neffectiveness of our designs.",

If there are more than two parties\ninvolved in a single global transaction, the global transaction is split into\nmultiple local two-party transactions, each of which follows the above\ncentral-exchange protocol. Unfortunately, the atomicity of the global\ntransaction is violated with the central-exchange approach: those local\ntwo-party transactions, once committed, cannot be rolled back if the global\ntransaction decides to abort. In a more general sense, the graph-based model of\n(two-party) transactions can hardly be extended to an arbitrary number of\nparties in a cross-blockchain transaction. %from why to how In this paper, we\nintroduce a higher-level abstraction of cross-blockchain transactions. We adopt\nthe \\textit{abstract simplicial complex}, an extensively-studied mathematical\nobject in algebraic topology, to represent an arbitrary number of parties\ninvolved in the blockchain transactions. Essentially, each party in the global\ntransaction is modeled as a vertex and the global transaction among $n+1$ ($n\n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $n > 0$) parties compose a $n$-dimensional simplex. While this\nhigher-level abstraction seems plausibly trivial, we will show how this simple\nextension leads to a new line of modeling methods and protocols for better\nprocessing cross-blockchain transactions.",

This paper presents an approach to attack against the difficulty\nadjustment algorithm (abbreviated as DAA) used in blockchain mining, which has\na direct impact on miners' earnings. In this method, the attack miner jumps\nbetween different blockchains to get more benefits than the honest miner who\nkeep mining on only one blockchain. We build a probabilistic model to simulate\nthe time to obtain the next block at different hash computing power called\nhashrate.

            "summary": "The financial crime landscape is evolving along with the digitization in\nfinancial services. In this context, laws and regulations cannot efficiently\ncope with a fast-moving industry such as finance, which translates in late\nadoption of measures and legal voids, providing a fruitful landscape for\nmalicious actors. In parallel, blockchain technology and its promising features\nsuch as immutability, verifiability, and authentication, enhance the\nopportunities of financial forensics. In this paper, we focus on an\nembezzlement scheme and we provide a forensic-by-design methodology for its\ninvestigation. In addition, the feasibility and adaptability of our approach\ncan be extended and embrace digital investigations on other types of schemes.\nWe provide a functional implementation based on smart contracts and we\nintegrate standardised forensic flows and chain of custody preservation\nmechanisms. Finally, we discuss the benefits and challenges of the symbiotic\nrelationship between blockchain and financial investigations, along with future\nresearch directions.",

            "summary": "The arisen of Bitcoin has led to much enthusiasm for blockchain research and\nblock mining, and the extensive existence of mining pools helps its\nparticipants (i.e., miners) gain reward more frequently. Recently, the mining\npools are proved to be vulnerable for several possible attacks, and pool block\nwithholding attack is one of them: one strategic pool manager sends some of her\nminers to other pools and these miners pretend to work on the puzzles but\nactually do nothing. And these miners still get reward since the pool manager\ncan not recognize these malicious miners. In this work, we revisit the\ngame-theoretic model for pool block withholding attacks and propose a revised\napproach to reallocate the reward to the miners. Fortunately, in the new model,\nthe pool managers have strong incentive to not launch such attacks. We show\nthat for any number of mining pools, no-pool-attacks is always a Nash\nequilibrium. Moreover, with only two minority mining pools participating,\nno-pool-attacks is actually the unique Nash equilibrium.",

To achieve this goal, we propose the application of the Internet of\nThings along with the server-based framework and Distributed Ledger Technology\nto build systems for smart voltage monitoring. Two models - a centralised model\nand a decentralised model have been presented and analysed thoroughly in this\npaper. The centralised model is built on client-server architecture, whereas\nthe decentralised model is based on a peer-to-peer architecture. Blockchain and\nInterPlanetary File System have been used for the implementation of the\ndecentralised system. Potential improvements to make these systems robust have\nalso been discussed. The methods proposed in this paper for voltage monitoring\nare novel; ensure efficient data storage and can be used for IoT data storage\nof any form.",

The passive DNS data\ncollection process creates a database containing various DNS data elements,\nsome of which are personal and need to be protected to preserve the privacy of\nthe end users. To this end, we propose the use of distributed ledger\ntechnology. We use Hyperledger Fabric to create a permissioned blockchain,\nwhich only authorized entities can access. The proposed solution supports\nqueries for storing and retrieving data from the blockchain ledger, allowing\nthe use of the passive DNS database for further analysis, e.g. for the\nidentification of malicious domain names. Additionally, it effectively protects\nthe DNS personal data from unauthorized entities, including the administrators\nthat can act as potential malicious insiders, and allows only the data owners\nto perform queries over these data. We evaluated our proposed solution by\ncreating a proof-of-concept experimental setup that passively collects DNS data\nfrom a network and then uses the distributed ledger technology to store the\ndata in an immutable ledger, thus providing a full historical overview of all\nthe records.",

Despite theoretical progress, collecting\nreal-life gambling data, which is essential to validate predictions and\nexperimental findings, remains a challenge. To address this issue, we collect\npublicly available betting data from a \\emph{DApp} (decentralized application)\non the Ethereum Blockchain, which instantly publishes the outcome of every\nsingle bet (consisting of each bet's timestamp, wager, probability of winning,\nuserID, and profit). This online casino is a simple dice game that allows\ngamblers to tune their own winning probabilities. Thus the dataset is well\nsuited for studying gambling strategies and the complex dynamic of risk\nattitudes involved in betting decisions. We analyze the dataset through the\nlens of current probability-theoretic models and discover empirical examples of\ngambling systems. Our results shed light on understanding the role of risk\npreferences in human financial behavior and decision-makings beyond gambling.",

This reduced latency is crucial in the setting of blockchains, where\nsmart contracts are executed as parts of transactions, to achieve peak\ntransactions processed per second.

The business logic of dApps is\nusually implemented within smart contracts developed through Solidity, a\nprogramming language for writing smart contracts on different blockchain\nplatforms, including the popular Ethereum. In Ethereum, the smart contracts run\non the machines of miners and the gas corresponds to the execution fee\ncompensating such computing resources. However, the deployment and execution\ncosts of a smart contract depend on the implementation choices done by\ndevelopers. Unappropriated design choices could lead to higher gas consumption\nthan necessary. In this paper, we (i) identify a set of 19 Solidity code smells\naffecting the deployment and transaction costs of a smart contract, and (ii)\nassess the relevance of such smells through a survey involving 34 participants.\nOn top of these smells, we propose GasMet, a suite of metrics for statically\nevaluating the code quality of a smart contract from the gas consumption\nperspective. An experiment involving 2,186 smart contracts demonstrates that\nthe proposed metrics have direct associations with deployment costs. The\nmetrics in our suite can be used for more easily identifying source code\nsegments that need optimizations.",

            "summary": "This work presents a new distributed Byzantine tolerant federated learning\nalgorithm, HoldOut SGD, for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization.\nHoldOut SGD uses the well known machine learning technique of holdout\nestimation, in a distributed fashion, in order to select parameter updates that\nare likely to lead to models with low loss values. This makes it more effective\nat discarding Byzantine workers inputs than existing methods that eliminate\noutliers in the parameter-space of the learned model. HoldOut SGD first\nrandomly selects a set of workers that use their private data in order to\npropose gradient updates. Next, a voting committee of workers is randomly\nselected, and each voter uses its private data as holdout data, in order to\nselect the best proposals via a voting scheme. We propose two possible\nmechanisms for the coordination of workers in the distributed computation of\nHoldOut SGD. The first uses a truthful central server and corresponds to the\ntypical setting of current federated learning. The second is fully distributed\nand requires no central server, paving the way to fully decentralized federated\nlearning. The fully distributed version implements HoldOut SGD via ideas from\nthe blockchain domain, and specifically the Algorand committee selection and\nconsensus processes. We provide formal guarantees for the HoldOut SGD process\nin terms of its convergence to the optimal model, and its level of resilience\nto the fraction of Byzantine workers. Empirical evaluation shows that HoldOut\nSGD is Byzantine-resilient and efficiently converges to an effectual model for\ndeep-learning tasks, as long as the total number of participating workers is\nlarge and the fraction of Byzantine workers is less than half (<1/3 for the\nfully distributed variant).",

One direction is to\nexplore the usage of sharding in which we partition the managed dataset over\nmany shards that independently operate as blockchains. Sharding requires an\nefficient fault-tolerant primitive for the ordering and execution of\nmulti-shard transactions, however.\n  In this work, we seek to design such a primitive suitable for distributed\nledger networks with high transaction throughput. To do so, we propose\nCerberus, a set of minimalistic primitives for processing single-shard and\nmulti-shard UTXO-like transactions. Cerberus aims at maximizing parallel\nprocessing at shards while minimizing coordination within and between shards.\nFirst, we propose Core-Cerberus, that uses strict environmental requirements to\nenable simple yet powerful multi-shard transaction processing. In our intended\nUTXO-environment, Core-Cerberus will operate perfectly with respect to all\ntransactions proposed and approved by well-behaved clients, but does not\nprovide any guarantees for other transactions.\n  To also support more general-purpose environments, we propose two\ngeneralizations of Core-Cerberus: we propose Optimistic-Cerberus, a protocol\nthat does not require any additional coordination phases in the well-behaved\noptimistic case, while requiring intricate coordination when recovering from\nattacks; and we propose Pessimistic-Cerberus, a protocol that adds sufficient\ncoordination to the well-behaved case of Core-Cerberus, allowing it to operate\nin a general-purpose fault-tolerant environments without significant costs to\nrecover from attacks. Finally, we compare the three protocols, showing their\npotential scalability and high transaction throughput in practical\nenvironments.",

However,\nlarge-scale FEL still faces following crucial challenges: (i) there lacks a\nsecure and communication-efficient model training scheme for FEL; (2) there is\nno scalable and flexible FEL framework for updating local models and global\nmodel sharing (trading) management. To bridge the gaps, we first propose a\nblockchain-empowered secure FEL system with a hierarchical blockchain framework\nconsisting of a main chain and subchains. This framework can achieve scalable\nand flexible decentralized FEL by individually manage local model updates or\nmodel sharing records for performance isolation. A Proof-of-Verifying consensus\nscheme is then designed to remove low-quality model updates and manage\nqualified model updates in a decentralized and secure manner, thereby achieving\nsecure FEL. To improve communication efficiency of the blockchain-empowered\nFEL, a gradient compression scheme is designed to generate sparse but important\ngradients to reduce communication overhead without compromising accuracy, and\nalso further strengthen privacy preservation of training data.

            "summary": "In recent years Smart Contracts and DApps are becoming increasingly important\nand widespread thanks to the properties of blockchain technology. In most cases\nDApps are business critical, and very strict security requirements should be\nassured. Developing safe and reliable Smart Contracts, however, is not a\ntrivial task. Several researchers have studied the security issues, however\nnone of these provide a simple and intuitive tool to overcome these problems.\nIn this paper we collected a list of security patterns for DApps. Moreover,\nbased on these patterns, we provide the reader with security assessment\nchecklists that can be easily used for the development of SCs. We cover the\nphases of design, coding, and testing and deployment of the software lifecycle.\nIn this way, we allow developers to easily verify if they applied all the\nrelevant security patterns to their smart contracts. We focus all the analysis\non the most popular Ethereum blockchain, and on the Solidity language.",

            "summary": "Ethereum has become a widely used platform to enable secure, Blockchain-based\nfinancial and business transactions. However, many identified bugs and\nvulnerabilities in smart contracts have led to serious financial losses, which\nraises serious concerns about smart contract security. Thus, there is a\nsignificant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high\nreliability. In this research: (1) Firstly, we propose an automated deep\nlearning based approach to learn structural code embeddings of smart contracts\nin Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and contract\nvalidation on smart contracts. We apply our approach to more than 22K solidity\ncontracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, results show that the clone\nratio of solidity code is at around 90%, much higher than traditional software.\nWe collect a list of 52 known buggy smart contracts belonging to 10 kinds of\ncommon vulnerabilities as our bug database. Our approach can identify more than\n1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately.\n(2) Secondly, according to developers' feedback, we have implemented the\napproach in a web-based tool, named SmartEmbed, to facilitate Solidity\ndevelopers for using our approach. Our tool can assist Solidity developers to\nefficiently identify repetitive smart contracts in the existing Ethereum\nblockchain, as well as checking their contract against a known set of bugs,\nwhich can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the\ncontract. We optimize the implementations of SmartEmbed which is sufficient in\nsupporting developers in real-time for practical uses. The Ethereum ecosystem\nas well as the individual Solidity developer can both benefit from our\nresearch.",

On the other hand, blockchain systems routinely\nperform a huge amount of computation that does not achieve practical purposes\nin order to build Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus from decentralized\nparticipants. In this paper, we propose a new consensus mechanism, Proof of\nLearning (PoLe), which directs the computation spent for consensus toward\noptimization of neural networks (NN). In our mechanism, the training/testing\ndata are released to the entire blockchain network (BCN) and the consensus\nnodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. When\nthe consensus on the BCN considers a NN model to be valid, a new block is\nappended to the blockchain. We experimentally compare the PoLe protocol with\nProof of Work (PoW) and show that PoLe can achieve a more stable block\ngeneration rate, which leads to more efficient transaction processing. We also\nintroduce a novel cheating prevention mechanism, Secure Mapping Layer (SML),\nwhich can be straightforwardly implemented as a linear NN layer. Empirical\nevaluation shows that SML can detect cheating nodes at small cost to the\npredictive performance.",

However, blockchains are closed-world systems which\ndo not have access to external state. To overcome this limitation, oracles have\nbeen introduced in various forms and for different purposes. However so far\ncommon oracle best practices have not been dissected, classified, and studied\nin their fundamental aspects. In this paper, we address this gap by studying\nfoundational blockchain oracle patterns in two foundational dimensions\ncharacterising the oracles: (i) the data flow direction, i.e., inbound and\noutbound data flow, from the viewpoint of the blockchain; and (ii) the\ninitiator of the data flow, i.e., whether it is push or pull-based\ncommunication. We provide a structured description of the four patterns in\ndetail, and discuss an implementation of these patterns based on use cases. On\nthis basis we conduct a quantitative analysis, which results in the insight\nthat the four different patterns are characterized by distinct performance and\ncosts profiles.",

            "summary": "EOSIO is one typical public blockchain platform. It is scalable in terms of\ntransaction speeds and has a growing ecosystem supporting smart contracts and\ndecentralized applications. However, the vulnerabilities within the EOSIO smart\ncontracts have led to serious attacks, which caused serious financial loss to\nits end users. In this work, we systematically analyzed three typical EOSIO\nsmart contract vulnerabilities and their related attacks. Then we presented\nEOSFuzzer, a general black-box fuzzing framework to detect vulnerabilities\nwithin EOSIO smart contracts. In particular, EOSFuzzer proposed effective\nattacking scenarios and test oracles for EOSIO smart contract fuzzing. Our\nfuzzing experiment on 3963 EOSIO smart contracts shows that EOSFuzzer is both\neffective and efficient to detect EOSIO smart contract vulnerabilities with\nhigh accuracy.",

In this paper, we tackle two problems\nposed by 5G features: system construction using multi-vendor devices and\nsoftwarized functions. Specifically, there are supply-chain risks that\nmalicious devices are used in the construction phase. Moreover, the softwarized\nnetwork functions are easy to be attacked compared to hardware. To cope with\nthese problems, we propose a concept of architecture comprising a blockchain to\nrecord security events including supply-chain information and a tamper\ndetection engine to ensure the integrity of software components in 5G system.\nWe implement the initial prototype of the architecture and show its\nfeasibility.",

            "summary": "Sharding is a promising blockchain scaling solution. But it currently suffers\nfrom high latency and low throughput when it comes to cross-shard transactions,\ni.e., transactions that require coordination from multiple shards. The root\ncause of these limitations arise from the use of the classic two-phase commit\nprotocol, which involves locking assets for extended periods of time. This\npaper presents Rivet, a new paradigm for blockchain sharding that achieves\nlower latency and higher throughput for cross-shard transactions. Rivet has a\nsingle reference shard running consensus, and multiple worker shards\nmaintaining disjoint states and processing a subset of transactions in the\nsystem. Rivet obviates the need for consensus within each worker shard, and as\na result, tolerates more failures within a shard and lowers communication\noverhead. We prove the correctness and security of Rivet. We also propose a\nmore realistic framework for evaluating sharded blockchains by creating a\nbenchmark based on real Ethereum transactions. An evaluation of our prototype\nimplementation of Rivet and the baseline two-phase commit, atop 50+ AWS EC2\ninstances, using our evaluation framework demonstrates the latency and\nthroughput improvements for cross-shard transactions.",

            "summary": "The blockchain space is changing constantly. New chains are being implemented\nfrequently with different use cases in mind. As more and more types of crypto\nassets are getting real world value there is an increasing need for blockchain\ninteroperability. Exchange services today are still dominated by central\nparties which require custody of funds. This trust imposes costs and security\nrisks as frequent breaches testify. Atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS) allow\nmutual distrusting parties to securely exchange crypto assets in a peer-to-peer\nmanner while preserving self-custody. Fundamental ACCS protocols leveraged the\nscripting capabilities of blockchains to conditionalize the transfer of funds\nbetween trading parties. Recent work showed that such protocols can be realized\nin a scriptless setting. This has many benefits to blockchains throughput,\nefficiency of swap protocols and also to fungibility and privacy. The proposed\nprotocols are limited to assets transferable by either Schnorr signatures or\nECDSA that are assuming the same elliptic curve parameters. In this work we\npresent JugglingSwap, a scriptless atomic cross-chain swap protocol with a\nhigher degree of interoperability. We weaken the assumptions about blockchains\nthat can be included in the ACCS protocol, and only require that (1) a\nthreshold variant exists to the underlying digital signature scheme and (2) it\nis based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). The fair\nexchange is achieved by a gradual release of secrets. To achieve this we use a\nnew building block we call Juggling: a public key verifiable encryption scheme\nto transfer segments of secret shares between parties, which can also be of\nseparate interest. Juggling is then tailored to a specific private key\nmanagement system design with threshold signatures security.",

Recently,\npermissioned blockchains garner particular attention thanks to their improved\nscalability and diverse needs from different organizations. One representative\nexample of permissioned blockchain is Hyperledger Fabric (\"Fabric\"). Due to its\nunique execute-order procedure, there is a critical need for a client to select\nan optimal number of peers. The interesting problem that this paper targets to\naddress is the tradeoff in the number of peers: a too large number will degrade\nscalability while a too small number will make the network vulnerable to faulty\nnodes. This optimization issue gets especially challenging in V2X networks due\nto mobility of nodes: a transaction must be executed and the associated block\nmust be committed before the vehicle leaves a network. To this end, this paper\nproposes an optimal peers selection mechanism based on reinforcement learning\n(RL) to keep a Fabric-empowered V2X network impervious to dynamicity due to\nmobility. We model the RL as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. The\nresults demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed scheme.",

Then, we propose a hybrid approach to perform the investigation by:\n1) collecting reported scams in the wild; and 2) detecting undisclosed ones\nbased on information collected from suspicious entities (e.g., domains, tweets,\netc). We have collected 195 confirmed COVID-19 cryptocurrency scams in total,\nincluding 91 token scams, 19 giveaway scams, 9 blackmail scams, 14 crypto\nmalware scams, 9 Ponzi scheme scams, and 53 donation scams. We then identified\nover 200 blockchain addresses associated with these scams, which lead to at\nleast 330K US dollars in losses from 6,329 victims. For each type of scams, we\nfurther investigated the tricks and social engineering techniques they used.

In this essay, we analyse blockchain\ntechnology and its social and political context from a perspective of Marxist\neconomic theory.\n  Since arguably the last great inflection point in society and technology was\nanalysed by Marx in terms of labour and capital and since we seem to be\nexperiencing a shift in the balance between these forces today, it makes sense\nto revisit the Marxist ideas and apply them to the current situation, to see\nhow well they still apply and if necessary to update them for current events.",

            "summary": "Consensus protocols play a pivotal role to balance security and efficiency in\nblockchain systems. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for\nblockchain consensus protocols termed as AlphaBlock. In this framework, we\ncompare the overall performance of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus and\nNakamoto Consensus (NC). BFT consensus is reached by multiple rounds of quorum\nvotes from the supermajority, while NC is reached by accumulating credibility\nwith the implicit voting from appending blocks. AlphaBlock incorporates the key\nconcepts of Hotstu BFT (HBFT) and Proof-of-authority (PoA) as the case study of\nBFT and NC. Using this framework, we compare the throughput and latency of HBFT\nand PoA with practical network and blockchain configurations. Our results show\nthat the performance of HBFT dominates PoA in most scenarios due to the absence\nof forks in HBFT. Moreover, we find out a set of optimal configurations in\nAlphaBlock, which sheds a light for improving the performance of blockchain\nconsensus algorithms.",

Instead, these protocols outsource their legitimacy to\nmechanisms beyond their internal structure, relying on traditional centralized\ninstitutions such as national ID issuers and KYC providers to verify the claims\nthey hold. This reliance has been employed to safeguard applications from a\nvulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in distributed\nsystems: the Sybil attack problem, which describes the abuse of an online\nsystem by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress\nin cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge\nin networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting,\nvouching, and interpreting, to arrive at a decentralized and sybil-resistant\nconsensus for identity.

Present vehicular\nsystem lacks data reliability, security, and easy deployment. Motivated by\nthese issues, this paper addresses a drone-enabled intelligent vehicular\nsystem, which is secure, easy to deploy and reliable in quality. Nevertheless,\nan increase in the number of operating drones in the communication networks\nmakes them more vulnerable towards the cyber-attacks, which can completely\nsabotage the communication infrastructure. To tackle these problems, we propose\na blockchain-based registration and authentication system for the entities such\nas drones, smart vehicles (SVs) and roadside units (RSUs). This paper is mainly\nfocused on the blockchain-based secure system design and the optimal placement\nof drones to improve the spectral efficiency of the overall network. In\nparticular, we investigate the association of RSUs with the drones by\nconsidering multiple communication-related factors such as available bandwidth,\nmaximum number of links a drone can support, and backhaul limitations. We show\nthat the proposed model can easily be overlaid on the current vehicular network\nreaping benefits of secure and reliable communications.",

We expect\nthese blockchains to eventually run in environments with high bandwidth and low\nlatency modern networks, as well as, advanced programmable hardware\naccelerators in servers.\n  Even though there is renewed interest in BFT consensus algorithms with\nvarious proposals targeting Permissioned Blockchains, related work does not\noptimize for fast networks and does not incorporate hardware accelerators -- we\nmake the case that doing so will pay off in the long run. To this end, we\nre-implemented the seminal PBFT algorithm in a way that allows us to measure\ndifferent configurations of the protocol. Through this we explore the benefits\nof various common optimization strategies and show that the protocol is\nunlikely to saturate more than 10Gbps networks without relying on specialized\nhardware-based offloading.

The framework exposes the\ninterrelation between technological decisions and architectural features,\ncapturing the knowledge from existing academic literature, industrial products,\ntechnical forums/blogs, and experts' feedback. We empirically show the\napplicability of our framework by dissecting the platforms behind Bitcoin and\nother top 10 cryptocurrencies, aided by a focus group with researchers and\nindustry practitioners. Then, we leverage the framework together with key\nnotions of the Architectural Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) to analyze four\nreal-world blockchain case studies from industry and academia. Results shown\nthat applying our framework leads to a deeper understanding of the\narchitectural tradeoffs, allowing to assess technologies more objectively and\nselect the one that best fit developers needs, ultimately cutting costs,\nreducing time-to-market and accelerating return on investment.",

This research study demonstrates the simulation of blockchain based\npower trading, supplemented by the solar power prediction using MLFF neural\nnetwork training in two prosumer nodes. This study can be the initial step in\nthe implementation of a power trading market model based on a decentralized\nblockchain system, with distributed generations in a university grid system.\nThis system can balance the electricity demand and supply within the institute,\nenable secure and rapid transactions, and the local market system can be\nreinforced by forecasting solar generation. The performance of the MLFF\ntraining can predict almost 90% accuracy of the model as short term ahead\nforecasting. Because of it, the prosumer bodies can complete the decision\nmaking before trading to their benefit.",

Although some classification frameworks\nfor common instruments from traditional finance and some for these new, so\ncalled cryptographic assets already exist and are used, a holistic approach to\nintegrate both worlds is missing. The present paper fills this research gap by\nidentifying 14 attributes, each of which is assigned different characteristics,\nthat can be used to classify all types of assets in a structured manner. Our\nproposed taxonomy which is an extension of existing classification frameworks,\nsummarises these findings in a morphological box and is tested for\npracticability by classifying exemplary assets like cash and bitcoin. The final\nclassification framework can help to ensure that the various stakeholders, such\nas investors or supervisors, have a consistent view of the different types of\nassets, and in particular of their characteristics, and also helps to establish\nstandardised terminology.",

            "summary": "Mining processes of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies are currently\nincentivized with voluntary transaction fees and fixed block rewards which will\nhalve gradually to zero. In the setting where optional and arbitrary\ntransaction fee becomes the remaining incentive, Carlsten et al.\\ [CCS~2016]\nfind that an undercutting attack can become the equilibrium strategy for\nminers. In undercutting, the attacker deliberately forks an existing chain by\nleaving wealthy transactions unclaimed to attract petty complaint miners to its\nfork. We observe that two simplifying assumptions in [CCS~2016] of fees\narriving at fixed rates and miners collecting {\\em all} accumulated fees\nregardless of block size limit are often infeasible in practice and find that\nthey are inaccurately inflating the profitability of undercutting. Studying\nBitcoin and Monero blockchain data, we find that the fees deliberately left out\nby an undercutter may not be attractive to other miners (hence to the attacker\nitself): the deliberately left out transactions may not fit into a new block\nwithout \"squeezing out\" some other to-be transactions, and thus claimable fees\nin the next round cannot be raised arbitrarily.\n  This work views undercutting and shifting among chains rationally as mining\nstrategies of rational miners. We model profitability of undercutting strategy\nwith block size limit present, which bounds the claimable fees in a round and\ngives rise to a pending (cushion) transaction set. In the proposed model, we\nfirst identify the conditions necessary to make undercutting profitable. We\nthen present an easy-to-deploy defense against undercutting by selectively\nassembling transactions into the new block to invalidate the identified\nconditions. Under a typical setting with undercutters present, applying this\navoidance technique is a Nash Equilibrium. Finally, we complement the above\nanalytical results with experiments.",

Even though there are\nparticular medications and vaccines to curb the epidemic, tracing and isolating\nthe infection source is the best option to slow the virus spread and reduce\ninfection and death rates. There are three disadvantages to the existing\ncontact tracing system: 1. User data is stored in a centralized database that\ncould be stolen and tampered with, 2. User's confidential personal identity may\nbe revealed to a third party or organization, 3. Existing contact tracing\nsystems only focus on information sharing from one dimension, such as\nlocation-based tracing, which significantly limits the effectiveness of such\nsystems.\n  We propose a global COVID-19 information sharing and risk notification system\nthat utilizes the Blockchain, Smart Contract, and Bluetooth. To protect user\nprivacy, we design a novel Blockchain-based platform that can share consistent\nand non-tampered contact tracing information from multiple dimensions, such as\nlocation-based for indirect contact and Bluetooth-based for direct contact.\nHierarchical smart contract architecture is also designed to achieve global\nagreements from users about how to process and utilize user data, thereby\nenhancing the data usage transparency. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism to\nprotect user identity privacy from multiple aspects. More importantly, our\nsystem can notify the users about the exposure risk via smart contracts.

However, increasing\nautomation and connectedness broadens the attack surface and heightens the\nlikelihood of a malicious entity successfully executing an attack. In this\npaper, we propose a Blockchain based Framework for sEcuring smaRt vehicLes\n(B-FERL). B-FERL uses permissioned blockchain technology to tailor information\naccess to restricted entities in the connected vehicle ecosystem.

In order to enable authentic and valid communication in the\nvehicular network, only vehicles with a verifiable record in the blockchain can\nexchange messages. Through qualitative arguments, we show that B-FERL is\nresilient to identified attacks. Also, quantitative evaluations in an emulated\nscenario show that B-FERL ensures a suitable response time and required storage\nsize compatible with realistic scenarios.

Later on, researchers proposed\nseveral variants of differential privacy in order to preserve privacy in\ncertain other scenarios, such as real-time cyber physical systems. Since then,\ndifferential privacy has rigorously been applied to certain other domains which\nhas the need of privacy preservation. One such domain is decentralized\nblockchain based smart metering, in which smart meters acting as blockchain\nnodes sent their real-time data to grid utility databases for real-time\nreporting. This data is further used to carry out statistical tasks, such as\nload forecasting, demand response calculation, etc. However, in case if any\nintruder gets access to this data it can leak privacy of smart meter users. In\nthis context, differential privacy can be used to protect privacy of this data.\nIn this chapter, we carry out comparison of four variants of differential\nprivacy (Laplace, Gaussian, Uniform, and Geometric) in blockchain based smart\nmetering scenario. We test these variants on smart metering data and carry out\ntheir performance evaluation by varying different parameters. Experimental\noutcomes shows at low privacy budget ($\\varepsilon$) and at low reading\nsensitivity value ($\\delta$), these privacy preserving mechanisms provide high\nprivacy by adding large amount of noise. However, among these four privacy\npreserving parameters Geometric parameters is more suitable for protecting high\npeak values and Laplace mechanism is more suitable for protecting low peak\nvalues at ($\\varepsilon$ = 0.01).",

By utilizing the ElGamal encryption, the server learns nearly\nnothing about the private data or the statistical result. The correctness of\naggregate statistics can be publicly verified by using a new efficient and\nverifiable computation approach. Moreover, the fairness of incentive is\nguaranteed based on the public blockchain in the presence of greedy service\nprovider, customers, and mobile users, who may launch payment-escaping,\npayment-reduction, free-riding, double-reporting, and Sybil attacks to corrupt\nreward distribution.

            "summary": "More than eight million smart contracts have been deployed into Ethereum,\nwhich is the most popular blockchain that supports smart contract. However,\nless than 1% of deployed smart contracts are open-source, and it is difficult\nfor users to understand the functionality and internal mechanism of those\nclosed-source contracts. Although a few decompilers for smart contracts have\nbeen recently proposed, it is still not easy for users to grasp the semantic\ninformation of the contract, not to mention the potential misleading due to\ndecompilation errors. In this paper, we propose the first system named STAN to\ngenerate descriptions for the bytecodes of smart contracts to help users\ncomprehend them. In particular, for each interface in a smart contract, STAN\ncan generate four categories of descriptions, including functionality\ndescription, usage description, behavior description, and payment description,\nby leveraging symbolic execution and NLP (Natural Language Processing)\ntechniques. Extensive experiments show that STAN can generate adequate,\naccurate, and readable descriptions for contract's bytecodes, which have\npractical value for users.",

They\nallow multiple agents to route payments through one another. So far, the\ntopology and construction of payment networks has not been explored much.\nParticipants are expected to minimize costs that are due to the allocation of\nliquidity as well as blockchain record fees. In this paper we study the\noptimization of maintenance costs of such networks. We present for the first\ntime, a closed model for symmetric off-chain channels, and provide efficient\nalgorithms for constructing minimal cost spanning-tree networks under this\nmodel. We prove that for any network demands, a simple hub topology provides a\n2-approximation to the minimal maintenance cost showing that spanning trees in\ngeneral are efficient. We also show an unbounded price of anarchy in a greedy\ngame between the transactors, when each player wishes to minimize his costs by\nchanging the network's structure. Finally, we simulate and compare the costs of\npayment networks with scale free demand topologies.",

            "summary": "Payment channel networks (PCN) enable scalable blockchain transactions\nwithout fundamentally changing the underlying distributed ledger algorithm.\nHowever, routing a payment via multiple channels in a PCN requires locking\ncollateral for potentially long periods of time. Adversaries can abuse this\nmechanism to conduct denial-of-service attacks. Previous work focused on source\nrouting, which is unlikely to remain a viable routing approach as these\nnetworks grow.\n  In this work, we examine the effectiveness of attacks in PCNs that use\nrouting algorithms based on local knowledge, where compromised intermediate\nnodes can delay or drop transactions to create denial-of-service. We focus on\nSpeedyMurmurs as a representative of such protocols. We identify two attacker\nnode selection strategies; one based on the position in the routing tree, and\nthe other on betweenness centrality. Our simulation-driven study shows that\nwhile they are both effective, the centrality-based attack approaches\nnear-optimal effectiveness. We also show that the attacks are ineffective in\nless centralized networks and discuss incentives for the participants in PCNs\nto create less centralized topologies through the payment channels they\nestablish among themselves.",

            "summary": "Since 2016, sharding has become an auspicious solution to tackle the\nscalability issue in legacy blockchain systems. Despite its potential to\nstrongly boost the blockchain throughput, sharding comes with its own security\nissues. To ease the process of deciding which shard to place transactions,\nexisting sharding protocols use a hash-based transaction sharding in which the\nhash value of a transaction determines its output shard. Unfortunately, we show\nthat this mechanism opens up a loophole that could be exploited to conduct a\nsingle-shard flooding attack, a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, to\noverwhelm a single shard that ends up reducing the performance of the system as\na whole.\n  To counter the single-shard flooding attack, we propose a countermeasure that\nessentially eliminates the loophole by rejecting the use of hash-based\ntransaction sharding. The countermeasure leverages the Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE) to let blockchain's validators securely execute a transaction\nsharding algorithm with a negligible overhead. We provide a formal\nspecification for the countermeasure and analyze its security properties in the\nUniversal Composability (UC) framework. Finally, a proof-of-concept is\ndeveloped to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of our solution.",

Not only those cross-shard transactions degrade\nthe system throughput but also double the confirmation time, and exhaust an\nalready scarce network bandwidth. Are cross-shard transactions imminent for\nsharding schemes? In this paper, we propose a new sharding paradigm, called\nOptChain, in which cross-shard transactions are minimized, resulting in almost\ntwice faster confirmation time and throughput. By treating transactions as a\nstream of nodes in an online graph, OptChain utilizes a lightweight and\non-the-fly transaction placement method to group both related and soon-related\ntransactions into the same shards. At the same time, OptChain maintains a\ntemporal balance among shards to guarantee the high parallelism. Our\ncomprehensive and large-scale simulation using Oversim P2P library confirms a\nsignificant boost in performance with up to 10 folds reduction in cross-shard\ntransactions, more than twice reduction in confirmation time, and 50% increase\nin throughput. When combined with Omniledger sharding protocol, OptChain\ndelivers a 6000 transactions per second throughput with 10.5s confirmation\ntime.",

We show that one of the more intuitive definitions of fairness is\nimpossible to achieve. We then present Wendy, a group of low overhead protocols\nthat can implement different concepts of fairness. Wendy acts as an additional\nwidget for an existing blockchain, and is largely agnostic to the underlying\nblockchain and its security assumptions. Furthermore, it is possible to apply a\nthe protocol only for a subset of the transactions, and thus run several\nindependent fair markets on the same chain.",

These smart contracts resemble\ntraditional programs, but with immutability being the core differentiating\nfactor. Given their immutability and potential high monetary value, it becomes\nimperative to develop high-quality smart contracts. Software metrics have\ntraditionally been an essential tool in determining programming quality. Given\nthe similarity between smart contracts (written in Solidity for Ethereum) and\nobject-oriented (OO) programming, OO metrics would appear applicable. In this\npaper, we empirically evaluate inheritance-based metrics as applied to smart\ncontracts. We adopt this focus because, traditionally, inheritance has been\nlinked to a more complex codebase which we posit is not the case with Solidity\nbased smart contracts. In this work, we evaluate the hypothesis that, due to\nthe differences in the context of smart contracts and OO programs, it may not\nbe appropriate to use the same interpretation of inheritance based metrics for\nassessment.",

            "summary": "In Bitcoin and Ethereum, nodes require large storage capacity to maintain all\nthe blockchain data, such as transactions, UTXOs, and account states. As of May\n2020, the storage size of the Bitcoin blockchain has expanded to 270 GB, and it\nwill continue to increase. This storage requirement is a major hurdle to\nbecoming a block proposer or validator. Although many studies have attempted to\nreduce the storage size, in the proposed methods, a node cannot keep all blocks\nor cannot generate a block. We propose an architecture called Trail that allows\nnodes to hold all blocks in a small storage and to generate and validate blocks\nand transactions. Trail does not depend on a consensus algorithm or fork choice\nrule. In this architecture, a client who issues transactions has the data to\nprove its own balances and can generate a transaction containing the proof of\nbalances. The nodes in Trail do not store transactions, UTXOs and account\nbalances: they keep only blocks. The blocksize is approximately 8 KB, which is\n100 times smaller than that of Bitcoin. Further, the block size is constant\nregardless of the number of accounts and the number of transactions. Compared\nto traditional blockchains, clients who issue transactions must store\nadditional data. However, we show that proper data archiving can keep the\naccount device storage size small. Trail allows more users to be block\nproposers and validators and improves the decentralization of the blockchain.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technology is a crypto-based secure ledger for data storage and\ntransfer through decentralized, trustless peer-to-peer systems. Despite its\nadvantages, previous studies have shown that the technology is not completely\nsecure against cyber attacks. Thus, it is crucial to perform domain specific\nrisk analysis to measure how viable the attacks are on the system, their impact\nand consequently the risk exposure. Specifically, in this paper, we carry out\nan analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated to an operational\nmulti-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We\nconduct an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. The\nanalysis identified five attack goals and five types of attackers that violate\nthe security of the blockchain system. In the case study of the public\npermissioned BSMD, we highlight the highest risk factors according to their\nimpact on the victims in terms of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust. Four\nattack goals represent a risk in terms of economic losses and one attack goal\ncontains many threats that represent a risk that is either unacceptable or\nundesirable.",

            "summary": "This paper presents LinSBFT, a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol with\nthe capacity of processing over 2000 smart contract transactions per second in\nproduction. LinSBFT applies to a permissionless, public blockchain system, in\nwhich there is no public-key infrastructure, based on the classic PBFT with 4\nimprovements: (\\romannumeral1) LinSBFT achieves $O(n)$ worst-case communication\nvolume, in contract to PBFT's $O(n^4)$; (\\romannumeral2) LinSBFT rotates the\nleader of protocol randomly to reduce the risk of denial-of-service attacks on\nleader; and (\\romannumeral3) each run of LinSBFT finalizes one block, which is\nrobust against participants that are honest in one run of the protocol, and\ndishonest in another, and the set of participants is dynamic, which is update\nperiodically. (\\romannumeral4) LinSBFT helps the delayed nodes to catch up via\na synchronization mechanism to promise the liveness. Further, in the ordinary\ncase, LinSBFT involves only a single round of voting instead of two in PBFT,\nwhich reduces both communication overhead and confirmation time, and employs\nthe \\emph{proof-of-stake} scheme to reward all participants. Extensive\nexperiments using data obtained from the Ethereum demonstrate that LinSBFT\nconsistently and significantly outperforms existing in-production BFT protocols\nfor blockchains.",

            "summary": "Smart contracting protocols promise to regulate the transfer of\ncryptocurrency amongst participants in a trustless manner. A safe smart\ncontract implementation should ensure that each participant can always append a\ncontract transaction to the blockchain in order move the contract towards\nsecure completion. To this goal, we propose Bitcoin Trace-Net, a contract\nverification framework which generates an executable symbolic model from the\nunderlying contract implementation. A Trace-Net model consists of a Petri Net\nformalism enriched with a Dolev-Yao-like actor knowledge model. The explicit\nsymbolic actor knowledge model supports the verification of contracts featuring\ncryptographic sub-protocols, which may not be observable on the blockchain.\nTrace-Net is sufficiently expressive to accurately model blockchain semantics\nsuch as the delay between a transaction broadcast and its subsequent\nconfirmation, as well as adversarial blockchain reorganizations of finite\ndepths, both of which can break smart contract safety. As an implementation\nlevel framework, Trace-Net can be instantiated at run-time to monitor and\nverify smart contract protocol executions.",

A\nsystem that analyzes the sleeping habits by continuously monitoring the\nphysiological changes that occur during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid\neye movement (NREM) stages of sleep is proposed in the current work. In\naddition to the physiological parameter changes, factors such as sleep\nduration, snoring range, eye movement, and limb movements are also monitored.\nThe SaYoPillow system is processed at the edge level with the storage being at\nthe cloud. Not having to compromise the user's privacy, SaYoPillow proposes\nsecure data transmission for both uploading and retrieving, and secure storage\nand communications as an attempt to reduce malicious attacks on healthcare. A\nuser interface is provided for the user to control data accessibility and\nvisibility. SaYoPillow has 96% accuracy which is close to other existing\nresearch works.

            "summary": "Most PoW blockchain protocols operate with a simple mechanism whereby a\nthreshold is set for each block and miners generate block hashes until one of\nthose values falls below the threshold. Although largely effective, this\nmechanism produces blocks at a highly variable rate and also leaves a\nblockchain susceptible to chain death, i.e. abandonment in the event that the\nthreshold is set too high to attract any miners. A recent innovation called\nreal-time block rate targeting, or RTT, fixes these problems by reducing the\ntarget throughout the mining interval. RTT exhibits much less variable block\ntimes and even features the ability to fully adjust the target after each\nblock. However, as we show in this paper, RTT also suffers from a critical\nvulnerability whereby miners deviate form the protocol to increase their\nprofits. We introduce the Radium protocol, which mitigates this vulnerability\nin RTT while retaining lower variance block times, responsive target\nadjustment, and lowering the risk of chain death. We also show that Radium's\nsusceptibility to the doublespend attack and orphaned blocks remains similar to\nBitcoin.",

            "summary": "A proof of work (PoW) blockchain protocol distributes rewards to its\nparticipants, called miners, according to their share of the total\ncomputational power. Sufficiently large miners can perform selfish mining -\ndeviate from the protocol to gain more than their fair share. Such systems are\nthus secure if all miners are smaller than a threshold size so their best\nresponse is following the protocol.\n  To find the threshold, one has to identify the optimal strategy for miners of\ndifferent sizes, i.e., solve a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, because\nof the PoW difficulty adjustment mechanism, the miners' utility is a non-linear\nratio function. We therefore call this an Average Reward Ratio (ARR) MDP.\nSapirshtein et al.\\ were the first to solve ARR MDPs by solving a series of\nstandard MDPs that converge to the ARR MDP solution.\n  In this work, we present a novel technique for solving an ARR MDP by solving\na single standard MDP. The crux of our approach is to augment the MDP such that\nit terminates randomly, within an expected number of rounds. We call this\nProbabilistic Termination Optimization (PTO), and the technique applies to any\nMDP whose utility is a ratio function. We bound the approximation error of PTO\n- it is inversely proportional to the expected number of rounds before\ntermination, a parameter that we control. Empirically, PTO's complexity is an\norder of magnitude lower than the state of the art.\n  PTO can be easily applied to different blockchains. We use it to tighten the\nbound on the threshold for selfish mining in Ethereum.",

            "summary": "We consider the privacy of interactions between individuals in a network. For\nmany networks, while nodes are anonymous to outside observers, the existence of\na link between individuals implies the possibility of one node revealing\nidentifying information about its neighbor. Moreover, while the identities of\nthe accounts are likely hidden to an observer, the network of interaction\nbetween two anonymous accounts is often available. For example, in blockchain\ncryptocurrencies, transactions between two anonymous accounts are published\nopenly. Here we consider what happens if one (or more) parties in such a\nnetwork are deanonymized by an outside identity. These compromised individuals\ncould leak information about others with whom they interacted, which could then\ncascade to more and more nodes' information being revealed. We use a\npercolation framework to analyze the scenario outlined above and show for\ndifferent likelihoods of individuals possessing information on their\ncounter-parties, the fraction of accounts that can be identified and the\nidealized minimum number of steps from a deanonymized node to an anonymous node\n(a measure of the effort required to deanonymize that individual). We further\ndevelop a greedy algorithm to estimate the \\emph{actual} number of steps that\nwill be needed to identify a particular node based on the noisy information\navailable to the attacker. We apply our framework to three real-world networks:\n(1) a blockchain transaction network, (2) a network of interactions on the dark\nweb, and (3) a political conspiracy network. We find that in all three\nnetworks, beginning from one compromised individual, it is possible to\ndeanonymize a significant fraction of the network ($>50$%) within less than 5\nsteps. Overall these results provide guidelines for investigators seeking to\nidentify actors in anonymous networks, as well as for users seeking to maintain\ntheir privacy.",

The primary problem in diagnosing COVID-19\npatients is the shortage and reliability of testing kits, due to the quick\nspread of the virus, medical practitioners are facing difficulty identifying\nthe positive cases. The second real-world problem is to share the data among\nthe hospitals globally while keeping in view the privacy concerns of the\norganizations. Building a collaborative model and preserving privacy are major\nconcerns for training a global deep learning model. This paper proposes a\nframework that collects a small amount of data from different sources (various\nhospitals) and trains a global deep learning model using blockchain based\nfederated learning. Blockchain technology authenticates the data and federated\nlearning trains the model globally while preserving the privacy of the\norganization. First, we propose a data normalization technique that deals with\nthe heterogeneity of data as the data is gathered from different hospitals\nhaving different kinds of CT scanners. Secondly, we use Capsule Network-based\nsegmentation and classification to detect COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, we design\na method that can collaboratively train a global model using blockchain\ntechnology with federated learning while preserving privacy. Additionally, we\ncollected real-life COVID-19 patients data, which is, open to the research\ncommunity. The proposed framework can utilize up-to-date data which improves\nthe recognition of computed tomography (CT) images. Finally, our results\ndemonstrate a better performance to detect COVID-19 patients.",

            "summary": "In modern healthcare systems, being able to share electronic health records\nis crucial for providing quality care and for enabling a larger spectrum of\nhealth services. Health data sharing is dependent on obtaining individual\nconsent which, in turn, is hindered by a lack of resources. To this extend,\nblockchain-based platforms facilitate data sharing by inherently creating a\ntrusted distributed network of users. These users are enabled to share their\ndata without depending on the time and resources of specific players (such as\nthe health services). In blockchain-based platforms, data governance mechanisms\nbecome very important due to the need to specify and monitor data sharing and\ndata use conditions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based data sharing\nconsent model for access control over individual health data. We use smart\ncontracts to dynamically represent the individual consent over health data and\nto enable data requesters to search and access them. The dynamic consent model\nextends upon two ontologies: the Data Use Ontology (DUO) which models the\nindividual consent of users and the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix\n(ADA-M) which describes queries from data requesters. We deploy the model on\nEthereum blockchain and evaluate different data sharing scenarios. The\ncontribution of this paper is to create an individual consent model for health\ndata sharing platforms. Such a model guarantees that individual consent is\nrespected and that there is accountability for all the participants in the data\nsharing platform. The evaluation of our solution indicates that such a data\nsharing model provides a flexible approach to decide how the data is used by\ndata requesters. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model is\nefficient and adapts to personalized access control policies in data sharing.",

            "summary": "This paper opts to mitigate the energy-inefficiency of the Blockchain\nProof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm by rationally repurposing the power\nspent during the mining process. The original PoW mining scheme is designed to\nconsider one block at a time and assign a reward to the first place winner of a\ncomputation race. To reduce the mining-related energy consumption, we propose\nto compensate the computation effort of the runner(s)-up of a mining round, by\ngranting them exclusivity of solving the upcoming block in the next round. This\nwill considerably reduce the number of competing nodes in the next round and\nconsequently, the consumed energy. Our proposed scheme divides time into\nepochs, where each comprises two mining rounds; in the first one, all network\nnodes can participate in the mining process, whereas in the second round only\nrunners-up can take part. Thus, the overall mining energy consumption can be\nreduced to nearly $50\\%$. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is\nthe first to considerably improve the energy consumption of the original PoW\nalgorithm. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our scheme in\nreducing energy consumption, the probability of fork occurrences, the level of\nmining centralization presented in the original PoW algorithm, and the effect\nof transaction censorship attack.",

            "summary": "Academic publications of latest research results are crucial to advance the\ndevelopment of all disciplines. However, there are several severe disadvantages\nin current academic publication systems. The first is the misconduct during the\npublication process due to the opaque paper review process. An anonymous\nreviewer may give biased comments to a paper without being noticed because the\ncomments are seldom published for evaluation. Second, access to research papers\nis restricted to only subscribers, and even the authors cannot access their own\npapers. To address the above problems, we propose Open-Pub, a decentralized,\ntransparent yet privacy-preserving academic publication scheme using the\nblockchain technology. In Open-Pub, we first design a threshold identity-based\ngroup signature (TIBGS) that protects identities of signers using verifiable\nsecret sharing. Then we develop a strong double-blind mechanism to protect the\nidentities of authors and reviewers. With this strong double-blind mechanism,\nauthors can choose to submit papers anonymously, and validators distribute\npapers anonymously to reviewers on the blockchain according to their research\ninterests. This process is publicly recorded and traceable on the blockchain so\nas to realize transparent peer preview. To evaluate its efficiency, we\nimplement Open-Pub based on Ethereum and conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate its performance, including computation cost and processing delay. The\nexperiment results show that Open-Pub is highly efficient in computation and\nprocessing anonymous transactions.",

            "summary": "Federated learning enables the development of a machine learning model among\ncollaborating agents without requiring them to share their underlying data.\nHowever, malicious agents who train on random data, or worse, on datasets with\nthe result classes inverted, can weaken the combined model. BlockFLow is an\naccountable federated learning system that is fully decentralized and\nprivacy-preserving. Its primary goal is to reward agents proportional to the\nquality of their contribution while protecting the privacy of the underlying\ndatasets and being resilient to malicious adversaries. Specifically, BlockFLow\nincorporates differential privacy, introduces a novel auditing mechanism for\nmodel contribution, and uses Ethereum smart contracts to incentivize good\nbehavior. Unlike existing auditing and accountability methods for federated\nlearning systems, our system does not require a centralized test dataset,\nsharing of datasets between the agents, or one or more trusted auditors; it is\nfully decentralized and resilient up to a 50% collusion attack in a malicious\ntrust model. When run on the public Ethereum blockchain, BlockFLow uses the\nresults from the audit to reward parties with cryptocurrency based on the\nquality of their contribution. We evaluated BlockFLow on two datasets that\noffer classification tasks solvable via logistic regression models. Our results\nshow that the resultant auditing scores reflect the quality of the honest\nagents' datasets. Moreover, the scores from dishonest agents are statistically\nlower than those from the honest agents. These results, along with the\nreasonable blockchain costs, demonstrate the effectiveness of BlockFLow as an\naccountable federated learning system.",

Applications of EVR include blockchain-based\nlotteries and gambling. An EVR source guarantees (i) secrecy, assuring that the\nrandom bits are kept secret until some predefined condition indicates that they\nare safe to reveal (e.g., the lottery's ticket sale closes), and (ii)\nrobustness, guaranteeing that the random bits are published once the condition\nholds. We formalize the EVR problem and solve it on top of an Ethereum-like\nblockchain abstraction, which supports smart contracts and a transferable\nnative coin. Randomness is generated via a distributed open commit-reveal\nscheme by game-theoretic agents who strive to maximize their coin holdings.\nNote that in an economic setting, such agents might profit from breaking\nsecrecy or robustness, and may engage in side agreements (via smart contracts)\nto this end. Our solution creates an incentive structure that counters such\nattacks. We prove that following the protocol gives rise to a stable state,\ncalled Coalition-Proof Nash Equilibrium, from which no coalition comprised of a\nsubset of the players can agree to deviate. In this stable state, robustness\nand secrecy are satisfied. Finally, we implement our EVR source over Ethereum.",

This allows authorities to automatically transact with\nconnected devices for witnessing services. A public request is made for witness\nstatements on the data of a target IoT that is transmitted on its local\nnetwork, and subsequently, devices (in close vicinity of the target IoT) offer\nwitnessing service.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (1) We develop a system architecture based\non blockchain and smart contract that enables authorities to dynamically avail\na verification service for data of a subject device from a distributed set of\nwitnesses which are willing to provide (in a privacy-preserving manner) their\nlocal wireless measurement in exchange of monetary return; (2) We then develop\na method to optimally select witnesses in such a way that the verification\nerror is minimized subject to monetary cost constraints; (3) Lastly, we\nevaluate the efficacy of our scheme using real Wi-Fi session traces collected\nfrom a five-storeyed building with more than thirty access points,\nrepresentative of a hospital.

Secondly, through\ngossip dissemination, GossipSub realises a lazy-pull model to reach nodes\nfar-away or outside the mesh. Thirdly, through constant observation, nodes\nmaintain a score profile for the peers they are connected to, allowing them to\nchoose the most well-behaved nodes to include in the mesh. Finally, and most\nimportantly, a number of tailor-made mitigation strategies designed\nspecifically for these three components make GossipSub resilient against the\nmost challenging Sybil-based attacks. We test GossipSub in a testbed\nenvironment involving more than 5000 VM nodes deployed on AWS and show that it\nstays immune to all considered attacks.

            "summary": "Clients of permissionless blockchain systems, like Bitcoin, rely on an\nunderlying peer-to-peer network to send and receive transactions. It is\ncritical that a client is connected to at least one honest peer, as otherwise\nthe client can be convinced to accept a maliciously forked view of the\nblockchain. In such an eclipse attack, the client is unable to reliably\ndistinguish the canonical view of the blockchain from the view provided by the\nattacker. The consequences of this can be catastrophic if the client makes\nbusiness decisions based on a distorted view of the blockchain transactions. In\nthis paper, we investigate the design space and propose two approaches for\nBitcoin clients to detect whether an eclipse attack against them is ongoing.\nEach approach chooses a different trade-off between average attack detection\ntime and network load. The first scheme is based on the detection of suspicious\nblock timestamps. The second scheme allows blockchain clients to utilize their\nnatural connections to the Internet (i.e., standard web activity) to gossip\nabout their blockchain views with contacted servers and their other clients.\nOur proposals improve upon previously proposed eclipse attack countermeasures\nwithout introducing any dedicated infrastructure or changes to the Bitcoin\nprotocol and network, and we discuss an implementation. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the gossip-based schemes through rigorous analysis using\noriginal Internet traffic traces and real-world deployment. The results\nindicate that our protocol incurs a negligible overhead and detects eclipse\nattacks rapidly with high probability, and is well-suited for practical\ndeployment.",

            "summary": "Role-based access control (RBAC) policies represent the rights of subjects in\nterms of roles to access resources. This research proposes a scalable, flexible\nand auditable RBAC system using the EOS blockchain platform to meet the\nsecurity requirements of organizations. The EOS blockchain platform for\ndeveloping smart contract and decentralized applications (DAPPs) aims to\naddress the scalability problem found in existing blockchain platforms. This\nsmart contract platform aims to eliminate transaction fees while conducting\nmillions of transactions per second. In our proposed approach, the EOS\nblockchain transparently stores RBAC policies. Administrative roles control\naccess to resources at a higher level according to the way organisations\nperform operations. An organisation creates roles, role hierarchies and\nconstraints to regulate user actions. Therefore, once an RBAC framework is\nestablished, the administrative user (issuer) only needs to grant and revoke\nroles to support changes in the organisational structure. Our proposed\nblockchain-based RBAC supports delegation capabilities using gaseless\ntransactions which makes it adoptable and appealing in a large number of\napplication scenarios. Our proposed solution is application-agnostic and\nwell-suited for diverse use cases. Existing state-of-the art security\nframeworks are not suitable due to the difficulty of scale, higher cost and\nsingle point of failure. Consequently, organisations demand a scalable,\ncost-effective and lightweight access control solution which can better protect\ntheir privacy as well. A proof of concept implementation is developed based on\nthe EOS blockchain. Our experimental results and analysis clearly show that our\nEOS blockchain-based RBAC outperforms existing blockchain platforms in terms of\ncost, latency, block generation time, contract execution time and throughput.",

The system would allow stakeholders (for example\nemployers) to validate learning records. Two main aims are investigated. The\nfirst is to evaluate the suitability of the idea of building a trusted\nachievement record for learners in higher education, and to evaluate potential\nuser knowledge of blockchain technology. This is to ensure that a designed\nsystem is usable. The second aim includes an interview conducted with a small\ngroup of participants to gather information about the challenges individuals\nhave when creating, and reviewing CVs. Overall, 90% of participants agreed that\nthere was a strong need for a trusted achievement record. In addition, 93.64%\nof respondents stated that they felt it was invaluable to have a system that is\nusable by all stakeholders. When tackling the second aim it was found that a\nprimary challenge is lack of knowledge of blockchain and its complexity. From\nthe employers' perspective, there is a lack of trust due to inaccuracies when\nstudents describe skills and qualifications in their resumes.",

            "summary": "Classic Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols forfeit liveness in the\nface of asynchrony in order to preserve safety, whereas most deployed\nblockchain protocols forfeit safety in order to remain live. In this work, we\nachieve the best of both worlds by proposing a novel abstractions called the\nfinality gadget. A finality gadget allows for transactions to always\noptimistically commit but informs the clients that these transactions might be\nunsafe. As a result, a blockchain can execute transactions optimistically and\nonly commit them after they have been sufficiently and provably audited. In\nthis work, we formally model the finality gadget abstraction, prove that it is\nimpossible to solve it deterministically in full asynchrony (even though it is\nstronger than consensus) and provide a partially synchronous protocol which is\ncurrently securing a major blockchain. This way we show that the protocol\ndesigner can decouple safety and liveness in order to speed up recovery from\nfailures. We believe that there can be other types of finality gadgets that\nprovide weaker safety (e.g., probabilistic) in order to gain more efficiency\nand this can depend on the probability that the network is not in synchrony.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we provide a new theoretical framework of pyramid Markov\nprocesses to solve some open and fundamental problems of blockchain selfish\nmining under a rigorous mathematical setting. We first describe a more general\nmodel of blockchain selfish mining with both a two-block leading competitive\ncriterion and a new economic incentive mechanism. Then we establish a pyramid\nMarkov process and show that it is irreducible and positive recurrent, and its\nstationary probability vector is matrix-geometric with an explicitly\nrepresentable rate matrix. Also, we use the stationary probability vector to\nstudy the influence of many orphan blocks on the waste of computing resource.\nNext, we set up a pyramid Markov reward process to investigate the long-run\naverage profits of the honest and dishonest mining pools, respectively. As a\nby-product, we build three approximative Markov processes and provide some new\ninteresting interpretation on the Markov chain and the revenue analysis\nreported in the seminal work by Eyal and Sirer (2014). Note that the pyramid\nMarkov (reward) processes can open up a new avenue in the study of blockchain\nselfish mining. Thus we hope that the methodology and results developed in this\npaper shed light on the blockchain selfish mining such that a series of\npromising research can be developed potentially.",

The assumption when using PoW is that a lot of trial and\nerror is required on average before a valid block is generated. One of the main\nconcerns raised with regard to this kind of system is the inherent need to\n\"waste\" energy on \"meaningless\" problems. In fact, the Bitcoin system is\nbelieved to consume more electricity than several small countries.\n  In this work we formally define three properties that are necessary for\nwasteless PoW systems: (1) solve \"meaningful\" problems (2) solve them\nefficiently and (3) be secure against double-spend attacks. These properties\naim to create an open market for problem-solving, in which miners produce\nsolutions to problems in the most efficient way (wasteless). The security of\nthe system stems from the economical incentive created by the demand for\nsolutions to these problems.\n  We analyze these properties, and deduce constraints that must apply to such\nPoW systems. In our main result, we conclude that under realistic assumptions,\nthe set of allowed problems must be preimage resistant functions in order to\nkeep the system secure and efficient.",

            "summary": "Ethereum smart contracts are programs that are deployed and executed in a\nconsensus-based blockchain managed by a peer-to-peer network. Several\nre-entrancy attacks that aim to steal Ether, the cryptocurrency used in\nEthereum, stored in deployed smart contracts have been found in the recent\nyears. A countermeasure to such attacks is based on dynamic analysis that\nexecutes the smart contracts themselves, but it requires the spending of Ether\nand knowledge of attack patterns for analysis in advance. In this paper, we\npresent a static analysis tool named \\textit{RA (Re-entrancy Analyzer)}, a\ncombination of symbolic execution and equivalence checking by a satisfiability\nmodulo theories solver to analyze smart contract vulnerabilities to re-entrancy\nattacks. In contrast to existing tools, RA supports analysis of inter-contract\nbehaviors by using only the Etherum Virtual Machine bytecodes of target smart\ncontracts, i.e., even without prior knowledge of attack patterns and without\nspending Ether. Furthermore, RA can verify existence of vulnerabilities to\nre-entrancy attacks without execution of smart contracts and it does not\nprovide false positives and false negatives. We also present an implementation\nof RA to evaluate its performance in analyzing the vulnerability of deployed\nsmart contracts to re-entrancy attacks and show that RA can precisely determine\nwhich smart contracts are vulnerable.",

As a\nresult, connections between personal identity and the ownership of on-chain\nlocation information are decoupled.

In\nparticular, multi-tenant applications at the edge of the network will boost the\ndevelopment of autonomous robots and vehicles offering computational resources\nand intelligence through reliable offloading services. The integration of more\ndistributed network architectures with distributed robotic systems can increase\nthe degree of intelligence and level of autonomy of connected units. We argue\nthat the last piece to put together a services framework with third-party\nintegration will be next-generation low-latency blockchain networks.\nBlockchains will enable a transparent and secure way of providing services and\nmanaging resources at the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) layer. We overview\nthe state-of-the-art in MEC slicing, distributed robotic systems and blockchain\ntechnology to define a framework for services the MEC layer that will enhance\nthe autonomous operations of connected robots and vehicles.",

            "summary": "Software development is a very broad activity that captures the entire life\ncycle of a software, which includes designing, programming, maintenance and so\non. In this study, we focus on the maintenance-related concerns of the\npost-deployment of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executed programs\nthat run on a blockchain. They cannot be modified once deployed and hence they\nbring unique maintenance challenges compared to conventional software.\nAccording to the definition of ISO/IEC 14764, there are four kinds of software\nmaintenance, i.e., corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive\nmaintenance. This study aims to answer (i) What kinds of issues will smart\ncontract developers encounter for corrective, adaptive, perfective, and\npreventive maintenance after they are deployed to the Ethereum? (ii) What are\nthe current maintenance-related methods used for smart contracts? To obtain the\nanswers to these research questions, we first conducted a systematic literature\nreview to analyze 131 smart contract related research papers published from\n2014 to 2020. Since the Ethereum ecosystem is fast-growing, some results from\nprevious publications might be out-of-date and there may be a gap between\nacademia and industry. To address this, we performed an online survey of smart\ncontract developers on Github to validate our findings and received 165 useful\nresponses. Based on the survey feedback and literature review, we present the\nfirst empirical study on smart contract maintenance-related concerns. Our study\ncan help smart contract developers better maintain their smart contract-based\nprojects, and we highlight some key future research directions to improve the\nEthereum ecosystem.",

            "summary": "The performance of partially synchronous BFT-based consensus protocols is\nhighly dependent on the primary node. All participant nodes in the network are\nblocked until they receive a proposal from the primary node to begin the\nconsensus process.Therefore, an honest but slack node (with limited bandwidth)\ncan adversely affect the performance when selected as primary. Hermes decreases\nprotocol dependency on the primary node and minimizes transmission delay\ninduced by the slack primary while keeping low message complexity and latency.\nHermes achieves these performance improvements by relaxing strong BFT agreement\n(safety) guarantees only for a specific type of Byzantine faults (also called\nequivocated faults). Interestingly, we show that in Hermes equivocating by a\nByzantine primary is unlikely, expensive and ineffective. Therefore, the safety\nof Hermes is comparable to the general BFT consensus. We deployed and tested\nHermes on 190 Amazon EC2 instances. In these tests, Hermes's performance was\ncomparable to the state-of-the-art BFT protocol for blockchains (when the\nnetwork size is large) in the absence of slack nodes. Whereas, in the presence\nof slack nodes Hermes out performed the state-of-the-art BFT protocol by more\nthan 4x in terms of throughput as well as 15x in terms of latency.",

            "summary": "Cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is expected to herald the\nage of autonomous vehicles in the coming years. With the integration of\nblockchain in such networks, information of all granularity levels, from\ncomplete blocks to individual transactions, would be accessible to vehicles at\nany time. Specifically, the blockchain technology is expected to improve the\nsecurity, immutability, and decentralization of cellular V2X communication\nthrough smart contract and distributed ledgers. Although blockchain-based\ncellular V2X networks hold promise, many challenges need to be addressed to\nenable the future interoperability and accessibility of such large-scale\nplatforms. One such challenge is the offloading of mining tasks in cellular V2X\nnetworks. While transportation authorities may try to balance the network\nmining load, the vehicles may select the nearest mining clusters to offload a\ntask. This may cause congestion and disproportionate use of vehicular network\nresources. To address this issue, we propose a game-theoretic approach for\nbalancing the load at mining clusters while maintaining fairness among\noffloading vehicles. Keeping in mind the low-latency requirements of vehicles,\nwe consider a finite channel blocklength transmission which is more practical\ncompared to the use of infinite blocklength codes. The simulation results\nobtained with our proposed offloading framework show improved performance over\nthe conventional nearest mining cluster selection technique.",

            "summary": "Within cloud-based internet of things (IoT) applications, typically cloud\nproviders employ Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to ensure the quality of their\nprovisioned services. Similar to any other contractual method, an SLA is not\nimmune to breaches. Ideally, an SLA stipulates consequences (e.g. penalties)\nimposed on cloud providers when they fail to conform to SLA terms. The current\npractice assumes trust in service providers to acknowledge SLA breach incidents\nand executing associated consequences. Recently, the Blockchain paradigm has\nintroduced compelling capabilities that may enable us to address SLA\nenforcement more elegantly. This paper proposes and implements a\nblockchain-based approach for assessing SLA compliance and enforcing\nconsequences. It employs a diagnostic accuracy method for validating the\ndependability of the proposed solution. The paper also benchmarks Hyperledger\nFabric to investigate its feasibility as an underlying blockchain\ninfrastructure concerning latency and transaction success/fail rates.",

This paper addresses the vulnerability of some\nunspecified security flaw in the SDN control plane application (such as a\nzero-day software vulnerability) which can be exploited to insert malicious\nflow rules in the switch that do not match network policies. Specifically, we\npropose a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) based framework that supports switch\nflow verification and insertion; and additionally provides straightforward\ndeployment of blockchain technology within an existing SDN infrastructure.\nWhile use of an external BaaS brings straightforward deployment, it obscures\nknowledge of the blockchain agents who are responsible for flow conformance\ntesting through a smart blockchain contract, leading to potential exploitation.\nThus, we design a strategy to prevent the blockchain agents from acting\narbitrarily, as this would result in what is termed a \"moral hazard\". We\nachieve this by developing a novel mathematical model of the fair reward scheme\nbased on game theory. To understand the performance of our system, we evaluate\nour model using a Matlab based simulation framework.

            "summary": "Electronic government (e-government) uses information and communication\ntechnologies to deliver public services to individuals and organisations\neffectively, efficiently and transparently. E-government is one of the most\ncomplex systems which needs to be distributed, secured and privacy-preserved,\nand the failure of these can be very costly both economically and socially.\nMost of the existing e-government systems such as websites and electronic\nidentity management systems (eIDs) are centralized at duplicated servers and\ndatabases. A centralized management and validation system may suffer from a\nsingle point of failure and make the system a target to cyber attacks such as\nmalware, denial of service attacks (DoS), and distributed denial of service\nattacks (DDoS). The blockchain technology enables the implementation of highly\nsecure and privacy-preserving decentralized systems where transactions are not\nunder the control of any third party organizations. Using the blockchain\ntechnology, exiting data and new data are stored in a sealed compartment of\nblocks (i.e., ledger) distributed across the network in a verifiable and\nimmutable way. Information security and privacy are enhanced by the blockchain\ntechnology in which data are encrypted and distributed across the entire\nnetwork. This paper proposes a framework of a decentralized e-government\npeer-to-peer (p2p) system using the blockchain technology, which can ensure\nboth information security and privacy while simultaneously increasing the trust\nof the public sectors. In addition, a prototype of the proposed system is\npresented, with the support of a theoretical and qualitative analysis of the\nsecurity and privacy implications of such system.",

            "summary": "A key performance metric in blockchains is the latency between when a\ntransaction is broadcast and when it is confirmed (the so-called, confirmation\nlatency). While improvements in consensus techniques can lead to lower\nconfirmation latency, a fundamental lower bound on confirmation latency is the\npropagation latency of messages through the underlying peer-to-peer (p2p)\nnetwork (inBitcoin, the propagation latency is several tens of seconds). The de\nfacto p2p protocol used by Bitcoin and other blockchains is based on random\nconnectivity: each node connects to a random subset of nodes. The induced p2p\nnetwork topology can be highly suboptimal since it neglects geographical\ndistance, differences in bandwidth, hash-power and computational abilities\nacross peers. We present Perigee, a decentralized algorithm that automatically\nlearns an efficient p2p topology tuned to the aforementioned network\nheterogeneities, purely based on peers' interactions with their neighbors.\nMotivated by the literature on the multi-armed bandit problem, Perigee\noptimally balances the tradeoff between retaining connections to known\nwell-connected neighbors, and exploring new connections to previously-unseen\nneighbors. Experimental evaluations show that Perigee reduces the latency to\nbroadcast by $33\\%$. Lastly Perigee is simple, computationally lightweight,\nadversary-resistant, and compatible with the selfish interests of peers, making\nit an attractive p2p protocol for blockchains.",

However, there are\nmany challenges to adopt global collaboration among the edge computing server\nentities among which the following two are significant: ensuring trust among\nthe servers and developing a unified scheme to enable real-time collaboration\nand task sharing. In this article, a blockchain framework is proposed to\nprovide a trusted collaboration mechanism between edge servers in a MEC\nenvironment.

A proof-of-work (PoW) based consensus mechanism has been proven\nto be secure and robust owing to its simple rule and has served as a firm\nfoundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

In this paper, we aim to propose a new PoW\ncalled Error-Correction Codes PoW (ECCPoW) where the error-correction codes and\ntheir decoder can be utilized for PoW. In ECCPoW, puzzles can be intentionally\ngenerated to vary from block to block, leading to a time-variant puzzle\ngeneration mechanism.

Many of\nthese constructions, including operational payment channels and atomic swaps,\nuse a building block called Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC).\n  In this work, we distill from HTLC a specification (HTLC-Spec), and present\nan implementation called Mutual-Assured-Destruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract\n(MAD-HTLC). MAD-HTLC employs a novel approach of utilizing the existing\nblockchain operators, called miners, as part of the design. If a user\nmisbehaves, MAD-HTLC incentivizes the miners to confiscate all her funds. We\nprove MAD-HTLC's security using the UC framework and game-theoretic analysis.\nWe demonstrate MAD-HTLC's efficacy and analyze its overhead by instantiating it\non Bitcoin's and Ethereum's operational blockchains.\n  Notably, current miner software makes only little effort to optimize revenue,\nsince the advantage is relatively small. However, as the demand grows and other\nrevenue components shrink, miners are more motivated to fully optimize their\nfund intake. By patching the standard Bitcoin client, we demonstrate such\noptimization is easy to implement, making the miners natural enforcers of\nMAD-HTLC.\n  Finally, we extend previous results regarding HTLC vulnerability to bribery\nattacks. An attacker can incentivize miners to prefer her transactions by\noffering high transaction fees. We demonstrate this attack can be easily\nimplemented by patching the Bitcoin client, and use game-theoretic tools to\nqualitatively tighten the known cost bound of such bribery attacks in presence\nof rational miners. We identify bribe opportunities occurring on the Bitcoin\nand Ethereum main networks where a few dollars bribe could yield tens of\nthousands of dollars in reward (e.g., \\$2 for over \\$25K).",

            "summary": "Blockchain has become particularly popular due to its promise to support\nbusiness-critical services in very different domains (e.g., retail, supply\nchains, healthcare). Blockchain systems rely on complex middleware, like\nEthereum or Hyperledger Fabric, that allow running smart contracts, which\nspecify business logic in cooperative applications. The presence of software\ndefects or faults in these contracts has notably been the cause of failures,\nincluding severe security problems. In this paper, we use a software\nimplemented fault injection (SWIFI) technique to assess the behavior of\npermissioned blockchain systems in the presence of faulty smart contracts. We\nemulate the occurrence of general software faults (e.g., missing variable\ninitialization) and also blockchain-specific software faults (e.g., missing\nrequire statement on transaction sender) in smart contracts code to observe the\nimpact on the overall system dependability (i.e., reliability and integrity).\nWe also study the effectiveness of formal verification (i.e., done by\nsolc-verify) and runtime protections (e.g., using the assert statement)\nmechanisms in detection of injected faults. Results indicate that formal\nverification as well as additional runtime protections have to complement\nbuilt-in platform checks to guarantee the proper dependability of blockchain\nsystems and applications. The work presented in this paper allows smart\ncontract developers to become aware of possible faults in smart contracts and\nto understand the impact of their presence. It also provides valuable\ninformation for middleware developers to improve the behavior (e.g., overall\nfault tolerance) of their systems.",

            "summary": "Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged to support clinicians in\ninterpreting medical images. CAD systems are traditionally combined with\nartificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and data augmentation to\nevaluate suspicious structures in medical images. This evaluation generates\nvast amounts of data. Traditional CAD systems belong to a single institution\nand handle data access management centrally. However, the advent of CAD systems\nfor research among multiple institutions demands distributed access management.\nThis research proposes a blockchain-based solution to enable distributed data\naccess management in CAD systems. This solution has been developed as a\ndistributed application (DApp) using Ethereum in a consortium network.",

A major challenge occurs when a new\nnode joining the network wants to retrieve the current state of the ledger.\nIndeed, that node may receive conflicting information from honest and Byzantine\nnodes, making it difficult to identify the current state. In this paper, we are\ninterested in protocols that are stateless, i.e., a new joining node should be\nable to retrieve the current state of the ledger just using a fixed amount of\ndata that characterizes the ledger (such as the genesis block in Bitcoin).

            "summary": "A Proof of Sequential Work (PoSW) allows a prover to convince a\nresource-bounded verifier that the prover invested a substantial amount of\nsequential time to perform some underlying computation. PoSWs have many\napplications including time-stamping, blockchain design, and universally\nverifiable CPU benchmarks. Mahmoody, Moran, and Vadhan (ITCS 2013) gave the\nfirst construction of a PoSW in the random oracle model though the construction\nrelied on expensive depth-robust graphs. In a recent breakthrough, Cohen and\nPietrzak (EUROCRYPT 2018) gave an efficient PoSW construction that does not\nrequire expensive depth-robust graphs.\n  In the classical parallel random oracle model, it is straightforward to argue\nthat any successful PoSW attacker must produce a long $\\mathcal{H}$-sequence\nand that any malicious party running in sequential time $T-1$ will fail to\nproduce an $\\mathcal{H}$-sequence of length $T$ except with negligible\nprobability. In this paper, we prove that any quantum attacker running in\nsequential time $T-1$ will fail to produce an $\\mathcal{H}$-sequence except\nwith negligible probability -- even if the attacker submits a large batch of\nquantum queries in each round. The proof is substantially more challenging and\nhighlights the power of Zhandry's recent compressed oracle technique (CRYPTO\n2019). We further extend this result to establish post-quantum security of a\nnon-interactive PoSW obtained by applying the Fiat-Shamir transform to Cohen\nand Pietrzak's efficient construction (EUROCRYPT 2018).",

These fundamental differences have hindered \"apples-to-apples\"\ncomparisons between different categories of blockchain protocols and, in turn,\nthe development of theory to formally discuss their relative merits.\n  This paper presents a parsimonious abstraction sufficient for capturing and\ncomparing properties of many well-known permissionless blockchain protocols,\nsimultaneously capturing essential properties of both proof-of-work and\nproof-of-stake protocols, and of both longest-chain-type and BFT-type\nprotocols. Our framework blackboxes the precise mechanics of the user selection\nprocess, allowing us to isolate the properties of the selection process which\nare significant for protocol design.\n  We illustrate our framework's utility with two results. First, we prove an\nanalog of the CAP theorem from distributed computing for our framework in a\npartially synchronous setting. This theorem shows that a fundamental dichotomy\nholds between protocols (such as Bitcoin) that are adaptive, in the sense that\nthey can function given unpredictable levels of participation, and protocols\n(such as Algorand) that have certain finality properties. Second, we formalize\nthe idea that proof-of-work (PoW) protocols and non-PoW protocols can be\ndistinguished by the forms of permission that users are given to carry out\nupdates to the state.",

Furthermore, the anomaly detection model is\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks since, during the training phase, all\nobservations are assumed to be benign. In this paper, we propose (1) a novel\napproach for anomaly detection and (2) a lightweight framework that utilizes\nthe blockchain to ensemble an anomaly detection model in a distributed\nenvironment.\n  Blockchain framework incrementally updates a trusted anomaly detection model\nvia self-attestation and consensus among the IoT devices.

            "summary": "Mining in the blockchain requires high computing power to solve the hash\npuzzle for example proof-of-work puzzle. It takes high cost to achieve the\ncalculation of this problem in devices of IOT, especially the mobile devices of\nIOT. It consequently restricts the application of blockchain in mobile\nenvironment. However, edge computing can be utilized to solve the problem for\ninsufficient computing power of mobile devices in IOT. Edge servers can recruit\nmany mobile devices to contribute computing power together to mining and share\nthe reward of mining with these recruited mobile devices. In this paper, we\npropose an incentivizing mechanism based on edge computing for mobile\nblockchain. We design a two-stage Stackelberg Game to jointly optimize the\nreward of edge servers and recruited mobile devices. The edge server as the\nleader sets the expected fee for the recruited mobile devices in Stage I. The\nmobile device as a follower provides its computing power to mine according to\nthe expected fee in Stage. It proves that this game can obtain a uniqueness\nNash Equilibrium solution under the same or different expected fee. In the\nsimulation experiment, we obtain a result curve of the profit for the edge\nserver with the different ratio between the computing power from the edge\nserver and mobile devices. In addition, the proposed scheme has been compared\nwith the MDG scheme for the profit of the edge server. The experimental results\nshow that the profit of the proposed scheme is more than that of the MDG scheme\nunder the same total computing power.",

            "summary": "The Lightning Network promises to alleviate Bitcoin's known scalability\nproblems. The operation of such second layer approaches relies on the ability\nof participants to turn to the blockchain to claim funds at any time, which is\nassumed to happen rarely. One of the risks that was identified early on is that\nof a wide systemic attack on the protocol, in which an attacker triggers the\nclosure of many Lightning channels at once. The resulting high volume of\ntransactions in the blockchain will not allow for the proper settlement of all\ndebts, and attackers may get away with stealing some funds. This paper explores\nthe details of such an attack and evaluates its cost and overall impact on\nBitcoin and the Lightning Network. Specifically, we show that an attacker is\nable to simultaneously cause victim nodes to overload the Bitcoin blockchain\nwith requests and to steal funds that were locked in channels. We go on to\nexamine the interaction of Lightning nodes with the fee estimation mechanism\nand show that the attacker can continuously lower the fee of transactions that\nwill later be used by the victim in its attempts to recover funds - eventually\nreaching a state in which only low fractions of the block are available for\nlightning transactions. Our attack is made easier even further as the Lightning\nprotocol allows the attacker to increase the fee offered by his own\ntransactions. We continue to empirically show that the vast majority of nodes\nagree to channel opening requests from unknown sources and are therefore\nsusceptible to this attack. We highlight differences between various\nimplementations of the Lightning Network protocol and review the susceptibility\nof each one to the attack. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies to lower\nthe systemic attack risk of the network.",

We conclude that neither\nminers nor mining pools who seek to maximize their compound return will have a\nfinancial incentive to occupy more than 50% of the hash rate if the cost of\nmining is at the same level for all. However, if there is an outstandingly\ncost-efficient miner, then the market share of this miner may exceed 50% in the\nequilibrium, which can threaten the viability of the entire ecosystem.",

Applications of artificial\nintelligence, blockchain technologies, and internet of things are promising to\naccelerate digitalization further. As a consequence, the number of data\ncenters, which provide the services of data processing, storage, and\ncommunication services, is also increasing rapidly. Because data centers are\nenergy-intensive with significant and growing electricity demand, an energy\nmodel of data centers with temporal, spatial, and predictive analysis\ncapability is critical for guiding industry and governmental authorities for\nmaking technology investment decisions. However, current models fail to provide\nconsistent and high dimensional energy analysis for data centers due to severe\ndata gaps. This can be further attributed to the lack of the modeling\ncapabilities for energy analysis of data center components including IT\nequipment and data center cooling and power provisioning infrastructure in\ncurrent energy models. In this research, a technology-based modeling framework,\nin hybrid with a data-driven approach, is proposed to address the knowledge\ngaps in current data center energy models. The research aims to provide policy\nmakers and data center energy analysts with comprehensive understanding of data\ncenter energy use and efficiency opportunities and a better understanding of\nmacro-level data center energy demand and energy saving potentials, in addition\nto the technological barriers for adopting energy efficiency measures.",

In this paper, we take\nthe first step to demystify the fake deposit vulnerability. Based on the\nessential patterns we have summarized, we implement DEPOSafe, an automated tool\nto detect and verify (exploit) the fake deposit vulnerability in ERC-20 smart\ncontracts. DEPOSafe incorporates several key techniques including symbolic\nexecution based static analysis and behavior modeling based dynamic\nverification. By applying DEPOSafe to 176,000 ERC-20 smart contracts, we have\nidentified over 7,000 vulnerable contracts that may suffer from two types of\nattacks.

Botnets benefited from this rise to increase their size and\nthe magnitude of their attacks. However, they still have a weak point in their\nCommand & Control (C&C) system, which is often based on centralized services or\nrequire a complex infrastructure to keep operating without being taken down by\nauthorities. The recent spread of blockchain technologies may give botnets a\npowerful tool to make them very hard to disrupt. Recent research showed how it\nis possible to embed C&C messages in Bitcoin transactions, making them nearly\nimpossible to block. Nevertheless, transactions have a cost and allow very\nlimited amounts of data to be transmitted. Because of that, only messages from\nthe botmaster to the bots are sent via Bitcoin, while bots are assumed to\ncommunicate through external channels. Furthermore, for the same reason,\nBitcoin-based messages are sent in clear. In this paper we show how, using\nBitcoin Testnet, it is possible to overcome these limitations and implement a\ncost-free, bidirectional, and encrypted C&C channel between the botmaster and\nthe bots. We propose a communication protocol and analyze its viability in real\nlife. Our results show that this approach would enable a botmaster to build a\nrobust and hard-to-disrupt C&C system at virtually no cost, thus representing a\nrealistic threat for which countermeasures should be devised.",

            "summary": "We propose a novel consensus protocol based on a hybrid approach, that\ncombines a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and a classical chain of blocks. This\narchitecture allows us to enforce collective block construction, minimising the\nmonopolistic power of the round-leader. In this way, we decrease the\npossibility for collusion among senders and miners, as well as miners\nthemselves, allowing the use of more incentive compatible and fair pricing\nstrategies. We investigate these possibilities alongside the ability to use the\nDAG structure to minimise the risk of transaction censoring. We conclude by\nproviding preliminary benchmarks of our protocol and by exploring further\nresearch directions.",

With the widespread deployment of\nByzantine consensus in blockchains and distributed ledgers today, however, more\nsophisticated trust assumptions are needed.\n  This paper presents the first implementation of BFT consensus with\ngeneralized quorums. It starts from a number of generalized trust structures\nmotivated by practice and explores methods to specify and implement them\nefficiently. In particular, it expresses the trust assumption by a monotone\nBoolean formula (MBF) with threshold operators and by a monotone span program\n(MSP), a linear-algebraic model for computation.\n  An implementation of HotStuff BFT consensus using these quorum systems is\ndescribed as well and compared to the existing threshold model. Benchmarks with\nHotStuff running on up to 40 replicas demonstrate that the MBF specification\nincurs no significant slowdown, whereas the MSP expression affects latency and\nthroughput noticeably due to the involved computations.",

Monitoring this huge number of IoT devices that are heterogeneous in\nterms of underlying communication protocols and data format is challenging.

Since using centralized architectures comes at the\nexpense of trusting an authority, it has several inherent drawbacks, including\nvulnerability to security attacks, lack of data privacy, and unauthorized data\nmanipulation. Hence, a new decentralized approach is crucial to remedy these\ndrawbacks. One of the most promising technologies which is widely used to\nprovide decentralization is blockchain. Additionally, to ease the burden of\ncommunication overhead and computational power on resource-constrained IoT\ndevices, fog computing can be exploited to decrease communication latency and\nprovide better network scalability.\n  In this paper, we propose a scalable blockchain-based architecture for\nmonitoring IoT devices using fog computing.

Blockchains that may experience severe hash rate fluctuations need\ndifficulty algorithms that quickly adapt the mining difficulty. However,\nwithout careful design, the system could be gamed by miners using coin-hopping\nstrategies to manipulate the block difficulty for profit. Such miner behavior\nresults in an unreliable system due to the unstable processing of transactions.\n  We provide an empirical analysis of how Bitcoin Cash's difficulty algorithm\ndesign leads to cyclicality in block solve times as a consequence of a positive\nfeedback loop. In response, we mathematically derive a difficulty algorithm\nusing a negative exponential filter which prohibits the formation of positive\nfeedback and exhibits additional desirable properties, such as history\nagnosticism. We compare the described algorithm to that of Bitcoin Cash in a\nsimulated mining environment and verify that the former would eliminate the\nsevere oscillations in transaction throughput.",

While data can be retained in\nblockchains, the stored values can be deleted or updated. From a user viewpoint\nthat searches for the data, it is unclear whether the discovered data from the\nblockchain storage is relevant for real-time decision-making process for\nblockchain-based application. The data freshness issue serves as a critical\nfactor especially in dynamic networks handling real-time information. In\ngeneral, transactions to renew the data require additional processing time\ninside the blockchain network, which is called ledger-commitment latency. Due\nto this problem, some users may receive outdated data. As a result, it is\nimportant to investigate if blockchain is suitable for providing real-time data\nservices. In this article, we first describe blockchain-enabled (BCE) networks\nwith Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Then, we define age of information (AoI) of BCE\nnetworks and investigate the influential factors in this AoI. Analysis and\nexperiments are conducted to support our proposed framework. Lastly, we\nconclude by discussing some future challenges.",

Given its dramatic price spikes (and crashes) along\nwith the never-ending news from SEC regulations to security breaches, there\nseems to be a lack of understanding about the dynamics of cryptocurrencies.\nThese dynamics are believed to be affected by various political, security,\nfinancial, and regulatory events. In this paper, we present an efficient\nframework for holistic analysis of cryptocurrency fluctuations by introducing\nthe Impact-Score metric to distinguish event-induced changes from normal\nvariations. We have applied our framework to 16 major worldwide events and the\nBitcoin blockchain network (defined as Bitcoin transaction and users,\nblockchain data, and memory pool data) from 2016-2018. The results show that a\nmajority of the events are correlated with substantial network changes. We\nobserved roughly generalizable correlations between event types (e.g. financial\nevents) and sub-structures of the Bitcoin blockchain network. Subgroups of\nthese events have strongly consistent temporal impacts on specific facets (e.g.\nactivity or fees) of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nrobustness of our process by correlating a majority of spikes in\nnetwork/subnetwork change with major events.",

Although these q-ary trees reduce\nthe branching factor and height, they still have their heights based on the key\nlength, and are forced to fixed heights. Instead of basing nodes on q-ary\nprefix trees, the B Merkle Tree incorporates concise intranode commitments\nwithin a self-balancing tree. The tree is based on the ordering of elements,\nwhich requires extra information to determine element placement, but it enables\nsignificantly smaller proof sizes. This allows for much lower tree heights\n(directed by the order of elements, not the size of the key), and therefore\ncreates smaller and more efficient proofs and operations. Additionally, the B\nMerkle Tree is defined with subset queries that feature similar communication\ncosts to non-membership proofs. Our scheme has the potential to benefit\noutsourced database models, like blockchain, which use authenticated data\nstructures and database indices to ensure immutability and integrity of data.\nWe present potential applications in key-value stores, relational databases,\nand, in part, Merkle forests.",

However, due to inadequate testing, DApps are easily\nexposed to serious vulnerabilities. We find three main challenges for DApp\ntesting, i.e., the inherent complexity of DApp, inconvenient pre-state setting,\nand not-so-readable logs. In this paper, we propose a testing framework named\nKaya to bridge these gaps. Kaya has three main functions. Firstly, Kaya\nproposes DApp behavior description language (DBDL) to make writing test cases\neasier. Test cases written in DBDL can also be automatically executed by Kaya.\nSecondly, Kaya supports a flexible and convenient way for test engineers to set\nthe blockchain pre-states easily. Thirdly, Kaya transforms incomprehensible\naddresses into readable variables for easy comprehension. With these functions,\nKaya can help test engineers test DApps more easily. Besides, to fit the\nvarious application environments, we provide two ways for test engineers to use\nKaya, i.e., UI and command-line. Our experimental case demonstrates the\npotential of Kaya in helping test engineers to test DApps more easily.",

GHAST protocol simultaneously achieves a\nlogarithmically bounded liveness guarantee and low confirmation latency. More\nspecifically, for maximum latency $d$ and adversarial computing power bounded\naway from 50\\%, GHAST guarantees confirmation with confidence $\\ge\n1-\\varepsilon$ after a time period of $O(d\\cdot \\log(1/\\varepsilon))$.

            "summary": "This paper introduces WhylSon, a deductive verification tool for smart\ncontracts written in Michelson, which is the low-level language of the Tezos\nblockchain. WhylSon accepts a formally specified Michelson contract and\nautomatically translates it to an equivalent program written in WhyML, the\nprogramming and specification language of the Why3 framework. Smart contract\ninstructions are mapped into a corresponding WhyML shallow-embedding of the\ntheir axiomatic semantics, which we also developed in the context of this work.\nOne major advantage of this approach is that it allows an out-of-the-box\nintegration with the Why3 framework, namely its VCGen and the backend support\nfor several automated theorem provers. We also discuss the use of WhylSon to\nautomatically prove the correctness of diverse annotated smart contracts.",

Cryptocurrencies, in particular, have developed\nas a haven for money laundering activity. Machine Learning can be used to\ndetect these illicit patterns. However, labels are so scarce that traditional\nsupervised algorithms are inapplicable. Here, we address money laundering\ndetection assuming minimal access to labels. First, we show that existing\nstate-of-the-art solutions using unsupervised anomaly detection methods are\ninadequate to detect the illicit patterns in a real Bitcoin transaction\ndataset. Then, we show that our proposed active learning solution is capable of\nmatching the performance of a fully supervised baseline by using just 5\\% of\nthe labels. This solution mimics a typical real-life situation in which a\nlimited number of labels can be acquired through manual annotation by experts.",

This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to\nseamlessly achieve interoperability among blockchains.\n  Given the novelty and potential of this new domain, we conduct a literature\nreview on blockchain interoperability, by collecting 262 papers, and 70 grey\nliterature documents, constituting a corpus of 332 documents. From those 332\ndocuments, we systematically analyzed and discussed 80 documents, including\nboth peer-reviewed papers and grey literature.\n  Our review classifies studies in three categories: Cryptocurrency-directed\ninteroperability approaches, Blockchain Engines, and Blockchain Connectors.\nEach category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria.\nWe discuss not only studies within each category and subcategory but also\nacross categories, providing a holistic overview of blockchain\ninteroperability, paving the way for systematic research in this domain. Our\nfindings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than\ncryptocurrencies.\n  The present survey leverages an interesting approach: we systematically\ncontacted the authors of grey literature papers and industry solutions to\nobtain an updated view of their work. Finally, this paper discusses supporting\ntechnologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and provides several\nfuture research directions.",

In our\nprivacy analysis of Ethereum's account-based model, we describe several\npatterns that characterize only a limited set of users and successfully apply\nthese quasi-identifiers in address deanonymization tasks. Using Ethereum Name\nService identifiers as ground truth information, we quantitatively compare\nalgorithms in recent branch of machine learning, the so-called graph\nrepresentation learning, as well as time-of-day activity and transaction fee\nbased user profiling techniques. As an application, we rigorously assess the\nprivacy guarantees of the Tornado Cash coin mixer by discovering strong\nheuristics to link the mixing parties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to propose and implement Ethereum user profiling techniques based on\nquasi-identifiers. Finally, we describe a malicious value-fingerprinting\nattack, a variant of the Danaan-gift attack, applicable for the confidential\ntransaction overlays on Ethereum.

In order to avoid ambiguities and\nmisinterpretations, several domain specific languages (DSLs) for specifying\nsuch derivatives have been proposed.

Therefore, more\ncaution should be taken in order to avoid undesired situations.\n  In this paper, we address the formal verification of financial derivatives\nwritten in a DSL for blockchain, called Findel. We identify a list of\nproperties that, once proved, they exclude several security vulnerabilities\n(e.g., immutable bugs, money losses). We develop an infrastructure that\nprovides means to interactively formalize and prove such properties. To provide\na higher confidence, we also generate proof certificates.

            "summary": "The Byzantine agreement problem is considered to be a core problem in\ndistributed systems. For example, Byzantine agreement is needed to build a\nblockchain, a totally ordered log of records. Blockchains are asynchronous\ndistributed systems, fault-tolerant against Byzantine nodes.\n  In the literature, the asynchronous byzantine agreement problem is studied in\na fully connected network model where every node can directly send messages to\nevery other node. This assumption is questionable in many real-world\nenvironments. In the reality, nodes might need to communicate by means of an\nincomplete network, and Byzantine nodes might not forward messages.\nFurthermore, Byzantine nodes might not behave correctly and, for example,\ncorrupt messages. Therefore, in order to truly understand Byzantine Agreement,\nwe need both ingredients: asynchrony and incomplete communication networks.\n  In this paper, we study the asynchronous Byzantine agreement problem in\nincomplete networks. A classic result by Danny Dolev proved that in a\ndistributed system with n nodes in the presence of f Byzantine nodes, the\nvertex connectivity of the system communication graph should be at least\n(2f+1). While Dolev's result was for synchronous deterministic systems, we\ndemonstrate that the same bound also holds for asynchronous randomized systems.\nWe show that the bound is tight by presenting a randomized algorithm, and a\nmatching lower bound.",

            "summary": "Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs that are executed across a\nblockchain. Unlike traditional programs, once deployed, they cannot be\nmodified. As smart contracts carry more value, they become more of an exciting\ntarget for attackers. Over the last years, they suffered from exploits costing\nmillions of dollars due to simple programming mistakes. As a result, a variety\nof tools for detecting bugs have been proposed. Most of these tools rely on\nsymbolic execution, which may yield false positives due to over-approximation.\nRecently, many fuzzers have been proposed to detect bugs in smart contracts.\nHowever, these tend to be more effective in finding shallow bugs and less\neffective in finding bugs that lie deep in the execution, therefore achieving\nlow code coverage and many false negatives. An alternative that has proven to\nachieve good results in traditional programs is hybrid fuzzing, a combination\nof symbolic execution and fuzzing. In this work, we study hybrid fuzzing on\nsmart contracts and present ConFuzzius, the first hybrid fuzzer for smart\ncontracts. ConFuzzius uses evolutionary fuzzing to exercise shallow parts of a\nsmart contract and constraint solving to generate inputs that satisfy complex\nconditions that prevent evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper parts.\nMoreover, ConFuzzius leverages dynamic data dependency analysis to efficiently\ngenerate sequences of transactions that are more likely to result in contract\nstates in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of ConFuzzius\nby comparing it with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers for\nsmart contracts. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 128 contracts and 21K\nreal-world contracts shows that our hybrid approach detects more bugs (up to\n23%) while outperforming state-of-the-art in terms of code coverage (up to\n69%), and that data dependency analysis boosts bug detection up to 18%.",

A trivial\nincrease in validation time~($\\tau$) introduces the popularly known Verifier's\nDilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and increases unfairness.\nLarge $\\tau$ also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine\nadversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes\n(a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust issues that are non-trivial to\nresolve.\n  In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to\ntheoretically scale $\\tau/\\mathbb{I} \\approx 1$ in PoW blockchains. The key\ninnovation in Tuxedo is to separate the consensus on the ordering of\ntransactions from their execution. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay\nvalidation of transactions in a block by up to $\\zeta$ blocks, where $\\zeta$ is\na system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all\npossible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with end-to-end delay\n$\\Delta$ and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known\nresults for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus.

            "summary": "Blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology, becomes more and more popular\nin both industry and academia. Each peer in blockchain system maintains a copy\nof ledger and makes sure of data consistency through consensus protocol.\nBlockchain system can provide many benefits such as immutability, transparency\nand security. Hyperledger Fabric is permissioned blockchain platform hosted by\nLinux foundation. Fabric has various components such as peer, ordering service,\nchaincode and state database. The structure of Fabric network is very\ncomplicated to provide reliable permissioned blockchain service. Generally,\ndevelopers must deal with hundreds of parameters to configure a network. That\nwill cause many reasonableness problems in configurations. In this paper, we\nfocus on how to detect reasonableness problems in Fabric configurations.\nFirstly, we discuss and provide a reasonableness problem knowledge database\nbased on the perspectives of functionality, security and performance. Secondly,\nwe implemented a detect tool for reasonableness check to Fabric. Finally, we\ncollect 108 sample networks as the testing dataset in the experiment. The\nresult shows our tool can help developers to locate reasonableness problems and\nunderstand their network better.",

This paper proposes a blockchain-enabled framework for P2P energy\ntrading among producer and consumer agents in a smart grid. A fully\ndecentralized market settlement mechanism is designed, which does not rely on a\ncentralized entity to settle the market and encourages producers and consumers\nto negotiate on energy trading with their nearby agents truthfully. To this\nend, the electrical distance of agents is considered in the pricing mechanism\nto encourage agents to trade with their neighboring agents. In addition, a\nreputation factor is considered for each agent, reflecting its past performance\nin delivering the committed energy. Before starting the negotiation, agents\nselect their trading partners based on their preferences over the reputation\nand proximity of the trading partners. An Anonymous Proof of Location (A-PoL)\nalgorithm is proposed that allows agents to prove their location without\nrevealing their real identity. The practicality of the proposed framework is\nillustrated through several case studies, and its security and privacy are\nanalyzed in detail.",

However, due to the nature of contact\ntracing, public concern on privacy issues has been a bottleneck to the existing\nsolutions, which is significantly affecting the uptake of contact tracing\napplications across the globe. In this paper, we present a blockchain-enabled\nprivacy-preserving contact tracing scheme: BeepTrace, where we propose to adopt\nblockchain bridging the user/patient and the authorized solvers to desensitize\nthe user ID and location information. Compared with recently proposed contract\ntracing solutions, our approach shows higher security and privacy with the\nadditional advantages of being battery friendly and globally accessible.\nResults show viability in terms of the required resource at both server and\nmobile phone perspectives. Through breaking the privacy concerns of the public,\nthe proposed BeepTrace solution can provide a timely framework for authorities,\ncompanies, software developers and researchers to fast develop and deploy\neffective digital contact tracing applications, to conquer COVID-19 pandemic\nsoon.

However,\nconditional payments in such networks is susceptible to Griefing Attack. In\nthis attack, an adversary doesn't resolve the payment with the intention of\nblocking channel capacity of the network. We propose an efficient\ncountermeasure for the attack, known as Griefing-Penalty. If any party in the\nnetwork mounts a griefing attack, it needs to pay a penalty proportional to the\ncollateral cost of executing a payment. The penalty is used for compensating\naffected parties in the network. We propose a new payment protocol HTLC-GP or\nHashed Timelock Contract with Griefing-Penalty to demonstrate the utility of\nthe countermeasure. Upon comparing our protocol with existing payment protocol\nHashed Timelock Contract, we observe that the average revenue earned by the\nattacker decreases substantially for HTLC-GP as compared to HTLC. We also study\nthe impact of path length for routing a transaction and rate of\ngriefing-penalty on the budget invested by an adversary for mounting the\nattack. The budget needed for mounting griefing attack in HTLC-GP is 12 times\nmore than the budget needed by attacker in HTLC, given that each payment\ninstance being routed via path length of hop count 20.",

In this work, we first identify the limitations\ncharacterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to\nuse DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among\ndifferent DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is\nlimited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a\nHealth Passport as a means of verifying that individuals are disease risk-free\nand how it could be used to resume the international tourism sector. Following,\nwe present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain and Proof of\nAuthority for issuing Digital Health Passports. The framework provides a\ndistributed infrastructure supporting the issuance of DHPs by foreign health\nsystems and their verification by relevant stakeholders, such as airline\ncompanies and border control authorities. We discuss the attributes of the\nsystem in terms of its usability and performance, security and privacy.\nFinally, we conclude by identifying future extensions of our work on formal\nsecurity and privacy properties that need to be rigorously guaranteed via\nappropriate security protocols.",

These applications need\nto tackle several fundamental trust issues: 1. Checking and confirming that the\nperson they are interacting with is a real person; 2. Validating that the\nhealthcare professional has competence within the field in question; and 3.\nConfirming that the healthcare professional has a valid license to practice. In\nthis paper, we present VerifyMed -- the first proof-of-concept platform, built\non Ethereum, for transparently validating the authorization and competence of\nmedical professionals using blockchain technology. Our platform models trust\nrelationships within the healthcare industry to validate professional clinical\nauthorization. Furthermore, it enables a healthcare professional to build a\nportfolio of real-life work experience and further validates the competence by\nstoring outcome metrics reported by the patients. The extensive realistic\nsimulations show that with our platform, an average cost for creating a smart\ncontract for a treatment and getting it approved is around 1 USD, and the cost\nfor evaluating a treatment is around 50 cents.",

            "summary": "Consensus is arguably one of the most important notions in distributed\ncomputing. Among asynchronous, randomized, and signature-free implementations,\nthe protocols of Most\\'efaoui et al. (PODC 2014 and JACM 2015) represent a\nlandmark result, which has been extended later and taken up in practical\nsystems. The protocols achieve optimal resilience and takes, in expectation,\nonly a constant expected number of rounds of quadratic message complexity.\nRandomization is provided through a common-coin primitive. In traditional\nconsensus protocols, all involved processes adhere to a global, symmetric\nfailure model, typically only defined by bounds on the number of faulty\nprocesses. Motivated by applications to blockchains, however, more flexible\ntrust assumptions have recently been considered. In particular, with asymmetric\ntrust, a process is free to choose which other processes it trusts and which\nones might collude against it. This paper revisits the optimal asynchronous\nprotocol of Most\\'efaoui et al. and shows how to realize it with asymmetric\ntrust. The paper starts by pointing out in detail why some versions of this\nprotocol may violate liveness. Then it proposes a fix for the protocol that\ndoes not affect its properties, but lets it regain the simplicity of its\noriginal version (PODC 2014). At the same time, the paper shows how to realize\nrandomized signature-free asynchronous Byzantine consensus with asymmetric\nquorums. This results in an optimal consensus protocol with subjective,\nasymmetric trust and constant expected running time. It is suitable for\napplications to blockchains, for instance.",

To achieve this goal we will exploit\nproperties of Boolean Groebner bases.

            "summary": "As one of the representative blockchain platforms, Ethereum has attracted\nlots of attacks. Due to the existed financial loss, there is a pressing need to\nperform timely investigation and detect more attack instances. Though multiple\nsystems have been proposed, they suffer from the scalability issue due to the\nfollowing reasons. First, the tight coupling between malicious contract\ndetection and blockchain data importing makes them infeasible to repeatedly\ndetect different attacks. Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes them\ninefficient to replay transactions. Third, the separation between malicious\ncontract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage.\n  In this paper, we present the design of a scalable attack detection framework\non Ethereum. It overcomes the scalability issue by saving the Ethereum state\ninto a database and providing an efficient way to locate suspicious\ntransactions. The saved state is fine-grained to support the replay of\narbitrary transactions. The state is well-designed to avoid saving unnecessary\nstate to optimize the storage consumption. We implement a prototype named\nEthScope and solve three technical challenges, i.e., incomplete Ethereum state,\nscalability, and extensibility. The performance evaluation shows that our\nsystem can solve the scalability issue, i.e., efficiently performing a\nlarge-scale analysis on billions of transactions, and a speedup of around\n2,300x when replaying transactions. It also has lower storage consumption\ncompared with existing systems. The result with three different types of\ninformation as inputs shows that our system can help an analyst understand\nattack behaviors and further detect more attacks. To engage the community, we\nwill release our system and the dataset of detected attacks.",

The book examines\nuniversally applicable patterns in administrative decisions and judicial\nrulings. First, similarities and divergence in behavior among the different\ncases are identified by analyzing parameters ranging from geographical location\nand administrative decisions to judicial reasoning and legal basis. As it turns\nout, in several of the cases presented, sources of general law, such as\ncompetition or labor law, are invoked as a legal basis, due to the lack of\ncurrent specialized legislation. This book also investigates the role and\nsignificance of national and indeed supranational regulatory bodies for\nadvanced algorithms and considers ENISA, an EU agency that focuses on network\nand information security, as an interesting candidate for a European regulator\nof advanced algorithms.

            "summary": "The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy\na contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for\ndevelopers. On the one hand, using selfdestruct function enables developers to\nremove smart contracts (SC) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency\nsituations happen, e.g. being attacked. On the other hand, this function can\nincrease the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for\nattackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or\nexclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online\nsurvey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their\nfeedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to\nthe Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information,\nwe propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called\npredecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by\ncomputing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the\npredecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that\nled to the death of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and\nLimits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a\ntool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false\npositives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits\nof Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89% of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in\naverage. According to the feedback of developers who exclude selfdestruct\nfunctions, we propose suggestions to help developers use selfdestruct functions\nin Ethereum smart contracts better.",

Although Distributed Ledger\nTechnologies (DLTs) could provide such a platform, blockchains, such as\nBitcoin, were not designed with IoT networks in mind, hence are often\nunsuitable for such applications: they offer poor transaction throughput and\nconfirmation times, put stress on constrained computing and storage resources,\nand require high transaction fees. In this work, we consider a class of\nIoT-friendly DLTs based on directed acyclic graphs, rather than a blockchain,\nand with a reputation system in the place of Proof of Work (PoW). However,\nwithout PoW, implementation of these DLTs requires an access control algorithm\nto manage the rate at which nodes can add new transactions to the ledger. We\nmodel the access control problem and present an algorithm that is fair,\nefficient and secure. Our algorithm represents a new design paradigm for DLTs\nin which concepts from networking are applied to the DLT setting for the first\ntime. For example, our algorithm uses distributed rate setting which is similar\nin nature to transmission control used in the Internet. However, our solution\nfeatures novel adaptations to cope with the adversarial environment of DLTs in\nwhich no individual agent can be trusted. Our algorithm guarantees utilisation\nof resources, consistency, fairness, and resilience against attackers. All of\nthis is achieved efficiently and with regard for the limitations of IoT\ndevices.

This paper proposes a cooperative protocol,\nnamely DEAN, across edge nodes to prevent data manipulation, and to allow fair\ndata sharing with quick recovery under resource constraints of limited storage,\ncomputing, and network capacity. Specifically, DEAN leverages a parallel\nmechanism equipped with three independent core components, effectively\nachieving low resource consumption while allowing secured parallel block\nprocessing on edge nodes. We have implemented a system prototype based on DEAN\nand experimentally verified its effectiveness with a comparison with three\npopular blockchain implementations: Ethereum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric.\nExperimental results show that the system prototype exhibits high resilience to\narbitrary failures: the percentile of trusty nodes is much higher than the\nrequired 50\\% in most cases. Performance-wise, DEAN-based blockchain\nimplementation outperforms the state-of-the-art blockchain systems with up to\n$25\\times$ higher throughput and $18\\times$ lower latency on 1,000 nodes.",

We demonstrate how distributed-ledger technologies\nbuild investor trust and disrupt the auditing industry. Our multi-functional\ndesign indicates that auditing firms can automate transaction verification\nwithout the need for a trusted third party by collaborating and sharing their\ninformation while preserving data privacy (commitment scheme) and security\n(immutability). We also explore how smart contracts and wallets facilitate the\ncomputerization and implementation of our system on Ethereum.

They form a\nlarge distributed network together, which can facilitate the integration of\ndistributed energy station (DES) and corresponding smart aggregators.\nNevertheless, because of potential security and privacy protection arisen from\ntrustless energies trading, how to make such energies trading goes smoothly is\na tricky challenge. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based multiple\nenergies trading (B-MET) system for secure and efficient energies trading by\nexecuting a smart contract we design. Because energies trading requires the\nblockchain in B-MET system to have high throughput and low latency, we design a\nnew byzantine-based consensus mechanism (BCM) based on node's credit to improve\nefficiency for the consortium blockchain under the B-MET system. Then, we take\ncombined heat and power (CHP) system as a typical example that provides\ndistributed energies. We quantify their utilities, and model the interactions\nbetween aggregators and DESs in a smart city by a novel multi-leader\nmulti-follower Stackelberg game. It is analyzed and solved by reaching Nash\nequilibrium between aggregators, which reflects the competition between\naggregators to purchase energies from DESs. In the end, we conduct plenty of\nnumerical simulations to evaluate and verify our proposed model and algorithms,\nwhich demonstrate their correctness and efficiency completely.",

We show that, under reasonable assumptions,\nour approach does not require tradeoffs on security or decentralization. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first result that disprove the trilemma\nconsidering the scalability of all architectural elements of a blockchain and\nnot only the consensus protocol.

            "summary": "Ethereum has emerged as the most popular smart contract development platform,\nwith hundreds of thousands of contracts stored on the blockchain and covering a\nvariety of application scenarios, such as auctions, trading platforms, and so\non. Given their financial nature, security vulnerabilities may lead to\ncatastrophic consequences and, even worse, they can be hardly fixed as data\nstored on the blockchain, including the smart contract code itself, are\nimmutable. An automated security analysis of these contracts is thus of utmost\ninterest, but at the same time technically challenging for a variety of\nreasons, such as the specific transaction-oriented programming mechanisms,\nwhich feature a subtle semantics, and the fact that the blockchain data which\nthe contract under analysis interacts with, including the code of callers and\ncallees, are not statically known.\n  In this work, we present eThor, the first sound and automated static analyzer\nfor EVM bytecode, which is based on an abstraction of the EVM bytecode\nsemantics based on Horn clauses. In particular, our static analysis supports\nreachability properties, which we show to be sufficient for capturing\ninteresting security properties for smart contracts (e.g., single-entrancy) as\nwell as contract-specific functional properties. Our analysis is proven sound\nagainst a complete semantics of EVM bytecode and an experimental large-scale\nevaluation on real-world contracts demonstrates that eThor is practical and\noutperforms the state-of-the-art static analyzers: specifically, eThor is the\nonly one to provide soundness guarantees, terminates on 95% of a representative\nset of real-world contracts, and achieves an F-measure (which combines\nsensitivity and specificity) of 89%.",

In FL, the central aggregator\naccumulates local updates uploaded by participants to update a global model.\nHowever, there are two critical security threats: poisoning and membership\ninference attacks. These attacks may be carried out by malicious or unreliable\nparticipants, resulting in the construction failure of global models or privacy\nleakage of FL models. Therefore, it is crucial for FL to develop security means\nof defense. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based secure FL framework\nto create smart contracts and prevent malicious or unreliable participants from\ninvolving in FL. In doing so, the central aggregator recognizes malicious and\nunreliable participants by automatically executing smart contracts to defend\nagainst poisoning attacks. Further, we use local differential privacy\ntechniques to prevent membership inference attacks. Numerical results suggest\nthat the proposed framework can effectively deter poisoning and membership\ninference attacks, thereby improving the security of FL in 5G networks.",

Prior auditing designs in centralized settings\nare not directly applicable here. A handful of proposals targeting DSN cannot\nsatisfactorily address these issues either.\n  We present an auditing solution that addresses on-chain privacy and\nefficiency, from a synergy of homomorphic linear authenticators with polynomial\ncommitments for succinct proofs, and the sigma protocol for provable privacy.\nThe solution results in, per audit, 288-byte proof written to the blockchain,\nand constant verification cost.

            "summary": "Blockchain systems often employ proof-of-work consensus protocols to validate\nand add transactions into hashchains. These protocols stimulate competition\namong miners in solving cryptopuzzles (e.g. SHA-256 hash computation in\nBitcoin) in exchange for a monetary reward. Here, we model mining as an all-pay\nauction, where miners' computational efforts are interpreted as bids, and the\nallocation function is the probability of solving the cryptopuzzle in a single\nattempt with unit (normalized) computational capability. Such an allocation\nfunction captures how blockchain systems control the difficulty of the\ncryptopuzzle as a function of miners' computational abilities (bids). In an\nattempt to reduce mining costs, we investigate designing a mining auction\nmechanism which induces a logit equilibrium amongst the miners with choice\ndistributions that are unilaterally decreasing with costs at each miner. We\nshow it is impossible to design a lenient allocation function that does this.\nSpecifically, we show that there exists no allocation function that discourages\nminers to bid higher costs at logit equilibrium, if the rate of change of\ndifficulty with respect to each miner's cost is bounded by the inverse of the\nsum of costs at all the miners.",

During complex system development, MBSE models need to be frequently\nexchanged across stakeholders. Concerns about data security and tampering using\ntraditional data exchange approaches obstruct the construction of a reliable\nmarketplace for digital assets. The emerging Distributed Ledger Technology\n(DLT), represented by blockchain, provides a novel solution for this purpose\nowing to its unique advantages such as tamper-resistant and decentralization.\nIn this paper, we integrate MBSE approaches with DLT aiming to create a\ndecentralized marketplace to facilitate the exchange of digital engineering\nassets (DEAs). We first define DEAs from perspectives of digital engineering\nobjects, development processes and system architectures. Based on this\ndefinition, the Graph-Object-Property-Point-Role-Relationship (GOPPRR) approach\nis used to formalize the DEAs. Then we propose a framework of a decentralized\nDEAs marketplace and specify the requirements, based on which we select a\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) structured DLT solution. As a proof-of-concept, a\nprototype of the proposed DEAs marketplace is developed and a case study is\nconducted to verify its feasibility. The experiment results demonstrate that\nthe proposed marketplace facilitates free DEAs exchange with a high level of\nsecurity, efficiency and decentralization.",

We formalize the problem of implementing such\ncommitments with a probabilistic delay and without the aforementioned\nassumptions as Multi-Party Timed Commitments (MPTC) and present a solution --\nthe Time-Capsule protocol. Like previous approaches, Time Capsule forms a\npuzzle whose solution reveals the committed values. But unlike previous\nsolutions, no party has an advantage in solving the puzzle, and individual\ncommitments cannot be revealed before the entire set is committed. A particular\napplication of MPTC realizes an advancement in the study of decentralized\nsystems. The state of the art in decentralized systems is manifested in\nblockchain systems that utilize Proof of Work to achieve censorship resistance.\nHowever, they are still vulnerable to frontrunning, an issue that is plaguing\noperational systems. By adapting Time Capsule, we allow it to be used for Proof\nof Work, preventing frontrunning by system operators and tuning the puzzle\ndifficulty using the blockchain mechanism.",

In this paper, we introduce BlockRoam, a novel\nblockchain-based roaming management system that provides an efficient data\nexchange platform among MSPs and mobile subscribers. Utilizing the\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and smart contracts, BlockRoam can\nsignificantly shorten the information exchanging delay, thereby addressing the\nroaming fraud problems. Through intensive analysis, we show that the security\nand performance of such PoS-based blockchain network can be further enhanced by\nincentivizing more users (e.g., subscribers) to participate in the network.\nMoreover, users in such networks often join stake pools (e.g., formed by MSPs)\nto increase their profits. Therefore, we develop an economic model based on\nStackelberg game to jointly maximize the profits of the network users and the\nstake pool, thereby encouraging user participation. We also propose an\neffective method to guarantee the uniqueness of this game's equilibrium. The\nperformance evaluations show that the proposed economic model helps the MSPs to\nearn additional profits, attracts more investment to the blockchain network,\nand enhances the network's security and performance.",

            "summary": "To implement a blockchain, we need a blockchain protocol for all the nodes to\nfollow. To design a blockchain protocol, we need a block publisher selection\nmechanism and a chain selection rule. In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based blockchain\nprotocols, block publisher selection mechanism selects the node to publish the\nnext block based on the relative stake held by the node. However, PoS\nprotocols, such as Ouroboros v1, may face vulnerability to fully adaptive\ncorruptions.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel PoS-based blockchain protocol, QuickSync,\nto achieve security against fully adaptive corruptions while improving on\nperformance. We propose a metric called block power, a value defined for each\nblock, derived from the output of the verifiable random function based on the\ndigital signature of the block publisher. With this metric, we compute chain\npower, the sum of block powers of all the blocks comprising the chain, for all\nthe valid chains. These metrics are a function of the block publisher's stake\nto enable the PoS aspect of the protocol. The chain selection rule selects the\nchain with the highest chain power as the one to extend. This chain selection\nrule hence determines the selected block publisher of the previous block. When\nwe use metrics to define the chain selection rule, it may lead to\nvulnerabilities against Sybil attacks. QuickSync uses a Sybil attack resistant\nfunction implemented using histogram matching. We prove that QuickSync\nsatisfies common prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties and hence\nit is secure. We also show that it is resilient to different types of\nadversarial attack strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that QuickSync\nperforms better than Bitcoin by an order of magnitude on both transactions per\nsecond and time to finality, and better than Ouroboros v1 by a factor of three\non time to finality.",

            "summary": "Game theory is often used as a tool to analyze decentralized systems and\ntheir properties, in particular, blockchains. In this note, we take the\nopposite view. We argue that blockchains can and should be used to implement\neconomic mechanisms because they can help to overcome problems that occur if\ntrust in the mechanism designer cannot be assumed. Mechanism design deals with\nthe allocation of resources to agents, often by extracting private information\nfrom them. Some mechanisms are immune to early information disclosure, while\nothers may heavily depend on it. Some mechanisms have to randomize to achieve\nfairness and efficiency. Both issues, information disclosure, and randomness\nrequire trust in the mechanism designer. If there is no trust, mechanisms can\nbe manipulated. We claim that mechanisms that use randomness or sequential\ninformation disclosure are much harder, if not impossible, to audit. Therefore,\ncentralized implementation is often not a good solution. We consider some of\nthe most frequently used mechanisms in practice and identify circumstances\nunder which manipulation is possible. We propose a decentralized implementation\nof such mechanisms, that can be, in practical terms, realized by blockchain\ntechnology. Moreover, we argue in which environments a decentralized\nimplementation of a mechanism brings a significant advantage.",

Nevertheless,\nwhether an equilibrium exists for three or more pools of distinct sizes remains\nan open problem. To this end, this paper studies the equilibrium in a\nblockchain of arbitrary pools.

Second, if the pools\nare of different size, we show that (i) if the blockchain's pools exhibit two\ndistinct sizes, an equilibrium can be reached, and (ii) if the blockchain has\nat least three distinct pool sizes, there does not exist an equilibrium.",

The novelty of LiTiChain lies in ensuring the connectivity of the\nchain even after the expired blocks are deleted from the chain. To provide the\nsame level of security as conventional blockchain, in LiTiChain, some blocks\nare stored longer than their lifetime, which incurs additional storage cost.\nThis paper presents two new blockchain architectures i.e. p-LiTiChain and\ns-LiTiChain that are variants of LiTiChain. The proposed architectures offer a\ndegree of freedom in the design of blockchain of finite-lifetime blocks in\nterms of a tradeoff between storage cost, security and computational cost.

In this\ntechnical report, we outline a novel architecture for the blockchain ledger and\nconsensus, which uses a tree of context chains with simultaneous validity. A\ncontext chain captures the transactions of a closed group of entities and\npersons, thus structuring blocks in a precisely defined way. The resulting\ncontext isolation enables consensus-steered deletion of an entire context\nwithout side effects to other contextes.

            "summary": "Neutral Host Small Cell Providers (SCP) represent a key element of the 5G\nvision of ultra-dense mobile networks. However, current business models mostly\nfocus on multi-year agreements for large venues, such as stadiums and hotel\nchains. These business agreements are regulated through binding Service Level\nAgreements (SLAs), which tend to be too cumbersome and costly for smaller scale\nSCPs. As a result, the neutral host model does not scale up to its full\npotential. In this paper, we propose a framework to enable the participation of\nsmall- to medium-sized players in the cellular market as providers offering\nnetwork resources to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). To this purpose, we\nreview the current and emerging spectrum and technology opportunities that SCPs\ncan use for neutral host deployments. We also propose the use of\nblockchain-enabled smart contracts as a simple and cost-efficient alternative\nto traditional SLAs for small-scale SCPs. To demonstrate this, we describe a\nproof of concept implementation of an Ethereum-based smart contract platform\nfor best-effort service between an SCP and an MNO. Our simulations on potential\nsmart contract-based deployments in city centre Dublin show that the received\nsignal strength in the considered area will increase by an average of $10$\npercent.",

The collected data is\ncrucial in certain applications where IoT devices generate data for critical\ninfrastructure or systems whose failure may result in catastrophic results.\nSpecifically, for such critical applications, data storage poses challenges\nsince the data may be compromised during the storage and the integrity might be\nviolated without being noticed. In such cases, integrity and data provenance\nare required in order to be able to detect the source of any incident and prove\nit in legal cases if there is a dispute with the involved parties. To address\nthese issues, blockchain provides excellent opportunities since it can protect\nthe integrity of the data thanks to its distributed structure. However, it\ncomes with certain costs as storing huge amount of data in a public blockchain\nwill come with significant transaction fees. In this paper, we propose a highly\ncost effective and reliable digital forensics framework by exploiting multiple\ninexpensive blockchain networks as a temporary storage before the data is\ncommitted to Ethereum. To reduce Ethereum costs,we utilize Merkle trees which\nhierarchically stores hashes of the collected event data from IoT devices. We\nevaluated the approach on popular blockchains such as EOS, Stellar, and\nEthereum by presenting a cost and security analysis. The results indicate that\nwe can achieve significant cost savings without compromising the integrity of\nthe data.",

            "summary": "The popularization of blockchains leads to a resurgence of interest in\nByzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) state machine replication protocols. However,\nmuch of the work on this topic focuses on the underlying consensus protocols,\nwith emphasis on their lack of scalability, leaving other subtle limitations\nunaddressed. These limitations are related to the effects of maintaining a\ndurable blockchain instead of a write-ahead log and the requirement for\nreconfiguring the set of replicas in a decentralized way. We demonstrate these\nlimitations using a digital coin blockchain application and BFT-SMaRt, a\npopular BFT replication library. We show how they can be addressed both at a\nconceptual level, in a protocol-agnostic way, and by implementing SMaRtChain, a\nblockchain platform based on BFT-SMaRt. SMaRtChain improves the performance of\nour digital coin application by a factor of eight when compared with a naive\nimplementation on top of BFT-SMaRt. Moreover, SMaRtChain achieves a throughput\n$8\\times$ and $33\\times$ better than Tendermint and Hyperledger Fabric,\nrespectively, when ensuring strong durability on its blockchain.",

            "summary": "Although almost all information about Smart Contract addresses is shared via\nwebsites, emails, or other forms of digital communication, Blockchains and\ndistributed ledger technology are unable to establish secure bindings between\nwebsites and corresponding Smart Contracts. For a user, it is impossible to\ndifferentiate whether a website links to a legitimate Smart Contract set up by\nowners of a business or to an illicit contract aiming to steal users' funds.\nSurprisingly, current attempts to solve this issue mostly comprise of\ninformation redundancy, e.g., displaying contract addresses multiple times in\nvarying forms of images and texts. These processes are burdensome, as the user\nis responsible for verifying the correctness of an address. More importantly,\nthey do not address the core issue, as the contract itself does not contain\ninformation about its authenticity. To solve current issues for these\napplications and increase security, we propose a solution that facilitates\npublicly issued SSL/TLS-certificates of Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) to\nensure the authenticity of Smart Contracts and their owners. Our approach\ncombines on-chain identity assertion utilizing signatures from the respective\ncertificate and off-chain authentication of the Smart Contract stored on the\nBlockchain. This approach allows to tackle the aforementioned issue and further\nenables applications such as the identification of consortia members in\npermissioned networks. The system is open and transparent, as the only\nrequirement for usage is ownership of an SSL/TLS-certificate. To enable\nprivacy-preserving authenticated Smart Contracts, we allow one-way and two-way\nbinding between website and contract. Further, low creation and maintenance\ncosts, a widely accepted public key infrastructure and user empowerment will\ndrive potential adaption of Ethereum Authenticated Smart Contracts (AuthSC).",

            "summary": "Both in the design and deployment of blockchain solutions many\nperformance-impacting configuration choices need to be made. We introduce\nBlockSim, a framework and software tool to build and simulate discrete-event\ndynamic systems models for blockchain systems. BlockSim is designed to support\nthe analysis of a large variety of blockchains and blockchain deployments as\nwell as a wide set of analysis questions. At the core of BlockSim is a Base\nModel, which contains the main model constructs common across various\nblockchain systems organized in three abstraction layers (network, consensus\nand incentives layer). The Base Model is usable for a wide variety of\nblockchain systems and can be extended easily to include system or deployment\nparticulars. The BlockSim software tool provides a simulator that implements\nthe Base Model in Python. This paper describes the Base Model, the simulator\nimplementation, and the application of BlockSim to Bitcoin, Ethereum and other\nconsensus algorithms. We validate BlockSim simulation results by comparison\nwith performance results from actual systems and from other studies in the\nliterature. We close the paper by a BlockSim simulation study of the impact of\nuncle blocks rewards on mining decentralization, for a variety of blockchain\nconfigurations.",

            "summary": "In recent years several distributed ledger technologies based on directed\nacyclic graphs (DAGs) have appeared on the market. Similar to blockchain\ntechnologies, DAG-based systems aim to build an immutable ledger and are faced\nwith security concerns regarding the irreversibility of the ledger state.\nHowever, due to their more complex nature and recent popularity, the study of\nadversarial actions has received little attention so far. In this paper we are\nconcerned with a particular type of attack on the IOTA cryptocurrency, more\nspecifically a Parasite Chain attack that attempts to revert the history stored\nin the DAG structure, also called the Tangle.\n  In order to improve the security of the Tangle, we present a detection\nmechanism for this type of attack. In this mechanism, we embrace the complexity\nof the DAG structure by sampling certain aspects of it, more particularly the\ndistribution of the number of approvers. We initially describe models that\npredict the distribution that should be expected for a Tangle without any\nmalicious actors. We then introduce metrics that compare this reference\ndistribution with the measured distribution. Upon detection, measures can then\nbe taken to render the attack unsuccessful. We show that due to a form of the\nParasite Chain that is different from the main Tangle it is possible to detect\ncertain types of malicious chains. We also show that although the attacker may\nchange the structure of the Parasite Chain to avoid detection, this is done so\nat a significant cost since the attack is rendered less efficient.",

            "summary": "The property of proportional representation in approval-based committee\nelections has appeared in the social choice literature for over a century, and\nis typically understood as avoiding the underrepresentation of minorities.\nHowever, we argue that the security of some distributed systems is directly\nlinked to the opposite goal of avoiding the overrepresentation of any minority,\na goal not previously formalized that leads us to an optimization objective\nknown as maximin support. After providing a thorough analysis of the\ncomputational complexity of this objective, we propose a new efficient election\nrule that simultaneously achieves a) a constant-factor approximation guarantee\nfor it, and b) the property of proportional justified representation (PJR) -\none of the strongest forms of proportional representation. However, the most\nstriking feature of the new rule is that one can verify in linear time that the\nwinning committee satisfies the two aforementioned guarantees, even when the\nalgorithm is executed by an untrusted party who only communicates the output.\nAs a result, the rule can be adapted into a verifiable computing scheme.\nMoreover, its verification procedure easily admits parallel processing for\nfurther efficiency.\n  Our work is motivated by an application on blockchain networks that implement\nNominated Proof-of-Stake, where the community elects a committee of validators\nto participate in the consensus protocol, and where preventing\noverrepresentation protects the network against attacks by an adversarial\nminority. Our election rule enables a validator selection protocol with formal\nguarantees on security and proportionality, and its adaptation as a verifiable\ncomputing scheme with a parallelized verification proves to be key for its\nsuccessful implementation given the computationally limited nature of the\nblockchain architecture.",

            "summary": "Transactions represent a fundamental component in blockchains as they are the\nprimary means for users to change the blockchain state. Current blockchain\nsystems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum require users to constantly observe the\nstate changes of interest or the events taking place in a blockchain and\nrequires the user to explicitly release the required transactions to respond to\nthe observed events in the blockchain. This paper proposes EventWarden, a\ndecentralized event-driven proxy service for users to outsource transactions in\nEthereum-like blockchains. EventWarden employs a novel combination of smart\ncontracts and blockchain logs. EventWarden allows a user to create a proxy\nsmart contract that specifies an interested event and also reserves an\narbitrary transaction to release. Upon observing the occurrence of the\nprescribed event, anyone in the Blockchain network can call the proxy contract\nto earn the service fee reserved in the contract by proving to the contract\nthat the event has been recorded into blockchain logs, which then automatically\ntriggers the proxy contract to release the reserved transaction. We show that\nthe reserved transaction can only get released from the proxy contract when the\nprescribed event has taken place. We also demonstrate that as long as a single\nmember in the Blockchain network is incentivized by the service fee to call the\nproxy contract after the prescribed event has taken place, the reserved\ntransaction is guaranteed to get released. We implement EventWarden over the\nEthereum official test network. The results demonstrate that EventWarden is\neffective and is ready-to-use in practice.",

We provide an extensive analysis\nof the Verifier's Dilemma, using a data-driven model-based approach that\ncombines closed-form expressions, machine learning techniques and\ndiscrete-event simulation. We collect data from over 300,000 smart contracts\nand experimentally obtain their CPU execution times. Gaussian Mixture Models\nand Random Forest Regression transform the data into distributions and inputs\nsuitable for the simulator. We show that, indeed, it is often economically\nrational not to verify.

The challenges in creating a\ntrustworthy 6G are multidisciplinary spanning technology, regulation,\ntechno-economics, politics and ethics. This white paper addresses their\nfundamental research challenges in three key areas. Trust: Under the current\n\"open internet\" regulation, the telco cloud can be used for trust services only\nequally for all users. 6G network must support embedded trust for increased\nlevel of information security in 6G. Trust modeling, trust policies and trust\nmechanisms need to be defined. 6G interlinks physical and digital worlds making\nsafety dependent on information security. Therefore, we need trustworthy 6G.\nSecurity: In 6G era, the dependence of the economy and societies on IT and the\nnetworks will deepen. The role of IT and the networks in national security\nkeeps rising - a continuation of what we see in 5G. The development towards\ncloud and edge native infrastructures is expected to continue in 6G networks,\nand we need holistic 6G network security architecture planning. Security\nautomation opens new questions: machine learning can be used to make safer\nsystems, but also more dangerous attacks. Physical layer security techniques\ncan also represent efficient solutions for securing less investigated network\nsegments as first line of defense. Privacy: There is currently no way to\nunambiguously determine when linked, deidentified datasets cross the threshold\nto become personally identifiable. Courts in different parts of the world are\nmaking decisions about whether privacy is being infringed, while companies are\nseeking new ways to exploit private data to create new business revenues. As\nsolution alternatives, we may consider blockchain, distributed ledger\ntechnologies and differential privacy approaches.",

It is thus important that\nsmart contracts are tested thoroughly before deployment. In this work, we\npresent an adaptive fuzzer for smart contracts on the Ethereum platform called\nsFuzz. Compared to existing Solidity fuzzers, sFuzz combines the strategy in\nthe AFL fuzzer and an efficient lightweight multi-objective adaptive strategy\ntargeting those hard-to-cover branches. sFuzz has been applied to more than 4\nthousand smart contracts and the experimental results show that (1) sFuzz is\nefficient, e.g., two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tools;\n(2) sFuzz is effective in achieving high code coverage and discovering\nvulnerabilities; and (3) the different fuzzing strategies in sFuzz complement\neach other.",

Our work\npresents the analysis of the dynamical properties of the ERC20 protocol\ncompliant crypto-coins' trading data using a network theory prism. We examine\nthe dynamics of ERC20 based networks over time by analyzing a meta-parameter of\nthe network, the power of its degree distribution.

Using a master equation,\nwe provide an equilibrium characterization of the total computational power\ndevoted to mining the blockchain (hashrate). From a simple setting we show how\nthe master equation approach allows us to enrich the model by relaxing most of\nthe simplifying assumptions. The essential structure of the game is preserved\nacross all the enrichments. In deterministic settings, the hashrate ultimately\nreaches a steady state in which it increases at the rate of technological\nprogress. In stochastic settings, there exists a target for the hashrate for\nevery possible random state. As a consequence, we show that in equilibrium the\nsecurity of the underlying blockchain is either $i)$ constant, or $ii)$\nincreases with the demand for the underlying cryptocurrency.",

Thus, these systems secure a\nhigh level of traceability in the supply chain. However, the distribution\ninformation, which can be private information, is made public since the\ninformation recorded in PBC can be read by anyone. In this paper, we propose a\nmethod for preserving privacy while securing traceability in a supply chain\nsystem using PBC. The proposed method preserves privacy by concealing the\ndistribution information via encryption. In addition, the proposed method\nensures distribution among legitimate supply chain parties while concealing\ntheir blockchain address by using a zero-knowledge proof to prove their\nauthenticity.

While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, and\nthe likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched,\nwe address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving\ncertification for test results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed a\nprototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that\nfacilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally\nidentifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app\nallows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with\nno other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for\nscalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called\n'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data\nplatform 'Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our\nmobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of\nverifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and\ndigital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive\ndigital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly\nin the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For\nthe test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and\nVerifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes only minutes to\nuse. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server architecture offer a\nprototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically,\nand in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key\nethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.",

The Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain system targets\nhigh-throughput transaction processing. Fabric uses a set of nodes tasked with\nthe ordering of transactions using consensus. Additional peers endorse and\nvalidate transactions, and maintain a copy of the ledger. The ability to\nquickly disseminate new transaction blocks from ordering nodes to all peers is\ncritical for both performance and consistency.

We show that the\ncurrent implementation of gossip in Fabric leads to heavy tail distributions of\nblock propagation latencies, impacting performance, consistency, and fairness.\nWe contribute a novel design for gossip in Fabric that simultaneously optimizes\npropagation time, tail latency and bandwidth consumption. Using a 100-node\ncluster, we show that our enhanced gossip allows the dissemination of blocks to\nall peers more than 10 times faster than with the original implementation,\nwhile decreasing the overall network bandwidth consumption by more than 40%.\nWith a high throughput and concurrent application, this results in 17% to 36%\nfewer invalidated transactions for different block sizes.",

Despite the benefits of its blockchain,\nBitcoin still faces serious scalability issues, most importantly its\never-increasing blockchain size. While alternative designs introduced schemes\nto periodically create snapshots and thereafter prune older blocks,\nalready-deployed systems such as Bitcoin are often considered incapable of\nadopting corresponding approaches. In this work, we revise this popular belief\nand present CoinPrune, a snapshot-based pruning scheme that is fully compatible\nwith Bitcoin. CoinPrune can be deployed through an opt-in velvet fork, i.e.,\nwithout impeding the established Bitcoin network. By requiring miners to\npublicly announce and jointly reaffirm recent snapshots on the blockchain,\nCoinPrune establishes trust into the snapshots' correctness even in the\npresence of powerful adversaries. Our evaluation shows that CoinPrune reduces\nthe storage requirements of Bitcoin already by two orders of magnitude today,\nwith further relative savings as the blockchain grows. In our experiments,\nnodes only have to fetch and process 5 GiB instead of 230 GiB of data when\njoining the network, reducing the synchronization time on powerful devices from\ncurrently 5 h to 46 min, with even more savings for less powerful devices.",

            "summary": "Blockchain is a relatively new technology that can be seen as a decentralised\ndatabase. Blockchain systems heavily rely on cryptographic hash functions to\nstore their data, which makes it difficult to tamper with any data stored in\nthe system. A topic that was researched along with blockchain is image\nauthentication. Image authentication focuses on investigating and maintaining\nthe integrity of images. As a blockchain system can be useful for maintaining\ndata integrity, image authentication has the potential to be enhanced by\nblockchain. There are many techniques that can be used to authenticate images;\nthe technique investigated by this work is image hashing. Image hashing is a\ntechnique used to calculate how similar two different images are. This is done\nby converting the images into hashes and then comparing them using a distance\nformula. To investigate the topic, an experiment involving a simulated\nblockchain was created. The blockchain acted as a database for images. This\nblockchain was made up of devices which contained their own unique image\nhashing algorithms. The blockchain was tested by creating modified copies of\nthe images contained in the database, and then submitting them to the\nblockchain to see if it will return the original image. Through this experiment\nit was discovered that it is plausible to create an image authentication system\nusing blockchain and image hashing. However, the design proposed by this work\nrequires refinement, as it appears to struggle in some situations. This work\nshows that blockchain can be a suitable approach for authenticating images,\nparticularly via image hashing. Other observations include that using multiple\nimage hash algorithms at the same time can increase performance in some cases,\nas well as that each type of test done to the blockchain has its own unique\npattern to its data.",

AnonBoot\nenforces that peers periodically create a small proof of work to refresh their\neligibility for providing secure anonymity services.

Blockchain technology provides primitives to\nrepresent these resources as digital assets on a secure distributed ledger. Due\nto the proliferation of blockchain-based assets, there is an increasing need\nfor a generic mechanism to trade assets between isolated platforms. To date,\nthere is no such mechanism without reliance on a trusted third party.\n  In this work, we address this shortcoming and present XChange. Unlike\nexisting approaches for decentralized asset trading, we decouple trade\nmanagement and the actual exchange of assets. XChange mediates trade of any\ndigital asset between isolated blockchain platforms while limiting the fraud\nconducted by adversarial parties. We first describe a generic, five-phase\ntrading protocol that establishes and executes trade between individuals. This\nprotocol accounts full trade specifications on a separate blockchain. We then\ndevise a lightweight system architecture, composed of all required components\nfor a generic asset marketplace.\n  We implement XChange and conduct real-world experimentation. We leverage an\nexisting, lightweight blockchain, TrustChain, to account all orders and full\ntrade specifications. By deploying XChange on multiple low-resource devices, we\nshow that a full trade completes within half a second. To quantify the\nscalability of our mechanism, we conduct further experiments on our compute\ncluster. We conclude that the throughput of XChange, in terms of trades per\nsecond, scales linearly with the system load. Furthermore, we find that XChange\nexhibits superior throughput and order fulfil latency compared to related\ndecentralized exchanges, BitShares and Waves.",

            "summary": "Blockchain Sharding is a blockchain performance enhancement approach. By\nsplitting a blockchain into several parallel-run committees (shards), it helps\nincrease transaction throughput, reduce computational resources required, and\nincrease reward expectation for participants. Recently, several flexible\nsharding methods that can tolerate up to $n/2$ Byzantine nodes ($n/2$ security\nlevel) have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from three main\ndrawbacks. First, in a non-sharding blockchain, nodes can have different weight\n(power or stake) to create a consensus, and as such an adversary needs to\ncontrol half of the overall weight in order to manipulate the system ($p/2$\nsecurity level). In blockchain sharding, all nodes carry the same weight. Thus,\nit is only under the assumption that honest participants create as many nodes\nas they should that a $n/2$ security level blockchain sharding reaches the\n$p/2$ security level. Second, when some nodes leave the system, other nodes\nneed to be reassigned, frequently, from shard to shard in order to maintain the\nsecurity level. This has an adverse effect on system performance. Third, while\nsome $n/2$ approaches can maintain data integrity with up to $n/2$ Byzantine\nnodes, their systems can halt with a smaller number of Byzantine nodes. In this\npaper, we present a $p/2$ security level blockchain sharding approach that does\nnot require honest participants to create multiple nodes, requires less node\nreassignment when some nodes leave the system, and can prevent the system from\nhalting. Our experiments show that our new approach outperforms existing\nblockchain sharding approaches in terms of security, transaction throughput and\nflexibility.",

Along with this, quite a few consensus algorithms that are one of\ncore technologies in blockchain have been proposed. Among them, we analyze a\nconsensus algorithm called LFT2, which is used by a blockchain system, ICON. We\nfirst formulate the LFT2 consensus algorithm and then analyze safety and\nliveness, which can be considered as the most important properties in\ndistributed consensus system. We prove that LFT2 satisfies safety and liveness,\nwhere a certain assumption is required to prove liveness. In addition, we\ncompare LFT2 with two similar consensus algorithms, and from the comparison, we\nshow that a trade-off exist among the three consensus algorithms. Finally, we\nsimulate LFT2 to measure a liveness quality.",

Then, the model\nupdates are stored in the blockchain in a decentralized and reliable manner.\nHowever, the issue of BFL is that the mobile devices have energy and CPU\nconstraints that may reduce the system lifetime and training efficiency. The\nother issue is that the training latency may increase due to the blockchain\nmining process. To address these issues, the MLMO needs to (i) decide how much\ndata and energy that the mobile devices use for the training and (ii) determine\nthe block generation rate to minimize the system latency, energy consumption,\nand incentive cost while achieving the target accuracy for the model. Under the\nuncertainty of the BFL environment, it is challenging for the MLMO to determine\nthe optimal decisions.

            "summary": "To improve transaction rates, many cryptocurrencies have implemented\nso-called ''Layer-2'' transaction protocols, where payments are routed across\nnetworks of private payment channels. However, for a given transaction, not\nevery network state provides a feasible route to perform the payment; in this\ncase, the transaction must be put on the public ledger. The payment channel\nnetwork thus multiplies the transaction rate of the overall system; the less\nfrequently it fails, the higher the multiplier.\n  We build on earlier work on credit networks and show that this network\nliquidity problem is connected to the combinatorics of graphical matroids.\nEarlier work could only analyze the (unnatural) scenario where transactions had\ndiscrete sizes.\n  Superficially, it might seem like the continuous case would be harder to\nexamine. However, removing this assumption lets us make progress in two\nimportant directions. First, we give a partial answer to the ``monotonicity\nconjecture'' that previous work left open. This conjecture asks that the\nnetwork's performance not degrade as capacity on any edge increases. And\nsecond, we construct here a network state sampling procedure with much faster\nasymptotic performance than off-the-shelf Markov chains ($O(\\vert E\\vert\n\\beta(\\vert E\\vert))$, where $\\beta(x)$ is the complexity of solving a linear\nprogram on $x$ constraints.)\n  We obtain our results by mapping the underlying graphs to convex bodies and\nthen showing that the liquidity and sampling problems reduce to bounding and\ncomputing the volumes of these bodies. The transformation relies crucially on\nthe combinatorial properties of the underlying graphic matroid, as do the\nproofs of monotonicity and fast sampling.",

            "summary": "The cross-blockchain transaction remains one of the most challenging problems\nin blockchains. The root cause of the challenge lies in the nondeterministic\nnature of blockchains: A $n$-party transaction across multiple blockchains\nmight be partially rolled back due to the potential forks in any of the\nparticipating blockchains---eventually, only one fork will survive in the\ncompetition among miners. While some effort has recently been made to\ndeveloping hierarchically distributed commit protocols to make multi-party\ntransactions progress, there is no systematic method to reason about the\ntransaction outcome. This paper tackles this problem from a perspective of\npoint-set topology. We construct multiple topological spaces for the\ntransactions and blockchain forks, and show that these spaces are internally\nrelated through either homeomorphism or continuous functions. Combined\ntogether, these tools allow us to reason about the cross-blockchain\ntransactions through the growing-fork topology, an intuitive representation of\nblockchains.",

For each version\nof the contract, we trace how the architectures of the underlying platforms and\ntheir mathematics affects the natural programming styles and natural classes of\nerrors.

            "summary": "Blockchain and other forms of distributed ledger technology (DLT) provide an\nopportunity to integrate digital information, management, and contracts to\nincrease trust and collaboration within the construction industry. DLT enables\ndirect peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by\nproviding an immutable and transparent record of these transactions.\nFurthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and\nautomation on the transaction level, through the use of smart contracts, which\nare code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in\nthe construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few\nimplementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a\nknowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system\nimplementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by 1) reviewing and\ncategorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, 2) providing an\noverview of DLT and its design options, 3) proposing an integrated framework to\nmatch DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and 4)\nanalysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case\ncategories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward\nmore connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of\nDLT and use cases in construction.",

            "summary": "While Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the most widely used consensus mechanism for\nblockchain, it received harsh criticism due to its massive waste of energy for\nmeaningless hash calculation. Some studies have introduced Proof-of-Stake to\naddress this issue. However, such protocols widen the gap between rich and poor\nand in the worst case lead to an oligopoly, where the rich control the entire\nnetwork. Other studies have attempted to translate the energy consumption of\nPoW into useful work, but they have many limitations, such as narrow\napplication scope, serious security issues and impractical incentive model. In\nthis paper, we introduce AxeChain, which can use the computing power of\nblockchain to solve practical problems raised by users without greatly\ncompromising decentralization or security. AxeChain achieves this by coupling\nhard problem solving with PoW mining. We model the security of AxeChain and\nderive a balance curve between power utilization and system security. That is,\nunder the reasonable assumption that the attack power does not exceed 1/3 of\nthe total power, 1/2 of total power can be safely used to solve practical\nproblems. We also design a novel incentive model based on the amount of work\ninvolved in problem solving, balancing the interests of both the users and\nminers. Moreover, our experimental results show that AxeChain provides strong\nsecurity guarantees, no matter what kind of problem is submitted.",

In particular, ownership, typestate, and assets, which Obsidian uses to\nprovide safety guarantees, have not seen broad adoption together in popular\nlanguages and result in significant usability challenges. We performed an\nempirical study with 20 participants comparing Obsidian to Solidity, which is\nthe language most commonly used for writing smart contracts today. We observed\nthat Obsidian participants were able to successfully complete more of the\nprogramming tasks than the Solidity participants. We also found that the\nSolidity participants commonly inserted asset-related bugs, which Obsidian\ndetects at compile time.",

Massive data generated from diverse blockchain\nsystems bring not only huge business values but also technological challenges\nin data analytics of heterogeneous blockchain data. Different from Bitcoin and\nEthereum, EOSIO has richer diversity and a higher volume of blockchain data due\nto its unique architectural design in resource management, consensus scheme and\nhigh throughput. Despite its popularity (e.g., 89,800,000 blocks generated till\nNovember 14, 2019 since its launch on June 8, 2018), few studies have been made\non data analysis of EOSIO. To fill this gap, we collect and process the\nup-to-date on-chain data from EOSIO. We name these well-processed EOSIO\ndatasets as XBlock-EOS, which consists of 7 well-processed datasets: 1) Block,\nTransaction and Action, 2) Internal and External EOS Transfer Action, 3)\nContract Information, 4) Contract Invocation, 5) Token Action, 6) Account\nCreation, 7) Resource Management. It is challenging to process and analyze a\nhigh volume of raw EOSIO data and establish the mapping from original raw data\nto the well-grained datasets since it requires substantial efforts in\nextracting various types of data as well as sophisticated knowledge on software\nengineering and data analytics.

However, the lightweight IIoT\ndevices cannot directly participate in the mining process due to the limitation\nof power and computational resources. The edge computing service makes it\npossible for IIoT applications to build a blockchain network, in which IIoT\ndevices purchase computational resources from edge servers and thus can offload\ntheir computational tasks. The amount of computational resource purchased by\nIIoT devices depends on how many profits they can get in the mining process,\nand will directly affect the security of the blockchain network. In this paper,\nwe investigate the incentive mechanism for the blockchain platform to attract\nIIoT devices to purchase more computational power from edge servers to\nparticipate in the mining process, thereby building a more secure blockchain\nnetwork. We model the interaction between the blockchain platform and IIoT\ndevices as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the blockchain platform act as\nthe leader, and IIoT devices act as followers. We analyze the existence and\nuniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium, and propose an efficient algorithm\nto compute the Stackelberg equilibrium point. Furthermore, we evaluate the\nperformance of our algorithm through extensive simulations, and analyze the\nstrategies of blockchain platform and IIoT devices under different situations.",

            "summary": "With the rapid popularity of blockchain, decentralized human intelligence\ntasks (HITs) are proposed to crowdsource human knowledge without relying on\nvulnerable third-party platforms. However, the inherent limits of blockchain\ncause decentralized HITs to face a few \"new\" challenges. For example, the\nconfidentiality of solicited data turns out to be the sine qua non, though it\nwas an arguably dispensable property in the centralized setting. To ensure the\n\"new\" requirement of data privacy, existing decentralized HITs use generic\nzero-knowledge proof frameworks (e.g. SNARK), but scarcely perform well in\npractice, due to the inherently expensive cost of generality.\n  We present a practical decentralized protocol for HITs, which also achieves\nthe fairness between requesters and workers. At the core of our contributions,\nwe avoid the powerful yet highly-costly generic zk-proof tools and propose a\nspecial-purpose scheme to prove the quality of encrypted data. By various\nnon-trivial statement reformations, proving the quality of encrypted data is\nreduced to efficient verifiable decryption, thus making decentralized HITs\npractical. Along the way, we rigorously define the ideal functionality of\ndecentralized HITs and then prove the security due to the ideal-real paradigm.\n  We further instantiate our protocol to implement a system called Dragoon, an\ninstance of which is deployed atop Ethereum to facilitate an image annotation\ntask used by ImageNet. Our evaluations demonstrate its practicality: the\non-chain handling cost of Dragoon is even less than the handling fee of\nAmazon's Mechanical Turk for the same ImageNet HIT.",

            "summary": "Smart contracts have enabled blockchain systems to evolve from simple\ncryptocurrency platforms, such as Bitcoin, to general transactional systems,\nsuch as Ethereum. Catering for emerging business requirements, a new\narchitecture called execute-order-validate has been proposed in Hyperledger\nFabric to support parallel transactions and improve the blockchain's\nthroughput. However, this new architecture might render many invalid\ntransactions when serializing them. This problem is further exaggerated as the\nblock formation rate is inherently limited due to other factors beside data\nprocessing, such as cryptography and consensus.\n  In this work, we propose a novel method to enhance the execute-order-validate\narchitecture, by reducing invalid transactions to improve the throughput of\nblockchains. Our method is inspired by state-of-the-art optimistic concurrency\ncontrol techniques in modern database systems. In contrast to existing\nblockchains that adopt database's preventive approaches which might abort\nserializable transactions, our method is theoretically more fine-grained.\nSpecifically, unserializable transactions are aborted before ordering and the\nremaining transactions are guaranteed to be serializable. For evaluation, we\nimplement our method in two blockchains respectively, FabricSharp on top of\nHyperledger Fabric, and FastFabricSharp on top of FastFabric. We compare the\nperformance of FabricSharp with vanilla Fabric and three related systems, two\nof which are respectively implemented with one standard and one\nstate-of-the-art concurrency control techniques from databases. The results\ndemonstrate that FabricSharp achieves 25% higher throughput compared to the\nother systems in nearly all experimental scenarios. Moreover, the\nFastFabricSharp's improvement over FastFabric is up to 66%.",

To keep the payment channel network\nsustainable, in this paper, we aim to increase the overall success rate of\npayments by effectively exploiting the fact that end-users are usually\nconnected to the network at multiple points (i.e., gateways) any of which can\nbe used to initiate the payment. We propose an efficient method for selection\nof the gateway for a user by considering the gateway's inbound and outbound\npayment traffic ratio. We then augment this proposed method with split payment\ncapability to further increase success rate especially for large transactions.\nThe evaluation of the proposed method shows that compared to greedy and\nmaxflow-based approaches, we can achieve much higher success rates, which are\nfurther improved with split payments.",

            "summary": "The combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system is a typical\ndistributed, electricity-gas integrated energy scheme in a community. First, it\ngenerates electricity by use of gas, and then exploits the waste heat to supply\ncommunity with heat and cooling. In this paper, we consider a smart city\nconsisting of a number of communities (CCHPs) and an agent of power grid (APG),\nwhere CCHPs can sell energy to the APG according to its bid. To study all\nutilities of entities in such a city from energy trading, a noncooperative\nStackelberg game between APG and CCHPs is formulated. Here, the APG gives a bid\nfor buying the energy from CCHPs, then CCHPs respond to the APG with their\noptimal energy supply that maximizing their utilities according to this bid. We\nshow that the maximum profit to the APG and utilities to the CCHPs can be\nobtained at the Stackelberg equilibrium, which is guaranteed to exist and\nunique. Because the complete information about energy supply of each CCHP is\nunknown to the APG in advance, we propose a distributed algorithm that is able\nto find the point of equilibrium through a limited number of iterations. Taking\nprivacy protection and transaction security into consideration, we design a\nblockchain-enabled energy management system. This system is composed of\nInternet of Energy (IoE) sub-system and blockchain sub-system, where the\ninformation interactions as well as energy transactions between APG and CCHPs\ncan be carried out effectively and safely. Finally, security analysis and\nnumerical simulations show the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed\nmechanism.",

            "summary": "In recent years, many researchers have focused on developing a feasible\nsolution for storing and exchanging medical images in the field of health care.\nCurrent practices are deployed on cloud-based centralized data centers, which\nincrease maintenance costs, require massive storage space, and raise privacy\nconcerns about sharing information over a network. Therefore, it is important\nto design a framework to enable sharing and storing of big medical data\nefficiently within a trustless environment. In the present paper, we propose a\nnovel proof-of-concept design for a distributed patient-centric image\nmanagement (PCIM) system that is aimed to ensure safety and control of patient\nprivate data without using a centralized infrastructure. In this system, we\nemployed an emerging Ethereum blockchain and a distributed file system\ntechnology called InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Then, we implemented an\nEthereum smart contract called the patientcentric access control protocol to\nenable a distributed and trustworthy access control policy. IPFS provides the\nmeans for decentralized storage of medical images with global accessibility. We\ndescribe how the PCIM system architecture facilitates the distributed and\nsecured patient-centric data access across multiple entities such as hospitals,\npatients, and image requestors. Finally, we deployed a smart contract prototype\non an Ethereum testnet blockchain and evaluated the proposed framework within\nthe Windows environment.

Initially driven by the research community, standardization\nbodies as 3GPP have embraced it as a promising solution to revolutionize the\ntraditional mobile telecommunication market by enabling new business models\nopportunities. Network Slicing is envisioned to open up the telecom market to\nnew players such as Industry Verticals, e.g. automotive, smart factories,\ne-health, etc. Given the large number of potential new business players, dubbed\nas network tenants, novel solutions are required to accommodate their needs in\na cost-efficient and secure manner. In this paper, we propose NSBchain, a novel\nnetwork slicing brokering (NSB) solution, which leverages on the widely adopted\nBlockchain technology to address the new business models needs beyond\ntraditional network sharing agreements. NSBchain defines a new entity, the\nIntermediate Broker (IB), which enables Infrastructure Providers (InPs) to\nallocate network resources to IBs through smart contracts and IBs to assign and\nre-distribute their resources among tenants in a secure, automated and scalable\nmanner.

To address this problem, we propose the SMACS\nframework, where updatable and sophisticated Access Control Rules (ACRs)} for\nsmart contracts can be realized with low cost. SMACS shifts the burden of\nexpensive ACRs validation and management operations to an off-chain\ninfrastructure, while implementing on-chain only lightweight token-based access\ncontrol. SMACS is flexible and in addition to simple access control lists can\neasily implement rules enhancing the runtime security of smart contracts.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive\noverview of DLT solutions analyzing the addressed challenges, provided\nsolutions and their usage for developing decentralized applications. Our study\nreviews over 100 blockchain papers and startup initiatives from which we\nconstruct a 3-tier based architecture for decentralized applications and we use\nit to systematically classify the technology solutions. Protocol and Network\nTier solutions address the digital assets registration, transactions, data\nstructure, and privacy and business rules implementation and the creation of\npeer-to-peer networks, ledger replication, and consensus-based state\nvalidation. Scaling Tier solutions address the scalability problems in terms of\nstorage size, transaction throughput, and computational capability. Finally,\nFederated Tier aggregates integrative solutions across multiple blockchain\napplications deployments.

            "summary": "Blockchain sharding is a promising approach to solving the dilemma between\ndecentralisation and high performance (transaction throughput) for blockchain.\nThe main challenge of Blockchain sharding systems is how to reach a decision on\na statement among a sub-group (shard) of people while ensuring the whole\npopulation recognises this statement. Namely, the challenge is to prevent an\nadversary who does not have the majority of nodes globally but have the\nmajority of nodes inside a shard. Most Blockchain sharding approaches can only\nreach a correct consensus inside a shard with at most $n/3$ evil nodes in a $n$\nnode system. There is a blockchain sharding approach which can prevent an\nincorrect decision to be reached when the adversary does not have $n/2$ nodes\nglobally. However, the system can be stopped from reaching consensus (become\ndeadlocked) if the adversary controls a smaller number of nodes.\n  In this paper, we present an improved Blockchain sharding approach that can\nwithstand $n/2$ adversarial nodes and recover from deadlocks. The recovery is\nmade by dynamically adjusting the number of shards and the shard size. A\nperformance analysis suggests our approach has a high performance (transaction\nthroughput) while requiring little bandwidth for synchronisation.",

            "summary": "By allowing users to obscure their transactions via including \"mixins\" (chaff\ncoins), ring signature schemes have been widely used to protect a sender's\nidentity of a transaction in privacy-preserving blockchain systems, like Monero\nand Bytecoin. However, recent works point out that the existing ring signature\nscheme is vulnerable to the \"chain-reaction\" analysis (i.e., the spent coin in\na given ring signature can be deduced through elimination). Especially, when\nthe diversity of mixins is low, the spent coin will have a high risk to be\ndetected. To overcome the weakness, the ring signature should be consisted of a\nset of mixins with high diversity and produce observations having \"similar\"\ndistributions for any two coins. In this paper, we propose a notion, namely\n$\\epsilon$-coin-indistinguishability ($\\epsilon$-CI), to formally define the\n\"similar\" distribution guaranteed through a differential privacy scheme. Then,\nwe formally define the CI-aware mixins selection problem with disjoint-superset\nconstraint (CIA-MS-DS), which aims to find a mixin set that has maximal\ndiversity and satisfies the constraints of $\\epsilon$-CI and the budget. In\nCIA-MS-DS, each ring signature is either disjoint with or the superset of its\npreceding ring signatures. We prove that CIA-MS-DS is NP-hard and thus\nintractable. To solve the CIA-MS-DS problem, we propose two approximation\nalgorithms, namely the Progressive Algorithm and the Game Theoretic Algorithm,\nwith theoretic guarantees. Through extensive experiments on both real data sets\nand synthetic data sets, we demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of\nour approaches.",

            "summary": "The EOSIO blockchain, one of the representative Delegated Proof-of-Stake\n(DPoS) blockchain platforms, has grown rapidly recently. Meanwhile, a number of\nvulnerabilities and high-profile attacks against top EOSIO DApps and their\nsmart contracts have also been discovered and observed in the wild, resulting\nin serious financial damages. Most of EOSIO's smart contracts are not\nopen-sourced and they are typically compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) bytecode,\nthus making it challenging to analyze and detect the presence of possible\nvulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose EOSAFE, the first static analysis\nframework that can be used to automatically detect vulnerabilities in EOSIO\nsmart contracts at the bytecode level. Our framework includes a practical\nsymbolic execution engine for Wasm, a customized library emulator for EOSIO\nsmart contracts, and four heuristics-driven detectors to identify the presence\nof four most popular vulnerabilities in EOSIO smart contracts. Experiment\nresults suggest that EOSAFE achieves promising results in detecting\nvulnerabilities, with an F1-measure of 98%. We have applied EOSAFE to all\nactive 53,666 smart contracts in the ecosystem (as of November 15, 2019). Our\nresults show that over 25% of the smart contracts are vulnerable. We further\nanalyze possible exploitation attempts against these vulnerable smart contracts\nand identify 48 in-the-wild attacks (25 of them have been confirmed by DApp\ndevelopers), resulting in financial loss of at least 1.7 million USD.",

The\nstandard solution for off-chain payments, state channels, are optimized for\nfrequent transactions between two entities and impose prohibitive liquidity and\ncapital requirements on payment senders for marketplace transactions. We\npropose PayPlace, a scalable off-chain protocol for payments between consumers\nand sellers. Using PayPlace, consumers establish a virtual unidirectional\npayment channel with an intermediary operator to pay for their transactions.\nUnlike state channels, however, the PayPlace operator can reference the\ncustodial funds accrued off-chain in these channels to in-turn make\ntamper-proof off-chain payments to merchants, without locking up corresponding\ncapital in channels with merchants. Our design ensures that new payments made\nto merchants are guaranteed to be safe once notarized and provably mitigates\nwell-known drawbacks in previous constructions like the data availability\nattack and ensures that neither consumers nor merchants need to be online to\nensure continued safety of their notarized funds. We show that the on-chain\nmonetary and computational costs for PayPlace is O(1) in the number of payment\ntransactions processed, and is near-constant in other parameters in most\nscenarios. PayPlace can hence scale the payment throughput for large-scale\nmarketplaces at no marginal cost and is orders of magnitude cheaper than the\nstate-of-art solution for non-pairwise off-chain payments, Zero Knowledge\nRollups.",

However, we argue that transaction execution is also\nimportant to the performance and security of blockchains. In other words, there\nare ample opportunities to speed up and further secure blockchains by reducing\nthe cost of transaction execution.\n  Our goal is to understand how much we can speed up blockchains by exploiting\ntransaction concurrency available in blockchain workloads. To this end, we\nfirst analyze historical data of seven major public blockchains, namely\nBitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and\nZilliqa. We consider two metrics for concurrency, namely the single-transaction\nconflict rate per block, and the group conflict rate per block. We find that\nthere is more concurrency in UTXO-based blockchains than in account-based ones,\nalthough the amount of concurrency in the former is lower than expected.\nAnother interesting finding is that some blockchains with larger blocks have\nmore concurrency than blockchains with smaller blocks. Next, we propose an\nanalytical model for estimating the transaction execution speed-up given an\namount of concurrency. Using results from our empirical analysis, the model\nestimates that 6x speed-ups in Ethereum can be achieved if all available\nconcurrency is exploited.",

Unfortunately, currently\nproposed watchtower schemes suffer from multiple security and efficiency\ndrawbacks. In this paper, we explore the design space behind watchtowers. We\npropose a novel watching service named as fail-safe watchtowers. In contrast to\nprior proposed watching services, our fail-safe watchtower does not watch\non-chain smart contracts constantly. Instead, it only sends a single on-chain\nmessage periodically confirming or denying the final states of channels being\nclosed. Our watchtowers can easily handle a large number of channels, are\nprivacy-preserving, and fail-safe tolerating multiple attack vectors.\nFurthermore, we show that watchtowers (in general) may be an option\neconomically unjustified for multiple payment scenarios and we introduce a\nsimple, yet powerful concept of short-lived assertions which can mitigate\nmisbehaving parties in these scenarios.",

Though various\ntools have been proposed to detect vulnerable smart contracts, the majority\nfails to protect vulnerable contracts that have already been deployed on the\nblockchain. Only very few solutions have been proposed so far to tackle the\nissue of post-deployment. However, these solutions suffer from low precision\nand are not generic enough to prevent any type of attack.\n  In this work, we introduce {\\AE}GIS, a dynamic analysis tool that protects\nsmart contracts from being exploited during runtime. Its capability of\ndetecting new vulnerabilities can easily be extended through so-called attack\npatterns. These patterns are written in a domain-specific language that is\ntailored to the execution model of Ethereum smart contracts. The language\nenables the description of malicious control and data flows. In addition, we\npropose a novel mechanism to streamline and speed up the process of managing\nattack patterns. Patterns are voted upon and stored via a smart contract, thus\nleveraging the benefits of tamper-resistance and transparency provided by the\nblockchain. We compare {\\AE}GIS to current state-of-the-art tools and\ndemonstrate that our solution achieves higher precision in detecting attacks.\nFinally, we perform a large-scale analysis on the first 4.5 million blocks of\nthe Ethereum blockchain, thereby confirming the occurrences of well reported\nand yet unreported attacks in the wild.",

For the first question, we explain how database technology\ncontributes to blockchain technology by unlocking different features such as\nACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) transactional\nconsistency, rich queries, real-time analytics, and low latency. We explain how\nthe CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem known for\ndatabases influenced the DCS (Decentralization, Consistency, Scalability)\ntheorem for the blockchain systems. By using an analogous relaxation approach\nas it was used for the proof of the CAP theorem, we postulate a\n\"DCS-satisfiability conjecture.\" For the second question, we review different\ndatabases that are designed specifically for blockchain and provide most of the\nblockchain functionality like immutability, privacy, censorship resistance,\nalong with database features.",

            "summary": "Permissioned blockchains are becoming popular as data management systems in\nthe enterprise setting. Compared to traditional distributed databases,\nblockchain platforms provide increased security guarantees but significantly\nlower performance. Further, these platforms are quite expensive to run for the\nlow throughput they provide. The following are two ways to improve performance\nand reduce cost: (1) make the system utilize allocated resources efficiently;\n(2) allow rapid and dynamic scaling of allocated resources based on load. We\nexplore both of these in this work.\n  We first investigate the reasons for the poor performance and scalability of\nthe dominant permissioned blockchain flavor called Execute-Order-Validate\n(EOV). We do this by studying the scaling characteristics of Hyperledger\nFabric, a popular EOV platform, using vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.\nWe find that the transaction throughput scales very poorly with these\ntechniques. At least in the permissioned setting, the real bottleneck is\ntransaction processing, not the consensus protocol. With vertical scaling, the\nallocated vCPUs go under-utilized. In contrast, with horizontal scaling, the\nallocated resources get wasted due to redundant work across nodes within an\norganization.\n  To mitigate the above concerns, we first improve resource efficiency by (a)\nimproving CPU utilization with a pipelined execution of validation & commit\nphases; (b) avoiding redundant work across nodes by introducing a new type of\npeer node called sparse peer that selectively commits transactions. We further\npropose a technique that enables the rapid scaling of resources. Our\nimplementation - SmartFabric, built on top of Hyperledger Fabric demonstrates\n3x higher throughput, 12-26x faster scale-up time, and provides Fabric's\nthroughput at 50% to 87% lower cost.",

In the\ntraditional economy, credit bears the risk that the borrower may default on its\ndebt, the lender hence requires upfront collateral from the borrower, plus\ninterest fee payments. Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders\ncan offer flash loans, i.e., loans that are only valid within one transaction\nand must be repaid by the end of that transaction. This concept has lead to a\nnumber of interesting attack possibilities, some of which were exploited in\nFebruary 2020.\n  This paper is the first to explore the implication of transaction atomicity\nand flash loans for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We show\nquantitatively how transaction atomicity increases the arbitrage revenue. We\nmoreover analyze two existing attacks with ROIs beyond 500k%. We formulate\nfinding the attack parameters as an optimization problem over the state of the\nunderlying Ethereum blockchain and the state of the DeFi ecosystem. We show how\nmalicious adversaries can efficiently maximize an attack profit and hence\ndamage the DeFi ecosystem further. Specifically, we present how two previously\nexecuted attacks can be \"boosted\" to result in a profit of 829.5k USD and 1.1M\nUSD, respectively, which is a boost of 2.37x and 1.73x, respectively.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we propose a technique for rebalancing link weights in\ndecentralized credit networks. Credit networks are peer-to-peer trust-based\nnetworks that enable fast and inexpensive cross-currency transactions compared\nto traditional bank wire transfers, which has led to their increasing\npopularity and use. Although researchers have studied security of transactions\nand privacy of users of such networks, and have invested significant efforts\ninto designing efficient routing algorithms for credit networks, comparatively\nlittle work has been done in the area of {replenishing} credit links of users\nin the network. Replenishing links at regular intervals in a credit network is\nimportant to keep users solvent, the network viable with enough liquidity, and\nto prevent transaction failures. This is achieved by a process called\n{rebalancing} that enables a poorly funded user to create incoming as well as\noutgoing credit links. We propose a system where a user with zero or no link\nweights can create incoming links with existing, trusted users in the network,\nin a procedure we call {balance transfer}, followed by creating outgoing links\nto existing or new users that would like to join the network, a process we call\n{bailout}. Both these processes together constitute our proposed rebalancing\nmechanism. Our techniques would also serve to make the network more competitive\nby offering users lower rates of interest, and enable users to earn routing\nfees-based revenue by participating in high throughput transaction paths.",

However, determining what the whitelisted behavior of an\nIoT device should be remains an open challenge.

This paper proposes a blockchain-based system for\ndetermining whether an IoT device is behaving like other devices of the same\ntype. Our system (SERENIoT, pronounced Serenity) overcomes the challenge of\ninitially determining the correct behavior for a device. Nodes in the SERENIoT\npublic blockchain submit summaries of the network behavior observed for\nconnected IoT devices and build whitelists of behavior observed by the majority\nof nodes. Changes in behavior through software updates are automatically\nwhitelisted once the update is broadly deployed.

            "summary": "In emerging applications such as blockchains and collaborative data\nanalytics, there are strong demands for data immutability, multi-version\naccesses, and tamper-evident controls. This leads to three new index structures\nfor immutable data, namely Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT), Merkle Bucket Tree\n(MBT), and Pattern-Oriented-Split Tree (POS-Tree). Although these structures\nhave been adopted in real applications, there is no systematic evaluation of\ntheir pros and cons in the literature. This makes it difficult for\npractitioners to choose the right index structure for their applications, as\nthere is only a limited understanding of the characteristics of each index.\n  To alleviate the above deficiency, we present a comprehensive analysis of the\nexisting index structures for immutable data, evaluating both their asymptotic\nand empirical performance. Specifically, we show that MPT, MBT, and POS-Tree\nare all instances of a recently proposed framework, dubbed \\my{Structurally\nInvariant and Reusable Indexes (SIRI)}. We propose to evaluate the SIRI\ninstances based on five essential metrics: their efficiency for four index\noperations (i.e., lookup, update, comparison, and merge), as well as their\n\\my{deduplication ratios} (i.e., the size of the index with deduplication over\nthe size without deduplication). We establish the worst-case guarantees of each\nindex in terms of these five metrics, and we experimentally evaluate all\nindexes in a large variety of settings. Based on our theoretical and empirical\nanalysis, we conclude that POS-Tree is a favorable choice for indexing\nimmutable data.",

The ever-increasing demand of data-volume, as well as speed of such\napplications, have essentially transported these applications from their\ncomfort zone: static setting, to a challenging territory of dynamic updates. At\nthe same time, mainstreaming of multi-core processors have entailed that the\ndynamic applications should be able to exploit concurrency as soon as\nparallelization gets inhibited. Thus, the design and implementation of\nefficient concurrent dynamic graph algorithms have become significant.\n  This paper reports a novel library of concurrent shared-memory algorithms for\nbreadth-first search (BFS), single-source shortest-path (SSSP), and betweenness\ncentrality (BC) in a dynamic graph. The presented algorithms are provably\nnon-blocking and linearizable. We extensively evaluate C++ implementations of\nthe algorithms through several micro-benchmarks. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the scalability with the number of threads. Our experiments also\nhighlight the limitations of static graph analytics methods in a dynamic\nsetting.",

            "summary": "A blockchain, such as Bitcoin, is an append-only, secure, transparent,\ndistributed ledger. A fair blockchain is expected to have healthy metrics; high\nhonest mining power, low processing latency, i.e., low wait times for\ntransactions and stable price of consumption, i.e., the minimum transaction fee\nrequired to have a transaction processed. As Bitcoin matures, the influx of\ntransactions increases and the block rewards become insignificant. We show that\nunder these conditions, it becomes hard to maintain the health of the\nblockchain. In Bitcoin, under these mature operating conditions (MOC), the\nminers would find it challenging to cover their mining costs as there would be\nno more revenue from merely mining a block. It may cause miners not to continue\nmining, threatening the blockchain's security. Further, as we show in this\npaper using simulations, the cost of acting in favor of the health of the\nblockchain, under MOC, is very high in Bitcoin, causing all miners to process\ntransactions greedily. It leads to stranded transactions, i.e., transactions\noffering low transaction fees, experiencing unreasonably high processing\nlatency. To make matters worse, a compounding effect of these stranded\ntransactions is the rising price of consumption. Such phenomena not only induce\nunfairness as experienced by the miners and the users but also deteriorate the\nhealth of the blockchain.\n  We propose BitcoinF transaction processing protocol, a simple, yet highly\neffective modification to the existing Bitcoin protocol to fix these issues of\nunfairness. BitcoinF resolves these issues of unfairness while preserving the\nability of the users to express urgency and have their transactions\nprioritized.",

Fog is highly distributed and\nconsists of a wide number of autonomous end devices, which contribute to the\nprocessing. However, the variety of devices offered across different users are\nnot audited. Hence, the security of Fog devices is a major concern in the Fog\ncomputing environment. Furthermore, mitigating and preventing those security\nmeasures is a research issue. Therefore, to provide the necessary security for\nFog devices, we need to understand what the security concerns are with regards\nto Fog. All aspects of Fog security, which have not been covered by other\nliterature works needs to be identified and need to be aggregate all issues in\nFog security. It needs to be noted that computation devices consist of many\nordinary users, and are not managed by any central entity or managing body.\nTherefore, trust and privacy is also a key challenge to gain market adoption\nfor Fog. To provide the required trust and privacy, we need to also focus on\nauthentication, threats and access control mechanisms as well as techniques in\nFog computing. In this paper, we perform a survey and propose a taxonomy, which\npresents an overview of existing security concerns in the context of the Fog\ncomputing paradigm. We discuss the Blockchain-based solutions towards a secure\nFog computing environment and presented various research challenges and\ndirections for future research.",

IoT domain is one of such applications,\nwhich can utilize cryptocur-rencies for micro payments without compromising\ntheir payment privacy. However, long confirmation times of transactions and\nrelatively high fees hinder the adoption of cryptoccurency based\nmicro-payments. The payment channel networks is one of the proposed solutions\nto address these issue where nodes establish payment channels among themselves\nwithout writing on blockchain. IoT devices can benefit from such payment\nnetworks as long as they are capable of sustaining their overhead. Payment\nchannel networks pose unique characteristics as far as the routing problem is\nconcerned. Specifically, they should stay balanced to have a sustainable\nnetwork for maintaining payments for longer times, which is crucial for IoT\ndevices once they are deployed.In this paper, we present a payment channel\nnetwork design that aims to keep the channels balanced by using a common weight\npolicy across the network. We additionally propose using multi-point\nconnections to nodes for each IoT device for unbalanced payment scenarios. The\nexperiment results show that we can keep the channels in the network more\nequally balanced compared to the minimal fee approach. In addition, multiple\nconnections from IoT devices to nodes increase the success ratio significantly.",

To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel test case\ngeneration approach, called ADF-GA (All-uses Data Flow criterion based test\ncase generation using Genetic Algorithm), for Solidity based Ethereum smart\ncontract programs. ADF-GA aims to efficiently generate a valid set of test\ncases via three stages. First, the corresponding program control flow graph is\nconstructed from the source codes. Second, the generated control flow graph is\nanalyzed to obtain the variable information in the Solidity programs, locate\nthe require statements, and also get the definition-use pairs to be tested.\nFinally, a genetic algorithm is used to generate test cases, in which an\nimproved fitness function is proposed to calculate the definition-use pairs\ncoverage of each test case with program instrumentation. Experimental studies\nare performed on several representative Solidity programs. The results show\nthat ADF-GA can effectively generate test cases, achieve better coverage, and\nreduce the number of iterations in genetic algorithm.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technology can play a vital role in the space industry and\nexploration. This magic technology can provide decentralized and secure\ntechniques for processing and manipulating space resources as space digital\ntokens. Tokenizing space resources such as orbits, satellites, spacecraft,\norbital debris, asteroids, and other space objects in the form of\nblockchain-based digital tokens will reflect plenty of various applications in\nthe space mining industry. Moreover, Blockchain algorithms based on smart\ncontracts can be utilized for tracking all space transactions and\ncommunications in a transparent, verifiable, and secure manner. This paper is\none of the first attempts towards conceptually investigating adopting\nblockchain theory in the space industry based on space digital token concept. A\nnew conceptual blockchain in space industry framework is proposed, and new\nmodels are created for introducing proposed solutions for some major challenges\nin the space industry and exploration. Finally, the paper is ended with\ndiscussing SpaceChain, the first open-source blockchain-based satellite network\nin the world as a case study of applying blockchain theory in designing and\nimplementing satellite systems.",

Abstractly, a smart contract is a functionality\nthat allows parties to deposit funds, and release them upon fulfillment of\nalgorithmically checkable conditions, and can thus be employed as a formal tool\nto enforce monetary incentives.\n  In this work, we give the first example of the use of smart contracts in a\nquantum setting. We describe a simple hybrid classical-quantum payment system\nwhose main ingredients are a classical blockchain capable of handling stateful\nsmart contracts, and quantum lightning, a strengthening of public-key quantum\nmoney introduced by Zhandry (Eurocrypt'19). Our hybrid payment system employs\nquantum states as banknotes and a classical blockchain to settle disputes and\nto keep track of the valid serial numbers. It has several desirable properties:\nit is decentralized, requiring no trust in any single entity; payments are as\nquick as quantum communication, regardless of the total number of users; when a\nquantum banknote is damaged or lost, the rightful owner can recover the lost\nvalue.",

To properly\nincentivize data owners to contribute their efforts, Shapley Value (SV) is\noften adopted to fairly assess their contribution.

In this paper, we propose\nFedCoin, a blockchain-based peer-to-peer payment system for FL to enable a\nfeasible SV based profit distribution. In FedCoin, blockchain consensus\nentities calculate SVs and a new block is created based on the proof of Shapley\n(PoSap) protocol. It is in contrast to the popular BitCoin network where\nconsensus entities \"mine\" new blocks by solving meaningless puzzles. Based on\nthe computed SVs, a scheme for dividing the incentive payoffs among FL clients\nwith nonrepudiation and tamper-resistance properties is proposed. Experimental\nresults based on real-world data show that FedCoin can promote high-quality\ndata from FL clients through accurately computing SVs with an upper bound on\nthe computational resources required for reaching consensus.

We formalize a defense to double-spend\nattacks.

A number of axioms and rules of inference\nare developed that can be used to justify a ``meeting of the minds''\nprecondition for contract formation from the fact that certain content has been\nsigned. In addition to an ``offer and acceptance'' process, the paper considers\n``signature in counterparts'', a legal process that permits a contract between\ntwo or more parties to be brought into force by having the parties\nindependently (possibly, remotely) sign different copies of the contract,\nrather than placing their signatures on a common copy at a physical meeting. It\nis argued that a satisfactory account of signature in counterparts benefits\nfrom a logic with syntactic self-reference. The axioms used are supported by a\nformal semantics, and a number of further properties of the logic are\ninvestigated. In particular, it is shown that the logic implies that when a\ncontract has been signed, the parties do not just agree, but are in mutual\nagreement (a common-knowledge-like notion) about the terms of the contract.",

However,\nthis 50% threshold is based on the analysis of computing power only, with\nimplicit and idealistic assumptions on the network and node behavior. Recent\nresearches have alluded that factors such as network connectivity, presence of\nblockchain forks, and mining strategy could undermine the consensus security\nassured by the honest-majority, but neither concrete analysis nor quantitative\nevaluation is provided. In this paper we fill the gap by proposing an\nanalytical model to assess the impact of network connectivity on the consensus\nsecurity of PoW blockchain under different adversary models. We apply our\nanalytical model to two adversarial scenarios: 1)\nhonest-but-potentially-colluding, 2) selfish mining. For each scenario, we\nquantify the communication capability of nodes involved in a fork race and\nestimate the adversary's mining revenue and its impact on security properties\nof the consensus protocol. Simulation results validated our analysis. Our\nmodeling and analysis provide a paradigm for assessing the security impact of\nvarious factors in a distributed consensus system.",

            "summary": "The Global Financial Crisis of 2008, caused by the accumulation of excessive\nfinancial risk, inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Now, more than ten\nyears later, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm\nwhich leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and\nsecurity, contains over 702m USD of capital as of April 15th, 2020. As this\necosystem develops, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is\nsupposed to be preventing. In this paper we explore how design weaknesses and\nprice fluctuations in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. We focus on\nDeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem\nwith a 76% market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020.\n  First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design\nto take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market\nshare, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the\nminting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel\nstrategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed\nthe execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the\nneed to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack\ndetails, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack\nvectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi\nlending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we\ndevelop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol,\nfocusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol\nsolvency. Based on our parameters, we find that with sufficiently illiquidity a\nlending protocol with a total debt of 400m USD could become undercollateralized\nwithin 19 days.",

However, blockchain mining processes demand high hardware\ncosts and consume a vast amount of energy (studies have shown that the amount\nof energy consumed in Bitcoin mining is almost the same as the electricity used\nin Ireland). To address the high mining cost problem of blockchain networks, in\nthis paper, we propose a blockchain mining resources allocation algorithm to\nreduce the mining cost in PoW-based (proof-of-work-based) blockchain networks.\nWe first propose an analytical queueing model for general blockchain networks.\nIn our queueing model, transactions arrive randomly to the queue and are served\nin a batch manner with unknown service rate probability distribution and\nagnostic to any priority mechanism. Then, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization\ntechniques to propose a dynamic mining resources allocation algorithm (DMRA),\nwhich is parameterized by a tuning parameter $K>0$. We show that our algorithm\nachieves an $[O(1/K), O(K)]$ cost-optimality-gap-vs-delay tradeoff. Our\nsimulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of DMRA in reducing\nmining costs.",

In this paper, we study\nthe structure of the resulting overlay network, as it significantly influences\nthe robustness and performance of IPFS. We monitor and systematically crawl\nIPFS' DHT towards mapping the IPFS overlay network. Our measurements found an\naverage of 44474 nodes at every given time. At least 52.19% of these reside\nbehind a NAT and are not reachable from the outside, suggesting that a large\nshare of the network is operated by private individuals on an as-needed basis.\nBased on our measurements and our analysis of the IPFS code, we conclude that\nthe topology of the IPFS network is, in its current state, closer to an\nunstructured overlay network than it is to a classical DHT. While such a\nstructure has benefits for robustness and the resistance against Sybil attacks,\nit leaves room for improvement in terms of performance and query privacy.",

As we experimentally showed in our previous white\npaper, our architecture provides a significant throughput improvement while\npreserving the security of the system. Flow exploits the heterogeneity offered\nby the nodes, in terms of bandwidth, storage, and computational capacity, and\ndefines the roles for the nodes based on their tasks in the pipeline, i.e.,\nCollector, Consensus, Execution, and Verification. While transaction collection\nfrom the user agents is completed through the bandwidth-optimized Collector\nNodes, the execution of them is done by the compute-optimized Execution Nodes.\nChecking the execution result is then distributed among a more extensive set of\nVerification Nodes, which confirm the result is correct in a distributed and\nparallel manner. In contrast to more traditional blockchain architectures,\nFlow's Consensus Nodes do not execute the transaction. Instead, Verification\nNodes report observed faulty executions to the Consensus Nodes, which\nadjudicate the received challenges and slash malicious actors.\n  In this paper, we detail the lifecycle of the transactions from the\nsubmission to the system until they are getting executed. The paper covers the\nCollector, Consensus, and Execution role. We provide a protocol specification\nof collecting the transactions, forming a block, and executing the resulting\nblock.

            "summary": "The design of permissioned blockchains places an access control requirement\nfor members to read, access, and write information over the blockchains. In\nthis paper, we study a hierarchical scenario to include three types of\nparticipants: providers, collectors, and governors. To be specific, providers\nforward transactions, collected from terminals, to collectors; collectors\nupload received transactions to governors after verifying and labeling them;\nand governors validate a part of received labeled transactions, pack valid ones\ninto a block, and append a new block on the ledger. Collectors in the\nhierarchical model play a crucial role in the design: they have connections\nwith both providers and governors, and are responsible for collecting,\nverifying, and uploading transactions. However, collectors are rational and\nsome of them may behave maliciously (not necessarily for their own benefits).\nIn this paper, we introduce a reputation protocol as a measure of the\nreliability of collectors in the permissioned blockchain environment. Its\nobjective is to encourage collectors to behave truthfully and, in addition, to\nreduce the verification cost. The verification cost on provider $p$ is defined\nas the total number of invalid transactions provided by $p$ and checked by\ngovernors. Through theoretical analysis, our protocol with the reputation\nmechanism has a significant improvement in efficiency. Specifically, the\nverification loss that governors suffer is proved to be asymptotically\n$O(\\sqrt{T_{total}})$ ($T_{total}$, representing the number of transactions\nverified by governors and provided by $p$), as long as there exists at least\none collector who behaves well. At last, two typical cases where our model can\nbe well applied are also demonstrated.",

            "summary": "Corruption is a major global financial problem with billions of dollars\nrendered lost or unaccountable annually. Corruption through contract fraud is\noften conducted by withholding and/or altering financial information. When such\nscandals are investigated by authorities, financial and legal documents are\nusually altered to conceal the paper trail.\n  Smart contracts have emerged in recent years and appear promising for\napplications such as legal contracts where transparency is critical and of\npublic interest. Transparency and auditability are inherent because smart\ncontracts execute operations on the blockchain, a distributed public ledger.\n  In this paper, we propose the Minimum Hybrid Contract (MHC), with the aim of\nintroducing 1) auditability, 2) transparency, and 3) immutability to the\ncontract's financial transactions. The MHC comprises an online smart contract\nand an offline traditional legal contract. where the two are immutably linked.\n  Secure peer-to-peer financial transactions, transparency, and cost accounting\nare automated by the smart contract, and legal issues or disputes are carried\nout by civil courts. The reliance on established legal processes facilitates an\nappropriate adoption of smart contracts in traditional contracts.",

The\nalgorithms given are capable of hashing entire graphs as well as assigning hash\nvalues to specific nodes in a given graph. The notion of node symmetry is made\nprecise via computation of vertex orbits and the graph automorphism group, and\nnodes that are symmetrically identical are assigned equal hashes. We also\npresent a novel Merkle-style hashing algorithm that seeks to fulfill the\nrecursive principle that a hash of a node should depend only on the hash of its\nneighbors. This algorithm works even in the presence of cycles, which would not\nbe possible with a naive approach. Structurally hashing trees has seen\nwidespread use in blockchain, source code version control, and web\napplications. Despite the popularity of tree hashing, directed graph hashing\nremains unstudied in the literature. Our algorithms open new possibilities to\nhashing both directed graphs and more complex data structures that can be\nreduced to directed graphs such as hypergraphs.",

In\nthis paper, we present an accessible, low-cost attack in which the attacker\nparalyzes multiple payment network channels for several days. The attack is\nbased on overloading channels with requests that are kept unresolved until\ntheir expiration time. Reaching the maximum allowed unresolved requests (HTLCs)\nlocks the channel for new payments. The attack is in fact inherent to the way\noff-chain networks are constructed, since limits on the number of unresolved\npayments are derived from limits on the blockchain. We consider three main\nversions of the attack: one in which the attacker attempts to block as many\nhigh liquidity channels as possible, one in which it disconnects as many pairs\nof nodes as it can, and one in which it tries to isolate individual nodes from\nthe network. We evaluate the costs of these attacks on Bitcoin's Lightning\nNetwork and compare how changes in the network have affected the cost of\nattack. Specifically, we consider how recent changes to default parameters in\neach of the main Lightning implementations contribute to the attacks. As we\nevaluate the attacks, we also look at statistics on parameters in the Lightning\nNetwork, which are of independent interest and compare the various\nimplementations of Lightning nodes. Finally, we suggest mitigation techniques\nthat make these attacks much harder to carry out.",

To overcome this, committee-based approaches (e.g., Elastico) that\npartition the outstanding transaction set into shards and (randomly) select\nmultiple committees to process these transactions in parallel have been\nproposed and have become very popular. However, by design these committee or\nshard-based blockchain solutions are easily vulnerable to the Sybil attacks,\nwhere an adversary can easily compromise/manipulate the consensus protocol if\nit has enough computational power to generate multiple Sybil committee members\n(by generating multiple valid node identifiers). Despite the straightforward\nnature of these attacks, they have not been systematically analyzed. In this\npaper, we fill this research gap by modelling and analyzing Sybil attacks in a\nrepresentative and popular shard-based protocol called Elastico. We show that\nthe PoW technique used for identifier or ID generation in the initial phase of\nthe protocol is vulnerable to Sybil attacks, and a node with high hash-power\ncan generate enough Sybil IDs to successfully compromise Elastico. We\nanalytically derive conditions for two different categories of Sybil attacks\nand perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results under\ndifferent network and protocol parameters.",

Although there has been significant work in the field of cloud\naccess control mechanisms, however, with the advent of Distributed Ledger\nTechnology (DLT), on-chain access control management frameworks hardly exist.\nExisting access control management mechanisms are tightly coupled with the\nbusiness logic, resulting in governance issues, non-coherent with existing\nIdentity Management Solutions, low security, and compromised usability. We\npropose a novel framework to implement dynamic role-based access control for\ndecentralized applications (dApps). The framework allows for managing access\ncontrol on a dApp, which is completely decoupled from the business application\nand integrates seamlessly with any dApps. The smart contract architecture\nallows for the independent management of business logic and execution of access\ncontrol policies. It also facilitates secure, low cost, and a high degree of\nflexibility of access control management. The proposed framework promotes\ndecentralized governance of access control policies and efficient smart\ncontract upgrades. We also provide quantitative and qualitative metrics for the\nefficacy and efficiency of the framework. Any Turing complete smart contract\nprogramming language is an excellent fit to implement the framework.

Except for opening and\nclosing of a payment channel, no other transaction requests accepted by a PCN\nare recorded in the Blockchain. Only the parties which have opened the channel\nwill know the exact amount of fund left at a given instant. In real scenarios,\nthere might not exist a single path which can enable transfer of high value\npayments. For such cases, splitting up the transaction value across multiple\npaths is a better approach. While there exists several approaches which route\ntransactions via several paths, such techniques are quite inefficient, as the\ndecision on the number of splits must be taken at the initial phase of the\nrouting algorithm (e.g., SpeedyMurmur [42]). Algorithms which do not consider\nthe residual capacity of each channel in the network are susceptible to\nfailure. Other approaches leak sensitive information, and are quite\ncomputationally expensive [28]. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed\nscheme HushRelay is an efficient privacy preserving routing algorithm, taking\ninto account the funds left in each channel, while splitting the transaction\nvalue across several paths. Comparing the performance of our algorithm with\nexisting routing schemes on real instances (e.g., Ripple Network), we observed\nthat HushRelay attains a success ratio of 1, with an execution time of 2.4 sec.\nHowever, SpeedyMurmur [42] attains a success ratio of 0.98 and takes 4.74 sec\nwhen the number of landmarks is 6. On testing our proposed routing algorithm on\nthe Lightning Network, a success ratio of 0.99 is observed, having an execution\ntime of 0.15 sec, which is 12 times smaller than the time taken by\nSpeedyMurmur.",

            "summary": "In the second decade of the 21st century, blockchain definitely became one of\nthe most trending computational technologies. This research aims to question\nthe feasibility and suitability of using blockchain technology within e-voting\nsystems, regarding both technical and non-technical aspects. In today's world,\nalthough the course of this spreading is considerably slow, several countries\nalready use means of e-voting due to many social and economic reasons, which we\nfurther investigated. Nevertheless, the number of countries offering various\ne-government solutions, apart from e-voting, is significantly high. E-voting\nsystems, naturally, require much more attention and assurance regarding\npotential security and anonymity issues, since voting is one of the few\nextremely critical governmental processes. Nevertheless, e-voting is not purely\na governmental service, but many companies and nonprofit organizations would\nbenefit the cost-efficiency, scalability, remote accessibility, and ease of use\nthat it provides. Blockchain technology is claimed to be able to address some,\nobviously not all, important security concerns, including anonymity,\nconfidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. The analysis results presented\nin this article mostly confirm these claims.",

Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for\nhackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce\naccurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can\nbe used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems.\nFurthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT\napplications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been\nconducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies\ntarget either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques,\nthus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years\naddressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC\ntechniques. In this paper, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the\npast few years, starting from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy\nissues using ML algorithms and BCtechniques in the IoT domain. First, we\ndiscuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the\npast twelve years in the IoT domain. Then, we classify the literature on\nsecurity and privacy efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the\nIoT domain. Finally, we identify and illuminate several challenges and future\nresearch directions in using ML algorithms and BC techniques to address\nsecurity and privacy issues in the IoT domain.",

Although protocols for the\nlatter case give seemingly stronger guarantees, this is not the case since they\n(inherently) tolerate a lower fraction of corrupted parties.\n  We design an SMR protocol that is network-agnostic in the following sense: if\nit is run in a synchronous network, it tolerates $t_s$ corrupted parties; if\nthe network happens to be asynchronous it is resilient to $t_a \\leq t_s$\nfaults. Our protocol achieves optimal tradeoffs between $t_s$ and $t_a$.",

Instead, we provide a tool to find errors/bad states, i.e.\nprogram states that do not conform with the intent of the developer.

While this paradigm has\nbeen widely adopted in industry, it has not been carefully analyzed in terms of\nits network scaling with respect to the number of peers. Applications for\nblockchain systems, such as cryptocurrencies and IoT, require this form of\nnetwork scaling.\n  In this paper, we propose a new stochastic network model for a blockchain\nsystem. We identify a structural property called \\emph{one-endedness}, which we\nshow to be desirable in any blockchain system as it is directly related to\ndistributed consensus among the peers. We show that the stochastic stability of\nthe network is sufficient for the one-endedness of a blockchain. We further\nestablish that our model belongs to a class of network models, called monotone\nseparable models. This allows us to establish upper and lower bounds on the\nstability region. The bounds on stability depend on the connectivity of the P2P\nnetwork through its conductance and allow us to analyze the scalability of\nblockchain systems on large P2P networks.

            "summary": "Decentralization is a key indicator for the evaluation of public blockchains.\nIn the past, there have been very few studies on measuring and comparing the\nactual level of decentralization between Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains and\nblockchains with other consensus protocols. This paper presents a new\ncomparison study of the level of decentralization in Bitcoin and Steem, a\nprominent Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain. Our study particularly\nfocuses on analysing the power that decides the creators of blocks in the\nblockchain. In Bitcoin, miners with higher computational power generate more\nblocks. In contrast, blocks in Steem are equally generated by witnesses while\nwitnesses are periodically elected by stakeholders with different voting power\nweighted by invested stake. We analyze the process of stake-weighted election\nof witnesses in DPoS and measure the actual stake invested by each stakeholder\nin Steem. We then compute the Shannon entropy of the distribution of\ncomputational power among miners in Bitcoin and the distribution of invested\nstake among stakeholders in Steem. Our analyses reveal that neither Bitcoin nor\nSteem is dominantly better than the other with respect to decentralization.\nCompared with Steem, Bitcoin tends to be more decentralized among top miners\nbut less decentralized in general. Our study is designed to provide insights\ninto the current state of the degree of decentralization in DPoS and PoW\nblockchains. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can\nfacilitate future studies of decentralization in other blockchain systems\nemploying different consensus protocols.",

This work proposes to\nutilize blockchain technology to realize a trusted and transparent\ndecentralized marketplace for contract compliance for trading IoT data streams\ngenerated by battery-operated IoT devices in real-time. The contribution of\nthis paper is two-fold: (1) we propose an autonomous blockchain-based\nmarketplace equipped with essential functionalities such as agreement\nframework, pricing model and rating mechanism to create an effective\nmarketplace framework without involving a mediator, (2) we propose a mechanism\nfor selection and allocation of buyers' demands on seller's devices under\nquality and battery constraints.

The basic idea is simple yet powerful: construct\na parallel chain -- sidechain -- with desired features, and provide a way to\ntransfer coins between the mainchain and the sidechain.\n  In this paper, we introduce Zendoo, a construction for Bitcoin-like\nblockchain systems that allows the creation and communication with sidechains\nof different types without knowing their internal structure. We consider a\nparent-child relationship between the mainchain and sidechains, where sidechain\nnodes directly observe the mainchain while mainchain nodes only observe\ncryptographically authenticated certificates from sidechain maintainers. We use\nzk-SNARKs to construct a universal verifiable transfer mechanism that is used\nby sidechains.\n  Moreover, we propose a specific sidechain construction, named Latus, that can\nbe built on top of this infrastructure, and realizes a decentralized verifiable\nblockchain system for payments. We leverage the use of recursive composition of\nzk-SNARKs to generate succinct proofs of sidechain state progression that are\nused to generate certificates' validity proofs.

In order to assess\nthe performance of blockchain under different network conditions, the simulator\nallows to define different network topologies, and integrates Linux kernel\ntraffic control (tc) tool to apply distinct delay or packet loss on the network\nnodes. Moreover, to validate the efficiency of our simulator we conduct a set\nof experiments and study the impact of the computation power and network delay\non the network's consistency in terms of number of forks and mining revenues.\nThe impact of applying different mining difficulty levels is also studied and\nthe block time as well as fork occurrences are evaluated. Furthermore, a\ncomprehensive survey and taxonomy of existing blockchain simulators are\nprovided along with a discussion justifying the need of new simulator.

The secondary users are introduced to opportunistically\naccess the licensed spectrum of idle operators (OPs). However, the identity\nprivacy and data security issues raise great concerns about the secure spectrum\nsharing among multi-OPs. To address these challenges, a consortium blockchain\ntrust framework is proposed for the spectrum sharing in multi-OPs wireless\ncommunication networks in this paper. A real consortium blockchain is\nconstructed among multi-OPs. The Multi-Ops Spectrum Sharing (MOSS) smart\ncontract is designed on the constructed consortium blockchain to implement the\nspectrum trading among multi-OPs. Without the need of trustless spectrum\nbroker, the MOSS smart contract enforces multi-OPs to share the spectrum\ntruthfully and designs a punishment mechanism to punish malicious OPs.\nSimulation results tested on the Remix integrated development environment (IDE)\nindicate the feasibility of the designed MOSS smart contract.

To address this,\nwe present the Geo-Scale Byzantine FaultTolerant consensus protocol (GeoBFT).\nGeoBFT is designed for excellent scalability by using a topological-aware\ngrouping of replicas in local clusters, by introducing parallelization of\nconsensus at the local level, and by minimizing communication between clusters.\nTo validate our vision of high-performance geo-scale resilient distributed\nsystems, we implement GeoBFT in our efficient ResilientDB permissioned\nblockchain fabric.

Recent proposals revisited committee-based BFT consensus to provide\ndeterministic finality: as soon as a block is validated, it is never revoked. A\ndistinguishing characteristic of these second-generation blockchains over\nclassical BFT protocols is that committees change over time as the\nparticipation and the blockchain state evolve. In this paper, we push forward\nin this direction by proposing a formalization of the Dynamic Repeated\nConsensus problem and by providing generic procedures to solve it in the\ncontext of blockchains. Our approach is modular in that one can plug in\ndifferent synchronizers and single-shot consensus instances. To offer a\ncomplete solution, we provide a concrete instantiation, called Tenderbake, and\npresent a blockchain synchronizer and a single-shot consensus algorithm,\nworking in a Byzantine and partially synchronous system model with eventually\nsynchronous clocks. In contrast to recent proposals, our methodology is driven\nby the need to bound the message buffers. This is essential in preventing\nspamming and run-time memory errors. Moreover, Tenderbake processes can\nsynchronize with each other without exchanging messages, leveraging instead the\ninformation stored in the blockchain.",

            "summary": "An increasing amount of users' sensitive information is now being collected\nfor analytics purposes. To protect users' privacy, differential privacy has\nbeen widely studied in the literature. Specifically, a differentially private\nalgorithm adds noise to the true answer of a query to generate a noisy\nresponse. As a result, the information about the dataset leaked by the noisy\noutput is bounded by the privacy parameter. Oftentimes, a dataset needs to be\nused for answering multiple queries (e.g., for multiple analytics tasks), so\nthe level of privacy protection may degrade as more queries are answered. Thus,\nit is crucial to keep track of the privacy spending which should not exceed the\ngiven privacy budget. Moreover, if a query has been answered before and is\nasked again on the same dataset, we may reuse the previous noisy response for\nthe current query to save the privacy cost. In view of the above, we design and\nimplement a blockchain-based system for tracking and saving\ndifferential-privacy cost. Blockchain provides a distributed immutable ledger\nthat records each query's type, the noisy response used to answer each query,\nthe associated noise level added to the true query result, and the remaining\nprivacy budget in our system. Furthermore, since the blockchain records the\nnoisy response used to answer each query, we also design an algorithm to reuse\nprevious noisy response if the same query is asked repeatedly. Specifically,\nconsidering that different requests of the same query may have different\nprivacy requirements, our algorithm (via a rigorous proof) is able to set the\noptimal reuse fraction of the old noisy response and add new noise (if\nnecessary) to minimize the accumulated privacy cost. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed algorithm can reduce the privacy cost significantly without\ncompromising data accuracy.",

In this paper, we focus on the network side of the BTC P2P network,\nanalyzing its nodes from a purely network measurements-based approach. We\npresent a BTC crawler able to discover and track the BTC P2P network through\nactive measurements, and use it to analyze its main properties. Through the\ncombined analysis of multiple snapshots of the BTC network as well as by using\nother publicly available data sources on the BTC network and DLT, we unveil the\nBTC P2P network, locate its active nodes, study their performance, and track\nthe evolution of the network over the past two years. Among other relevant\nfindings, we show that (i) the size of the BTC network has remained almost\nconstant during the last 12 months - since the major BTC price drop in early\n2018, (ii) most of the BTC P2P network resides in US and EU countries, and\n(iii) despite this western network locality, most of the mining activity and\ncorresponding revenue is controlled by major mining pools located in China. By\nadditionally analyzing the distribution of BTC coins among independent BTC\nentities (i.e., single BTC addresses or groups of BTC addresses controlled by\nthe same actor), we also conclude that (iv) BTC is very far from being the\ndecentralized and uncontrolled system it is so much advertised to be, with only\n4.5% of all the BTC entities holding about 85% of all circulating BTC coins.",

            "summary": "The growing size of modern datasets necessitates splitting a large scale\ncomputation into smaller computations and operate in a distributed manner.\nAdversaries in a distributed system deliberately send erroneous data in order\nto affect the computation for their benefit. Boolean functions are the key\ncomponents of many applications, e.g., verification functions in blockchain\nsystems and design of cryptographic algorithms. We consider the problem of\ncomputing a Boolean function in a distributed computing system with particular\nfocus on \\emph{security against Byzantine workers}. Any Boolean function can be\nmodeled as a multivariate polynomial with high degree in general. However, the\nsecurity threshold (i.e., the maximum number of adversarial workers can be\ntolerated such that the correct results can be obtained) provided by the recent\nproposed Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC) can be extremely low if the degree of\nthe polynomial is high. We propose three different schemes called \\emph{coded\nAlgebraic normal form (ANF)}, \\emph{coded Disjunctive normal form (DNF)} and\n\\emph{coded polynomial threshold function (PTF)}. The key idea of the proposed\nschemes is to model it as the concatenation of some low-degree polynomials and\nthreshold functions. In terms of the security threshold, we show that the\nproposed coded ANF and coded DNF are optimal by providing a matching outer\nbound.",

One is refined resilience analysis utilizing game theory to study\nthe consequences of selfish behaviors of users (miners), and the other is the\nextension from a linear (chain) structure to a non-linear (graphical) structure\nfor performance improvements, such as IOTA and Graphcoin. The first question\nthat comes to people's minds is what improvements that a blockchain system\nwould see by leveraging these new advances. In this paper, we consider three\nmajor metrics for a blockchain system: full verification, scalability, and\nfinality-duration. We { establish a formal framework and} prove that no\nblockchain system can achieve full verification, high scalability, and low\nfinality-duration simultaneously. We observe that classical blockchain systems\nlike Bitcoin achieves full verification and low finality-duration, Harmony and\nEthereum 2.0 achieve low finality-duration and high scalability.

Recent distributed ledger technologies\nhave replaced the blockchain linear structure with a more flexible directed\nacyclic graph in an attempt to accommodate a higher throughput. Despite the\nfast-growing diffusion of directed acyclic graph based distributed ledger\ntechnologies, researchers lack a basic understanding of their behavior. In this\npaper we analyze the Tangle, a directed acyclic graph that is used (with\ncertain modifications) in various protocols such as IOTA, Byteball, Avalanche\nor SPECTRE. Our contribution is threefold. First, we run simulations in a\ncontinuous-time model to examine tip count stability and cumulative weight\nevolution while varying the rate of incoming transactions. In particular we\nconfirm analytical predictions on the number of tips with uniform random tip\nselection strategy. Second, we show how different tip selection algorithms\naffect the growth of the Tangle. Moreover, we explain these differences by\nanalyzing the spread of exit probabilities of random walks. Our findings\nconfirm analytically derived predictions and provide novel insights on the\ndifferent phases of growth of cumulative weight as well as on the average time\ndifference for a transaction to receive its first approval when using distinct\ntip selection algorithms. Lastly, we analyze simulation overhead and\nperformance as a function of Tangle size and compare results for different tip\nselection algorithms.",

The blockchain is gaining a lot of\ninterest in these domains to secure the system by ignoring centralized\ndependencies, where proof-of-work (PoW) plays a vital role to make the whole\nsecurity solution decentralized. Due to the resource limitations of the\ndevices, PoW is not suitable for blockchain-based security solutions. This\npaper presents a novel consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Authentication\n(PoAh), which introduces a cryptographic authentication mechanism to replace\nPoW for resource constrained devices, and to make the blockchain\napplication-specific. PoAh is thus suitable for private as well as permissioned\nblockchains. Further, PoAh not only secures the systems, but also maintains\nsystem sustainability and scalability. The proposed consensus algorithm is\nevaluated theoretically in simulation scenarios, and in real-time hardware\ntestbeds to validate its performance.

            "summary": "Smart contracts have been increasingly used together with blockchains to\nautomate financial and business transactions. However, many bugs and\nvulnerabilities have been identified in many contracts which raises serious\nconcerns about smart contract security, not to mention that the blockchain\nsystems on which the smart contracts are built can be buggy. Thus, there is a\nsignificant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high\nreliability. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to learn\ncharacteristics of smart contracts in Solidity, which is useful for clone\ndetection, bug detection and contract validation on smart contracts. Our new\napproach is based on word embeddings and vector space comparison. We parse\nsmart contract code into word streams with code structural information, convert\ncode elements (e.g., statements, functions) into numerical vectors that are\nsupposed to encode the code syntax and semantics, and compare the similarities\namong the vectors encoding code and known bugs, to identify potential issues.\nWe have implemented the approach in a prototype, named SmartEmbed. Results show\nthat our tool can effectively identify many repetitive instances of Solidity\ncode, where the clone ratio is around 90\\%. Code clones such as type-III or\neven type-IV semantic clones can also be detected accurately. Our tool can\nidentify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases\nefficiently and accurately. Our tool can also help to efficiently validate any\ngiven smart contract against a known set of bugs, which can help to improve the\nusers' confidence in the reliability of the contract.\n  The anonymous replication packages can be accessed at:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1kauLT3y2IiHPkUlVx4FSTda-dVAyL4za/view?usp=sharing,\nand evaluated it with more than 22,000 smart contracts collected from the\nEthereum blockchain.",

It is considered\na technological breakthrough anticipated to disrupt several application\ndomains. This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various\npurposes. However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious\nshortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be\naddressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component\nof any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many\nways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the\nlimitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel\nconsensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these\nalgorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain\nperforms the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus\nalgorithms are not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on\nthe properties of the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain\nconsensus algorithms in terms of their scopes. This article fills this gap by\nanalysing a wide range of consensus algorithms using a comprehensive taxonomy\nof properties and by examining the implications of different issues still\nprevalent in consensus algorithms in detail. The result of the analysis is\npresented in tabular formats, which provides a visual illustration of these\nalgorithms in a meaningful way. We have also analysed more than hundred top\ncrypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus algorithms to\nunderstand their properties and to implicate different trends in these\ncrypto-currencies. Finally, we have presented a decision tree of algorithms to\nbe used as a tool to test the suitability of consensus algorithms under\ndifferent criteria.",

In this paper, we propose segment\nblockchain, an approach that segmentises blockchain and enables nodes to only\nstore a copy of one blockchain segment. We use \\emph{PoW} as a membership\nthreshold to limit the number of nodes taken by an Adversary---the Adversary\ncan only gain at most $n/2$ of nodes in a network of $n$ nodes when it has\n$50\\%$ of the calculation power in the system (the Nakamoto blockchain security\nthreshold). A segment blockchain system fails when an Adversary stores all\ncopies of a segment, because the Adversary can then leave the system, causing a\npermanent loss of the segment. We theoretically prove that segment blockchain\ncan sustain a $(AD/n)^m$ failure probability when the Adversary has no more\nthan $AD$ number of nodes and every segment is stored by $m$ number of nodes.\nThe storage requirement is mostly shrunken compared to the traditional design\nand therefore making the blockchain more suitable for data-heavy applications.",

Although blockchains have the\npotential to provide various services for high-performance computing (HPC)\nsystems, HPC will not be able to embrace blockchains before the following two\nmissing pieces become available: (i) new consensus protocols being aware of the\nshared-storage architecture in HPC, and (ii) new fault-tolerant mechanisms\ncompensating for HPC's programming model---the message passing interface\n(MPI)---that is vulnerable for blockchain-like workloads. To this end, we\ndesign a new set of consensus protocols crafted for the HPC platforms and a new\nfault-tolerance subsystem compensating for the failures caused by faulty MPI\nprocesses. Built on top of the new protocols and fault-tolerance mechanism, a\nprototype system is implemented and evaluated with two million transactions on\na 500-core HPC cluster, showing $6\\times$, $12\\times$, and $75\\times$ higher\nthroughput than Hyperldeger, Ethereum, and Parity, respectively.",

Off-chain wallets appear in different forms, from\npaper wallets to hardware wallets to dedicated wallet apps, while on-chain\nwallets are realized as smart contracts. Wallet contracts are supposed to\nincrease trust and security by being transparent and by offering features like\ndaily limits, approvals, multiple signatures, and recovery mechanisms. The most\nprominent platform for smart contracts in general and the token ecosystem im\nparticular, and thus also for wallet contracts is Ethereum. Our work aims at a\nbetter understanding of wallet contracts on Ethereum, since they are one of the\nmost frequently deployed smart contracts. By analyzing source code, bytecode,\nand execution traces, we derive usage scenarios and patterns. We discuss\nmethods for identifying wallet contracts in a semi-automatic manner by looking\nat the deployed bytecodes and the on-chain interaction patterns. We extract\nblueprints for wallets and compile a ground truth. Furthermore, we\ndifferentiate characteristics of wallets in use, and group them into six types.\nWe provide numbers and temporal perspectives regarding the creation and use of\nwallets.

As a result, they usually start off as favourites but\nquickly become the outcasts of the digital asset market.\n  The blockchain society attempts to anchor the value of cryptocurrency with\nreal values by employing smart contracts and link it with computation resources\nand the digital-productivity that have value and demands in the real world. But\ntheir attempts have some undesirable effects due to a limited number of\npractical applications. This limitation is caused by the dilemma between high\nperformance and decentralisation (universal joinability). The emerging of\nblockchain sharding models, however, has offered a possible solution to address\nthis dilemma.\n  In this paper, we explore a financial model for blockchain sharding that will\nbuild an active link between the value of cryptocurrency and computation\nresources as well as the market and labour behaviours. Our model can adjust the\nprice of resources and the compensation for maintaining a system based on those\nbehaviours. We anchor the value of cryptocurrency by the amount of computation\nresources participated in and give the cryptocurrency a meaning as the exchange\nbetween computation resources globally. Finally, we present a working example\nwhich, through financial regularities, regulates the behaviour of anonymous\nparticipants, also incents/discourages participation dynamically.",

This thesis work is concerned with designing trustworthy\nbusiness-to-business (B2B) market platforms drawing upon blockchain technology\nand game theory.\n  The proposed platform is built upon three key ideas. First, we use\npermissioned blockchains with smart contracts as a technically sound approach\nfor building the B2B platform. The blockchain deploys smart contracts that\ngovern the interactions of enterprise buyers and sellers. Second, the smart\ncontracts are designed using a rigorous analysis of a repeated game model of\nthe strategic interactions between buyers and sellers. We show that such smart\ncontracts induce honest behavior from buyers and sellers. Third, we embed\ncryptographic regulation protocols into the permissioned blockchain to ensure\nthat business sensitive information is not revealed to the competitors. We\nbelieve our work is an important step in the direction of building a powerful\nB2B platform that maximizes social welfare and enables trusted collaboration\nbetween strategic enterprise agents.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system proposed by Nakamoto in 2008. Based\non the Nakamoto consensus, Bagaria, Kannan, Tse, Fanti, and Viswanath proposed\nthe Prism protocol in 2018 and showed that it achieves near-optimal blockchain\nthroughput while maintaining a similar level of security as bitcoin. Previous\nprobabilistic security guarantees for the bitcoin and Prism backbone protocols\nwere either established under a simplified discrete-time model or expressed in\nterms of exponential order results. This paper presents a streamlined and\nstrengthened analysis under a more realistic continuous-time model. A fully\nrigorous model for blockchains is developed with no restrictions on adversarial\nminers except for an upper bound on their aggregate mining rate. The only\nassumption on the peer-to-peer network is that all block propagation delays are\nupper bounded by a constant. A new notion of \"t-credible blockchains\" is\nintroduced, which, together with some carefully defined \"typical\" events\nconcerning block production over time intervals, is crucial to establish\nprobabilisitic security guarantees in continuous time. A blockchain growth\ntheorem, a blockchain quality theorem, and a common prefix theorem are\nestablished with explicit probability bounds. Moreover, under a certain typical\nevent which occurs with probability close to $1$, a valid transaction that is\ndeep enough in one credible blockchain is shown to be permanent in the sense\nthat it must be found in} in all future credible blockchains.",

            "summary": "Insurance is one of the fundamental services offered to the citizens to\nreduce their costs and assist them in case of an emergency. One of the most\nimportant challenges in the insurance industry is to address liability\nchallenge and the forging of documents by the involved parties, i.e., insurance\ncompany or the users, in order to increase financial gain. Conventional methods\nto address this challenge is significantly time consuming and costly and also\nsuffers from lock of transparency. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based\nsolution for the insurance industry in smart cities (BIS). BIS creates a big\numbrella that consists of the smart city managers, insurance companies, users,\nand sensors and devices. The users are known by changeable Public Keys (PKs)\nthat introduces a level of anonymity. The data collected by the sensors is\nstored in cloud or local storage and is shared with insurance company on demand\nto find the liable party that in turn increases the privacy of the users. BIS\nenables the users to prove and share the history of their insurances with other\nusers or insurances. Using Proof of Concept (POC) implementation we\ndemonstrated the applicability of blockchain in insurance industry. The\nimplementation results prove that BIS significantly reduces delay involved in\ninsurance industry as compared with conventional insurance methods.",

            "summary": "Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain systems that supports more\nthan half a million transactions every day and fosters miscellaneous\ndecentralized applications with its Turing-complete smart contract machine.\nWhereas it remains mysterious what the transaction pattern of Ethereum is and\nhow it evolves over time. In this paper, we study the evolutionary behavior of\nEthereum transactions from a temporal graph point of view. We first develop a\ndata analytics platform to collect external transactions associated with users\nas well as internal transactions initiated by smart contracts. Three types of\ntemporal graphs, user-to-user, contract-to-contract and user-contract graphs,\nare constructed according to trading relationship and are segmented with an\nappropriate time window. We observe a strong correlation between the size of\nuser-to-user transaction graph and the average Ether price in a time window,\nwhile no evidence of such linkage is shown at the average degree, average edge\nweights and average triplet closure duration. The macroscopic and microscopic\nburstiness of Ethereum transactions is validated. We analyze the Gini indexes\nof the transaction graphs and the user wealth in which Ethereum is found to be\nvery unfair since the very beginning, in a sense, \"the rich is already very\nrich\".",

The system must maintain a\nlarge Shard size (the number of nodes inside a Shard) to sustain the low\nfailure probability so that only a small number of Shards may exist. In this\npaper, we present a new approach of Blockchain Sharding that can withstand up\nto n/2 of nodes being bad. We categorise the nodes into different classes, and\nevery Shard has a fixed number of nodes from different classes. We prove that\nthis design is much more secure than the traditional models (only have one\nclass) and the Shard size can be reduced significantly. In this way, many more\nShards can exist, and the transaction throughput can be largely increased. The\nimproved Blockchain Sharding approach is promising to serve as the foundation\nfor decentralised autonomous organisations and decentralised database.",

We present an asymptotically optimal consistency analysis assuming\nthat an honest round is more likely than an adversarial round (i.e., $\\Pr[S] +\n\\Pr[M] > \\Pr[A]$); this threshold is optimal. This is a first in the literature\nand can be applied to both the simple synchronous communication as well as\ncommunication with bounded delays.\n  In all existing consistency analyses, event $M$ is either penalized or\ntreated neutrally. Specifically, the consistency analyses in Ouroboros Praos\n(Eurocrypt 2018) and Genesis (CCS 2018) assume that $\\Pr[S] - \\Pr[M] > \\Pr[A]$;\nthe analyses in Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017) and Snow White (Fin. Crypto\n2019) assume that $\\Pr[S] > \\Pr[A]$. Moreover, all existing analyses completely\nbreak down when $\\Pr[S] < \\Pr[A]$. These thresholds determine the critical\ntrade-off between the honest majority, network delays, and consistency error.\n  Our new results can be directly applied to improve the security guarantees of\nthe existing protocols. We also provide an efficient algorithm to explicitly\ncalculate these error probabilities in the synchronous setting. Furthermore, we\ncomplement these results by analyzing the setting where $S$ is rare, even\nallowing $\\Pr[S] = 0$, under the added assumption that honest players adopt a\nconsistent chain selection rule.",

Its decoupling idea has\ninspired a new generation of high-performance blockchain protocols. However,\nthe existing incentive analysis of Bitcoin-NG has several limitations. First,\nthe impact of network capacity is ignored. Second, an integrated incentive\nanalysis that jointly considers both key blocks and microblocks is still\nmissing.\n  In this paper, we aim to address these two limitations. First, we propose a\nnew incentive analysis that takes the network capacity into account, showing\nthat Bitcoin-NG can still maintain incentive compatibility against the\nmicroblock mining attack even under limited network capacity. Second, we\nleverage a Markov decision process (MDP) to jointly analyze the incentive of\nboth key blocks and microblocks, showing that the selfish mining revenue of\nBitcoin-NG is a little higher than that in Bitcoin only when the selfish miner\ncontrols more than 35\\% of the mining power.

Depending on\nthe query type and the data size, the run time difference between blockchain\nbased query-response and SQLite based query-response ranged from 0.2 seconds to\n6 seconds. A deeper inspection revealed that range queries were the bottleneck\nof our solution which, nevertheless, scales up linearly.

As\nauspicious as this approach is, it brings forth many challenges: from data\nsecurity to time latency issues with data computation as well as delivery to\nend users. Fog computing has emerged as an extension for cloud computing to\nbring data processing and storage close to end-users; however, it minimizes the\ntime latency issue but still suffers from data security challenges. For\ninstance, when a fog node providing services to end users is compromised, the\nusers' data security can be violated. Thus, this paper proposes a secure and\nfine-grained data access control scheme by integrating the CP-ABE algorithm and\nblockchain concept to prevent fog nodes from violating end users' data security\nin a situation where a compromised fog node is being ousted. We also classify\nthe fog nodes into fog federations, based on their attributes such as services\nand locations, to minimize the time latency and communication overhead between\nfog nodes and cloud server. Further, the exploitation and integration of the\nblockchain concept and the CP-ABE algorithm enables fog nodes in the same fog\nfederation to perform the authorization process in a distributed manner. In\naddition, to solve time latency and communication overhead problems, we equip\nevery fog node with an off-chain database to store most frequently accessed\ndata files for specific time, and with an on-chain access control policies\ntable (On-chain Files Tracking Table) which must be protected from being\ntampered by malicious (rogue) fog nodes. Therefore, blockchain plays a vital\nrole here as it is tamper-proof by nature. We demonstrate our scheme's\nefficiency and feasibility by designing algorithms and conducting a security\nanalysis. The provided analysis shows that the proposed scheme is efficient and\nfeasible in ousting malicious (rogue) fog nodes.",

Traditional ways to ensure the security of a smart contract,\nincluding DSLs, auditing and static analysis, are used before the code is\ndeployed to the blockchain, and thus offer no protection after the deployment.\nAfter each upgrade the whole code need to be verified again, which is a\ndifficult and time-consuming process that is prone to errors. To address these\nissues a security protocol and framework for smart contracts called Cap9 was\ndeveloped. It provides developers the ability to perform upgrades in a secure\nand robust manner, and improves isolation and transparency through the use of a\nlow level capability-based security model.

Machine Learning of our features on the simulated blockchain shows\nthat the technique can be used to aide in identifying individuals and groups,\nalthough it did not successfully reveal the hidden transaction values. We apply\nthe technique on the real Monero blockchain to identify ShapeShift\ntransactions, a cryptocurrency exchange that has leaked information through\ntheir API providing labels for themselves and their users.",

This paper attempts to lay out a\ntheoretical foundation for a specific type of blockchains---the ones requiring\nbasic authenticity from the participants, also called \\textit{permissioned\nblockchain}. We formulate permissioned blockchain systems and operations into a\ngame-theoretical problem by incorporating constraints implied by the wisdom\nfrom distributed computing and Byzantine systems. We show that in a\nnoncooperative blockchain game (NBG), a Nash equilibrium can be efficiently\nfound in a closed-form even though the game involves more than two players.\nSomewhat surprisingly, the simulation results of the Nash equilibrium implies\nthat the game can reach a stable status regardless of the number of Byzantine\nnodes and trustworthy players. We then study a harder problem where players are\nallowed to form coalitions: the coalitional blockchain game (CBG). We show that\nalthough the Shapley value for a CBG can be expressed in a more succinct form,\nits core is empty.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we develop a new framework called blockchain-based Radio\nFrequency (RF)-powered backscatter cognitive radio network. In the framework,\nIoT devices as secondary transmitters transmit their sensing data to a\nsecondary gateway by using the RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio\ntechnology. The data collected at the gateway is then sent to a blockchain\nnetwork for further verification, storage and processing. As such, the\nframework enables the IoT system to simultaneously optimize the spectrum usage\nand maximize the energy efficiency. Moreover, the framework ensures that the\ndata collected from the IoT devices is verified, stored and processed in a\ndecentralized but in a trusted manner. To achieve the goal, we formulate a\nstochastic optimization problem for the gateway under the dynamics of the\nprimary channel, the uncertainty of the IoT devices, and the unpredictability\nof the blockchain environment. In the problem, the gateway jointly decides (i)\nthe time scheduling, i.e., the energy harvesting time, backscatter time, and\ntransmission time, among the IoT devices, (ii) the blockchain network, and\n(iii) the transaction fee rate to maximize the network throughput while\nminimizing the cost. To solve the stochastic optimization problem, we then\npropose to employ, evaluate, and assess the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nwith Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (D3QN) to derive the optimal policy for the\ngateway. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed solution\noutperforms the conventional baseline approaches such as the conventional\nQ-Learning algorithm and non-learning algorithms in terms of network throughput\nand convergence speed. Furthermore, the proposed solution guarantees that the\ndata is stored in the blockchain network at a reasonable cost.",

Through analysis of bitcoin subgraphs or\nchainlets, the PDE model captures the influence of transaction patterns on\nbitcoin price over time and combines the effect of all chainlet clusters. In\naddition, Google Trends Index is incorporated to the PDE model to reflect the\neffect of bitcoin market sentiment. The experiment shows that the average\naccuracy of daily bitcoin price prediction is 0.82 for 362 consecutive days in\n2017.

We use the\nlabelled traces to train a neural network (NN) model to learn to distinguish\nruntime patterns for passing versus failing executions for a given program. Our\napproach for building this NN model involves the following steps, 1. Instrument\nthe program to record execution traces as sequences of method invocations and\nglobal state, 2. Label a small fraction of the execution traces with their\nverdicts, 3. Designing a NN component that embeds information in execution\ntraces to fixed length vectors, 4. Design a NN model that uses the trace\ninformation for classification, 5. Evaluate the inferred classification model\non unseen execution traces from the program.\n  We evaluate our approach using case studies from different application\ndomains: 1.

However, a\nlong-standing bottleneck hindering its further development is the massive\nresource consumption attributed to the distributed storage and computation\nmethods. This makes blockchain suffer from insufficient performance and poor\nscalability. Here, we analyze the recent blockchain techniques and demonstrate\nthat the potential of widely-adopted consensus-based scaling is seriously\nlimited, especially in the current era when Moore's law-based hardware scaling\nis about to end. We achieve this by developing an open-source benchmarking\ntool, called Prism, for investigating the key factors causing low resource\nefficiency and then discuss various topology and hardware innovations which\ncould help to scale up blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst in-depth study that explores the next-generation scaling strategies by\nconducting large-scale and comprehensive benchmarking.",

However, adopting BC to IoT is not straightforward in\nmost cases, due to overheads and delays caused by BC operations. In this paper,\nwe apply a BC technology known as Hyperledgder Fabric, to an IoT network. This\ntechnology introduces an execute-order technique for transactions that\nseparates the transaction execution from consensus, resulting in increased\nefficiency. We demonstrate that our proposed IoT-BC architecture is\nsufficiently secure with regard to fundamental security goals i.e.,\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability.

            "summary": "Permissionless blockchains offer many advantages but also have significant\nlimitations including high latency. This prevents their use in important\nscenarios such as retail payments, where merchants should approve payments\nfast. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this problem by moving\ntransactions off the chain. However, such Layer-2 solutions have their own\nproblems: payment channels require a separate deposit towards each merchant and\nthus significant locked-in funds from customers; payment hubs require very\nlarge operator deposits that depend on the number of customers; and side-chains\nrequire trusted validators.\n  In this paper, we propose Snappy, a novel solution that enables recipients,\nlike merchants, to safely accept fast payments. In Snappy, all payments are on\nthe chain, while small customer collaterals and moderate merchant collaterals\nact as payment guarantees. Besides receiving payments, merchants also act as\nstatekeepers who collectively track and approve incoming payments using\nmajority voting. In case of a double-spending attack, the victim merchant can\nrecover lost funds either from the collateral of the malicious customer or a\ncolluding statekeeper (merchant). Snappy overcomes the main problems of\nprevious solutions: a single customer collateral can be used to shop with many\nmerchants; merchant collaterals are independent of the number of customers; and\nvalidators do not have to be trusted. Our Ethereum prototype shows that safe,\nfast (<2 seconds) and cheap payments are possible on existing blockchains.",

This paper proposes a new distributed commit protocol,\nnamely \\textit{cross-blockchain transaction} (CBT), for conducting transactions\nacross an arbitrary number of blockchains without any centralized component.\nThe key idea of CBT is to extend the two-phase commit protocol with a heartbeat\nmechanism to ensure the liveness of CBT without introducing additional nodes or\nblockchains. We have implemented CBT and compared it to the state-of-the-art\nprotocols, demonstrating CBT's low overhead (3.6\\% between two blockchains,\nless than $1\\%$ among 32 or more blockchains) and high scalability (linear\nscalability on up to 64-blockchain transactions).

A sobering outlook\nis crucial because misleading concepts may bury the whole idea of blockchain\nuse. The paper aims to research the possibilities of blockchain and other\ndistributed ledger technologies (DLT) and applicability of these technologies\nfor different purposes in real estate, property rights and public registries.\nBlockchain, which is distinguished from permissioned systems as the technology\nof the immutable ledger that does not require authorities, is a new word in\ngovernance. However, this technology has some principal features that can\nrestrain its implementation at the state level, and thus require further\nresearch and development. The application of blockchain requires a proper\narchitecture of overlaid technologies to support changes of outdated and\nmistaken data, address issues of digital identity and privacy, legal compliance\nand enforceability of smart contracts and scalability of the ledger. This paper\nshows the constraints of the technology's properties which were not explained\nbefore in the context of title rights and land registration even though\ntechnological limits are known in more specific technical sources. Along with\nthe known benefits this meant to help to avoid misinterpretation of some DLT\nfeatures by non-technical people. A multidisciplinary approach in analysing the\ntechnology and laws helped to better understand what can and cannot be\nbeneficial for public registries and the protection of property rights. The\npresented outcomes can be laid down as requirements for the technical protocols\naimed at addressing the issues of DLT and public policies to put blockchain at\nthe service of society.",

The wide\nspread of disinformation and fake news can cause detrimental societal effects.\nDespite the recent progress in detecting disinformation and fake news, it is\nstill non-trivial due to its complexity, diversity, multi-modality, and costs\nof fact-checking or annotation. The goal of this chapter is to pave the way for\nappreciating the challenges and advancements via: (1) introducing the types of\ninformation disorder on social media and examine their differences and\nconnections; (2) describing important and emerging tasks to combat\ndisinformation for characterization, detection and attribution; and (3)\ndiscussing a weak supervision approach to detect disinformation with limited\nlabeled data. We then provide an overview of the chapters in this book that\nrepresent the recent advancements in three related parts: (1) user engagements\nin the dissemination of information disorder; (2) techniques on detecting and\nmitigating disinformation; and (3) trending issues such as ethics, blockchain,\nclickbaits, etc. We hope this book to be a convenient entry point for\nresearchers, practitioners, and students to understand the problems and\nchallenges, learn state-of-the-art solutions for their specific needs, and\nquickly identify new research problems in their domains.",

            "summary": "Although blockchains aim for immutability as their core feature, several\ninstances have exposed the harms with perfect immutability. The permanence of\nillicit content inserted in Bitcoin poses a challenge to law enforcement\nagencies like Interpol, and millions of dollars are lost in buggy smart\ncontracts in Ethereum. A line of research then spawned on Redactable\nblockchains with the aim of solving the problem of redacting illicit contents\nfrom both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. However, all the\nexisting proposals follow the build-new-chain approach for redactions, and\ncannot be integrated with existing systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n  We present Reparo, a generic protocol that acts as a publicly verifiable\nlayer on top of any blockchain to perform repairs, ranging from fixing buggy\ncontracts to removing illicit contents from the chain. Reparo facilitates\nadditional functionalities for blockchains while maintaining the same provable\nsecurity guarantee; thus, Reparo can be integrated with existing blockchains\nand start performing repairs on the pre-existent data. Any system user may\npropose a repair and a deliberation process ensues resulting in a decision that\ncomplies with the repair policy of the chain and is publicly verifiable.\n  Our Reparo layer can be easily tailored to different consensus requirements,\ndoes not require heavy cryptographic machinery and can, therefore, be\nefficiently instantiated in any permission-ed or -less setting. We demonstrate\nit by giving efficient instantiations of Reparo on top of Ethereum (with PoS\nand PoW), Bitcoin, and Cardano. Moreover, we evaluate Reparo with Ethereum\nmainnet and show that the cost of fixing several prominent smart contract bugs\nis almost negligible. For instance, the cost of repairing the prominent Parity\nMultisig wallet bug with Reparo is as low as 0.000000018% of the Ethers that\ncan be retrieved after the fix.",

            "summary": "Proof of work (PoW), the most popular consensus mechanism for Blockchain,\nrequires ridiculously large amounts of energy but without any useful outcome\nbeyond determining accounting rights among miners. To tackle the drawback of\nPoW, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus algorithm, namely proof of\nfederated learning (PoFL), where the energy originally wasted to solve\ndifficult but meaningless puzzles in PoW is reinvested to federated learning.\nFederated learning and pooled-ming, a trend of PoW, have a natural fit in terms\nof organization structure. However, the separation between the data usufruct\nand ownership in Blockchain lead to data privacy leakage in model training and\nverification, deviating from the original intention of federal learning. To\naddress the challenge, a reverse game-based data trading mechanism and a\nprivacy-preserving model verification mechanism are proposed. The former can\nguard against training data leakage while the latter verifies the accuracy of a\ntrained model with privacy preservation of the task requester's test data as\nwell as the pool's submitted model.

            "summary": "Though voting-based consensus algorithms in Blockchain outperform proof-based\nones in energy- and transaction-efficiency, they are prone to incur wrong\nelections and bribery elections. The former originates from the uncertainties\nof candidates' capability and availability; and the latter comes from the\negoism of voters and candidates. Hence, in this paper, we propose an\nuncertainty- and collusion-proof voting consensus mechanism, including the\nselection pressure-based voting consensus algorithm and the trustworthiness\nevaluation algorithm. The first algorithm can decrease the side effects of\ncandidates' uncertainties, lowering wrong elections while trading off the\nbalance between efficiency and fairness in electing miners. The second\nalgorithm adopts an incentive compatible scoring rule to evaluate the\ntrustworthiness of voting, motivating voters to report true beliefs on\ncandidates by making egoism in consistent with altruism so as to avoid bribery\nelections. A salient feature of our work is theoretically analyzing the\nproposed voting consensus mechanism by the large deviation theory. Our analysis\nprovides not only the voting failure rate of a candidate but also its decay\nspeed, based on which the concepts of {\\it the effective selection valve} and\n{\\it the effective expectation of merit} are introduced to help the system\ndesigner to determine the optimal voting standard and guide a candidate to\nbehave in an optimal way for lowering the voting failure rate.",

In this study, we\napply the zero-determinant (ZD) theory to design a novel pooled mining which\noffers an incentive mechanism for motivating non-memorial and memorial\nevolutionary miners not to switch in pools strategically. In short, our\nhopping-proof pooled mining has three unique features: 1) fee-free. No fee is\ncharged if the miner does not hop. 2) wide applicability. It can be employed in\nboth prepaid and postpaid mechanisms. 3) fairness. Even the pool can dominate\nthe game with any miner, he has to cooperate when the miner does not hop among\npools. The fairness of our scheme makes it have long-term sustainability.

As enterprises begin to\nadopt blockchain technology to solve business problems, there are valid\nconcerns if blockchain applications can support the transactional demands of\nproduction systems. In fact, the multiple distributed components and protocols\nthat underlie blockchain applications makes performance optimization a\nnon-trivial task. Blockchain performance optimization and scalability require a\nmethodology to reduce complexity and cost. Furthermore, existing performance\nresults often lack the requirements, load, and infrastructure of a production\napplication. In this paper, we first develop a methodical approach to\nperformance tuning enterprise blockchain applications to increase performance\nand transaction capacity. The methodology is applied to an enterprise\nblockchain-based application (leveraging Hyperledger Fabric) for performance\ntuning and optimization with the goal of bridging the gap between laboratory\nand production deployed system performance. We then present extensive results\nand analysis of our performance testing for on-premise and cloud deployments,\nin which we were able to scale the application from 30 to 3000 TPS without\nforking the Hyperledger Fabric source code and maintaining a reasonable\ninfrastructure footprint. We also provide blockchain application and platform\nrecommendations for performance improvement.",

            "summary": "While various covert botnets were proposed in the past, they still lack\ncomplete anonymization for their servers/botmasters or suffer from slow\ncommunication between the botmaster and the bots. In this paper, we propose a\nnew generation hybrid botnet that covertly and efficiently communicates over\nBitcoin Lightning Network (LN), called LNBot. LN is a payment channel network\noperating on top of Bitcoin network for faster Bitcoin transactions with\nnegligible fees. Exploiting various anonymity features of LN, we designed a\nscalable two-layer botnet which completely anonymize the identity of the\nbotmaster. In the first layer, the botmaster sends commands anonymously to the\nC&C servers through LN transactions. Specifically, LNBot allows botmaster's\ncommands to be sent in the form of surreptitious multihop LN payments, where\nthe commands are encoded with ASCII or Huffman encoding to provide covert\ncommunications. In the second layer, C&C servers further relay those commands\nto the bots they control in their mini-botnets to launch any type of attacks to\nvictim machines. We implemented a proof-of-concept on the actual LN and\nextensively analyzed the delay and cost performance of LNBot. Our analysis show\nthat LNBot achieves better scalibility compared to the other similar blockchain\nbotnets with negligible costs. Finally, we also provide and discuss a list of\npotential countermeasures to detect LNBot activities and minimize its impacts.",

Recently, blockchain technology has\nreceived a lot of attention from the community as a possible solution to\novercome security issues in IoT. However, traditional blockchains (such as the\nones used in Bitcoin and Ethereum) are not well suited to the\nresource-constrained nature of IoT devices and also with the large volume of\ninformation that is expected to be generated from typical IoT deployments. To\novercome these issues, several researchers have presented lightweight instances\nof blockchains tailored for IoT. For example, proposing novel data structures\nbased on blocks with decoupled and appendable data. However, these researchers\ndid not discuss how the consensus algorithm would impact their solutions, i.e.,\nthe decision of which consensus algorithm would be better suited was left as an\nopen issue. In this paper, we improved an appendable-block blockchain framework\nto support different consensus algorithms through a modular design. We\nevaluated the performance of this improved version in different emulated\nscenarios and studied the impact of varying the number of devices and\ntransactions and employing different consensus algorithms. Even adopting\ndifferent consensus algorithms, results indicate that the latency to append a\nnew block is less than 161ms (in the more demanding scenario) and the delay for\nprocessing a new transaction is less than 7ms, suggesting that our improved\nversion of the appendable-block blockchain is efficient and scalable, and thus\nwell suited for IoT scenarios.",

            "summary": "Byzantine State Machine Replication (SMR) is a long studied topic that\nreceived increasing attention recently with the advent of blockchains as\ncompanies are trying to scale them to hundreds of nodes. Byzantine SMRs try to\nincrease throughput by either reducing the latency of consensus instances that\nthey run sequentially or by reducing the number of replicas that send messages\nto others in order to reduce the network usage. Unfortunately, the former\napproach makes use of resources in burst whereas the latter requires\nCPU-intensive authentication mechanisms.\n  In this paper, we propose a new Byzantine SMR called Dispel (Distributed\nPipeline) that allows any node to distributively start new consensus instances\nwhenever they detect sufficient resources locally. We evaluate the performance\nof Dispel within a single datacenter and across up to 380 machines over 3\ncontinents by comparing it against four other SMRs. On 128 nodes, Dispel speeds\nup HotStuff, the Byzantine fault tolerant SMR being integrated within\nFacebook's blockchain, by more than 12 times. In addition, we also test Dispel\nunder isolated and correlated failures and show that the Dispel distributed\ndesign is more robust than HotStuff. Finally, we evaluate Dispel in a\ncryptocurrency application with Bitcoin transactions and show that this SMR is\nnot the bottleneck.",

It is the underlying technology for the Bitcoin\ncryptocurrency, but there are many applications beyond the financial sector.\nWith built-in security and removal of the need for third party trust,\nblockchain has started to see some use within contract applications among other\nthings. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a\npermissioned-based blockchain third party consent management system, whose\npolicy can be decided by a government agency. We have constructed a proof of\nconcept implementation using Hyperledger Fabric to provide a service that\nallows end-users to control and consent to who manages their private\ninformation. We believe our solution meets the guiding principles of EU General\nData Protection Regulation or GDPR. While our performance and usability\nevaluation are limited, our solution design and its implementation meet the 7\nfoundational principles of privacy by design.",

However, few are discussed about incentive methods to attract new\nusers, as well as to motivate the system or application usage by existing\nend-users. Also, little is discussed about performance during code execution in\nblockchains. In order to tackle these issues, this work presents the\npreliminary evaluation of TokenHealth, an application for collaborative health\npractice monitoring with gamification and token-based incentives. The proposed\nsolution is implemented through smart contracts using Solidity in the Ethereum\nblockchain. We evaluated the performance of both in Ropsten test network and in\na Private instance. The preliminary results show that the execution of smart\ncontracts takes less than a minute for a full cycle of different smart\ncontracts.

More recently, the Blockchain\nand the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more\nand more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications.\nSome people have come to the point of saying that the \"Blockchain revolution\"\ncan be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a\nresult, all software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is\ngrowing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such\nhuge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried\nsoftware development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis\nwhich does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of\nsoftware engineering are taken into account. This paper tries to cope with this\nissue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement,\nanalyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process\nis based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and\nincremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more\nformal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the\nsystem, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain\ndevelopment. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to\nshow how it works.",

Bitcoin is the largest\ncryptocurrency worldwide and a phenomenon that challenges the underpinnings of\ntraditional financial systems - its users can send money pseudo-anonymously\nwhile circumventing traditional banking systems. Yet, despite the fact that all\nfinancial transactions in Bitcoin are available in an openly accessible online\nledger - the blockchain - not much is known about how different types of actors\nin the network (we call them entities) actually use Bitcoin. BitConduite offers\nan entity-centered view on transactions, making the data accessible to\nnon-technical experts through a guided workflow for classification of entities\naccording to several activity metrics. Other novelties are the possibility to\ncluster entities by similarity and exploration of transaction data at different\nscales, from large groups of entities down to a single entity and the\nassociated transactions. Two use cases illustrate the workflow of the system\nand its analytic power. We report on feedback regarding the approach and the\nthe software tool gathered during a workshop with domain experts, and we\ndiscuss the potential of the approach based on our findings.",

SilentDelivery employs a novel combination of threshold\nsecret sharing and decentralized smart contracts. The protocol maintains shares\nof the decryption key of the private information of an information sender using\na group of mailmen recruited in a blockchain network before the specified\nfuture time-frame and restores the information to the information recipient at\nthe required time-frame. To tackle the key challenges that limit the security\nand scalability of the protocol, SilentDelivery incorporates two novel\ncountermeasure strategies. The first strategy, namely silent recruitment,\nenables a mailman to get recruited by a sender silently without the knowledge\nof any third party. The second strategy, namely dual-mode execution, makes the\nprotocol run in a lightweight mode by default, where the cost of running smart\ncontracts is significantly reduced. We rigorously analyze the security of\nSilentDelivery and implement the protocol over the Ethereum official test\nnetwork. The results demonstrate that SilentDelivery is more secure and\nscalable compared to the state of the art and reduces the cost of running smart\ncontracts by 85%.",

            "summary": "Proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency blockchains like Bitcoin secure vast\namounts of money. Their operators, called miners, expend resources to generate\nblocks and receive monetary rewards for their effort. Blockchains are, in\nprinciple, attractive targets for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks: There is\nfierce competition among coins, as well as potential gains from short selling.\nClassical DoS attacks, however, typically target a few servers and cannot scale\nto systems with many nodes. There have been no successful DoS attacks to date\nagainst prominent cryptocurrencies. We present Blockchain DoS (BDoS), the first\nincentive-based DoS attack that targets PoW cryptocurrencies. Unlike classical\nDoS, BDoS targets the system's mechanism design: It exploits the reward\nmechanism to discourage miner participation. Previous DoS attacks against PoW\nblockchains require an adversary's mining power to match that of all other\nminers. In contrast, BDoS can cause a blockchain to grind to a halt with\nsignificantly fewer resources, e.g., 21% as of March 2020 in Bitcoin, according\nto our empirical study. We find that Bitcoin's vulnerability to BDoS increases\nrapidly as the mining industry matures and profitability drops. BDoS differs\nfrom known attacks like Selfish Mining in its aim not to increase an\nadversary's revenue, but to disrupt the system. Although it bears some\nalgorithmic similarity to those attacks, it introduces a new adversarial model,\ngoals, algorithm, and game-theoretic analysis. Beyond its direct implications\nfor operational blockchains, BDoS introduces the novel idea that an adversary\ncan manipulate miners' incentives by proving the existence of blocks without\nactually publishing them.",

            "summary": "While sharing files in a peer-to-peer (P2P) system significantly increases\nboth the speed of retrieving the contents and the robustness of the system,\ntracing the access of files is not straightforward, even in the case of private\nP2P networks. In fact, a participant that has uploaded a file to a P2P network\nis not necessarily involved in its download. Additionally, due to the nature of\nthe P2P network it is possible for a participant to already have all the\nfragments of a file, even before requesting it.\n  This work tries to address the problem of tracing file access in a private\nP2P file sharing network through the use of blockchains to improve quality of\nservice and auditability. To this end, the proposed solution combines three\nelements: (1) A distributed hash table network that is used to distribute\nencrypted files with redundancy amongst the partner peers; (2) Shamir's secret\nsharing scheme to split the secret keys of each file; (3) A blockchain network\nto distribute and manage the secret shares amongst the partner peers. In fact,\nthe latter makes access to a file undeniable to every node of the network.\n  The solution is relevant for consortia that manage a shared data pool on base\nof P2P technology with unrestricted access to files but where access to a file\nhas to be recorded due to legal or billing reasons.",

            "summary": "Recently, blockchain has gained momentum in the academic community thanks to\nits decentralization, immutability, transparency and security. As an emerging\nparadigm, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has been widely used to provide\ncomputation and storage resources to mobile user equipments (UE) at the edge of\nthe network for improving the performance of mobile applications. In this\npaper, we propose a novel blockchain-based MEC architecture where UEs can\noffload their computation tasks to the MEC servers. In particular, a blockchain\nnetwork is deployed and hosted on the MEC platform as Blockchain as a Service\n(BaaS) that supports smart contract-based resource trading and transaction\nmining services for mobile task offloading. To enhance the performance of the\nblockchain-empowered MEC system, we propose a joint scheme of computation\noffloading and blockchain mining. Accordingly, an optimization problem is\nformulated to maximize edge service revenue and blockchain mining reward while\nminimizing the service computation latency with respect to constraints of user\nservice demands and hash power resource. We then propose a novel Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) approach using a double deep Q-network (DQN)\nalgorithm to solve the proposed problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nproposed scheme outperforms the other baseline methods in terms of better\nsystem utility with computational efficiency. Experiment results also verify\nthat the trading contract design is efficient with low operation cost, showing\nthe feasibility of the proposed scheme.",

Legacy credential verification systems are typically\ntime-consuming, costly, and bureaucratic, and struggle against certain classes\nof credential fraud. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive blockchain-based\ncredential verification solution, Cerberus, which is considerably more\nefficient, easy and intuitive to use, and effectively mitigates widespread\nmanifestations of credential fraud. Cerberus also improves significantly upon\nother blockchain-based solutions in the research literature: it adheres closely\nto the existing credential verification ecosystem, it addresses a threat model\ninformed by real-world fraud scenarios. Moreover, Cerberus uses on-chain smart\ncontracts for credential revocation, and it does not entail students or\nemployers to manage digital identities or cryptographic credentials to use the\nsystem. We prototype our solution and describe our attempt to design an online\nverification service with a rich feature set, including data privacy,\ntranscript verification, and selective disclosure of data.

We based our study\non user evaluation of a prototype of a blockchain-based research data sharing\nframework using a TAM validated questionnaire. Our results show that, overall,\nall the individual constructs of the behavior model significantly influence the\nintention to use the system while their collective effect is found to be\ninsignificant.

Novel to this work were mechanisms by which the issuing\nentity could manage the cryptocurrency but where their power was limited and\ntransparency was enforced by the cryptocurrency being implemented using a\npublicly mined blockchain. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of this\ntheoretical model by implementing such a managed cryptocurrency architecture\nthrough forking the Bitcoin code base. We discovered that the theoretical model\ncontains several vulnerabilities and security issues that needed to be\nmitigated. It also contains architectural features that presented significant\nimplementation challenges; some aspects of the proposed changes to the Bitcoin\nspecification were not practical or even workable.

It has similarities to cash in that it enables the general public\nto immediately transfer funds to a recipient without intermediary systems being\ninvolved. However, our system is account-based, unlike circulating bank notes\nthat are self-contained. Our design would allow one to satisfy know your\ncustomer laws and be subject to law enforcement actions following legal due\nprocess (e.g., account freezing and fund seizure), while mitigating\ncounterparty risk with checks and balances. Funds can thus be transferred only\nbetween approved and authenticated users. Our system has on-chain governance\ncapabilities using smart contracts deployed on a dedicated, permissioned\nblockchain that has different sets of control mechanisms for who can read data,\nwrite data, and publish blocks. To enable the governance features, only\nauthorized identity proofed entities can submit transactions. To enable\nprivacy, only the block publishers can read the blockchain; the publishers\nmaintain dedicated nodes that provide access controlled partial visibility of\nthe blockchain data. Being permissioned, we can use a simple consensus protocol\nwith no transaction fees. A separate security layer prevents denial of service\nand a balance of power mechanism prevents any small group of entities from\nhaving undue control. While permissioned, we ensure that no one entity controls\nthe blockchain data or block publishing capability through a voting system with\npublicly visible election outcomes.",

In this paper, we study\nthe problem of routing transactions in such a payment processing network. We\nfirst propose a Stochastic model to study such a system, as opposed to a fluid\nmodel that is studied in the literature. Each link in such a model is a\ntwo-sided queue, and unlike classical queues, such queues are not stable unless\nthere is an external control. We propose a notion of stability for the payment\nprocessing network consisting of such two-sided queues using the notion of\non-chain rebalancing. We then characterize the capacity region and propose a\nthroughput optimal algorithm that stabilizes the system under any load within\nthe capacity region. The stochastic model enables us to study closed loop\npolicies, which typically have better queuing/delay performance than the open\nloop policies (or static split rules) studied in the literature.

In\nthis paper, we propose a methodology to evaluate the performance of blockchain\nplatforms and conducted an experimental study on the Libra blockchain.

            "summary": "Improving transaction throughput is an important challenge for Bitcoin.\nHowever, shortening the block generation interval or increasing the block size\nto improve throughput makes it sharing blocks within the network slower and\nincreases the number of orphan blocks. Consequently, the security of the\nblockchain is sacrificed. To mitigate this, it is necessary to reduce the block\npropagation delay. Because of the contribution of new Bitcoin protocols and the\nimprovements of the Internet, the block propagation delay in the Bitcoin\nnetwork has been shortened in recent years. In this study, we identify impacts\nof compact block relay---an up-to-date Bitcoin protocol---and Internet\nimprovement on the block propagation delay and fork rate in the Bitcoin network\nfrom 2015 to 2019. Existing measurement studies could not identify them but our\nsimulation enables it. The experimental results reveal that compact block relay\ncontributes to shortening the block propagation delay more than Internet\nimprovements. The block propagation delay is reduced by 64.5% for the 50th\npercentile and 63.7% for the 90th percentile due to Internet improvements, and\nby 90.1% for the 50th percentile and by 87.6% for the 90th percentile due to\ncompact block relay.",

The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical\napplications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic\nimprovements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity\nand enhanced system throughput. Despite all these advantages that 5G will bring\nabout, there are still major challenges to be addressed, including\ndecentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, network privacy\nand security vulnerabilities. Blockchain can offer innovative solutions to\neffectively solve the challenges in 5G networks. Driven by the dramatically\nincreased capacities of the 5G networks and the recent breakthroughs in the\nblockchain technology, blockchain-based 5G services are expected to witness a\nrapid development and bring substantial benefits to future society. In this\npaper, we provide a state-of-art survey on the integration of blockchain with\n5G networks and beyond. Our key focus is on the discussions on the potential of\nblockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud/edge computing,\nSoftware Defined Networks, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing,\nand D2D communications. We then explore the opportunities of blockchain to\nimportant 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, network\nvirtualization, resource management to interference management, federated\nlearning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the\napplications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in\nvarious domains, i.e. smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart\ngrid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the survey are then summarized,\nand possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly,\nwe complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research\non this newly emerging area.",

            "summary": "Today's permissioned blockchain systems come in a stand-alone fashion and\nrequire the users to integrate yet another full-fledged transaction processing\nsystem into their already complex data management landscape. This seems odd as\nblockchains and traditional DBMSs share large parts of their processing stack.\nThus, rather than replacing the established data systems altogether, we\nadvocate to simply 'chainify' them with a blockchain layer on top.\n  Unfortunately, this task is far more challenging than it sounds: As we want\nto build upon heterogeneous transaction processing systems, which potentially\nbehave differently, we cannot rely on every organization to execute every\ntransaction deterministically in the same way. Further, as these systems are\nalready filled with data and being used by top-level applications, we also\ncannot rely on every organization being resilient against tampering with its\nlocal data.\n  Therefore, in this work, we will drop these assumptions and introduce a\npowerful processing model that avoids them in the first place: The so-called\nWhatever-LedgerConsensus (WLC) model allows us to create a highly flexible\npermissioned blockchain layer coined ChainifyDB that (a) is centered around\nbullet-proof database technology, (b) makes even stronger guarantees than\nexisting permissioned systems, (c) provides a sophisticated recovery mechanism,\n(d) has an up to 6x higher throughput than the permissioned blockchain system\nFabric, and (e) can easily be integrated into an existing heterogeneous\ndatabase landscape.",

Due to the\nimmutability nature of blockchain, no change is possible on a deployed smart\ncontract or a verified transaction. On the other hand, there are millions of\ndollars carried by smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain, and hence, a faulty\nsmart contract can lead to a huge monetary loss. Therefore, it is important for\nsmart contract developers to fully test and check the correctness of their code\nbefore deploying it on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose a testing\nmechanism for smart contracts in Solidity language, based on mutation testing.\nWe analyzed a comprehensive list of known bugs in Solidity smart contracts, and\ndesigned 10 classes of mutation operators inspired by the real faults. Our\nexperimental results show that our proposed mutation operators can regenerate\n10 of 15 famous faulty smart contracts, which have resulted in millions of\ndollars loss. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed mutation\noperators in detecting real faults in Solidity smart contracts.

            "summary": "The Lightning Network is a so-called second-layer technology built on top of\nthe Bitcoin blockchain to provide \"off-chain\" fast payment channels between\nusers, which means that not all transactions are settled and stored on the main\nblockchain. In this paper, we model the emergence of the Lightning Network as a\n(bond) percolation process and we explore how the distributional properties of\nthe volume and size of transactions per user may impact its feasibility. The\nagents are all able to reciprocally transfer Bitcoins using the main blockchain\nand also - if economically convenient - to open a channel on the Lightning\nNetwork and transact \"off chain\". We base our approach on fitness-dependent\nnetwork models: as in real life, a Lightning channel is opened with a\nprobability that depends on the \"fitness\" of the concurring nodes, which in\nturn depends on wealth and volume of transactions. The emergence of a connected\ncomponent is studied numerically and analytically as a function of the\nparameters, and the phase transition separating regions in the phase space\nwhere the Lightning Network is sustainable or not is elucidated. We\ncharacterize the phase diagram determining the minimal volume of transactions\nthat would make the Lightning Network sustainable for a given level of fees or,\nalternatively, the maximal cost the Lightning ecosystem may impose for a given\naverage volume of transactions. The model includes parameters that could be in\nprinciple estimated from publicly available data once the evolution of the\nLighting Network will have reached a stationary operable state, and is fairly\nrobust against different choices of the distributions of parameters and fitness\nkernels.",

This has sparked a wide range of decentralisation\ninitiatives with perhaps the most profound and successful being the blockchain\ntechnology. In the past years, a core Internet infrastructure, domain name\nsystem (DNS), is being revised mainly due to its inherent security and privacy\nissues. One of the proposed panaceas is Blockchain-based DNS, which claims to\nsolve many issues of traditional DNS. However, this does not come without\nsecurity concerns and issues, as any introduction and adoption of a new\ntechnology does - let alone a disruptive one such as blockchain. In this work,\nwe discuss a number of associated threats, including emerging ones, and we\nvalidate many of them with real-world data. In this regard, we explore a part\nof the blockchain DNS ecosystem in terms of the browser extensions using such\ntechnologies, the chain itself (Namecoin and Emercoin), the domains, and users\nwhich have been registered in both platforms. Finally, we provide some\ncountermeasures to address the identified threats, and we propose a fertile\ncommon ground for further research.",

            "summary": "Incentive mechanisms are central to the functionality of permissionless\nblockchains: they incentivize participants to run and secure the underlying\nconsensus protocol. Designing incentive-compatible incentive mechanisms is\nnotoriously challenging, however. As a result, most public blockchains today\nuse incentive mechanisms whose security properties are poorly understood and\nlargely untested. In this work, we propose SquirRL, a framework for using deep\nreinforcement learning to analyze attacks on blockchain incentive mechanisms.\nWe demonstrate SquirRL's power by first recovering known attacks: (1) the\noptimal selfish mining attack in Bitcoin [52], and (2) the Nash equilibrium in\nblock withholding attacks [16]. We also use SquirRL to obtain several novel\nempirical results. First, we discover a counterintuitive flaw in the widely\nused rushing adversary model when applied to multi-agent Markov games with\nincomplete information. Second, we demonstrate that the optimal selfish mining\nstrategy identified in [52] is actually not a Nash equilibrium in the\nmulti-agent selfish mining setting. In fact, our results suggest (but do not\nprove) that when more than two competing agents engage in selfish mining, there\nis no profitable Nash equilibrium. This is consistent with the lack of observed\nselfish mining in the wild. Third, we find a novel attack on a simplified\nversion of Ethereum's finalization mechanism, Casper the Friendly Finality\nGadget (FFG) that allows a strategic agent to amplify her rewards by up to 30%.\nNotably, [10] show that honest voting is a Nash equilibrium in Casper FFG: our\nattack shows that when Casper FFG is composed with selfish mining, this is no\nlonger the case. Altogether, our experiments demonstrate SquirRL's flexibility\nand promise as a framework for studying attack settings that have thus far\neluded theoretical and empirical understanding.",

The centralized cloud-based IoT service architecture has\nserious limitations in terms of security, availability, and scalability, and is\nsubject to single points of failure (SPOF). Recently, accommodating IoT\nservices on blockchains has become a trend for better security, privacy, and\nreliability. However, blockchain's shortcomings of high cost, low throughput,\nand long latency make it unsuitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we\ntake a retrospection of existing blockchain-based IoT solutions and propose a\nframework for efficient blockchain and IoT integration. Following the\nframework, we design a novel blockchain-assisted decentralized IoT remote\naccessing system, RS-IoT, which has the advantage of defending IoT devices\nagainst zero-day attacks without relying on any trusted third-party. By\nintroducing incentives and penalties enforced by smart contracts, our work\nenables \"an economic approach\" to thwarting the majority of attackers who aim\nto achieve monetary gains. Our work presents an example of how blockchain can\nbe used to ensure the fairness of service trading in a decentralized\nenvironment and punish misbehaviors objectively. We show the security of RS-IoT\nvia detailed security analyses.

            "summary": "This work applies reinforcement learning (RL) from the AI machine learning\nfield to derive an optimal Bitcoin-like blockchain mining strategy without\nknowing the details of the blockchain network model. Previously, the most\nprofitable mining strategy was believed to be honest mining encoded in the\ndefault blockchain protocol. It was shown later that it is possible to gain\nmore mining rewards by deviating from honest mining. In particular, the mining\nproblem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) which can be\nsolved to give the optimal mining strategy. However, solving the mining MDP\nrequires knowing the values of various parameters that characterize the\nblockchain network model. In real blockchain networks, these parameter values\nare not easy to obtain and may change over time. This hinders the use of the\nMDP model-based solution. In this work, we employ RL to dynamically learn a\nmining strategy with performance approaching that of the optimal mining\nstrategy by observing and interacting with the network. Since the mining MDP\nproblem has a non-linear objective function (rather than linear functions of\nstandard MDP problems), we design a new multi-dimensional RL algorithm to solve\nthe problem. Experimental results indicate that, without knowing the parameter\nvalues of the mining MDP model, our multi-dimensional RL mining algorithm can\nstill achieve the optimal performance over time-varying blockchain networks.",

            "summary": "The payment channel, which allows two parties to perform micropayments\nwithout involving the blockchain, has become a promising proposal to improve\nthe scalability of decentralized ledgers such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Payment\nchannels have been extended to the payment network, through which users can\nutilize existing channels as intermediary links to route coins to others.\nHowever, routing payments through multiple channels bears nontrivial overheads.\nIt requires every intermediary channel to lock a portion of its available\ncapacity until the payment is settled. This may lead to deadlock in a\nconcurrent situation. The intermediary nodes in a payment path may also charge\nfees for routing a payment. The longer the routing path, the more serious the\nabove problems.\n  In this paper, we design and develop a novel off-chain system to shorten the\nrouting path for the payment network. In particular, we propose the channel\nhub, which is an extension of the payment hub, to allows transferring coins\ndirectly from one payment channel to another within the same hub. That is, the\nchannel hub can be viewed as a shortcut device for the underlying payment\nnetwork. We design a new protocol named Boros to perform secure off-chain\ncross-channel transfers through the channel hub. We not only present the\nsecurity definition of the Boros protocol formally but also prove its security\nusing the UC-framework. To demonstrate the feasibility of the Boros protocol,\nwe develop a proof-of-concept prototype running on the Ethereum. Our evaluation\nshows that our system can effectively shorten the off-chain routing path.",

The protocol is based on the concept of Ronald L. Rivest and\npublished in the paper \"Electronic Lottery Tickets as Micropayments\" (1997).\nThe \"lottery ticket\" was designed for centralized systems where a trusted third\nparty is required to provide payments, and in some scenarios is also a lottery\nfacilitator. The existing blockchain protocol cannot accommodate peer-to-peer\n\"lottery\" micropayments at least without the need to create payment channels,\nwhich is analysed in the paper. Therefore, the implementation required the\ndevelopment of an update to the blockchain core. In the result, RandpayUTXO was\nintroduced - infinitely spendable zero output that requires the payee's\nsignature to be published in the blockchain. Randpay is considered to be the\nfirst blockchain protocol to require the payee to sign the transaction by their\nprivate key. This is a significant feature to improve not only\nmicrotransactions but also extend the use of the blockchain for legal deeds\nthat require a payee's consent to be recognised in legal applications. The\nsecond important innovation of this research is the implementation of Blum's\n\"coin flipping by telephone\" problem to design a \"lottery ticket\" that does not\nrequire any third party to facilitate the lottery. The paper offers an API\ndescription, an analysis of the mathematical model, and proof of how \"lottery\"\ncan be beneficial. There is also an attack analysis and overview of existing\nsolutions.",

To achieve this, Hyperledger Fabric introduces a novel\nexecute-order-validate blockchain architecture, allowing parallelization of\ntransaction execution and validation. However, this raises the need for\ntransaction isolation. Today transaction isolation is attained by locking the\nentire state database during simulation of transactions and database updates.\nThis lock is one of the major performance bottlenecks as observed by previous\nwork.\n  This work presents a new lock-free approach for providing transaction\nisolation. It harnesses the already existing versioning of key-value pairs in\nthe database, used primarily for a read-write conflict detection during the\nvalidation phase, to create a version-based snapshot isolation.

However, many characteristics of\nB-RAN remain unclear and hard to characterize. In this study, we develop an\nanalytical framework to model B-RAN and provide some basic fundamental\nanalysis. Starting from block generation, we establish a queuing model based on\na time-homogeneous Markov chain. From the queuing model, we evaluate the\nperformance of B-RAN with respect to latency and security considerations. By\nconnecting latency and security, we uncover a more comprehensive picture of the\nachievable performance of B-RAN. Further, we present experimental results via\nan innovative prototype and validate the proposed model.",

            "summary": "Proof of Stake (PoS) is a burgeoning Sybil resistance mechanism that aims to\nhave a digital asset (\"token\") serve as security collateral in crypto networks.\nHowever, PoS has so far eluded a comprehensive threat model that encompasses\nboth Byzantine attacks from distributed systems and financial attacks that\narise from the dual usage of the token as a means of payment and a Sybil\nresistance mechanism. In particular, the existence of derivatives markets makes\nmalicious coordination among validators easier to execute than in Proof of Work\nsystems. We demonstrate that it is also possible for on-chain lending smart\ncontracts to cannibalize network security in PoS systems. When the yield\nprovided by these contracts is more attractive than the inflation rate provided\nfrom staking, stakers will tend to remove their staked tokens and lend them\nout, thus reducing network security. In this paper, we provide a simple\nstochastic model that describes how rational validators with varying risk\npreferences react to changes in staking and lending returns. For a particular\nconfiguration of this model, we provide a formal proof of a phase transition\nbetween equilibria in which tokens are predominantly staked and those in which\nthey are predominantly lent. We further validate this emergent adversarial\nbehavior (e.g. reduced staked token supply) with agent-based simulations that\nsample transitions under more realistic conditions. Our results illustrate that\nrational, non-adversarial actors can dramatically reduce PoS network security\nif block rewards are not calibrated appropriately above the expected yields of\non-chain lending.",

In\naddition, it is shown that regulating the number of nodes (as in a permissioned\nnetwork) does not lead to additional cost savings that cannot otherwise be\nachieved via a setting of block rewards in a permissionless (i.e., free entry)\nnetwork.

This thesis proposes to develop a new smart contract\nprogramming language with the primary focus on safety, auditability, and the\nintention to prevent as many of the known categories of vulnerabilities by\ndesign as possible. The programming language's code is validated during\ndeployment and afterwards isolated from other smart contracts running on the\nsame blockchain to enforce compile-time guarantees during runtime. The designed\nprogramming language does evaluate new concepts and paradigms rarely used in\nnon-smart contract environments for their potential benefit in a smart contract\nenvironment.",

We first propose a new leader-based-view (LBV)\nabstraction that encapsulates the core properties provided by each view in a\npartially synchronous consensus algorithm, designed according to the\nleader-based view-by-view paradigm (e.g., PBFT and Paxos). Then, we compose\nseveral LBV instances in a non-trivial way in order to boost asynchronous\nliveness of existing SMR solutions.\n  ACE is model agnostic - it abstracts away any model assumptions that\nconsensus protocols may have, e.g., the ratio and types of faulty parties. For\nexample, when the LBV abstraction is instantiated with a partially synchronous\nconsensus algorithm designed to tolerate crash failures, e.g., Paxos or Raft,\nACE yields an asynchronous SMR for $n = 2f+1$ parties. However, if the LBV\nabstraction is instantiated with a byzantine protocol like PBFT or HotStuff,\nthen ACE yields an asynchronous byzantine SMR for $n = 3f+1$ parties.\n  To demonstrate the power of ACE, we implement it in C++, instantiate the LBV\nabstraction with a view implementation of HotStuff -- a state of the art\npartially synchronous byzantine agreement protocol -- and compare it with the\nbase HotStuff implementation under different adversarial scenarios. Our\nevaluation shows that while ACE is outperformed by HotStuff in the optimistic,\nsynchronous, failure-free case, ACE has absolute superiority during network\nasynchrony and attacks.",

To\ncapture essential control flow behaviors of smart contracts, we propose the\nnotions of whole transaction basis path set and bounded transaction\ninteraction. The former is a limited set of linearly independent\ninter-procedural paths from which the potentially infinite paths of Ethereum\ntransactions can be constructed by linear combination, while the latter is the\npermutations of transactions within a certain bound. Based on these two\nnotions, we define a family of path-based test coverage criteria. Algorithms\nare given to the generation of coverage requirements. A case study is conducted\nto compare the effectiveness of the proposed test coverage criteria with random\ntesting and statement coverage testing.",

While the analysis of\nBitcoin guarantees consistency with error $2^{-k}$ for blocks of depth $O(k)$,\nthe state-of-the-art of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains suffers from a\nquadratic dependence on $k$: these protocols, exemplified by Ouroboros (Crypto\n2017), Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017),\ncan only establish that depth $\\Theta(k^2)$ is sufficient. Whether this\nquadratic gap is an intrinsic limitation of PoS---due to issues such as the\nnothing-at-stake problem---has been an urgent open question, as deployed PoS\nblockchains further rely on consistency for protocol correctness.\n  We give an axiomatic theory of blockchain dynamics that permits rigorous\nreasoning about the longest-chain rule and achieve, in broad generality,\n$\\Theta(k)$ dependence on depth in order to achieve consistency error $2^{-k}$.\nIn particular, for the first time, we show that PoS protocols can match\nproof-of-work protocols for linear consistency.

Among them, phishing scams on blockchain have\nbeen found making a notable amount of money, thus emerging as a serious threat\nto the trading security of the blockchain ecosystem. In order to create a\nfavorable environment for investment, an effective method for detecting\nphishing scams is urgently needed in the blockchain ecosystem. To this end,\nthis paper proposes an approach to detect phishing scams on Ethereum by mining\nits transaction records. Specifically, we first crawl the labeled phishing\naddresses from two authorized websites and reconstruct the transaction network\naccording to the collected transaction records. Then, by taking the transaction\namount and timestamp into consideration, we propose a novel network embedding\nalgorithm called trans2vec to extract the features of the addresses for\nsubsequent phishing identification. Finally, we adopt the oneclass support\nvector machine (SVM) to classify the nodes into normal and phishing ones.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the phishing detection method works\neffectively on Ethereum, and indicate the efficacy of trans2vec over existing\nstate-of-the-art algorithms on feature extraction for transaction networks.\nThis work is the first investigation on phishing detection on Ethereum via\nnetwork embedding and provides insights into how features of large-scale\ntransaction networks can be embedded.",

However, initial\nblockchain applications (like Bitcoin) attain very low throughput, which has\npromoted the design of permissioned blockchain systems. These permissioned\nblockchain systems employ classical Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols to\nreach consensus. However, existing permissioned blockchain systems still attain\nlow throughputs (of the order 10K txns/s). As a result, existing works blame\nthis low throughput on the associated BFT protocol and expend resources in\ndeveloping optimized protocols. We believe such blames only depict a one-sided\nstory. In specific, we raise a simple question: can a well-crafted system based\non a classical BFT protocol outperform a modern protocol? We show that\ndesigning such a well-crafted system is possible and illustrate that even if\nsuch a system employs a three-phase protocol, it can outperform another system\nutilizing a single-phase protocol. This endeavor requires us to dissect a\npermissioned blockchain system and highlight different factors that affect its\nperformance.

            "summary": "Permissionless blockchains protocols such as Bitcoin are inherently limited\nin transaction throughput and latency. Current efforts to address this key\nissue focus on off-chain payment channels that can be combined in a\nPayment-Channel Network (PCN) to enable an unlimited number of payments without\nrequiring to access the blockchain other than to register the initial and final\ncapacity of each channel. While this approach paves the way for low latency and\nhigh throughput of payments, its deployment in practice raises several privacy\nconcerns as well as technical challenges related to the inherently concurrent\nnature of payments, such as race conditions and deadlocks, that have been\nunderstudied so far. In this work, we lay the foundations for privacy and\nconcurrency in PCNs, presenting a formal definition in the Universal\nComposability framework as well as practical and provably secure solutions. In\nparticular, we present Fulgor and Rayo. Fulgor is the first payment protocol\nfor PCNs that provides provable privacy guarantees for PCNs and is fully\ncompatible with the Bitcoin scripting system. However, Fulgor is a blocking\nprotocol and therefore prone to deadlocks of concurrent payments as in\ncurrently available PCNs. Instead, Rayo is the first protocol for PCNs that\nenforces non-blocking progress (i.e., at least one of the concurrent payments\nterminates). We show through a new impossibility result that non-blocking\nprogress necessarily comes at the cost of weaker privacy. At the core of Fulgor\nand Rayo is Multi-Hop HTLC, a new smart contract, compatible with the Bitcoin\nscripting system, that provides conditional payments while reducing running\ntime and communication overhead with respect to previous approaches.",

However, the ability to successfully make\npayments in such networks relies on the willingness of participants to lock\ncollateral in the network. In Lightning, the key financial incentive is to lock\ncollateral are small fees for routing payments for other participants. While\nusers can choose these fees, currently, they mainly stick to the default fees.\nBy providing insights on beneficial choices for fees, we aim to incentivize\nusers to lock more collateral and improve the effectiveness of the network.\n  In this paper, we consider a node $\\mathbf{A}$ that given the network\ntopology and the channel details selects where to establish channels and how\nmuch fee to charge such that its financial gain is maximized. We formalize the\noptimization problem and show that it is NP-hard. We design a greedy algorithm\nto approximate the optimal solution. In each step, our greedy algorithm selects\na node which maximizes the total reward concerning the number of shortest paths\npassing through $\\mathbf{A}$ and channel fees. Our simulation study leverages\nreal-world data set to quantify the impact of our gain optimization and\nindicates that our strategy is at least a factor two better than other\nstrategies.",

            "summary": "In communication networks, network virtualization can usually provide better\ncapacity utilization and quality of service (QoS) than what can be achieved\notherwise. However, conventional resource allocation for virtualized networks\nwould still follow a fixed pattern based on the predicted capacity needs of the\nusers, even though, in reality, the actual traffic demand of a user will always\ntend to fluctuate. The mismatch between the fixed capacity allocation and the\nactual fluctuating traffic would lead to degradation of provisioned network\nservices and inefficiency in the assigned network capacity. To overcome this,\nwe propose a new spectrum trading (ST) scheme between virtual optical networks\n(VONs) in the context of an elastic optical network (EON). The key idea here is\nto allow different VONs to trade their spectrum resources according to the\nactual capacity they need at different time instants. A VON with unused spectra\ncan then trade away its unused spectra to other VONs that are short of spectrum\nresources at that time. In exchange, it is rewarded with a certain amount of\ncredit for its contribution to the ST community, which it can then use later to\nget extra bandwidth, if needed. The trust-worthiness of the trading records\nbetween the VONs is ensured in a distributed fashion through a\nblockchain-assisted account book that is updated whenever a new trade occurs.\nFor this, we develop a software-defined control plane to enable spectrum\ntrading in an EON. The performance of the ST scheme is evaluated and compared\nwith a scenario without such trading. Our results show that the proposed ST\nscheme is effective in improving the QoS of each VON and significantly improves\nthe overall network capacity utilization.",

            "summary": "Micropayments are increasingly being adopted by a large number of\napplications. However, processing micropayments individually can be expensive,\nwith transaction fees exceeding the payment value itself. By aggregating these\nsmall transactions into a few larger ones, and using cryptocurrencies, today's\ndecentralized probabilistic micropayment schemes can reduce these fees.\nUnfortunately, existing solutions force micropayments to be issued\nsequentially, thus to support fast issuance rates a customer needs to create a\nlarge number of escrows, which bloats the blockchain. Moreover, these schemes\nincur a large computation and bandwidth overhead, which limit their\napplicability in large-scale systems.\n  In this paper, we propose MicroCash, the first decentralized probabilistic\nframework that supports concurrent micropayments. MicroCash introduces a novel\nescrow setup that enables a customer to concurrently issue payment tickets at a\nfast rate using a single escrow. MicroCash is also cost effective because it\nallows for ticket exchange using only one round of communication, and it\naggregates the micropayments using a lottery protocol that requires only secure\nhashing. Our experiments show that MicroCash can process thousands of tickets\nper second, which is around 1.7-4.2x times the rate of a state-of-the-art\nsequential micropayment system. Moreover, MicroCash supports any ticket issue\nrate over any period using only one escrow, while the sequential scheme would\nneed more than 1000 escrows per second to permit high rates. This enables our\nsystem to further reduce transaction fees and data on the blockchain by around\n50%.",

One\nsuch project is carried out by a team of the Formal Methods Group at IOHK. This\nproject, in which the author is involved, aims at a formally verified\nimplementation of the Ouroboros family of consensus protocols, the backbone of\nthe Cardano blockchain. The first outcome of our project is the\n$\\natural$-calculus (pronounced \"natural calculus\"), a general-purpose process\ncalculus that serves as our implementation language. The $\\natural$-calculus is\na domain-specific language embedded in a functional host language using\nhigher-order abstract syntax.\n  This paper will be a ramble through the $\\natural$-calculus. First we will\nlook at its language and its operational semantics. The latter is unique in\nthat it uses a stack of two labeled transition systems to treat phenomena like\ndata transfer and the opening and closing of channel scope in a modular\nfashion. The presence of multiple transition systems calls for a generic\ntreatment of derived concurrency concepts.

The proposed technique\navoids the limitations of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of Space (PoS) which\nrequire spending of only energy and space, respectively. Also, it provides a\nflexibility for adjusting the resources spending to the system budget. The\nproposed consensus technique is based on a puzzle where the problem of\ninverting one-way function is solved employing a dedicated Time-Memory-Data\nTrade-Off (TMD-TO) paradigm. The algorithms of the consensus protocol are\nproposed which employ certain unconstrained and constrained TMD-TO based\ninversions. Security of the proposed technique is considered based on the\nprobability that the honest pool of nodes generate a longer extension of the\nblockchain before its update, and a condition on the employed parameters in\norder to achieve desired security have been derived.

In this paper we provide a summary of Ethereum smart contract audits\nperformed for 23 professional stakeholders, avoiding the common problem of\nreporting issues mostly prevalent in low-quality contracts. These audits were\nperformed at a leading company in blockchain security, using both open-source\nand proprietary tools, as well as human code analysis performed by professional\nsecurity engineers. We categorize 246 individual defects, making it possible to\ncompare the severity and frequency of different vulnerability types, compare\nsmart contract and non-smart contract flaws, and to estimate the efficacy of\nautomated vulnerability detection approaches.",

            "summary": "As ethereum blockchain has become popular, the number of users and\ntransactions has skyrocketed, causing an explosive increase of its data size.\nAs a result, ordinary clients using PCs or smartphones cannot easily bootstrap\nas a full node, but rely on other full nodes such as the miners to run or\nverify transactions. This may affect the security of ethereum, so light\nbootstrapping techniques such as fast sync has been proposed to download only\nparts of full data, yet the space overhead is still too high. One of the\nbiggest space overhead that cannot easily be reduced is caused by saving the\nstate of all accounts in the block's state trie. Fortunately, we found that\nmore than 90% of accounts are inactive and old transactions are hard to be\nmanipulated. Based on these observations, this paper propose a novel\noptimization technique called ethanos that can reduce bootstrapping cost by\nsweeping inactive accounts periodically and by not downloading old\ntransactions. If an inactive account becomes active, ethanos restore its state\nby running a restoration transaction. Also, ethanos gives incentives for\narchive nodes to maintain the old transactions for possible re-verification. We\nimplemented ethanos by instrumenting the go-ethereum (geth) client and\nevaluated with the real 113 million transactions from 14 million accounts\nbetween 7M-th and 8M-th blocks in ethereum. Our experimental result shows that\nethanos can reduce the size of the account state by half, which, if combined\nwith removing old transactions, may reduce the storage size for bootstrapping\nto around 1GB. This would be reasonable enough for ordinary clients to\nbootstrap on their personal devices.",

            "summary": "Some of the recent blockchain proposals, such as Stellar and Ripple, allow\nfor open membership while using quorum-like structures typical for classical\nByzantine consensus with closed membership. This is achieved by constructing\nquorums in a decentralised way: each participant independently chooses whom to\ntrust, and quorums arise from these individual decisions. Unfortunately, the\nconsensus protocols underlying such blockchains are poorly understood, and\ntheir correctness has not been rigorously investigated. In this paper we\nrigorously prove correct the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), with our proof\ngiving insights into the protocol structure and its use of lower-level\nabstractions. To this end, we first propose an abstract version of SCP that\nuses as a black box Stellar's federated voting primitive (analogous to reliable\nByzantine broadcast), previously investigated by Garc\\'ia-P\\'erez and Gotsman.\nThe abstract consensus protocol highlights a modular structure in Stellar and\ncan be proved correct by reusing the previous results on federated voting.\nHowever, it is unsuited for realistic implementations, since its processes\nmaintain infinite state. We thus establish a refinement between the abstract\nprotocol and the concrete SCP that uses only finite state, thereby carrying\nover the result about the correctness of former to the latter. Our results help\nestablish the theoretical foundations of decentralised blockchains like Stellar\nand gain confidence in their correctness.",

            "summary": "Proof of Work (PoW) is a Sybil-deterrence security mechanism. It introduces\nan external cost to a system by requiring computational effort to perform\nactions. However, since its inception, a central challenge was to tune this\ncost. Initial designs for deterring spam email and DoS attacks applied overhead\nequally to honest participants and attackers. Requiring too little effort did\nnot deter attacks, whereas too much encumbered honest participation. This might\nbe the reason it was never widely adopted.\n  Nakamoto overcame this trade-off in Bitcoin by distinguishing desired from\nmalicious behavior and introducing internal rewards for the former. This\nsolution gained popularity in securing cryptocurrencies and using the virtual\ninternally-minted tokens for rewards. However, in existing blockchain protocols\nthe internal rewards fund (almost) the same value of external expenses. Thus,\nas the token value soars, so does the PoW expenditure. Bitcoin PoW, for\nexample, already expends as much electricity as Colombia or Switzerland. This\namount of resource-guzzling is unsustainable and hinders even wider adoption of\nthese systems.\n  In this work we present Hybrid Expenditure Blockchain (HEB), a novel PoW\nmechanism. HEB is a generalization of Nakamoto's protocol that enables tuning\nthe external expenditure by introducing a complementary internal-expenditure\nmechanism. Thus, for the first time, HEB decouples external expenditure from\nthe reward value.\n  We show a practical parameter choice by which HEB requires significantly less\nexternal consumption compare to Nakamoto's protocol, its resilience against\nrational attackers is similar, and it retains the decentralized and\npermissionless nature of the system. Taking the Bitcoin ecosystem as an\nexample, HEB cuts the electricity consumption by half.",

            "summary": "Feeding external data to a blockchain, a.k.a. data feed, is an essential task\nto enable blockchain interoperability and support emerging cross-domain\napplications, notably stablecoins. Given the data-intensive feeds in real life\n(e.g., high-frequency price updates) and the high cost in using blockchain,\nnamely Gas, it is imperative to reduce the Gas cost of data feeds. Motivated by\nthe constant-changing workloads in finance and other applications, this work\nfocuses on designing a dynamic, workload-aware approach for cost effectiveness\nin Gas. This design space is understudied in the existing blockchain research\nwhich has so far focused on static data placement.\n  This work presents GRuB, a cost-effective data feed that dynamically\nreplicates data between the blockchain and an off-chain cloud storage. GRuB's\ndata replication is workload-adaptive by monitoring the current workload and\nmaking online decisions w.r.t. data replication. A series of online algorithms\nare proposed that achieve the bounded worst-case cost in blockchain's Gas. GRuB\nruns the decision-making components on the untrusted cloud off-chain for lower\nGas costs, and employs a security protocol to authenticate the data transferred\nbetween the blockchain and cloud. The overall GRuB system can autonomously\nachieve low Gas costs with changing workloads.\n  We built a GRuB prototype functional with Ethereum and Google LevelDB, and\nsupported real applications in stablecoins. Under real workloads collected from\nthe Ethereum contract-call history and mixed workloads of YCSB, we\nsystematically evaluate GRuB's cost which shows a saving of Gas by 10% ~ 74%,\nwith comparison to the baselines of static data-placement.",

            "summary": "Algorand is a recent, open-source public or permissionless blockchain system\nthat employs a novel proof-of-stake byzantine consensus protocol to efficiently\nscale the distributed transaction agreement problem to billions of users. In\naddition to being more democratic and energy-efficient, compared to popular\nprotocols such as Bitcoin, Algorand also touts a much high transaction\nthroughput. This paper is the first attempt in the literature to study and\naddress this problem. By carefully modeling the participation costs and rewards\nreceived within a strategic interaction scenario, we first empirically show\nthat even a small number of nodes defecting to participate in the protocol\ntasks due to insufficiency of the available incentives can result in the\nAlgorand network failing to compute and add new blocks of transactions. We\nfurther show that this effect can be formalized by means of a mathematical\nmodel of interaction in Algorand given its participation costs and the current\n(or planned) reward distribution/sharing approach envisioned by the Algorand\nFoundation. Specifically, on analyzing this game model we observed that mutual\ncooperation under the currently proposed reward sharing approach is not a Nash\nequilibrium. This is a significant result which could threaten the success of\nan otherwise robust distributed consensus mechanism. We propose a novel reward\nsharing approach for Algorand and formally show that it is\nincentive-compatible, i.e., it can guarantee cooperation within a group of\nselfish Algorand users. Extensive numerical and Algorand simulation results\nfurther confirm our analytical findings. Moreover, these results show that for\na given distribution of stakes in the network, our reward sharing approach can\nguarantee cooperation with a significantly smaller reward per round.",

In this paper, we present the\nProof-of-Execution consensus protocol (PoE) that alleviates these challenges.\nAt the core of PoE are out-of-order processing and speculative execution, which\nallow PoE to execute transactions before consensus is reached among the\nreplicas. With these techniques, PoE manages to reduce the costs of BFT in\nnormal cases, while guaranteeing reliable consensus for clients in all cases.\nWe envision the use of PoE in high-throughput multi-party data-management and\nblockchain systems. To validate this vision, we implement PoE in our efficient\nResilientDB fabric and extensively evaluate PoE against several\nstate-of-the-art BFT protocols.

To push throughput\nbeyond this single-replica limit, we propose concurrent consensus. In\nconcurrent consensus, replicas independently propose transactions, thereby\nreducing the influence of any single replica on performance. To put this idea\nin practice, we propose our RCC paradigm that can turn any primary-backup\nconsensus protocol into a concurrent consensus protocol by running many\nconsensus instances concurrently. RCC is designed with performance in mind and\nrequires minimal coordination between instances. Furthermore, RCC also promises\nincreased resilience against failures. We put the design of RCC to the test by\nimplementing it in ResilientDB, our high-performance resilient blockchain\nfabric, and comparing it with state-of-the-art primary-backup consensus\nprotocols. Our experiments show that RCC achieves up to 2.75x higher throughput\nthan other consensus protocols and can be scaled to 91 replicas.",

In\nthis paper, we fill such a gap and develop central limit theorems and\nassociated rates of convergence for a rescaled test statistic based on the\nbias-corrected distance correlation in high dimensions under some mild\nregularity conditions and the null hypothesis. Our new theoretical results\nreveal an interesting phenomenon of blessing of dimensionality for\nhigh-dimensional distance correlation inference in the sense that the accuracy\nof normal approximation can increase with dimensionality. Moreover, we provide\na general theory on the power analysis under the alternative hypothesis of\ndependence, and further justify the capability of the rescaled distance\ncorrelation in capturing the pure nonlinear dependency under moderately high\ndimensionality for a certain type of alternative hypothesis. The theoretical\nresults and finite-sample performance of the rescaled statistic are illustrated\nwith several simulation examples and a blockchain application.",

In this paper, we propose a manageable, user-driven and auditable\naccess control framework for DOSNs using blockchain technology. In the proposed\napproach, the blockchain is used as a support for the definition of privacy\npolicies. The resource owner uses the public key of the subject to define\nflexible role-based access control policies, while the private key associated\nwith the subject's Ethereum account is used to decrypt the private data once\naccess permission is validated on the blockchain.

First, we build\nan economic model of a decentralized exchange with two miner clusters, standing\nin for compact areas of economic activity (e.g., cities). \"Local\" miners in the\narea with relatively higher trading activity only join a decentralized exchange\nif they enjoy a large speed advantage over \"long-distance\" competitors. This is\ndue to a transfer of economic value across miners, specifically from high- to\nlow-activity clusters. Second, we estimate the speed advantage of \"local\" over\n\"long-distance\" miners in a series of Monte Carlo experiments over a\ntwo-cluster, unstructured peer-to-peer network simulated in C. We find that the\nspeed advantage increases in the level of infrastructure asymmetry between\nclusters. Cross-region DEX blockchains are feasible as long as the asymmetry\nlevels in trading activity and infrastructure availability across regions are\npositively correlated.",

In particular, as the number of\ncontrollable grid connected assets increases, there is a need for a\ndecentralized, coupled economic and control mechanism to dynamically balance\nthe entire electric grid. Blockchain based Transactive Energy (TE) systems have\ngained significant momentum as an approach to sustain the reliability and\nsecurity of the power grid in order to support the flexibility of electricity\ndemand. What is lacking in these designs, however, is a mechanism that\nphysically verifies all the energy transactions, to keep the various inherently\nselfish players honest. In this paper, we introduce a secure peer-to-peer\nnetwork mechanism for the physical validation of economic transactions cleared\nover a distributed ledger. The framework is $\\textit{secure}$ in the sense that\nselfish and malicious agents that are trying to inject false data into the\nnetwork are prevented from adversely affecting the optimal functionality of the\nverification process by detecting and isolating them from the communication\nnetwork. Preliminary simulations focusing on TE show the workings of this\nframework.",

The datasets are\npart of SmartBugs, a new extendable execution framework that we created to\nfacilitate the integration and comparison between multiple analysis tools and\nthe analysis of Ethereum smart contracts. We used SmartBugs to execute the 9\nautomated analysis tools on the two datasets. In total, we ran 428,337 analyses\nthat took approximately 564 days and 3 hours, being the largest experimental\nsetup to date both in the number of tools and in execution time. We found that\nonly 42% of the vulnerabilities from our annotated dataset are detected by all\nthe tools, with the tool Mythril having the higher accuracy (27%). When\nconsidering the largest dataset, we observed that 97% of contracts are tagged\nas vulnerable, thus suggesting a considerable number of false positives.\nIndeed, only a small number of vulnerabilities (and of only two categories)\nwere detected simultaneously by four or more tools.",

We fill this gap by introducing\nthe first formal framework as well as a roadmap to robust sharding. In\nparticular, we first define the properties sharded distributed ledgers should\nfulfill. We build upon and extend the Bitcoin backbone protocol by defining\nconsistency and scalability. Consistency encompasses the need for atomic\nexecution of cross-shard transactions to preserve safety, whereas scalability\nencapsulates the speedup a sharded system can gain in comparison to a\nnon-sharded system.\n  Using our model, we explore the limitations of sharding. We show that a\nsharded ledger with $n$ participants cannot scale under a fully adaptive\nadversary, but it can scale up to $m$ shards where $n=c'm\\log m$, under an\nepoch-adaptive adversary; the constant $c'$ encompasses the trade-off between\nsecurity and scalability. This is possible only if the sharded ledgers create\nsuccinct proofs of the valid state updates at every epoch. We leverage our\nresults to identify the sufficient components for robust sharding, which we\nincorporate in a protocol abstraction termed Divide & Scale. To demonstrate the\npower of our framework, we analyze the most prominent sharded blockchains\n(Elastico, Monoxide, OmniLedger, RapidChain) and pinpoint where they fail to\nmeet the desired properties.",

Instruction costs vary\ndepending on the instruction type and the approximate computational resources\nrequired to execute the instruction on the network. The cost of gas is adjusted\nusing transaction fees to ensure adequate payment of the network. In this work,\nwe highlight the \"real\" economics of smart contracts. We show that the actual\ncosts of executing smart contracts are disproportionate to the computational\ncosts and that this gap is continuously widening. We show that the gas\ncost-model of the underlying EVM instruction-set is wrongly modeled.\nSpecifically, the computational cost for the SLOAD instruction increases with\nthe length of the blockchain. Our proposed performance model estimates gas\nusage and execution time of a smart contract at a given block-height.

The SRA contains four\nlayers: (1) the network layer, (2) the consensus layer, (3) the replicated\nstate machine layer, and (4) the application layer. At each of these layers, we\nidentify known security threats, their origin, and countermeasures, while we\nalso analyze several cross-layer dependencies. Next, to enable better reasoning\nabout security aspects of blockchains by the practitioners, we propose a\nblockchain-specific version of the threat-risk assessment standard ISO/IEC\n15408 by embedding the stacked model into this standard.

            "summary": "Blockchain is maintained as a global log between a network of nodes and uses\ncryptographic distributed protocols to synchronize the updates. As adopted by\nBitcoin and Ethereum these update operations to the ledger are serialized, and\nexecuted in batches. To safeguard the system against the generation of\nconflicting sets of updates and maintain the consistency of the ledger, the\nfrequency of the updates is controlled, which severely affects the performance\nof the system.\n  This paper presents Converging Directed Acyclic Graph (CDAG), as a substitute\nfor the chain and DAG structures used in other blockchain protocols. CDAG\nallows multiple parallel updates to the ledger and converges them at the next\nstep providing finality to the blocks. It partitions the updates into\nnon-intersecting buckets of transactions to prevent the generation of\nconflicting blocks and divide the time into slots to provide enough time for\nthem to propagate in the network. Multiple simultaneous updates improve the\nthroughput of CDAG, and the converging step helps to finalize them faster, even\nin the presence of conflicts. Moreover, CDAG provides a total order among the\nblocks of the ledger to support smart contracts, unlike some of the other\nblockDAG protocols.\n  We evaluate the performance of CDAG on Google Cloud Platform using Google\nKubernetes Engine, simulating a real-time network. Experimental results show\nthat CDAG achieves a throughput of more than 2000 transactions per second and\nconfirms them well in under 2 minutes. Also, the protocol scales well in\ncomparison to other permissioned protocols, and the capacity of the network\nonly limits the performance.",

On the\nsame day, Facebook announced plans for Calibra, a subsidiary in charge of the\ndevelopment of an electronic wallet and financial services. In view of the\nprimary risk of sovereignty posed by the creation of Libra, regulators and\nCentral Banks quickly took very clear positions against the project and\nexpressed a lot of questions focusing on regulation aspects and national\nsovereignty.\n  The purpose of this paper is to provide a holistic analysis of the project\nencompassing several aspects of its implementation and the issues it raises. We\naddress a set of questions that are part of the cryptocurrency environment and\nblockchain technology that support the Libra project. We describe the\ngovernance of the project based on two levels, one for the Association and the\nother for the Libra Blockchain. We identify the main risks considering at the\nsame time political, financial, economic, technological and ethical risks. We\nemphasize the difficulty to regulate such a project as it will depend on\nseveral countries whose legislations are very different. Finally, the future of\nthis kind of projects is discussed through the emergence of Central Bank\nDigital Currencies.",

Our\nnovel approach distributes blocks over multiple blockchains.

In the federated learning, training data is\nwidely distributed and maintained on the mobile devices as workers. A central\naggregator updates a global model by collecting local updates from mobile\ndevices using their local training data to train the global model in each\niteration. However, unreliable data may be uploaded by the mobile devices\n(i.e., workers), leading to frauds in tasks of federated learning. The workers\nmay perform unreliable updates intentionally, e.g., the data poisoning attack,\nor unintentionally, e.g., low-quality data caused by energy constraints or\nhigh-speed mobility. Therefore, finding out trusted and reliable workers in\nfederated learning tasks becomes critical. In this article, the concept of\nreputation is introduced as a metric. Based on this metric, a reliable worker\nselection scheme is proposed for federated learning tasks. Consortium\nblockchain is leveraged as a decentralized approach for achieving efficient\nreputation management of the workers without repudiation and tampering.

More in detail, authentication of the issuing\ninstitution is performed by retrieving an unauthenticated issuer profile\nonline, and comparing some data reported there with those included in the\nissued certificate. We show that, by fabricating a fake issuer profile and\ngenerating a suitably altered certificate, an attacker is able to impersonate a\nlegitimate issuer and can produce certificates that cannot be distinguished\nfrom originals by the Blockcerts validation procedure. We also propose some\npossible countermeasures against an attack of this type, which require the use\nof a classic public key infrastructure or a decentralized identity system\nintegrated with the Blockcerts protocol.",

Blockchain works over the principle of\ndistributed, secured, and shared ledger, which is used to record, and track\ndata within a decentralized network. This technology has successfully replaced\ncertain systems of economic transactions in organizations and has the potential\nto overtake various industrial business models in future. Blockchain works over\npeer-to-peer (P2P) phenomenon for its operation and does not require any\ntrusted-third party authorization for data tracking and storage. The\ninformation stored in blockchain is distributed throughout the decentralized\nnetwork and is usually protected using cryptographic hash functions. Since the\nbeginning of blockchain technology, its use in different applications is\nincreasing exponentially, but this increased use has also raised some questions\nregarding privacy and security of data being stored in it. Protecting privacy\nof blockchain data using data perturbation strategy such as differential\nprivacy could be a novel approach to overcome privacy issues in blockchain. In\nthis article, we cover the topic of integration of differential privacy in each\nlayer of blockchain and in certain blockchain based scenarios. Moreover, we\nhighlight some future challenges and application scenarios in which integration\nof differential privacy in blockchain can produce fruitful results.",

In this paper, we prove that a\nnatural longest chain PoS protocol with similar predictability as Nakamoto's\nPoW protocol can achieve security against any adversary with less than 1/(1+e)\nfraction of the total stake. Moreover we propose a new family of longest chain\nPoS protocols that achieve security against a 50% adversary, while only\nrequiring short-term predictability.

With the\nincrease in popularity, malicious users found new opportunities to profit by\ndeceiving newcomers. Consequently, attackers started luring other attackers\ninto contracts that seem to have exploitable flaws, but that actually contain a\ncomplex hidden trap that in the end benefits the contract creator. In the\nblockchain community, these contracts are known as honeypots. A recent study\npresented a tool called HONEYBADGER that uses symbolic execution to detect\nhoneypots by analyzing contract bytecode. In this paper, we present a data\nscience detection approach based foremost on the contract transaction behavior.\nWe create a partition of all the possible cases of fund movements between the\ncontract creator, the contract, the transaction sender and other participants.\nTo this end, we add transaction aggregated features, such as the number of\ntransactions and the corresponding mean value and other contract features, for\nexample compilation information and source code length. We find that all\naforementioned categories of features contain useful information for the\ndetection of honeypots. Moreover, our approach allows us to detect new,\npreviously undetected honeypots of already known techniques. We furthermore\nemploy our method to test the detection of unknown honeypot techniques by\nsequentially removing one technique from the training set. We show that our\nmethod is capable of discovering the removed honeypot techniques. Finally, we\ndiscovered two new techniques that were previously not known.",
