            "summary": "Blockchain technology enables the execution of collaborative business\nprocesses involving untrusted parties without requiring a central authority.\nSpecifically, a process model comprising tasks performed by multiple parties\ncan be coordinated via smart contracts operating on the blockchain. The\nconsensus mechanism governing the blockchain thereby guarantees that the\nprocess model is followed by each party. However, the cost required for\nblockchain use is highly dependent on the volume of data recorded and the\nfrequency of data updates by smart contracts. This paper proposes an optimized\nmethod for executing business processes on top of commodity blockchain\ntechnology. The paper presents a method for compiling a process model into a\nsmart contract that encodes the preconditions for executing each task in the\nprocess using a space-optimized data structure. The method is empirically\ncompared to a previously proposed baseline by replaying execution logs,\nincluding one from a real-life business process, and measuring resource\nconsumption.",

Our analysis focuses on\nthe value of transactions that can be secured under a conventional double-spend\nattack, both with and without a concurrent eclipse attack. Our model quantifies\nthe importance of several factors that determine the attack's success,\nincluding confirmation depth, attacker mining power, and any confirmation\ndeadline set by the merchant. In general, the security of a transaction against\na double-spend attack increases roughly logarithmically with the depth of the\nblock, made easier by the increasing sum of coin turned-over (between\nindividuals) in the blocks, but more difficult by the increasing proof of work\nrequired. In recent blockchain data, we observed a median block turnover value\nof 6 BTC. Based on this value, a merchant requiring a single confirmation is\nprotected against only attackers that can increase the current mining power by\n1% or less. However, similar analysis shows that a merchant that requires a\nmuch longer 72 confirmations (~12 hours) will eliminate all potential profit\nfor any double-spend attacker adding mining power less than 40% of the current\nmining power.",

Given that\nblockchain participants typically do not trust each other, enabling fairness in\nexisting cryptocurrencies is an essential but insufficiently explored problem.\n  In this paper, we explore the solution space for enabling the fair exchange\nof a cryptocurrency payment for a receipt. We identify the timeliness of an\nexchange as an important property especially when one of the parties involved\nin the exchange is resource-constrained.

            "summary": "There has recently been a flood of interest in potential new applications of\nblockchains, as well as proposals for more generic designs called public\nledgers. Most of the novel proposals have been in the financial sector.\nHowever, the public ledger is an abstraction that solves several of the\nfundamental problems in the design of secure distributed systems: global time\nin the form of a strict linear order of past events, globally consistent and\nimmutable view of the history, and enforcement of some application-specific\nsafety properties. This paper investigates the applications of public ledgers\nto access control and, more specifically, to group management in distributed\nsystems where entities are represented by their public keys and authorization\nis encoded into signed certificates. It is particularly difficult to handle\nnegative information, such as revocation of certificates or group membership,\nin the distributed setting. The linear order of events and global consistency\nsimplify these problems, but the enforcement of internal constraints in the\nledger implementation often presents problems. We show that different types of\nrevocation require slightly different properties from the ledger. We compare\nthe requirements with Bitcoin, the best known blockchain, and describe an\nefficient ledger design for membership revocation that combines ideas from\nblockchains and from web-PKI monitoring. While we use certificate-based\ngroup-membership management as the case study, the same ideas can be applied\nmore widely to rights revocation in distributed systems.",

BlockChain BC that underpin the crypto-currency\nBitcoin have been recently used to provide security and privacy in peer-to-peer\nnetworks with similar topologies to IoT. However, BCs are computationally\nexpensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not\nsuitable for IoT devices. This position paper proposes a new secure, private,\nand lightweight architecture for IoT, based on BC technology that eliminates\nthe overhead of BC while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits.\nThe described method is investigated on a smart home application as a\nrepresentative case study for broader IoT applications. The proposed\narchitecture is hierarchical, and consists of smart homes, an overlay network\nand cloud storages coordinating data transactions with BC to provide privacy\nand security. Our design uses different types of BCs depending on where in the\nnetwork hierarchy a transaction occurs, and uses distributed trust methods to\nensure a decentralized topology. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture\nunder common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security\nand privacy for IoT applications.",

However, several of the\nheterogeneous characteristics that make them ideal for certain future\napplications --- robot autonomy, decentralized control, collective emergent\nbehavior, etc. --- hinder the evolution of the technology from academic\ninstitutions to real-world problems. Blockchain, an emerging technology\noriginated in the Bitcoin field, demonstrates that by combining peer-to-peer\nnetworks with cryptographic algorithms a group of agents can reach an agreement\non a particular state of affairs and record that agreement without the need for\na controlling authority. The combination of blockchain with other distributed\nsystems, such as robotic swarm systems, can provide the necessary capabilities\nto make robotic swarm operations more secure, autonomous, flexible and even\nprofitable. This work explains how blockchain technology can provide innovative\nsolutions to four emergent issues in the swarm robotics research field. New\nsecurity, decision making, behavior differentiation and business models for\nswarm robotic systems are described by providing case scenarios and examples.\nFinally, limitations and possible future problems that arise from the\ncombination of these two technologies are described.",

We formulate and study the stochastic game that underlies\nthese strategic considerations. The miners collectively build a tree of blocks,\nand they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in\nthe path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly\nmined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two\nsimplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In\nthe simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are\nstrategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a\nblock is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that\nother miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which\nblocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games,\nwe show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small,\ntheir best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer.\nHowever, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the\nexpected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.",

Modern blockchains feature services such as name registration and\nsmart contracts. Some employ new forms of consensus, such as proof-of-stake\ninstead of proof-of-work. However, these blockchains are so far relatively\npoorly investigated, despite the fact that they move considerable assets. In\nthis paper, we explore three representative, modern blockchains---Ethereum,\nNamecoin, and Peercoin. Our focus is on the features that set them apart from\nthe pure currency use case of Bitcoin. We investigate the blockchains' activity\nin terms of transactions and usage patterns, identifying some curiosities in\nthe process. For Ethereum, we are mostly interested in the smart contract\nfunctionality it offers. We also carry out a brief analysis of issues that are\nintroduced by negligent design of smart contracts. In the case of Namecoin, our\nfocus is how the name registration is used and has developed over time. For\nPeercoin, we are interested in the use of proof-of-stake, as this consensus\nalgorithm is poorly understood yet used to move considerable value. Finally, we\nrelate the above to the fundamental characteristics of the underlying\npeer-to-peer networks. We present a crawler for Ethereum and give statistics on\nthe network size. For Peercoin and Namecoin, we identify the relatively small\nsize of the networks and the weak bootstrapping process.",

            "summary": "Most popular blockchain solutions, like Bitcoin, rely on proof-of-work,\nguaranteeing that the output of the consensus is agreed upon with high\nprobability. However, this probability depends on the delivery of messages and\nthat the computational power of the system is sufficiently scattered among\npools of nodes in the network so that no pool can mine more blocks faster than\nthe crowd. New approaches, like Ethereum, generalise the proof-of-work approach\nby letting individuals deploy their own private blockchain with high\ntransaction throughput. As companies are starting to deploy private chains, it\nhas become crucial to better understand the guarantees blockchains offer in\nsuch a small and controlled environment.\n  In this paper, we present the \\emph{Blockchain Anomaly}, an execution that we\nexperienced when building our private chain at NICTA/Data61. Even though this\nanomaly has never been acknowledged before, it may translate into dramatic\nconsequences for the user of blockchains. Named after the infamous Paxos\nanomaly, this anomaly makes dependent transactions, like \"Bob sends money to\nCarole after he received money from Alice\" impossible. This anomaly relies on\nthe fact that existing blockchains do not ensure consensus safety\ndeterministically: there is no way for Bob to make sure that Alice actually\nsent him coins without Bob using an external mechanism, like converting these\ncoins into a fiat currency that allows him to withdraw. We also explore smart\ncontracts as a potential alternative to transactions in order to freeze coins,\nand show implementations of smart contract that can suffer from the Blockchain\nanomaly and others that may cope with it.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin was recently introduced as a peer-to-peer electronic currency in\norder to facilitate transactions outside the traditional financial system. The\ncore of Bitcoin, the Blockchain, is the history of the transactions in the\nsystem maintained by all miners as a distributed shared register. New blocks in\nthe Blockchain contain the last transactions in the system and are added by\nminers after a block mining process that consists in solving a resource\nconsuming proof-of-work (cryptographic puzzle). The reward is a motivation for\nmining process but also could be an incentive for attacks such as selfish\nmining. In this paper we propose a solution for one of the major problems in\nBitcoin : selfish mining or block-withholding attack. This attack is conducted\nby adversarial or selfish miners in order to either earn undue rewards or waste\nthe computational power of honest miners. Contrary to recent solutions, our\nsolution, ZeroBlock, prevents block-withholding using a technique free of\ntimestamp that can be forged. Moreover, we show that our solution is compliant\nwith nodes churn.",

            "summary": "The digital currency Bitcoin has had remarkable growth since it was first\nproposed in 2008. Its distributed nature allows currency transactions without a\ncentral authority by using cryptographic methods and a data structure called\nthe blockchain. In this paper we use the no-cloning theorem of quantum\nmechanics to introduce Quantum Bitcoin, a Bitcoin-like currency that runs on a\nquantum computer. We show that our construction of quantum shards and two\nblockchains allows untrusted peers to mint quantum money without risking the\nintegrity of the currency. The Quantum Bitcoin protocol has several advantages\nover classical Bitcoin, including immediate local verification of transactions.\nThis is a major improvement since we no longer need the computationally\nintensive and time-consuming method Bitcoin uses to record all transactions in\nthe blockchain. Instead, Quantum Bitcoin only records newly minted currency\nwhich drastically reduces the footprint and increases efficiency. We present\nformal security proofs for counterfeiting resistance and show that a quantum\nbitcoin can be re-used a large number of times before wearing out - just like\nordinary coins and banknotes. Quantum Bitcoin is the first distributed quantum\nmoney system and we show that the lack of a paper trail implies full anonymity\nfor the users. In addition, there are no transaction fees and the system can\nscale to any transaction volume.",

Third, a trustless bootstrapping process for\na new node involves downloading and processing all the transactions ever\nwritten into a blockchain.\n  In this paper we present a new consensus protocol for Bitcoin-like\npeer-to-peer systems where a right to generate a block is given to a party\nproviding non-interactive proofs of storing a subset of the past state\nsnapshots. Unlike the blockchain systems in use today, a network using our\nprotocol is safe if the nodes prune full blocks not needed for mining.\n  We extend the GKL model to describe our Proof-of-Work scheme and a\ntransactional model modifications needed for it.

The key\ninsight that allows Weaver to combine strict serializability with horizontal\nscalability and high performance is a novel request ordering mechanism called\nrefinable timestamps. This technique couples coarse-grained vector timestamps\nwith a fine-grained timeline oracle to pay the overhead of strong consistency\nonly when needed. Experiments show that Weaver enables a Bitcoin blockchain\nexplorer that is 8x faster than Blockchain.info, and achieves 12x higher\nthroughput than the Titan graph database on social network workloads and 4x\nlower latency than GraphLab on offline graph traversal workloads.",

In\nthis paper, we propose several novel contributions to address the\naforementioned issues with PGP and associated Web of Trust. To address the\nsubjectivity of the Web of Trust, we provide a new certificate format based on\nBitcoin which allows a user to verify a PGP certificate using Bitcoin\nidentity-verification transactions - forming first degree trust relationships\nthat are tied to actual values (i.e., number of Bitcoins transferred during\ntransaction).

Each\npurpose is defined in a contract, and the entire economy of contracts is\nstructured in a unified ontology. We claim to secure the ONE network using\neconomically non-arbitrary methodologies and economically incented human\nbehaviour. Decisions influenced by reputation help to secure the network\nwithout an untrusted third party. The stack of contracts, organised in a\nunified ontology, functions as a super recursive algorithm, with individual use\nprogramming the algorithm, acting as the \"oracle\". The state of the algorithm\nbecomes the \"memory\" of a scalable and trustable artificial intelligence (AI).\nThis AI offers a new platform for what we call the \"Autonomy-of-Things\" (AoT).",

We present an\nattack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair\nshare. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational\nminers will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will\nincrease in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system\nceases to be a decentralized currency.\n  Selfish mining is feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose\na practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects against selfish\nmining pools that command less than 1/4 of the resources.
