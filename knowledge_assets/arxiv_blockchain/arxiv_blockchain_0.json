            "summary": "As blockchain smart contracts become more widespread and carry more valuable\ndigital assets, they become an increasingly attractive target for attackers.\nOver the past few years, smart contracts have been subject to a plethora of\ndevastating attacks, resulting in billions of dollars in financial losses.\nThere has been a notable surge of research interest in identifying defects in\nsmart contracts. However, existing smart contract fuzzing tools are still\nunsatisfactory. They struggle to screen out meaningful transaction sequences\nand specify critical inputs for each transaction. As a result, they can only\ntrigger a limited range of contract states, making it difficult to unveil\ncomplicated vulnerabilities hidden in the deep state space.\n  In this paper, we shed light on smart contract fuzzing by employing a\nsequence-aware mutation and seed mask guidance strategy. In particular, we\nfirst utilize data-flow-based feedback to determine transaction orders in a\nmeaningful way and further introduce a sequence-aware mutation technique to\nexplore deeper states. Thereafter, we design a mask-guided seed mutation\nstrategy that biases the generated transaction inputs to hit target branches.\nIn addition, we develop a dynamic-adaptive energy adjustment paradigm that\nbalances the fuzzing resource allocation during a fuzzing campaign. We\nimplement our designs into a new smart contract fuzzer named MuFuzz, and\nextensively evaluate it on three benchmarks. Empirical results demonstrate that\nMuFuzz outperforms existing tools in terms of both branch coverage and bug\nfinding. Overall, MuFuzz achieves higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art\nfuzzers (up to 25%) and detects 30% more bugs than existing bug detectors.",

Although many fields have managed to include\nblockchain in their core functionalities, the adoption of blockchain, in\ngeneral, is constrained by the so-called trilemma trade-off between\ndecentralization, scalability, and security. In our previous work, we have\nshown that using a digital twin for dynamically managing blockchain systems\nduring runtime can be effective in managing the trilemma trade-off. Our Digital\nTwin leverages DDDAS feedback loop, which is responsible for getting the data\nfrom the system to the digital twin, conducting optimisation, and updating the\nphysical system. This paper examines how leveraging DDDAS feedback loop can\nsupport the optimisation component of the trilemma benefiting from\nReinforcement Learning agents and a simulation component to augment the quality\nof the learned model while reducing the computational overhead required for\ndecision-making.",

Users can\nmanipulate their crypto assets by simply sending emails with no need to manage\nkeys. These emails are verified using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) along with\ntheir attached digital signatures that the sender domain server (SDS) generates\naccording to DomainKeys Identified Mail. Unless the SDS forges the emails, the\ncrypto assets remain secure in the proposed system. Moreover, the existing SDSs\ncan be used as is by outsourcing additional work to a third party that is not\nnecessarily trusted. The system supports various functions to manipulate crypto\nassets. We produced a tool for variable-regex mapping (VRM) that enables\ndevelopers to build a new function without ZKP skills. For example, using the\ntool, we built a demo application where users can exchange crypto assets via\nUniswap only with emails.

            "summary": "Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet\ninfrastructure, responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.\nHowever, DNS is vulnerable to some malicious attacks, including DNS cache\npoisoning, which redirects users to malicious websites displaying offensive or\nillegal content. Existing countermeasures often suffer from at least one of the\nfollowing weakness: weak attack resistance, high overhead, or complex\nimplementation. To address these challenges, this paper presents TI-DNS, a\nblockchain-based DNS resolution architecture designed to detect and correct the\nforged DNS records caused by the cache poisoning attacks in the DNS resolution\nprocess. TI-DNS leverages a multi-resolver Query Vote mechanism to ensure the\ncredibility of verified records on the blockchain ledger and a stake-based\nincentive mechanism to promote well-behaved participation. Importantly, TI-DNS\nis easy to be adopted as it only requires modifications to the resolver side of\ncurrent DNS infrastructure. Finally, we develop a prototype and evaluate it\nagainst alternative solutions. The result demonstrates that TI-DNS effectively\nand efficiently solves DNS cache poisoning.",

            "summary": "We study game-theoretic models for capturing participation in blockchain\nsystems. Permissionless blockchains can be naturally viewed as games, where a\nset of potentially interested users is faced with the dilemma of whether to\nengage with the protocol or not. Engagement here implies that the user will be\nasked to complete certain tasks, whenever they are selected to contribute\n(typically according to some stochastic process) and be rewarded if they choose\nto do so. Apart from the basic dilemma of engaging or not, even more strategic\nconsiderations arise in settings where users may be able to declare\nparticipation and then retract before completing their tasks (but are still\nable to receive rewards) or are rewarded independently of whether they\ncontribute. Such variations occur naturally in the blockchain setting due to\nthe complexity of tracking ``on-chain'' the behavior of the participants.\n  We capture these participation considerations offering a series of models\nthat enable us to reason about the basic dilemma, the case where retraction\neffects influence the outcome and the case when payments are given universally\nirrespective of the stochastic process. In all cases we provide\ncharacterization results or necessary conditions on the structure of Nash\nequilibria. Our findings reveal that appropriate reward mechanisms can be used\nto stimulate participation and avoid negative effects of free riding, results\nthat are in line but also can inform real world blockchain system deployments.",

Instead of spamming hashing operations to\nmine blocks, miners will be running Monte Carlo simulations to support a\nreal-world HEP experiment with useful data. The block problems will be defined\nby a Root Authority which is represented by a HEP experiment like CBM. The\nfocus in this publication is a mechanism that allows the Root Authority to\nselect a winner from a list of nodes that solved a block problem. The mechanism\nis designed so that winner selection is deterministic, fair and transparent.\nThis mechanism allows every node to verify the fairness of the winner selection\nprocess without giving the nodes a tool to be able to improve their own winning\nchances.",

Due to the transparency of\npermissionless blockchains, opportunistic traders can compete to earn revenue\nby extracting Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which undermines both the\nconsensus security and efficiency of blockchain systems. The Flashbots bundle\nmechanism further aggravates the MEV competition because it empowers\nopportunistic traders with the capability of designing more sophisticated MEV\nextraction. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on DeFi MEV\nactivities in Flashbots bundle by developing ActLifter, a novel automated tool\nfor accurately identifying DeFi actions in transactions of each bundle, and\nActCluster, a new approach that leverages iterative clustering to facilitate us\nto discover known/unknown DeFi MEV activities. Extensive experimental results\nshow that ActLifter can achieve nearly 100% precision and recall in DeFi action\nidentification, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.\nMoreover, with the help of ActCluster, we obtain many new observations and\ndiscover 17 new kinds of DeFi MEV activities, which occur in 53.12% of bundles\nbut have not been reported in existing studies",

In this paper, we argue how these shortcomings and frictions\nare being mitigated by the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We delve\ninto the workings of smart contracts, the backbone of DeFi transactions, with\nan emphasis on those underpinning token exchange and lending services. We\nhighlight the pros and cons of the novel form of decentralized governance\nintroduced via the ownership of governance tokens. Despite its potential, the\ncurrent DeFi infrastructure introduces operational risks to users, which we\nsegment into five primary categories: consensus mechanisms, protocol, oracle,\nfrontrunning, and systemic risks.

While such methods rely on high-quality and large\nquantities of machine-readable scientific data, the current scientific data\ninfrastructure faces significant challenges that limit effective data curation\nand sharing. These challenges include insufficient return on investment for\nresearchers to share quality data, logistical difficulties in maintaining\nlong-term data repositories, and the absence of standardized methods for\nevaluating the relative importance of various datasets. To address these\nissues, this paper presents the Lennard Jones Token, a blockchain-based\nproof-of-concept solution implemented on the Ethereum network. The token system\nincentivizes users to submit optimized structures of Lennard Jones particles by\noffering token rewards, while also charging for access to these valuable\nstructures. Utilizing smart contracts, the system automates the evaluation of\nsubmitted data, ensuring that only structures with energies lower than those in\nthe existing database for a given cluster size are rewarded. The paper explores\nthe details of the Lennard Jones Token as a proof of concept and proposes\nfuture blockchain-based tokens aimed at enhancing the curation and sharing of\nscientific data.",

            "summary": "Researchers have discovered a series of theoretical attacks against Bitcoin's\nNakamoto consensus; the most damaging ones are selfish mining, double-spending,\nand consistency delay attacks. These attacks have one common cause: block\nwithholding. This paper proposes Crystal, which leverages quorum certificates\nto resist block withholding misbehavior. Crystal continuously elects committees\nfrom miners and requires each block to have a quorum certificate, i.e., a set\nof signatures issued by members of its committee. Consequently, an attacker has\nto publish its blocks to obtain quorum certificates, rendering block\nwithholding impossible. To build Crystal, we design a novel two-round committee\nelection in a Sybil-resistant, unpredictable and non-interactive way, and a\nreward mechanism to incentivize miners to follow the protocol. Our analysis and\nevaluations show that Crystal can significantly mitigate selfish mining and\ndouble-spending attacks. For example, in Bitcoin, an attacker with 30% of the\ntotal computation power will succeed in double-spending attacks with a\nprobability of 15.6% to break the 6-confirmation rule; however, in Crystal, the\nsuccess probability for the same attacker falls to 0.62%. We provide formal\nend-to-end safety proofs for Crystal, ensuring no unknown attacks will be\nintroduced. To the best of our knowledge, Crystal is the first protocol that\nprevents selfish mining and double-spending attacks while providing safety\nproof.",

            "summary": "We study just-in-time (JIT) liquidity provision within blockchain-based\ndecentralized exchanges (DEXs). In contrast to passive liquidity providers\n(LPs) who deposit assets into liquidity pools before observing order flows, JIT\nLPs take a more active approach. They monitor pending orders from public\nblockchain mempools and swiftly supply liquidity, only to withdraw it in the\nsame block. Our game-theoretical analysis uncovers a paradoxical scenario: the\npresence of a JIT LP, rather than enhancing liquidity as expected, can\ninadvertently reduce it. A central reason behind the paradox is the adverse\nselection problem encountered by passive LPs, stemming from the presence of\ninformed arbitrageurs. Unlike passive LPs, JIT LPs have the advantage of\nanalyzing the order flow prior to providing liquidity and block confirmation.\nWe show that this second-mover advantage mitigates their adverse selection\ncosts and potentially crowds out passive LPs, particularly when order flows are\nnot highly elastic to changes in pool liquidity. These equilibrium effects may\nlead to an overall reduction of pool liquidity and to an increased execution\nrisk for liquidity demanders. To alleviate the detrimental effects of JIT\nliquidity, we propose a two-tiered fee structure for passive and JIT LPs. We\nshow that this structure may prevent crowding out and improve welfare.",

The rise\nof blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) underscores this intertwined\nevolution of technology and finance. While DeFi has introduced exciting\nopportunities, it has also exposed the ecosystem to new forms of market\nmisconduct. This paper aims to bridge the academic and regulatory gaps by\naddressing key research questions about market misconduct in DeFi. We begin by\ndiscussing how blockchain technology can potentially enable the emergence of\nnovel forms of market misconduct. We then offer a comprehensive definition and\ntaxonomy for understanding DeFi market misconduct. Through comparative analysis\nand empirical measurements, we examine the novel forms of misconduct in DeFi,\nshedding light on their characteristics and social impact. Subsequently, we\ninvestigate the challenges of building a tailored regulatory framework for\nDeFi. We identify key areas where existing regulatory frameworks may need\nenhancement. Finally, we discuss potential approaches that bring DeFi into the\nregulatory perimeter.",

            "summary": "The Bitcoin scalability problem has led to the development of off-chain\nfinancial mechanisms such as payment channel networks (PCNs) which help users\nprocess transactions of varying amounts, including micro-payment transactions,\nwithout writing each transaction to the blockchain. Since PCNs only allow\npath-based transactions, effective, secure routing protocols that find a path\nbetween a sender and receiver are fundamental to PCN operations. In this paper,\nwe propose RACED, a routing protocol that leverages the idea of Distributed\nHash Tables (DHTs) to route transactions in PCNs in a fast and secure way. Our\nexperiments on real-world transaction datasets show that RACED gives an average\ntransaction success ratio of 98.74%, an average pathfinding time of 31.242\nseconds, which is $1.65*10^3$, $1.8*10^3$, and $4*10^2$ times faster than three\nother recent routing protocols that offer comparable security/privacy\nproperties. We rigorously analyze and prove the security of RACED in the\nUniversal Composability framework.",

            "summary": "Decentralised organisations use blockchains as a basis for governance: they\nuse on-chain transactions to allocate voting weight, publish proposals, cast\nvotes, and enact the results.\n  However, blockchain-based governance structures have challenges, mostly\nnotably, the need to align the short-term outlook of pseudononymous voters with\nthe long-term growth and success of the decentralised organisation. The\nVote-Escrowed Token (veToken) model attempts to resolve this tension by\nrequiring voters to escrow or lock tokens of value for an extended period in\nexchange for voting weight.\n  In this paper, we describe the veToken model and analyse its emergent\noutcomes. We show that voting behaviour follows bribes set by higher-level\nprotocols, and that the cost per vote varies depending on how it is acquired.\nWe describe the implementation of the veToken model by Curve Finance, a popular\nautomated market maker for stablecoins, and the ecosystem of protocols that has\narisen on top of this implementation. We show that voting markets such as\nVotium largely determine the outcome of fortnightly votes held by Convex\nFinance, and we show that Frax Finance, a stablecoin issuer, plays a central\nrole in the ecosystem even though they directly lock relatively few tokens with\nCurve. Instead, they indirectly lock tokens through yield aggregators such as\nConvex Finance and purchase voting weight through voting markets such as\nVotium.\n  Although the veToken model in isolation is straight-forward and easily\nexplained, it leads to many complex and emergent outcomes. Decentralised\norganisations should consider these outcomes before adopting the model.",

Today's conventional perimeter-based systems use\ncredential-based authentication (e.g., username/password, certificates, etc.)\nto decide whether an actor can access a network. However, the verification\nprocess occurs only at the system's perimeter because most IoT devices lack\nrobust security measures due to their limited hardware and software\ncapabilities, making them highly vulnerable. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nnovel approach based on Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) extended with blockchain\nto further enhance security. The blockchain component serves as an immutable\ndatabase for storing users' requests and is used to verify trustworthiness by\nanalyzing and identifying potentially malicious user activities. We discuss the\nframework, processes of the approach, and the experiments carried out on a\ntestbed to validate its feasibility and applicability in the smart city\ncontext.

Various\ncentralized federated learning frameworks like FedML, have emerged in the\ncommunity to help boost the research on FL. However, decentralized\nblockchain-based federated learning framework is still missing, which cause\ninconvenience for researcher to reproduce or verify the algorithm performance\nbased on blockchain.

Reasons for the difficulty of benchmarking\nblockchains include, for example, the high number of system parameters to\nconfigure and the effort to deploy a blockchain network. In addition,\nperformance data, which mostly comes from system vendors, is often\nintransparent. We investigate and evaluate the performance of seven\npermissioned blockchain systems using different parameter settings in a\nreproducible manner. We employ an end-to-end approach, where the clients\nsending the transactions are fully involved in the data collection approach.\nOur results highlight the peculiarities and limitations of the systems under\ninvestigation. Due to the insights given, our work forms the basis for\ncontinued research to optimise the performance of blockchain systems.",

Contrary to popular belief, it raises\nsecurity and privacy issues as it is used to collect data from consumers or\nautomated systems. Numerous articles are published that discuss issues like\ncentralised control systems and potential alternatives like integration with\nblockchain. Although a few recent surveys focused on the challenges and\nsolutions facing the IoT ecosystem, most of them did not concentrate on the\nthreats, difficulties, or blockchain-based solutions. Additionally, none of\nthem focused on blockchain and IoT integration challenges and attacks. In the\ncontext of the IoT ecosystem, overall security measures are very important to\nunderstand the overall challenges. This article summarises difficulties that\nhave been outlined in numerous recent articles and articulates various attacks\nand security challenges in a variety of approaches, including blockchain-based\nsolutions and so on. More clearly, this contribution consolidates threats,\naccess control issues, and remedies in brief. In addition, this research has\nlisted some attacks on public blockchain protocols with some real-life examples\nthat can guide researchers in taking preventive measures for IoT use cases.\nFinally, a future research direction concludes the research gaps by analysing\ncontemporary research contributions.",

            "summary": "With the evolution of blockchain technology, the issue of transaction\nsecurity, particularly on platforms like Ethereum, has become increasingly\ncritical. Front-running attacks, a unique form of security threat, pose\nsignificant challenges to the integrity of blockchain transactions. In these\nattack scenarios, malicious actors monitor other users' transaction activities,\nthen strategically submit their own transactions with higher fees. This ensures\ntheir transactions are executed before the monitored transactions are included\nin the block. The primary objective of this paper is to delve into a\ncomprehensive classification of transactions associated with front-running\nattacks, which aims to equip developers with specific strategies to counter\neach type of attack. To achieve this, we introduce a novel detection method\nnamed FRAD (Front-Running Attacks Detection on Ethereum using Ternary\nClassification Model). This method is specifically tailored for transactions\nwithin decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum, enabling accurate\nclassification of front-running attacks involving transaction displacement,\ninsertion, and suppression. Our experimental validation reveals that the\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier offers the best performance in detecting\nfront-running attacks, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 84.59% and\nF1-score of 84.60%.",

Focusing on news and social\nmedia data, primarily from Twitter and Reddit, we analyse the influence of\npublic sentiment on cryptocurrency valuations using advanced deep learning NLP\nmethods. Alongside conventional price regression, we treat cryptocurrency price\nforecasting as a classification problem. This includes both the prediction of\nprice movements (up or down) and the identification of local extrema. We\ncompare the performance of various ML models, both with and without NLP data\nintegration. Our findings reveal that incorporating NLP data significantly\nenhances the forecasting performance of our models. We discover that\npre-trained models, such as Twitter-RoBERTa and BART MNLI, are highly effective\nin capturing market sentiment, and that fine-tuning Large Language Models\n(LLMs) also yields substantial forecasting improvements. Notably, the BART MNLI\nzero-shot classification model shows considerable proficiency in extracting\nbullish and bearish signals from textual data. All of our models consistently\ngenerate profit across different validation scenarios, with no observed decline\nin profits or reduction in the impact of NLP data over time. The study\nhighlights the potential of text analysis in improving financial forecasts and\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of various NLP techniques in capturing nuanced\nmarket sentiment.",

Our model has a single good that is sold repeatedly every day where\nnew demand for the good arrives every day. The novel element in our model is\nthat all unsatisfied demand from one day remains in the system and is added to\nthe new demand of the next day. Every day there is a new monopolist that gets\nto sell a fixed supply $s$ of the good and naturally chooses to do so at the\nmonopolist's price for the combined demand. What will the dynamics of the\nprices chosen by the sequence of monopolists be? What level of efficiency will\nbe obtained in the long term?\n  We start with a non-strategic analysis of users' behavior and our main result\nshows that prices keep fluctuating wildly and this is an endogenous property of\nthe model and happens even when demand is stable with nothing stochastic in the\nmodel. These price fluctuations underscore the necessity of an analysis under\nstrategic behavior of the users, which we show results in the prices being\nstable at the market equilibrium price.",

This process complicates individual\ntransaction tracing and disrupts many established blockchain analysis\nheuristics. Despite its significance, limited research has been conducted on\nidentifying CoinJoin transactions. Particularly noteworthy are varied CoinJoin\nimplementations such as JoinMarket, Wasabi, and Whirlpool, each presenting\ndistinct challenges due to their unique transaction structures. This study\ndelves deeply into the open-source implementations of these protocols, aiming\nto develop refined heuristics for identifying their transactions on the\nblockchain.

            "summary": "Privacy and security in the parameter transmission process of federated\nlearning are currently among the most prominent concerns. However, there are\ntwo thorny problems caused by unprotected communication methods:\n\"parameter-leakage\" and \"inefficient-communication\". This article proposes\nBlockchain-based Federated Learning (FBChain) model for federated learning\nparameter communication to overcome the above two problems. First, we utilize\nthe immutability of blockchain to store the global model and hash value of\nlocal model parameters in case of tampering during the communication process,\nprotect data privacy by encrypting parameters, and verify data consistency by\ncomparing the hash values of local parameters, thus addressing the\n\"parameter-leakage\" problem. Second, the Proof of Weighted Link Speed (PoWLS)\nconsensus algorithm comprehensively selects nodes with the higher weighted link\nspeed to aggregate global model and package blocks, thereby solving the\n\"inefficient-communication\" problem. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed FBChain model and its ability to improve model\ncommunication efficiency in federated learning.",

            "summary": "We present a secure and private blockchain-based Verifiable Random Function\n(VRF) scheme addressing some limitations of classical VRF constructions. Given\nthe imminent quantum computing adversarial scenario, conventional cryptographic\nmethods face vulnerabilities. To enhance our VRF's secure randomness, we adopt\npost-quantum Ring-LWE encryption for synthesizing pseudo-random sequences.\nConsidering computational costs and resultant on-chain gas costs, we suggest a\nbifurcated architecture for VRF design, optimizing interactions between\non-chain and off-chain. Our approach employs a secure ring signature supported\nby NIZK proof and a delegated key generation method, inspired by the\nChaum-Pedersen equality proof and the Fiat-Shamir Heuristic. Our VRF scheme\nintegrates multi-party computation (MPC) with blockchain-based decentralized\nidentifiers (DID), ensuring both security and randomness. We elucidate the\nsecurity and privacy aspects of our VRF scheme, analyzing temporal and spatial\ncomplexities. We also approximate the entropy of the VRF scheme and detail its\nimplementation in a Solidity contract. Also, we delineate a method for\nvalidating the VRF's proof, matching for the contexts requiring both randomness\nand verification. Conclusively, using the NIST SP800-22 of the statistical\nrandomness test suite, our results exhibit a 98.86% pass rate over 11 test\ncases, with an average p-value of 0.5459 from 176 total tests.",

The Safe-House is badly needed since\nthere are many ongoing hacks and security concerns in the DeFi space right now.\nThe Safe-House is a piece of engineering sophistication that utilizes existing\nblockchain principles to bring about greater security when customer assets are\nmoved around. The Safe-House logic is easily implemented as smart contracts on\nany decentralized system. The amount of funds at risk from both internal and\nexternal parties -- and hence the maximum one time loss -- is guaranteed to\nstay within the specified limits based on cryptographic fundamentals.\n  To improve the safety of the Safe-House even further, we adapt the one time\npassword (OPT) concept to operate using blockchain technology. Well suited to\nblockchain cryptographic nuances, our secondary advancement can be termed the\none time next time password (OTNTP) mechanism. The OTNTP is designed to\ncomplement the Safe-House making it even more safe.\n  We provide a detailed threat assessment model -- discussing the risks faced\nby DeFi protocols and the specific risks that apply to blockchain fund\nmanagement -- and give technical arguments regarding how these threats can be\novercome in a robust manner. We discuss how the Safe-House can participate with\nother external yield generation protocols in a secure way. We provide reasons\nfor why the Safe-House increases safety without sacrificing the efficiency of\noperation. We start with a high level intuitive description of the landscape,\nthe corresponding problems and our solutions.

While efforts have been made to\nimprove DKG communication, practical large scale deployments are still yet to\ncome, due to various challenges including broadcast channel scalability and\nworst-case complaint phase. In this paper, we propose a practical DKG for\nDL-based cryptosystems, with only (quasi-)linear computation/communication cost\nper participant, with the help of a public ledger, and beacon; Notably, our DKG\nonly incurs constant-size blockchain storage cost for broadcast, even in the\nface of worst-case complaints. Moreover, our protocol satisfies adaptive\nsecurity. The key to our improvements lies in delegating the most costly\noperations to an Any-Trust group. This group is randomly sampled and consists\nof a small number of individuals. The population only trusts that at least one\nmember in the group is honest, without knowing which one. Additionally, we\nintroduce an extended broadcast channel based on a blockchain and data\ndispersal network (such as IPFS), enabling reliable broadcasting of\narbitrary-size messages at the cost of constant-size blockchain storage, which\nmay be of independent interest.\n  Our DKG leads to a fully practical instantiation of Filecoin's checkpointing\nmechanism, in which all validators of a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockcahin\nperiodically run DKG and threshold signing to create checkpoints on Bitcoin,\nthereby enhancing the security of the PoS chain. In comparison with another\ncheckpointing approach of Babylon (Oakland, 2023), ours enjoys a significally\nsmaller monetary cost of Bitcoin transaction fees. For a PoS chain with\n$2^{12}$ validators, our cost is merely 0.6\\% of that incurred by Babylon's\napproach.",

            "summary": "Consensus, abstracting a myriad of problems in which processes have to agree\non a single value, is one of the most celebrated problems of fault-tolerant\ndistributed computing. Consensus applications include fundamental services for\nthe environments of the Cloud and Blockchain, and in such challenging\nenvironments, malicious behaviors are often modeled as adversarial Byzantine\nfaults.\n  At OPODIS 2010, Mostefaoui and Raynal (in short MR) presented a\nByzantine-tolerant solution to consensus in which the decided value cannot be a\nvalue proposed only by Byzantine processes. MR has optimal resilience coping\nwith up to t < n/3 Byzantine nodes over n processes. MR provides this\nmultivalued consensus object (which accepts proposals taken from a finite set\nof values) assuming the availability of a single Binary consensus object (which\naccepts proposals taken from the set {0,1}).\n  This work, which focuses on multivalued consensus, aims at the design of an\neven more robust solution than MR. Our proposal expands MR's fault-model with\nself-stabilization, a vigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to\ntolerating Byzantine, self-stabilizing systems can automatically recover after\nthe occurrence of arbitrary transient-faults. These faults represent any\nviolation of the assumptions according to which the system was designed to\noperate (provided that the algorithm code remains intact).\n  To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first self-stabilizing solution\nfor intrusion-tolerant multivalued consensus for asynchronous message-passing\nsystems prone to Byzantine failures. Our solution has a O(t) stabilization time\nfrom arbitrary transient faults.",

            "summary": "Byzantine agreement, arguably the most fundamental problem in distributed\ncomputing, operates among n processes, out of which t < n can exhibit arbitrary\nfailures. The problem states that all correct (non-faulty) processes must\neventually decide (termination) the same value (agreement) from a set of\nadmissible values defined by the proposals of the processes (validity).\nDepending on the exact version of the validity property, Byzantine agreement\ncomes in different forms, from Byzantine broadcast to strong and weak\nconsensus, to modern variants of the problem introduced in today's blockchain\nsystems. Regardless of the specific flavor of the agreement problem, its\ncommunication cost is a fundamental metric whose improvement has been the focus\nof decades of research. The Dolev-Reischuk bound, one of the most celebrated\nresults in distributed computing, proved 40 years ago that, at least for\nByzantine broadcast, no deterministic solution can do better than Omega(t^2)\nexchanged messages in the worst case. Since then, it remained unknown whether\nthe quadratic lower bound extends to seemingly weaker variants of Byzantine\nagreement. This paper answers the question in the affirmative, closing this\nlong-standing open problem. Namely, we prove that any non-trivial agreement\nproblem requires Omega(t^2) messages to be exchanged in the worst case. To\nprove the general lower bound, we determine the weakest Byzantine agreement\nproblem and show, via a novel indistinguishability argument, that it incurs\nOmega(t^2) exchanged messages.",

To support CAS applications such as AI-driven decision-making\nand blockchain-based smart data management platform, data and message\nexchange/dissemination is a fundamental element. The distributed message\nbroadcast and forward protocols in CAS, such as vehicular ad hoc networks\n(VANET), can suffer from significant message loss and uncertain transmission\ndelay, and faulty nodes might disseminate fake messages to confuse the network.\nTherefore, the consensus mechanism is essential in CAS with distributed\nstructure to guaranteed correct nodes agree on the same parameter and reach\nconsistency. However, due to the wireless nature of CAS, traditional consensus\ncannot be directly deployed. This article reviews several existing consensus\nmechanisms, including average/maximum/minimum estimation consensus mechanisms\nthat apply on quantity, Byzantine fault tolerance consensus for request, state\nmachine replication (SMR) and blockchain, as well as their implementations in\nCAS. To deploy wireless-adapted consensus, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph\n(DAG)-based message structure to build a non-equivocation data dissemination\nprotocol for CAS, which has resilience against message loss and unpredictable\nforwarding latency. Finally, we enhance this protocol by developing a\ntwo-dimension DAG-based strategy to achieve partial order for blockchain and\ntotal order for the distributed service model SMR.",

First, we\npropose a new blockchain based federated learning architecture that utilizes\nthe well-tested proof-of-stake consensus mechanism on an existing blockchain\nnetwork to select validators and miners to aggregate the participants' updates\nand compute the blocks. Second, to ensure the robustness of the aggregation\nprocess, we design a novel softmax aggregation method based on approximated\npopulation loss values that relies on our specific blockchain architecture.\nAdditionally, we show our softmax aggregation technique converges to the global\nminimum in the convex setting with non-restricting assumptions. Our\ncomprehensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing robust\naggregation algorithms in various settings by large margins.",

            "summary": "Data from interconnected vehicles may contain sensitive information such as\nlocation, driving behavior, personal identifiers, etc. Without adequate\nsafeguards, sharing this data jeopardizes data privacy and system security. The\ncurrent centralized data-sharing paradigm in these systems raises particular\nconcerns about data privacy. Recognizing these challenges, the shift towards\ndecentralized interactions in technology, as echoed by the principles of\nIndustry 5.0, becomes paramount. This work is closely aligned with these\nprinciples, emphasizing decentralized, human-centric, and secure technological\ninteractions in an interconnected vehicular ecosystem. To embody this, we\npropose a practical approach that merges two emerging technologies: Federated\nLearning (FL) and Blockchain. The integration of these technologies enables the\ncreation of a decentralized vehicular network. In this setting, vehicles can\nlearn from each other without compromising privacy while also ensuring data\nintegrity and accountability. Initial experiments show that compared to\nconventional decentralized federated learning techniques, our proposed approach\nsignificantly enhances the performance and security of vehicular networks. The\nsystem's accuracy stands at 91.92\\%. While this may appear to be low in\ncomparison to state-of-the-art federated learning models, our work is\nnoteworthy because, unlike others, it was achieved in a malicious vehicle\nsetting. Despite the challenging environment, our method maintains high\naccuracy, making it a competent solution for preserving data privacy in\nvehicular networks.",

            "summary": "Access control is a critical component of computer security, governing access\nto system resources. However, designing policies and roles in traditional\naccess control can be challenging and difficult to maintain in dynamic and\ncomplex systems, which is particularly problematic for organizations with\nnumerous resources. Furthermore, traditional methods suffer from issues such as\nthird-party involvement, inefficiency, and privacy gaps, making transparent and\ndynamic access control an ongoing research problem. Moreover detecting\nmalicious activities and identifying users who are not behaving appropriately\ncan present notable difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose\nDLACB, a Deep Learning Based Access Control Using Blockchain, as a solution to\ndecentralized access control. DLACB uses blockchain to provide transparency,\ntraceability, and reliability in various domains such as medicine, finance, and\ngovernment while taking advantage of deep learning to not rely on predefined\npolicies and eventually automate access control. With the integration of\nblockchain and deep learning for access control, DLACB can provide a general\nframework applicable to various domains, enabling transparent and reliable\nlogging of all transactions. As all data is recorded on the blockchain, we have\nthe capability to identify malicious activities. We store a list of malicious\nactivities in the storage system and employ a verification algorithm to\ncross-reference it with the blockchain. We conduct measurements and comparisons\nof the smart contract processing time for the deployed access control system in\ncontrast to traditional access control methods, determining the time overhead\ninvolved. The processing time of DLBAC demonstrates remarkable stability when\nexposed to increased request volumes.",

However, some properties, such as the transaction processing\nthroughput remained limited, especially in Proof-of-Work blockchains.\nTherefore, several promising directions, such as sharding designs and DAG-based\nprotocols emerged. In this paper, we focus on DAG-based consensus protocols and\npresent a discrete-event simulator for them. Our simulator can simulate\nrealistic blockchain networks created from data of a Bitcoin network, while its\nnetwork configuration and topology can be customized. The simulated network\nconsists of honest and malicious miners. Malicious miners do not make any\nattack on consensus itself. Instead, they use a different transaction selection\nstrategy than honest miners (who select transactions randomly) with the\nintention to earn unfairly more profits than honest miners at the cost of\ndowngrading the protocol performance by duplicate transactions. As a\nconsequence, this harms the performance of some DAG-based protocols (e.g.,\nPHANTOM and GHOSTDAG) in terms of transaction processing throughput, which we\ndemonstrate in our experiments and extend the results of the related work that\ncontains a small-scale network of 10 nodes by the results obtained on a\nlarge-scale network with 7000 nodes.

At a technical level, our results\ngeneralize the framework for hybrid quantum-classical search algorithms\nproposed by Rosmanis. Namely, for an arbitrary distribution $D$ on Boolean\nfunctions, the probability an algorithm equipped with $\\tau_c$ classical and\n$\\tau_q$ quantum queries succeeds in finding a preimage of $1$ for a function\nsampled from $D$ is at most $\\nu_D \\cdot(2\\sqrt{\\tau_c} + 2\\tau_q + 1)^2$,\nwhere $\\nu_D$ captures the average (over $D$) fraction of preimages of $1$. As\napplications of our hardness results, we first revisit and generalize the\nsecurity of the Bitcoin protocol called the Bitcoin backbone, to a setting\nwhere the adversary has both quantum and classical capabilities, presenting a\nnew hybrid honest majority condition necessary for the protocol to properly\noperate. Secondly, we examine the generic security of hash functions against\nhybrid adversaries. Regarding our second contribution, we design a hybrid\nalgorithm which first spends all of its classical queries and in the second\nstage runs a ``modified Grover'' where the initial state depends on the\ndistribution $D$.

This article explores how smart contracts and blockchain can be used\nto create a transparent and secure ledger for tracking charitable donations. We\ndiscuss the limitations of traditional donation systems and how a\nblockchain-based system can help overcome these challenges. We describe how\nsmart contracts work, how they can be used in donation tracking, and the\nbenefits they offer, including automated processes, reduced transaction fees,\nand increased accountability. We also discuss how blockchain technology\nprovides a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger that can increase transparency\nand help prevent fraud. Finally, we examine some of the challenges that must be\naddressed when implementing a smart contract-based donation tracking system,\nsuch as the need for technical expertise and the potential for security\nbreaches. Overall, a donation-tracking system using smart contracts and\nblockchain has the potential to increase trust and accountability in the\ndonation process, which can ultimately help ensure that donations are used for\ntheir intended purposes.",

Existing definitions of\ndecentralization, however-the 'D' in DAO-fall short of capturing key properties\ncharacteristic of diverse and equitable participation. We propose a new metric\ncalled Voting-Bloc Entropy (VBE, pronounced ''vibe'') that formalizes a broad\nnotion of decentralization in voting on DAO proposals. VBE measures the\nsimilarity of participants' utility functions across a set of proposals. We use\nVBE to prove a number of results about the decentralizing effects of vote\ndelegation, proposal bundling, bribery, and quadratic voting. Our results lead\nto practical suggestions for enhancing DAO decentralization. One of our results\nhighlights the risk of systemic bribery with increasing DAO decentralization.\nTo show that this threat is realistic, we present the first practical\nrealization of a Dark DAO, a proposed mechanism for privacy-preserving\ncorruption of identity systems, including those used in DAO voting. Our\nDark-DAO prototype uses trusted execution environments (TEEs) in the Oasis\nSapphire blockchain for attacks on Ethereum DAOs. It demonstrates that Dark\nDAOs constitute a realistic future concern for DAO governance.",

One promising avenue for achieving this vision is through fully\non-chain (FOC) games, where both game state and logic reside on the blockchain,\nmaximizing composability. However, we must grapple with inherent limitations\nand trade-offs, particularly in terms of costs and scalability. This paper\nproposes BOLT, a framework that leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to\nscale FOC games without state fragmentation or compromised trust assumptions.\nThe framework introduces a systematic approach for discovering, utilizing, and\npublishing modular pieces of logic as components deeply rooted in the\nEntity-Component-System (ECS) pattern. To enhance scalability and resource\noptimization, we introduce the concept of Ephemeral Rollups (ERs) that overcome\nthe tradeoffs of L2s horizontal scaling.

Facing this challenge, we propose RecAGT, a novel\nidentification scheme aimed at reducing communication overhead and identifying\npotential malicious nodes. First, shard testable codes are designed to encode\nthe original data in case of a leak of confidential data. Second, a new\nidentity proof protocol is presented as evidence against malicious behavior.\nFinally, adaptive group testing is chosen to identify malicious nodes. Notably,\nour work focuses on the internal operation within the committee and can thus be\napplied to any sharding permissioned blockchains.

The blockchain (BC) guarantees task-offloading\nprivacy, but cost reduction, queueing delays, and redundancy elimination remain\nopen problems. This paper presents a redundancy-aware BC-based approach for the\nmetaverse's partial computation offloading (PCO). Specifically, we formulate a\njoint BC redundancy factor (BRF) and PCO problem to minimize computation costs,\nmaximize incentives, and meet delay and BC offloading constraints. We proved\nthis problem is NP-hard and transformed it into two subproblems based on their\ntemporal correlation: real-time PCO and Markov decision process-based BRF. We\nformulated the PCO problem as a multiuser game, proposed a decentralized\nalgorithm for Nash equilibrium under any BC redundancy state, and designed a\ndouble deep Q-network-based algorithm for the optimal BRF policy. The BRF\nstrategy is updated periodically based on user computation demand and network\nstatus to assist the PCO algorithm. The experimental results suggest that the\nproposed approach outperforms existing schemes, resulting in a remarkable 47%\nreduction in cost overhead, delivering approximately 64% higher rewards, and\nachieving convergence in just a few training episodes.",

The outcome of our work is a system capable\nof establishing a tokenomics framework that caters to the needs and\nfunctionalities of both investors and operators.

            "summary": "Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way information is propagated in\ndecentralized networks. Ethereum plays a pivotal role in facilitating smart\ncontracts and decentralized applications. Understanding information propagation\ndynamics in Ethereum is crucial for ensuring network efficiency, security, and\nscalability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes\nGraph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to analyze the information propagation\npatterns in the Ethereum network. The first phase of our research involves data\ncollection from the Ethereum blockchain, consisting of blocks, transactions,\nand node degrees. We construct a transaction graph representation using\nadjacency matrices to capture the node embeddings; while our major contribution\nis to develop a combined Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) model to optimize the network efficiency and scalability. It\nlearns the best actions to take in various network states, ultimately leading\nto improved network efficiency, throughput, and optimize gas limits for block\nprocessing. In the experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of our\nmodel on a large-scale Ethereum dataset. We investigate effectively aggregating\ninformation from neighboring nodes capturing graph structure and updating node\nembeddings using GCN with the objective of transaction pattern prediction,\naccounting for varying network loads and number of blocks. Not only we design a\ngas limit optimization model and provide the algorithm, but also to address\nscalability, we demonstrate the use and implementation of sparse matrices in\nGraphConv, GraphSAGE, and GAT. The results indicate that our designed GAT-RL\nmodel achieves superior results compared to other GCN models in terms of\nperformance. It effectively propagates information across the network,\noptimizing gas limits for block processing and improving network efficiency.",

Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) holds significant diagnostic potential, but its effective analysis\nremains a formidable task. This study introduces a groundbreaking decentralized\nexpert system that cleverly combines blockchain technology with Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) to integrate robust anomaly detection for patient-submitted\ndata.\n  Traditional diagnostic methods often lead to delayed and imprecise\npredictions, especially in the early stages of the disease. Centralized data\nrepositories struggle to manage the immense volumes of MRI data, and persistent\nprivacy concerns hinder collaborative efforts. Our innovative solution\nharnesses decentralization to protect data integrity and patient privacy,\nfacilitated by blockchain technology. It not only emphasizes AI-driven MRI\nanalysis but also incorporates a sophisticated data anomaly detection\narchitecture. These mechanisms scrutinize patient-contributed data for various\nissues, including data quality problems and atypical findings within MRI\nimages.\n  Conducting an exhaustive check of MRI image correctness and quality directly\non the blockchain is impractical due to computational complexity and cost\nconstraints. Typically, such checks are performed off-chain, and the blockchain\nsecurely records the results. This comprehensive approach empowers our\ndecentralized app to provide more precise early-stage Alzheimer's Disease\npredictions.

While prior research\nhas explored the potential of NLP tools in social media sentiment analysis, a\ngap persists in understanding the sentiment landscape of blockchain governance\ncommunities. The evolving discourse and sentiment dynamics on the forums of top\nDAOs remain largely unknown. This paper delves deep into the evolving discourse\nand sentiment dynamics on the public forums of leading DeFi projects -- Aave,\nUniswap, Curve Dao, Aragon, Yearn.finance, Merit Circle, and Balancer --\nplacing a primary focus on discussions related to governance issues. Despite\ndiffering activity patterns, participants across these decentralized\ncommunities consistently express positive sentiments in their Discord\ndiscussions, indicating optimism towards governance decisions. Additionally,\nour research suggests a potential interplay between discussion intensity and\nsentiment dynamics, indicating that higher discussion volumes may contribute to\nmore stable and positive emotions. The insights gained from this study are\nvaluable for decision-makers in blockchain governance, underscoring the pivotal\nrole of sentiment analysis in interpreting community emotions and its evolving\nimpact on the landscape of blockchain governance.

This method provides accountability of\naccess, comprehensive records that are permanently maintained in IPFS, and\nverifiable provenance for creating, distributing, and accessing certificates.\nIt also makes it possible to share certificates more safely and efficiently. By\nincorporating trust factors through data provenance, our system provides a\ncountermeasure against issues such as fake and duplicate certificates. It\naddresses the challenge of the traditional certificate verification processes,\nwhich are lengthy manual process. With this system, students can manage and\nvalidate their academic credentials from multiple institutions in one location\nwhile ensuring authenticity and confidentiality using digital signatures and\nhashing for data protection against unauthorized access.

For this, we\nconducted a tertiary study that scrutinized 37 secondary studies published from\n2012 to 2023, from which we found 36 interoperability types associated with 117\ndifferent definitions, besides 13 interoperability models and six frameworks in\nvarious domains. This panorama reveals that the concern with interoperability\nhas migrated from technical to social-technical issues going beyond the\nsoftware systems' boundary and still requiring solving many open issues. We\nalso address the urgent actions and also potential research opportunities to\nleverage interoperability as a multidisciplinary research field to achieve\nlow-coupled, cost-effective, and interoperable systems.",

In the present\nwork we study capitalization, floor price, the number of transactions, the\ninter-transaction times, and the transaction volume value of a few selected\npopular token collections. The results show that the fluctuations of all these\nquantities are characterized by heavy-tailed probability distribution\nfunctions, in most cases well described by the stretched exponentials, with a\ntrace of power-law scaling at times, long-range memory, and in several cases\neven the fractal organization of fluctuations, mostly restricted to the larger\nfluctuations, however. We conclude that the NFT market - even though young and\ngoverned by a somewhat different mechanisms of trading - shares several\nstatistical properties with the regular financial markets. However, some\ndifferences are visible in the specific quantitative indicators.",

            "summary": "In today's world, secure and efficient biometric authentication is of keen\nimportance. Traditional authentication methods are no longer considered\nreliable due to their susceptibility to cyber-attacks. Biometric\nauthentication, particularly fingerprint authentication, has emerged as a\npromising alternative, but it raises concerns about the storage and use of\nbiometric data, as well as centralized storage, which could make it vulnerable\nto cyber-attacks. In this paper, a novel blockchain-based fingerprint\nauthentication system is proposed that integrates zk-SNARKs, which are\nzero-knowledge proofs that enable secure and efficient authentication without\nrevealing sensitive biometric information. A KNN-based approach on the FVC2002,\nFVC2004 and FVC2006 datasets is used to generate a cancelable template for\nsecure, faster, and robust biometric registration and authentication which is\nstored using the Interplanetary File System. The proposed approach provides an\naverage accuracy of 99.01%, 98.97% and 98.52% over the FVC2002, FVC2004 and\nFVC2006 datasets respectively for fingerprint authentication. Incorporation of\nzk-SNARK facilitates smaller proof size. Overall, the proposed method has the\npotential to provide a secure and efficient solution for blockchain-based\nidentity management.",

A secured identity management system ensures both security and the\nefficient provision of services for the host nation and the donor\norganizations.

The research studies\npresented the introductory, conceptual, and practical solution related to the\nblockchain-based smart contract. There is a common agreement in the studies\nthat blockchain-based smart contract not only streamlines refugee identity\nverification but also safeguards against unauthorized entries. Since it is a\ntechnology as well, it has been essential to know the present status of the\ntechnology in the social context. In such a situation it becomes essential to\nreview the existing research studies to provide insight for future studies. In\nthis study, we reviewed current studies using a thematic approach. Our findings\nsuggest researchers are more inclined to provide conceptual models as the\nmodels are important in advancing technology; however, the models need to be\nimplemented for practical advances. However, the main contribution of this\nstudy is that this study gathers current efforts in smart contract-based\nrefugee identity management.

We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that\nhappened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder\ntook over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to\nleave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event\nin the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive\nimpact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to\ntakeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to\ntakeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its\nunderlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate\nto resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the\ncurrent active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical\nupper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly\ndifferent. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the\npassive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the\ndiversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity\non takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our\nstudy provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance\nand suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any\nblockchain that implements this governance model.",

            "summary": "Sui Lutris is the first smart-contract platform to sustainably achieve\nsub-second finality. It achieves this significant decrease in latency by\nemploying consensusless agreement not only for simple payments but for a large\nvariety of transactions. Unlike prior work, Sui Lutris neither compromises\nexpressiveness nor throughput and can run perpetually without restarts. Sui\nLutris achieves this by safely integrating consensuless agreement with a\nhigh-throughput consensus protocol that is invoked out of the critical finality\npath but makes sure that when a transaction is at risk of inconsistent\nconcurrent accesses its settlement is delayed until the total ordering is\nresolved. Building such a hybrid architecture is especially delicate during\nreconfiguration events, where the system needs to preserve the safety of the\nconsensusless path without compromising the long-term liveness of potentially\nmisconfigured clients. We thus develop a novel reconfiguration protocol, the\nfirst to show the safe and efficient reconfiguration of a consensusless\nblockchain. Sui Lutris is currently running in production as part of a major\nsmart-contract platform. Combined with the Move Programming language it enables\nthe safe execution of smart contracts that expose objects as a first-class\nresource. In our experiments Sui Lutris achieves latency lower than 0.5 seconds\nfor throughput up to 5,000 certificates per second (150k ops/s with bundling),\ncompared to the state-of-the-art real-world consensus latencies of 3 seconds.\nFurthermore, it gracefully handles validators crash-recovery and does not\nsuffer visible performance degradation during reconfiguration.",

By\nintegrating GAI into modern Internet of Things (IoT), Generative Internet of\nThings (GIoT) is emerging and holds immense potential to revolutionize various\naspects of society, enabling more efficient and intelligent IoT applications,\nsuch as smart surveillance and voice assistants. In this article, we present\nthe concept of GIoT and conduct an exploration of its potential prospects.\nSpecifically, we first overview four GAI techniques and investigate promising\nGIoT applications. Then, we elaborate on the main challenges in enabling GIoT\nand propose a general GAI-based secure incentive mechanism framework to address\nthem, in which we adopt Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) for incentive\nmechanism designs and apply blockchain technologies for secure GIoT management.\nMoreover, we conduct a case study on modern Internet of Vehicle traffic\nmonitoring, which utilizes GDMs to generate effective contracts for\nincentivizing users to contribute sensing data with high quality. Finally, we\nsuggest several open directions worth investigating for the future popularity\nof GIoT.",

However, these\nframeworks often need more comprehensiveness and generality, particularly in\nadopting a distributed applications' cross-layer approach. This work analyses\nin detail the requirements for distributed systems assessment. We summarize\nthese findings into a structured methodology and experimentation framework\ncalled METHODA. Our approach emphasizes setting up and assessing a broader\nspectrum of distributed systems and addresses a notable research gap. We\nshowcase the effectiveness of the framework by evaluating four distinct systems\nand their interaction, leveraging a diverse set of eight carefully selected\nmetrics and 12 essential parameters. Through experimentation and analysis we\ndemonstrate the framework's capabilities to provide valuable insights across\nvarious use cases. For instance, we identify that a combination of Trusted\nExecution Environments with threshold signature scheme FROST introduces minimal\noverhead on the performance with average latency around \\SI{40}{\\ms}. We\nshowcase an emulation of realistic systems behavior, e.g., Maximal Extractable\nValue is possible and could be used to further model such dynamics.

However, the additional\nlatency between executing and committing transactions, due to Fabric's\nthree-phase transaction lifecycle of Execute-Order-Validate (EOV), is a\npotential scalability bottleneck. The added latency increases the probability\nof concurrent updates on the same keys by different transactions, leading to\ntransaction failures caused by Fabric's concurrency control mechanism. The\ntransaction failures increase the application development complexity and\ndecrease Fabric's throughput. Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs)\nprovide a solution for merging and resolving conflicts in the presence of\nconcurrent updates. In this work, we introduce FabricCRDT, an approach for\nintegrating CRDTs to Fabric. Our evaluations show that in general, FabricCRDT\noffers higher throughput of successful transactions than Fabric, while\nsuccessfully committing and merging all conflicting transactions without any\nfailures.",

The\nDPoS consensus algorithm has emerged as a popular choice due to its fast\ntransaction processing and high throughput. Despite these advantages, the\nalgorithm still suffers from weaknesses such as centralization and\nvulnerability to long-range attacks, which can compromise the integrity of the\nblockchain network.\n  To combat these problems, we developed an Enhanced Anti-Long-Range Attack\nDPoS algorithm (HL-DPoS). First, we split nodes into pieces to reduce\ncentralization issues while giving witness nodes the power to report and\nbenefit from malicious node's reports, maintaining high efficiency and high\nsecurity. Second, we propose a validation method in HL-DPoS that compares\nconsensuses transactions with the longest chain to detect long-range attacks.\nAlgorithm analysis and simulation experiment results demonstrate that our\nHL-DPoS consensus algorithm improves security while achieving better consensus\nperformance.",

            "summary": "With the increasing importance of machine learning, the privacy and security\nof training data have become critical. Federated learning, which stores data in\ndistributed nodes and shares only model parameters, has gained significant\nattention for addressing this concern. However, a challenge arises in federated\nlearning due to the Byzantine Attack Problem, where malicious local models can\ncompromise the global model's performance during aggregation. This article\nproposes the Blockchain-based Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning (BRLF) model\nthat combines federated learning with blockchain technology. This integration\nenables traceability of malicious models and provides incentives for locally\ntrained clients. Our approach involves selecting the aggregation node based on\nPearson's correlation coefficient, and we perform spectral clustering and\ncalculate the average gradient within each cluster, validating its accuracy\nusing local dataset of the aggregation nodes. Experimental results on public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior byzantine robustness of our secure\naggregation algorithm compared to other baseline byzantine robust aggregation\nmethods, and proved our proposed model effectiveness in addressing the resource\nconsumption problem.",

It allows for both efficient\nmembership and non-membership proofs. It has been widely used as an\nauthenticated data structure in various applications, such as layer-2 rollups\nfor blockchains. zkSync Lite, a popular Ethereum layer-2 rollup solution, uses\na sparse Merkle tree to represent the state of the layer-2 blockchain. The\naccount information is recorded in the leaves of the tree. In this paper, we\nstudy the sparse Merkle tree algorithms presented in zkSync Lite, and propose\nan efficient batch update algorithm to calculate a new root hash given a list\nof account (leaf) operations. Using the construction in zkSync Lite as a\nbenchmark, our algorithm 1) improves the account update time from\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and 2) reduces the batch update cost\nby half using a one-pass traversal.

As the sentiment expressed on social media platforms can\nsignificantly influence cryptocurrency discussions and market movements,\nsentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial tool for understanding public\nopinion and predicting market trends. Motivated by the aim to enhance sentiment\nanalysis accuracy in the cryptocurrency domain, this paper investigates\nfine-tuning techniques on large language models. This paper also investigates\nthe efficacy of supervised fine-tuning and instruction-based fine-tuning on\nlarge language models for unseen tasks. Experimental results demonstrate a\nsignificant average zero-shot performance gain of 40% after fine-tuning,\nhighlighting the potential of this technique in optimizing pre-trained language\nmodel efficiency. Additionally, the impact of instruction tuning on models of\nvarying scales is examined, revealing that larger models benefit from\ninstruction tuning, achieving the highest average accuracy score of 75.16%. In\ncontrast, smaller-scale models may experience reduced generalization due to the\ncomplete utilization of model capacity. To gain deeper insight about how\ninstruction works with these language models, this paper presents an\nexperimental investigation into the response of an instruction-based model\nunder different instruction tuning setups. The investigation demonstrates that\nthe model achieves an average accuracy score of 72.38% for short and simple\ninstructions. This performance significantly outperforms its accuracy under\nlong and complex instructions by over 12%, thereby effectively highlighting the\nprofound significance of instruction characteristics in maximizing model\nperformance.",

            "summary": "The generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) use billions of parameters to extensively analyse large datasets\nand extract critical private information such as, context, specific details,\nidentifying information etc. This have raised serious threats to user privacy\nand reluctance to use such tools. This article proposes the conceptual model\ncalled PrivChatGPT, a privacy-preserving model for LLMs that consists of two\nmain components i.e., preserving user privacy during the data\ncuration/pre-processing together with preserving private context and the\nprivate training process for large-scale data. To demonstrate its\napplicability, we show how a private mechanism could be integrated into the\nexisting model for training LLMs to protect user privacy; specifically, we\nemployed differential privacy and private training using Reinforcement Learning\n(RL). We measure the privacy loss and evaluate the measure of uncertainty or\nrandomness once differential privacy is applied. It further recursively\nevaluates the level of privacy guarantees and the measure of uncertainty of\npublic database and resources, during each update when new information is added\nfor training purposes. To critically evaluate the use of differential privacy\nfor private LLMs, we hypothetically compared other mechanisms e..g, Blockchain,\nprivate information retrieval, randomisation, for various performance measures\nsuch as the model performance and accuracy, computational complexity, privacy\nvs. utility etc. We conclude that differential privacy, randomisation, and\nobfuscation can impact utility and performance of trained models, conversely,\nthe use of ToR, Blockchain, and PIR may introduce additional computational\ncomplexity and high training latency.

The scam revolves around Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) arbitrage and\naims to lure victims into executing a so-called \"bot contract\" to steal funds\nfrom them.\n  To collect the scam at a large scale, we developed a fully automated scam\ndetection system named CryptoScamHunter, which continuously collects YouTube\nvideos and automatically detects scams. Meanwhile, CryptoScamHunter can\ndownload the source code of the bot contract from the provided links and\nextract the associated scam cryptocurrency address. Through deploying\nCryptoScamHunter from Jun. 2022 to Jun. 2023, we have detected 10,442 arbitrage\nbot scam videos published from thousands of YouTube accounts. Our analysis\nreveals that different strategies have been utilized in spreading the scam,\nincluding crafting popular accounts, registering spam accounts, and using\nobfuscation tricks to hide the real scam address in the bot contracts.\nMoreover, from the scam videos we have collected over 800 malicious bot\ncontracts with source code and extracted 354 scam addresses. By further\nexpanding the scam addresses with a similar contract matching technique, we\nhave obtained a total of 1,697 scam addresses. Through tracing the transactions\nof all scam addresses on the Ethereum mainnet and Binance Smart Chain, we\nreveal that over 25,000 victims have fallen prey to this scam, resulting in a\nfinancial loss of up to 15 million USD.\n  Overall, our work sheds light on the dissemination tactics and censorship\nevasion strategies adopted in the arbitrage bot scam, as well as on the scale\nand impact of such a scam on online social networks and blockchain platforms,\nemphasizing the urgent need for effective detection and prevention mechanisms\nagainst such fraudulent activity.",

Furthermore, emerging blockchain technology like Sui Network\nenhances the efficiency of smart contracts by eliminating traditional web3\nbarriers, such as inefficiencies and expensive transaction fees. This unlocks\nthe potential for extensive decentralized gaming applications.\n  This paper aims to provide insights into designing a fair, verifiable, and\nefficient smart contract game on blockchain by the example of building raffles\non the Sui Network. We explore efficient methods for implementing randomness on\nsmart contracts, including DRAND committee-based decentralized random beacons\nand single private-key-based verifiable random functions (VRF).

To mitigate this gap, we\ninstantiate a live graph with NFT transaction network and investigate its\ndynamics to provide new observations and insights. Specifically, through\ndownloading and parsing the NFT transaction activities, we obtain a temporal\ngraph with more than 4.5 million nodes and 124 million edges. Then, a series of\nmeasurements are presented to understand the properties of the NFT ecosystem.\nThrough comparisons with social, citation, and web networks, our analyses give\nintriguing findings and point out potential directions for future exploration.\nFinally, we also study machine learning models in this live graph to enrich the\ncurrent datasets and provide new opportunities for the graph community. The\nsource codes and dataset are available at https://livegraphlab.github.io.",

This\nvoluminous data stream requires a significant amount of network bandwidth and\nextensive storage infrastructure. Additionally, local data processing demands\nsubstantial manpower and hardware investments. Data isolation across different\nhealthcare institutions hinders cross-institutional collaboration in clinics\nand research. In this work, we anticipate an innovative MRI system and its four\ngenerations that integrate emerging distributed cloud computing, 6G bandwidth,\nedge computing, federated learning, and blockchain technology. This system is\ncalled Cloud-MRI, aiming at solving the problems of MRI data storage security,\ntransmission speed, AI algorithm maintenance, hardware upgrading, and\ncollaborative work. The workflow commences with the transformation of k-space\nraw data into the standardized Imaging Society for Magnetic Resonance in\nMedicine Raw Data (ISMRMRD) format. Then, the data are uploaded to the cloud or\nedge nodes for fast image reconstruction, neural network training, and\nautomatic analysis. Then, the outcomes are seamlessly transmitted to clinics or\nresearch institutes for diagnosis and other services. The Cloud-MRI system will\nsave the raw imaging data, reduce the risk of data loss, facilitate\ninter-institutional medical collaboration, and finally improve diagnostic\naccuracy and work efficiency.",

Works like Bitcoin and the Sleepy Model have\nset the stage for this developing framework.\n  Notable contributions from Momose and Ren (CCS 2022) and subsequent works\nhave introduced Total-Order Broadcast protocols leveraging Graded Agreement\nprimitives and supporting dynamic participation, though often requiring\nmultiple rounds of voting per decision -- a potential bottleneck for real-world\nlarge-scale systems.\n  Addressing this, our paper presents a novel Total-Order Broadcast protocol in\nthe Sleepy Model resilient to up to 1/2 adversarial participants, requiring\njust a single round of voting per decision.

In this work, we bridge this gap by discussing the shortcomings of\npermissionless cross-chain relaying systems and identifying three issues that\nadversely impact their performance, scalability and security. We take the first\nstep towards addressing issues that hinder performance and scalability by\nproposing a novel protocol to enable coordination among independent relayers.\nAdditionally, we provide an in-depth discussion about the trade-offs associated\nwith the design of relayer coordination protocols for permissionless settings.\nThrough this work we provide a foundation for improving cross-chain relaying\nservices.",

This paper focuses on\nprotecting the lowest level layer in the blockchain, particularly the P2P\nnetwork that allows the nodes to communicate and share information.

This\nlayer is prone to threats inherited from traditional P2P networks, and it must\nbe analyzed and understood by collecting data and extracting insights from the\nnetwork behavior to reduce those risks. We introduce Tikuna, an open-source\ntool for monitoring and detecting potential attacks on the Ethereum blockchain\nP2P network, at an early stage. Tikuna employs an unsupervised Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) method based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect attacks\nand alert users. Empirical results indicate that the proposed approach\nsignificantly improves detection performance, with the ability to detect and\nclassify attacks, including eclipse attacks, Covert Flash attacks, and others\nthat target the Ethereum blockchain P2P network layer, with high accuracy.

Current internet platforms strive to counter this through\nverification algorithms, but these efforts find themselves in a continuous\ntug-of-war with counterfeit actions.\n  Exploiting the transparency, immutability, and traceability of blockchain\ntechnology, this paper introduces a robust reputation voting system grounded in\nit. Unlike existing blockchain-based reputation systems, our model harnesses an\nintrinsically economically incentivized approach to bolster agent integrity. We\noptimize this model to mirror real-world user behavior, preserving the\nreputation system's foundational sustainability. Through Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, using both uniform and power-law distributions enabled by an\ninnovative inverse transform method, we traverse a broad parameter landscape,\nreplicating real-world complexity. The findings underscore the promise of a\nsustainable, transparent, and formidable reputation mechanism. Given its\nstructure, our framework can potentially function as a universal, sustainable\noracle for offchain-onchain bridging, aiding entities in perpetually\ncultivating their reputation. Future integration with technologies like Ring\nSignature and Zero Knowledge Proof could amplify the system's privacy facets,\nrendering it particularly influential in the ever-evolving digital domain.",

For\nefficient P2P trading, a free market for trading needs to be established while\nensuring the information reliability, security, and privacy. Blockchain has\nbeen used to provide this framework, but it consumes very high energy and is\nslow. Further, until now, no blockchain model has considered the role of\nconventional electric utility companies in P2P trading. In this paper, we have\nintroduced a credit blockchain that reduces energy consumption by employing a\nnew mechanism to update transactions and increases speed by providing interest\nfree loans to buyers. This model also integrates the electric utility companies\nwithin the P2P trading framework, thereby increasing members trading options.\nWe have also discussed the pricing strategies for trading. All the above\nassertions have been verified through simulations, demonstrating that this\nmodel will promote P2P trading by providing enhanced security, speed, and\ngreater trading options. The proposed model will also help trade energy at\nprices beneficial for both sellers and buyers.",

This has been a\nlong-overlooked gap, as existing studies have primarily focused on\ninter-committee (validator set) behaviors and activities, while neglecting the\ndynamic formation of committees, especially for individual stakeholders seeking\nreliable validators. Our study bridges this gap by diving into the delegation\nprocess (normal users delegate their small-value tokens to delegatees who later\nact as validators) before entering an actual consensus phase.\n  We propose a Bayesian model to quantify normal users' trust in delegatees,\nwhich we further incorporate into a game-theoretical model to simulate users'\nreactions against a set of critical factors identified through extensive\nresearch (including 10+ staking service provider as well as 30+ PoS\nblockchains). Our results reveal that users tend to choose their delegatees and\nutilize their tokens by carefully weighing the delegation cost, the behaviors\nof other users, and the reputation of delegatees, ultimately reaching a Nash\nequilibrium. Unfortunately, the collective trend significantly increases the\nlikelihood of token concentration on a small number of delegatees.",

Our approach\ninvolves validators exchanging perceptions as votes to assess potential\nconflicts between transactions and the witness set, representing input\ntransactions in the UTXO model. These perceptions collectively contribute to an\nintermediate belief regarding the validity of transactions. By integrating\ntheir beliefs with those of other validators, localized decisions are made to\ndetermine validity. Ultimately, a final consensus is achieved through a\nmajority vote, ensuring precise and efficient validation of transactions. Our\nproposed approach is compared to the existing DAG-based scheme IOTA and the\nsharded blockchain Omniledger through extensive simulations. The results show\nthat IOTA has high throughput and low latency but sacrifices accuracy and is\nvulnerable to orphanage attacks especially with low transaction rates.\nOmniledger achieves stable accuracy by increasing shards but has increased\nlatency.

In particular, we focus on the effects that model\nstaleness and inconsistencies, endorsed by blockchains' modus operandi, have on\nthe training procedure held by FL devices asynchronously. Using simulation, we\nevaluate the blockchained FL operation on the well-known CIFAR-10 dataset and\nfocus on the accuracy and timeliness of the solutions.

However, as distributed energy resources (DERs) penetration grows, the\ngrid edge is increasingly infused with intelligent computing and communication\ncapabilities. Thus, the bottom-up approach to grid operations inclined toward\ndecentralizing energy systems will likely gain momentum alongside the existing\ncentralized paradigm. Decentralization refers to transferring control and\ndecision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group\nthereof) to a distributed network. It is not a new concept - in energy systems\ncontext or otherwise. In the energy systems context, however, the complexity of\nthis multifaceted concept increases manifolds due to two major reasons - i) the\nnature of the commodity being traded (the electricity) and ii) the enormity of\nthe traditional electricity sector's structure that builds, operates, and\nmaintains this capital-intensive network. In this work, we aim to highlight the\nneed for and outline a credible path toward restructuring the current\noperational architecture of the electricity grid in view of the ongoing\ndecentralization trends with an emphasis on peer-to-peer energy trading. We\nfurther introduce blockchain technology in the context of decentralized energy\nsystems problems.

            "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is a well-known paradigm of distributed machine\nlearning on mobile and IoT devices, which preserves data privacy and optimizes\ncommunication efficiency. To avoid the single point of failure problem in FL,\ndecentralized federated learning (DFL) has been proposed to use peer-to-peer\ncommunication for model aggregation, which has been considered an attractive\nsolution for machine learning tasks on distributed personal devices. However,\nthis process is vulnerable to attackers who share false models and data. If\nthere exists a group of malicious clients, they might harm the performance of\nthe model by carrying out a poisoning attack. In addition, in DFL, clients\noften lack the incentives to contribute their computing powers to do model\ntraining. In this paper, we proposed Blockchain-based Decentralized Federated\nLearning (BDFL), which leverages a blockchain for decentralized model\nverification and auditing. BDFL includes an auditor committee for model\nverification, an incentive mechanism to encourage the participation of clients,\na reputation model to evaluate the trustworthiness of clients, and a protocol\nsuite for dynamic network updates. Evaluation results show that, with the\nreputation mechanism, BDFL achieves fast model convergence and high accuracy on\nreal datasets even if there exist 30\\% malicious clients in the system.",

            "summary": "This paper presents a partially synchronous BFT consensus protocol powered by\nBBCA, a lightly modified Byzantine Consistent Broadcast (CBC) primitive. BBCA\nprovides a Complete-Adopt semantic through an added probing interface to allow\neither aborting the broadcast by correct nodes or exclusively, adopting the\nmessage consistently in case of a potential delivery. It does not introduce any\nextra type of messages or communication cost to CBC.\n  BBCA is harnessed into BBCA-CHAIN to make direct commits on a chained\nbackbone of a causally ordered graph of blocks, without any additional voting\nblocks or artificial layering. With the help of Complete-Adopt, the additional\nknowledge gained from the underlying CBC completely removes the voting latency\nin popular DAG-based protocols. At the same time, causal ordering allows nodes\nto propose blocks in parallel and achieve high throughput.\n  BBCA-CHAIN thus closes up the gap between protocols built by consistent\nbroadcasts (e.g., Bullshark) to those without such an abstraction (e.g.,\nPBFT/HotStuff), emphasizing their shared fundamental principles. Using a\nBracha-style CBC as an example, we fully specify BBCA-CHAIN with simplicity,\nserving as a solid basis for high-performance replication systems (and\nblockchains).",

Among them, the AI language model represented\nby ChatGPT has made great progress. Such large language models (LLMs) serve\npeople in the form of AI-generated content (AIGC) and are widely used in\nconsulting, healthcare, and education. However, it is difficult to guarantee\nthe authenticity and reliability of AIGC learning data. In addition, there are\nalso hidden dangers of privacy disclosure in distributed AI training. Moreover,\nthe content generated by LLMs is difficult to identify and trace, and it is\ndifficult to cross-platform mutual recognition. The above information security\nissues in the coming era of AI powered by LLMs will be infinitely amplified and\naffect everyone's life. Therefore, we consider empowering LLMs using blockchain\ntechnology with superior security features to propose a vision for trusted AI.\nThis paper mainly introduces the motivation and technical route of blockchain\nfor LLM (BC4LLM), including reliable learning corpus, secure training process,\nand identifiable generated content. Meanwhile, this paper also reviews the\npotential applications and future challenges, especially in the frontier\ncommunication networks field, including network resource allocation, dynamic\nspectrum sharing, and semantic communication. Based on the above work combined\nand the prospect of blockchain and LLMs, it is expected to help the early\nrealization of trusted AI and provide guidance for the academic community.",

FL\neffectively integrates cloud infrastructure to transfer ML models onto edge\nservers using blockchain technology. Through this mechanism, it guarantees the\nstreamlined processing and data storage requirements of both centralized and\ndecentralized systems, with an emphasis on scalability, privacy considerations,\nand cost-effective communication. In current FL implementations, data owners\nlocally train their models, and subsequently upload the outcomes in the form of\nweights, gradients, and parameters to the cloud for overall model aggregation.\nThis innovation obviates the necessity of engaging Internet of Things (IoT)\nclients and participants to communicate raw and potentially confidential data\ndirectly with a cloud center. This not only reduces the costs associated with\ncommunication networks but also enhances the protection of private data. This\nsurvey conducts an analysis and comparison of recent FL applications, aiming to\nassess their efficiency, accuracy, and privacy protection. However, in light of\nthe complex and evolving nature of FL, it becomes evident that additional\nresearch is imperative to address lingering knowledge gaps and effectively\nconfront the forthcoming challenges in this field. In this study, we categorize\nrecent literature into the following clusters: privacy protection, resource\nallocation, case study analysis, and applications. Furthermore, at the end of\neach section, we tabulate the open areas and future directions presented in the\nreferenced literature, affording researchers and scholars an insightful view of\nthe evolution of the field.",

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided\ndisaster relief networks (UDRNs) leverage UAVs to assist existing ground relief\nnetworks by swiftly assessing affected areas and timely delivering lifesaving\nsupplies. However, severe challenges in mutual coordination, trust, and\nsecurity hinder the deployment of UDRNs. This paper leverages the promising\nblockchain technology to address collaborative, trust-free, and traceable\ndisaster relief services.

Subsequently, we propose to optimize the blockchain-based UDRN system,\nincluding (i) a series of smart contracts for transparent and automated relief\nassignment; (ii) a dynamic contract audit mechanism to prevent known/unknown\ncontract vulnerabilities; and (iii) a transaction forensics strategy with\non/off-chain cooperation for traceable relief services.

            "summary": "Blockchain provides decentralization and trustlessness features for the\nIndustrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which expands the application scenarios\nof IIoT. To address the problem that the blockchain cannot actively obtain\noff-chain data, the blockchain oracle is proposed as a bridge between the\nblockchain and external data. However, the existing oracle schemes are\ndifficult to solve the problem of low quality of service caused by frequent\ndata changes and heterogeneous devices in IIoT, and the current oracle node\nselection schemes are difficult to balance security and quality of service. To\ntackle these problems, this paper proposes a secure and reliable oracle scheme\nthat can obtain high-quality off-chain data. Specifically, we first design an\noracle node selection algorithm based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and\nreputation mechanism to securely select high-quality nodes. Second, we propose\na data filtering algorithm based on a sliding window to further improve the\nconsistency of the collected data. We verify the security of the proposed\nscheme through security analysis. The experimental results show that the\nproposed scheme can effectively improve the service quality of the oracle.",

            "summary": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that gained popularity for\nenabling the transformation of cryptocurrency among peers without mediation by\na centralized third-party authority. Smart contracts expand the applications of\nblockchain technology and have played a role in its widespread adoption. Smart\ncontracts are immutable digital programs that are deployed on blockchains to\ncodify agreements between parties. Existing smart contract implementations have\nfaced challenges, including security vulnerabilities, leading to significant\nlosses and concerns. This has stimulated a wave of attempts to improve Smart\nContract Languages (SCLs) to overcome implementation challenges and ensure code\nquality, producing many languages with diverse features. Scholars have made\nsome attempts to classify SCLs and clarify the process of selecting an SCL, but\nto the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive survey of existing SCLs has been\npublished. Our work surpasses earlier efforts by evaluating a significantly\nlarger set of SCLs, in greater depth, to ease the process of SCL selection for\nblockchain research and implementation. In this paper, we (1) propose a robust\nframework for comparing existing SCLs, (2) analyze and discuss 36 SCLs,\naddressing issues beyond those used to construct the comparison framework, and\n(3) define new parameters for future research and development of SCLs. The\nsurvey provides a guide for those who intend to select or use an SCL to\nimplement smart contracts, develop new SCLs, or add new extensions to the\nexisting SCLs.",

            "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables\nmultiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the\norchestration of a central aggregator. Traditional FL solutions rely on the\ntrust assumption of the centralized aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients\nin a fair and honest manner. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could\nabandon and replace the client's training models, or launch Sybil attacks to\ninsert fake clients. Such malicious behaviors give the aggregator more power to\ncontrol clients in the FL setting and determine the final training results. In\nthis work, we introduce zkFL, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to\ntackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model\naggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the\naggregator needs to provide a proof per round. The proof can demonstrate to the\nclients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To\nfurther reduce the verification cost of clients, we employ a blockchain to\nhandle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the nodes\nvalidating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without\nknowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and\nempirical results show that zkFL can achieve better security and privacy than\ntraditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or\nheavily compromising the training speed.",

This enables advanced\nnetwork analytics to highlight operational efficiencies within the DApp's\narchitecture.\n  The bipartite graph generated by the proposed tool comprises two sets of\nnodes: one representing smart contracts, interfaces, and libraries, and the\nother including functions, events, and modifiers. Edges in the graph connect\nfunctions to smart contracts they interact with, offering a granular view of\ninterdependencies and execution flow within the DApp. This network-centric\napproach allows researchers and practitioners to apply complex network theory\nin understanding the robustness, adaptability, and intricacies of decentralized\nsystems.\n  Our work contributes to the enhancement of security in smart contracts by\nallowing the visualisation of the network, and it provides a deep understanding\nof the architecture and operational logic within DApps.

We show that this bound is loose.\nIn particular, an attack may be structured so that under equilibrium play by\nmost miners, a miner's choice to participate only slightly affects the attack\nsuccess chance. Combined with the fact that most of the cost of attack success\nis externalized by any given small miner, this implies that if most mining\npower is controlled by small miners, bribing miners to participate in such an\nattack is much cheaper than the Budish bound.

Thus,\nwe propose a blockchain approach to visual navigation for a heterogeneous robot\nteam over a wide area of visual navigation.

            "summary": "The rapid evolution of the Ethereum network necessitates sophisticated\ntechniques to ensure its robustness against potential threats and to maintain\ntransparency. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have pioneered anomaly\ndetection in such platforms, capturing the intricacies of both spatial and\ntemporal transactional patterns has remained a challenge. This study presents a\nfusion of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with Temporal Random Walks (TRW)\nenhanced by probabilistic sampling to bridge this gap. Our approach, unlike\ntraditional GCNs, leverages the strengths of TRW to discern complex temporal\nsequences in Ethereum transactions, thereby providing a more nuanced\ntransaction anomaly detection mechanism. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate\nthat our TRW-GCN framework substantially advances the performance metrics over\nconventional GCNs in detecting anomalies and transaction bursts. This research\nnot only underscores the potential of temporal cues in Ethereum transactional\ndata but also offers a scalable and effective methodology for ensuring the\nsecurity and transparency of decentralized platforms. By harnessing both\nspatial relationships and time-based transactional sequences as node features,\nour model introduces an additional layer of granularity, making the detection\nprocess more robust and less prone to false positives. This work lays the\nfoundation for future research aimed at optimizing and enhancing the\ntransparency of blockchain technologies, and serves as a testament to the\nsignificance of considering both time and space dimensions in the ever-evolving\nlandscape of the decentralized platforms.",

We validate the accuracy of these\nsimulations for predicting the performance of BFT systems by comparing\nsimulation results with measurements of real systems deployed on cloud\ninfrastructures.

With the increasing number of\nglobal and Turkish investors, it is evident that interest in digital assets\nwill continue to rise sustainably, even in the face of financial fluctuations.\nHowever, it remains uncertain whether consumers perceive blockchain\ntechnology's ease of use and usefulness when purchasing cryptocurrencies. This\nstudy aims to explain blockchain technology's perceived ease of use and\nusefulness in cryptocurrency purchases by considering factors such as quality\ncustomer service, reduced costs, efficiency, and reliability. To achieve this\ngoal, data were obtained from 463 participants interested in cryptocurrencies\nin different regions of Turkey. The data were analyzed using SPSS Process Macro\nprograms. The analysis results indicate that perceived ease of use and\nusefulness mediate the effects of customer service and reduced costs,\nefficiency, and security on purchase intention.",

            "summary": "Most algorithms deployed in healthcare do not consider gender and sex despite\nthe effect they have on individuals' health differences. Missing these\ndimensions in healthcare information systems is a point of concern, as\nneglecting these aspects will inevitably perpetuate existing biases, produce\nfar from optimal results, and may generate diagnosis errors. An\noften-overlooked community with distinct care values and needs are LGBT+ older\nadults, which has traditionally been under-surveyed in healthcare and\ntechnology design. This paper investigates the implications of missing gender\nand sex considerations in distributed ledger technologies for LGBT+ older\nadults. By using the value sensitive design methodology, our contribution shows\nthat many value meanings dear to marginalized communities are not considered in\nthe design of the blockchain, such as LGBT+ older adults' interpretations of\ntrust, privacy, and security. By highlighting the LGBT+ older population\nvalues, our contribution alerts us to the potential discriminatory implications\nof these technologies, which do not consider the gender and sex differences of\nmarginalized, silent populations. Focusing on one community throughout - LGBT+\nolder adults - we emphasize the need for a holistic, value sensitive design\napproach for the development of ledger technologies for healthcare, including\nthe values of everyone within the healthcare ecosystem.",

A key enabler for adoption of blockchain-based federated learning\nis how to select suitable participants to train models collaboratively.\nSelecting participants by storing and querying the metadata of data owners on\nblockchain could ensure the reliability of selected data owners, which is\nhelpful to obtain high-quality models in FL. However, querying\nmulti-dimensional metadata on blockchain needs to traverse every transaction in\neach block, making the query time-consuming. An efficient query method for\nmulti-dimensional metadata in the blockchain for selecting participants in FL\nis absent and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel data structure to\nimprove the query efficiency within each block named MerkleRB-Tree. In detail,\nwe leverage Minimal Bounding Rectangle(MBR) and bloom-filters for the query\nprocess of multi-dimensional continuous-valued attributes and discrete-valued\nattributes respectively. Furthermore, we migrate the idea of the skip list\nalong with an MBR and a bloom filter at the head of each block to enhance the\nquery efficiency for inter-blocks. The performance analysis and extensive\nevaluation results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod in blockchain-based FL.",

If the attacker's chain has the most cumulative mining puzzle\ndifficulty, nodes will recognize it as canonical. We propose a modification to\nPoW protocols, called ADESS, that contains two novel features. The first\nmodification enables a node to identify the attacker chain by comparing the\ntemporal sequence of blocks on competing chains. The second modification\npenalizes the attacker by requiring it to apply exponentially increasing\nhashrate in order to make its chain canonical. We demonstrate two things; (i)\nthe expected cost of carrying out a double-spend attack is weakly higher under\nADESS compared to the current PoW protocols and (ii) for any value of\ntransaction, there is a penalty setting in ADESS that renders the expected\nprofit of a double-spend attack negative.",

            "summary": "Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is value extractable by temporary monopoly\npower commonly found in decentralized systems. This extraction stems from a\nlack of user privacy upon transaction submission and the ability of a\nmonopolist validator to reorder, add, and/or censor transactions. There are two\nmain directions to reduce MEV: reduce the flexibility of the miner to reorder\ntransactions by enforcing ordering rules and/or introduce a competitive market\nfor the right to reorder, add, and/or censor transactions. In this work, we\nunify these approaches via \\emph{uncertainty principles}, akin to those found\nin harmonic analysis and physics. This provides a quantitative trade-off\nbetween the freedom to reorder transactions and the complexity of an economic\npayoff to a user in a decentralized network. This trade off is analogous to the\nNyquist-Shannon sampling theorem and demonstrates that sequencing rules in\nblockchains need to be application specific. Our results suggest that neither\nso-called fair ordering techniques nor economic mechanisms can individually\nmitigate MEV for arbitrary payoff functions.",

In the general case with more than one\nresource, our optimal policies correctly handle cross-effects (complementarity\nand substitutability) in resource demands. We also show how these cross-effects\ncan be used to inform resource design, i.e. combining resources into bundles\nthat have low demand-side cross-effects can yield simpler and more efficient\nprice-update rules. Our framework is also practical, we demonstrate how it can\nbe used to refine or inform the design of heuristic fee update rules such as\nEIP-1559 or EIP-4844 with two case studies.

            "summary": "Cuttlefish addresses several limitations of existing consensus-less and\nconsensus-minimized decentralized ledgers, including restricted programmability\nand the risk of deadlocked assets. The key insight of Cuttlefish is that\nconsensus in blockchains is necessary due to contention, rather than multiple\nowners of an asset as suggested by prior work. Previous proposals proactively\nuse consensus to prevent contention from blocking assets, taking a pessimistic\napproach. In contrast, Cuttlefish introduces collective objects and multi-owner\ntransactions that can offer most of the functionality of classic blockchains\nwhen objects transacted on are not under contention. Additionally, in case of\ncontention, Cuttlefish proposes a novel `Unlock' protocol that significantly\nreduces the latency of unblocking contented objects. By leveraging these\nfeatures, Cuttlefish implements consensus-less protocols for a broader range of\ntransactions, including asset swaps and multi-signature transactions, which\nwere previously believed to require consensus.",

The Sui blockchain\nprotocol uses a variant of the Bullshark consensus algorithm due to its lower\nlatency, but this leader-based protocol causes performance issues when\ncandidate leaders crash. In this paper, we explore the ideas pioneered by\nCarousel on providing Leader-Utilization and present HammerHead. Unlike\nCarousel, which is built with a chained and pipelined consensus protocol in\nmind, HammerHead does not need to worry about chain quality as it is directly\nprovided by the DAG, but needs to make sure that even though validators might\ncommit blocks in different views the safety and liveness is preserved. Our\nimplementation of HammerHead shows a slight performance increase in a faultless\nsetting, and a drastic 2x latency reduction and up to 40% throughput increase\nwhen suffering faults (100 validators, 33 faults).",

            "summary": "Trading through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) has become crucial in today's\nblockchain ecosystem, enabling users to swap tokens efficiently and\nautomatically. However, the capacity of miners to strategically order\ntransactions has led to exploitative practices (e.g., front-running attacks,\nsandwich attacks) and gain substantial Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) for\ntheir own advantage. To mitigate such manipulation, Ferreira and Parkes\nrecently proposed a greedy sequencing rule such that the execution price of\ntransactions in a block moves back and forth around the starting price.\nUtilizing this sequencing rule makes it impossible for miners to conduct\nsandwich attacks, consequently mitigating the MEV problem.\n  However, no sequencing rule can prevent miners from obtaining risk-free\nprofits. This paper systemically studies the computation of a miner's optimal\nstrategy for maximizing MEV under the greedy sequencing rule, where the utility\nof miners is measured by the overall value of their token holdings. Our results\nunveil a dichotomy between the no trading fee scenario, which can be optimally\nstrategized in polynomial time, and the scenario with a constant fraction of\ntrading fee, where finding the optimal strategy is proven NP-hard. The latter\nrepresents a significant challenge for miners seeking optimal MEV.\n  Following the computation results, we further show a remarkable phenomenon:\nMiner's optimal MEV also benefits users. Precisely, in the scenarios without\ntrading fees, when miners adopt the optimal strategy given by our algorithm,\nall users' transactions will be executed, and each user will receive equivalent\nor surpass profits compared to their expectations. This outcome provides\nfurther support for the study and design of sequencing rules in decentralized\nexchanges.",

            "published": "2023-09-20T13:41:45Z",
            "summary": "Smart contracts are programs that are executed on the blockchain and can\nhold, manage and transfer assets in the form of cryptocurrencies. The\ncontract's execution is then performed on-chain and is subject to consensus,\ni.e. every node on the blockchain network has to run the function calls and\nkeep track of their side-effects. In most programmable blockchains, such as\nEthereum, the notion of gas is introduced to prevent DoS attacks by malicious\nparties who might try to slow down the network by performing heavy\ncomputations. A fixed cost to each atomic operation, and the initiator of a\nfunction call pays the total gas cost as a transaction fee. This helps prevent\nDoS attacks, but the resulting fees are extremely high. For example, in 2022,\non Ethereum alone, there has been a total gas usage of 1.77 Million ETH ~ 4.3\nBillion USD. This thesis proposes \"lazy contracts\" as a solution to alleviate\nthese costs. Our solution moves most of the computation off-chain, ensuring\nthat each function call incurs only a tiny amount of gas usage, while\npreserving enough data on-chain to guarantee an implicit consensus about the\nstate of the contract variables and ownership of funds. A complete on-chain\nexecution of the functions will only be triggered in case two parties to the\ncontract are in disagreement about the current state, which in turn can only\nhappen if at least one party is dishonest. In such cases, our protocol can\nidentify the dishonest party and penalize them by having them pay for the\nentire gas usage. Hence, no rational party has an incentive to act dishonestly.\nFinally, we perform extensive experiments over 160,735 real-world Solidity\ncontracts that were involved in 9,055,492 transactions in January 2022--January\n2023 on Ethereum and show that our approach reduces the overall gas usage by\n55.4%, which amounts to an astounding saving of 109.9 Million USD in gas fees.",

            "summary": "Many protocols in distributed computing rely on a source of randomness,\nusually called a random beacon, both for their applicability and security. This\nis especially true for proof-of-stake blockchain protocols in which the next\nminer or set of miners have to be chosen randomly and each party's likelihood\nto be selected is in proportion to their stake in the cryptocurrency.\n  Current random beacons used in proof-of-stake protocols, such as Ouroboros\nand Algorand, have two fundamental limitations: Either (i)~they rely on\npseudorandomness, e.g.~assuming that the output of a hash function is uniform,\nwhich is a widely-used but unproven assumption, or (ii)~they generate their\nrandomness using a distributed protocol in which several participants are\nrequired to submit random numbers which are then used in the generation of a\nfinal random result. However, in this case, there is no guarantee that the\nnumbers provided by the parties are uniformly random and there is no incentive\nfor the parties to honestly generate uniform randomness. Most random beacons\nhave both limitations.\n  In this thesis, we provide a protocol for distributed generation of\nrandomness. Our protocol does not rely on pseudorandomness at all. Similar to\nsome of the previous approaches, it uses random inputs by different\nparticipants to generate a final random result. However, the crucial difference\nis that we provide a game-theoretic guarantee showing that it is in everyone's\nbest interest to submit uniform random numbers. Hence, our approach is the\nfirst to incentivize honest behavior instead of just assuming it. Moreover, the\napproach is trustless and generates unbiased random numbers. It is also\ntamper-proof and no party can change the output or affect its distribution.\nFinally, it is designed with modularity in mind and can be easily plugged into\nexisting distributed protocols such as proof-of-stake blockchains.",

            "summary": "Auto-completing code enables developers to speed up coding significantly.\nRecent advances in transformer-based large language model (LLM) technologies\nhave been applied to code synthesis. However, studies show that many of such\nsynthesized codes contain vulnerabilities. We propose a novel\nvulnerability-constrained decoding approach to reduce the amount of vulnerable\ncode generated by such models. Using a small dataset of labeled vulnerable\nlines of code, we fine-tune an LLM to include vulnerability labels when\ngenerating code, acting as an embedded classifier. Then, during decoding, we\ndeny the model to generate these labels to avoid generating vulnerable code. To\nevaluate the method, we chose to automatically complete Ethereum Blockchain\nsmart contracts (SCs) as the case study due to the strict requirements of SC\nsecurity. We first fine-tuned the 6-billion-parameter GPT-J model using 186,397\nEthereum SCs after removing the duplication from 2,217,692 SCs. The fine-tuning\ntook more than one week using ten GPUs. The results showed that our fine-tuned\nmodel could synthesize SCs with an average BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation\nUnderstudy) score of 0.557. However, many codes in the auto-completed SCs were\nvulnerable. Using the code before the vulnerable line of 176 SCs containing\ndifferent types of vulnerabilities to auto-complete the code, we found that\nmore than 70% of the auto-completed codes were insecure. Thus, we further\nfine-tuned the model on other 941 vulnerable SCs containing the same types of\nvulnerabilities and applied vulnerability-constrained decoding. The fine-tuning\ntook only one hour with four GPUs. We then auto-completed the 176 SCs again and\nfound that our approach could identify 62% of the code to be generated as\nvulnerable and avoid generating 67% of them, indicating the approach could\nefficiently and effectively avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-completed code.",

            "summary": "Majority voting is a simple mathematical function that returns the value that\nappears most often in a set. As a popular decision fusion technique, the\nmajority voting function (MVF) finds applications in resolving conflicts, where\na number of independent voters report their opinions on a classification\nproblem. Despite its importance and its various applications in ensemble\nlearning, data crowd-sourcing, remote sensing, and data oracles for\nblockchains, the accuracy of the MVF for the general multi-class classification\nproblem has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive a new upper bound on the\naccuracy of the MVF for the multi-class classification problem. More\nspecifically, we show that under certain conditions, the error rate of the MVF\nexponentially decays toward zero as the number of independent voters increases.\nConversely, the error rate of the MVF exponentially grows with the number of\nindependent voters if these conditions are not met.\n  We first explore the problem for independent and identically distributed\nvoters where we assume that every voter follows the same conditional\nprobability distribution of voting for different classes, given the true\nclassification of the data point. Next, we extend our results for the case\nwhere the voters are independent but non-identically distributed. Using the\nderived results, we then provide a discussion on the accuracy of the truth\ndiscovery algorithms. We show that in the best-case scenarios, truth discovery\nalgorithms operate as an amplified MVF and thereby achieve a small error rate\nonly when the MVF achieves a small error rate, and vice versa, achieve a large\nerror rate when the MVF also achieves a large error rate. In the worst-case\nscenario, the truth discovery algorithms may achieve a higher error rate than\nthe MVF. Finally, we confirm our theoretical results using numerical\nsimulations.",

In this paper, we develop a\nmeasurement framework to characterize each phase's transaction and block data\nin Hyperledger Fabric based on the Fabric SDK Nodejs, where we thoroughly\nanalyze and open source the implementation details of the measurement\nframework. We evaluate the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and have some\ninteresting observations; 1. The number of CPU cores has a linear impact on the\nthroughput of an endorsing peer. 2. The Raft-based ordering service shows good\nscalability with the number of ordering service nodes. 3. The communication\nlatencies between the client and service in Hyperledger Fabric are significant.\nWe then identify each phase's dominant latency in Hyperledger Fabric via\nprimitive operation analysis and propose a stochastic computation model for\nperformance analysis. We also use the alpha-beta communication model to analyze\nthe corresponding communication latency. Finally, we validate the accuracy of\nthe performance model on both local and cloud clusters.

Vulnerabilities within them can trigger a\ncascade of consequences, resulting in significant losses. Many current papers\nprimarily focus on classifying smart contracts for malicious intent, often\nrelying on limited contract characteristics, such as bytecode or opcode. This\npaper proposes a novel, two-layered framework: 1) classifying and 2) directly\nrepairing malicious contracts. Slither's vulnerability report is combined with\nsource code and passed through a pre-trained RandomForestClassifier (RFC) and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), classifying and repairing each suggested\nvulnerability. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuned and\nprompt-engineered LLMs. The smart contract repair models, built from\npre-trained GPT-3.5-Turbo and fine-tuned Llama-2-7B models, reduced the overall\nvulnerability count by 97.5% and 96.7% respectively. A manual inspection of\nrepaired contracts shows that all retain functionality, indicating that the\nproposed method is appropriate for automatic batch classification and repair of\nvulnerabilities in smart contracts.",

Despite their crucial role, the\ndevelopment of smart contracts may introduce vulnerabilities and potentially\nlead to severe consequences, such as financial losses. Meanwhile, large\nlanguage models, represented by ChatGPT, have gained great attentions,\nshowcasing great capabilities in code analysis tasks. In this paper, we\npresented an empirical study to investigate the performance of ChatGPT in\nidentifying smart contract vulnerabilities. Initially, we evaluated ChatGPT's\neffectiveness using a publicly available smart contract dataset. Our findings\ndiscover that while ChatGPT achieves a high recall rate, its precision in\npinpointing smart contract vulnerabilities is limited. Furthermore, ChatGPT's\nperformance varies when detecting different vulnerability types. We delved into\nthe root causes for the false positives generated by ChatGPT, and categorized\nthem into four groups. Second, by comparing ChatGPT with other state-of-the-art\nsmart contract vulnerability detection tools, we found that ChatGPT's F-score\nis lower than others for 3 out of the 7 vulnerabilities. In the case of the\nremaining 4 vulnerabilities, ChatGPT exhibits a slight advantage over these\ntools. Finally, we analyzed the limitation of ChatGPT in smart contract\nvulnerability detection, revealing that the robustness of ChatGPT in this field\nneeds to be improved from two aspects: its uncertainty in answering questions;\nand the limited length of the detected code. In general, our research provides\ninsights into the strengths and weaknesses of employing large language models,\nspecifically ChatGPT, for the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities.",

            "summary": "Auction-based Federated Learning (AFL) enables open collaboration among\nself-interested data consumers and data owners. Existing AFL approaches are\ncommonly under the assumption of sellers' market in that the service clients as\nsellers are treated as scarce resources so that the aggregation servers as\nbuyers need to compete the bids. Yet, as the technology progresses, an\nincreasing number of qualified clients are now capable of performing federated\nlearning tasks, leading to shift from sellers' market to a buyers' market. In\nthis paper, we shift the angle by adapting the procurement auction framework,\naiming to explain the pricing behavior under buyers' market. Our modeling\nstarts with basic setting under complete information, then move further to the\nscenario where sellers' information are not fully observable. In order to\nselect clients with high reliability and data quality, and to prevent from\nexternal attacks, we utilize a blockchain-based reputation mechanism. The\nexperimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "summary": "As a trusted middleware connecting the blockchain and the real world, the\nblockchain oracle can obtain trusted real-time price information for financial\napplications such as payment and settlement, and asset valuation on the\nblockchain. However, the current oracle schemes face the dilemma of security\nand service quality in the process of node selection, and the implicit interest\nrelationship in financial applications leads to a significant conflict of\ninterest between the task publisher and the executor, which reduces the\nparticipation enthusiasm of both parties and system security. Therefore, this\npaper proposes an anonymous node selection scheme that anonymously selects\nnodes with high reputations to participate in tasks to ensure the security and\nservice quality of nodes. Then, this paper also details the interest\nrequirements and behavioral motives of all parties in the payment settlement\nand asset valuation scenarios. Under the assumption of rational participants,\nan incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg game is proposed. It can\nachieve equilibrium under the pursuit of the interests of task publishers and\nexecutors, thereby ensuring the interests of all types of users and improving\nthe enthusiasm of participation. Finally, we verify the security of the\nproposed scheme through security analysis. The experimental results show that\nthe proposed scheme can reduce the variance of obtaining price data by about\n55\\% while ensuring security, and meeting the interests of all parties.",

            "summary": "The communities of blockchains and distributed ledgers have been stirred up\nby the introduction of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Originally designed to\nsolve privacy issues, ZKPs have now evolved into an effective remedy for\nscalability concerns and are applied in Zcash (internet money like Bitcoin). To\nenable ZKPs, Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CS) offer a verifier for bi-linear\nequations. To accurately and efficiently represent R1CS, several language tools\nlike Circom, Noir, and Snarky have been proposed to automate the compilation of\nadvanced programs into R1CS. However, due to the flexible nature of R1CS\nrepresentation, there can be significant differences in the compiled R1CS forms\ngenerated from circuit language programs with the same underlying semantics. To\naddress this issue, this paper uses a data-flow-based R1CS paradigm algorithm,\nwhich produces a standardized format for different R1CS instances with\nidentical semantics. By using the normalized R1CS format circuits, the\ncomplexity of circuits' verification can be reduced. In addition, this paper\npresents an R1CS normalization algorithm benchmark, and our experimental\nevaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of our methods.",

To\nensure confidentiality while maintaining data sharing capabilities, the\nCiphertext-Policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme can be used to\nachieve fine-grained access control in cloud services. However, existing\napproaches are impaired by three critical concerns: illegal authorization, key\ndisclosure, and privacy leakage.\n  To address these, we propose a blockchain-based data governance system that\nemploys blockchain technology and attribute-based encryption to prevent privacy\nleakage and credential misuse. First, our ABE encryption system can handle\nmulti-authority use cases while protecting identity privacy and hiding access\npolicy, which also protects data sharing against corrupt authorities. Second,\napplying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data encryption makes the\nwhole system efficient and responsive to real-world conditions. Furthermore,\nthe encrypted data is stored in a decentralized storage system such as IPFS,\nwhich does not rely on any centralized service provider and is, therefore,\nresilient against single-point failures. Third, illegal authorization activity\ncan be readily identified through the logged on-chain data. Besides the system\ndesign, we also provide security proofs to demonstrate the robustness of the\nproposed system.",

Therefore, we propose an adaptive and modular\nblockchain-enabled architecture for a decentralized metaverse to address these\nissues. The solution includes an adaptive consensus/ledger protocol based on a\nmodular blockchain, which can effectively adapt to the ever-changing scenarios\nof the metaverse, reduce resource consumption, and provide a secure and\nreliable interactive environment. In addition, we propose the concept of\nNon-Fungible Resource (NFR) to virtualize idle resources.

            "summary": "Given the exponential expansion of the internet, the possibilities of\nsecurity attacks and cybercrimes have increased accordingly. However, poorly\nimplemented security mechanisms in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices make\nthem susceptible to cyberattacks, which can directly affect users. IoT\nforensics is thus needed for investigating and mitigating such attacks. While\nmany works have examined IoT applications and challenges, only a few have\nfocused on both the forensic and security issues in IoT. Therefore, this paper\nreviews forensic and security issues associated with IoT in different fields.\nFuture prospects and challenges in IoT research and development are also\nhighlighted. As demonstrated in the literature, most IoT devices are vulnerable\nto attacks due to a lack of standardized security measures. Unauthorized users\ncould get access, compromise data, and even benefit from control of critical\ninfrastructure. To fulfil the security-conscious needs of consumers, IoT can be\nused to develop a smart home system by designing a FLIP-based system that is\nhighly scalable and adaptable. Utilizing a blockchain-based authentication\nmechanism with a multi-chain structure can provide additional security\nprotection between different trust domains. Deep learning can be utilized to\ndevelop a network forensics framework with a high-performing system for\ndetecting and tracking cyberattack incidents. Moreover, researchers should\nconsider limiting the amount of data created and delivered when using big data\nto develop IoT-based smart systems. The findings of this review will stimulate\nacademics to seek potential solutions for the identified issues, thereby\nadvancing the IoT field.",

            "summary": "In the realm of algorithmic economics, voting systems are evaluated and\ncompared by examining the properties or axioms they satisfy. While this pursuit\nhas yielded valuable insights, it has also led to seminal impossibility results\nsuch as Arrow's and Gibbard-Satterthwaite's Impossibility Theorems, which pose\nchallenges in designing ideal voting systems. Enter the domain of quantum\ncomputing: recent advancements have introduced the concept of quantum voting\nsystems, which have many potential applications including in security and\nblockchain. Building on recent works that bypass Arrow's Impossibility Theorem\nusing quantum voting systems, our research extends Quantum Condorcet Voting\n(QCV) to counter the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Impossibility Theorem in a quantum\nsetting. To show this, we introduce a quantum-specific notion of truthfulness,\nextend ideas like incentive compatibility and the purpose of onto to the\nquantum domain, and introduce new tools to map social welfare functions to\nsocial choice functions in this domain.",

We have discovered that\nthe distribution of nodes' degrees follows a power law that makes them\nscale-free networks, in addition, the centrality of tokens in exchange graphs\nprovides valuable insights into their price and significance in cryptocurrency\nmarkets. These measures of centrality can be used to detect anomalies in\ncryptocurrency markets and prices.

In light of all of these options\nfor measuring and improving testing effort, how should a QA engineer spend\ntheir time? We propose a new framework for reasoning about the extent, limits,\nand nature of a given testing effort based on an idea we call the oracle gap,\nor the difference between source code coverage and mutation score for a given\nsoftware element. We conduct (1) a large-scale observational study of the\noracle gap across popular Maven projects, (2) a study that varies testing and\noracle quality across several of those projects and (3) a small-scale\nobservational study of highly critical, well-tested code across comparable\nblockchain projects. We show that the oracle gap surfaces important information\nabout the extent and quality of a test effort beyond either adequacy metric\nalone. In particular, it provides a way for practitioners to identify source\nfiles where it is likely a weak oracle tests important code.",

Built on blockchain and smart contracts, the DeFi ecosystem has\nexperienced explosive growth in recent years. Unfortunately, smart contracts\nhold a massive amount of value, making them an attractive target for attacks.\nSo far, attacks against smart contracts and DeFi protocols have resulted in\nbillions of dollars in financial losses, severely threatening the security of\nthe entire DeFi ecosystem. Researchers have proposed various security tools for\nsmart contracts and DeFi protocols as countermeasures. However, a comprehensive\ninvestigation of these efforts is still lacking, leaving a crucial gap in our\nunderstanding of how to enhance the security posture of the smart contract and\nDeFi landscape.\n  To fill the gap, this paper reviews the progress made in the field of smart\ncontract and DeFi security from the perspective of both vulnerability detection\nand automated repair. First, we analyze the DeFi smart contract security issues\nand challenges. Specifically, we lucubrate various DeFi attack incidents and\nsummarize the attacks into six categories. Then, we present an empirical study\nof 42 state-of-the-art techniques that can detect smart contract and DeFi\nvulnerabilities. In particular, we evaluate the effectiveness of traditional\nsmart contract bug detection tools in analyzing complex DeFi protocols.\nAdditionally, we investigate 8 existing automated repair tools for smart\ncontracts and DeFi protocols, providing insight into their advantages and\ndisadvantages. To make this work useful for as wide of an audience as possible,\nwe also identify several open issues and challenges in the DeFi ecosystem that\nshould be addressed in the future.",

In\nvehicular metaverses, VMUs update vehicle twins (VTs) deployed in RoadSide\nUnits (RSUs) to obtain metaverse services. However, due to the mobility of\nvehicles and the limited service coverage of RSUs, VT migration is necessary to\nensure continuous immersive experiences for VMUs. This process requires RSUs to\ncontribute resources for enabling efficient migration, which leads to a\nresource trading problem between RSUs and VMUs. Moreover, a single RSU cannot\nsupport large-scale VT migration. To this end, we propose a blockchain-assisted\ngame approach framework for reliable VT migration in vehicular metaverses.\nBased on the subject logic model, we first calculate the reputation values of\nRSUs considering the freshness of interaction between RSUs and VMUs. Then, a\ncoalition game based on the reputation values of RSUs is formulated, and RSU\ncoalitions are formed to jointly provide bandwidth resources for reliable and\nlarge-scale VT migration. Subsequently, the RSU coalition with the highest\nutility is selected. Finally, to incentivize VMUs to participate in VT\nmigration, we propose a Stackelberg model between the selected coalition and\nVMUs. Numerical results demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the\nproposed schemes.",

A financial ecosystem built\non top of a blockchain is supposed to be fair and transparent for each\nparticipating actor. Yet, there are sophisticated actors who turn their domain\nknowledge and market inefficiencies to their strategic advantage; thus\nextracting value from trades not accessible to others. This situation is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that blockchain-based markets and decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) instruments are mostly unregulated. Though a large body of work\nhas already studied the unfairness of different aspects of DeFi and\ncryptocurrency trading, the economic intricacies of non-fungible token (NFT)\ntrades necessitate further analysis and academic scrutiny.\n  The trading volume of NFTs has skyrocketed in recent years. A single NFT\ntrade worth over a million US dollars, or marketplaces making billions in\nrevenue is not uncommon nowadays. While previous research indicated the\npresence of wrongdoings in the NFT market, to our knowledge, we are the first\nto study predatory trading practices, what we call opportunistic trading, in\ndepth. Opportunistic traders are sophisticated actors who employ automated,\nhigh-frequency NFT trading strategies, which, oftentimes, are malicious,\ndeceptive, or, at the very least, unfair. Such attackers weaponize their\nadvanced technical knowledge and superior understanding of DeFi protocols to\ndisrupt trades of unsuspecting users, and collect profits from economic\nsituations that are inaccessible to ordinary users, in a \"supposedly\" fair\nmarket. In this paper, we explore three such broad classes of opportunistic\nstrategies aiming to realize three distinct trading objectives, viz., acquire,\ninstant profit generation, and loss minimization.",

            "summary": "In traditional blockchain networks, transaction fees are only allocated to\nfull nodes (i.e., miners) regardless of the contribution of forwarding\nbehaviors of light nodes. However, the lack of forwarding incentive reduces the\nwillingness of light nodes to relay transactions, especially in the\nenergy-constrained Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET). This paper proposes a novel\ndual auction mechanism to allocate transaction fees for forwarding and\nvalidation behaviors in the wireless blockchain network. The dual auction\nmechanism consists of two auction models: the forwarding auction and the\nvalidation auction. In the forwarding auction, forwarding nodes use Generalized\nFirst Price (GFP) auction to choose transactions to forward. Besides,\nforwarding nodes adjust the forwarding probability through a no-regret\nalgorithm to improve efficiency. In the validation auction, full nodes select\ntransactions using Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism to construct the block.\nWe prove that the designed dual auction mechanism is Incentive Compatibility\n(IC), Individual Rationality (IR), and Computational Efficiency (CE).\nEspecially, we derive the upper bound of the social welfare difference between\nthe social optimal auction and our proposed one. Extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed dual auction mechanism decreases energy and\nspectrum resource consumption and effectively improves social welfare without\nsacrificing the throughput and the security of the wireless blockchain network.",

However, because of the nature of blockchain, when a user\nwithdraws coins (i.e., transfers coins to an external on-chain account), all\nfuture transactions can be learned by the platform. This is in sharp contrast\nto conventional stock exchange where all external activities of users are\nalways hidden from the platform. Since the platform knows highly sensitive user\nprivate information such as passport number, bank information etc, linking all\n(on-chain) transactions raises a serious privacy concern about the potential\ndisastrous data breach in those cryptocurrency exchange platforms.\n  In this paper, we propose a cryptocurrency exchange that restores user\nanonymity for the first time. To our surprise, the seemingly well-studied\nprivacy/anonymity problem has several new challenges in this setting. Since the\npublic blockchain and internal transaction activities naturally provide many\nnon-trivial leakages to the platform, internal privacy is not only useful in\nthe usual sense but also becomes necessary for regaining the basic anonymity of\nuser transactions. We also ensure that the user cannot double spend, and the\nuser has to properly report accumulated profit for tax purposes, even in the\nprivate setting. We give a careful modeling and efficient construction of the\nsystem that achieves constant computation and communication overhead (with only\nsimple cryptographic tools and rigorous security analysis); we also implement\nour system and evaluate its practical performance.",

However, even under these\nfavorable conditions, prosumer engagement levels remain low, requiring trading\nmechanisms that are aligned with their social values and expectations. In this\npaper, we introduce an innovative hedonic game coordination and cooperation\nmodel for P2P energy trading among prosumers which considers the social\nrelationships within an energy community to create energy coalitions and\nfacilitate energy transactions among them. We defined a heuristic that\noptimizes the prosumers coalitions, considering their social and energy price\npreferences and balancing the energy demand and supply within the community. We\nintegrated the proposed hedonic game model into a state-of-the-art\nblockchain-based P2P energy flexibility market and evaluated its performance\nwithin an energy community of prosumers. The evaluation results on a\nblockchain-based P2P energy flexibility market show the effectiveness in\nconsidering social factors when creating coalitions, increasing the total\namount of energy transacted in a market session by 5% compared with other game\ntheory-based solutions. Finally, it shows the importance of the social\ndimensions of P2P energy transactions, the positive social dynamics in the\nenergy community increasing the amount of energy transacted by more than 10%\nwhile contributing to a more balanced energy demand and supply within the\ncommunity.",

            "summary": "Traditional blockchains cannot achieve the same transaction throughput as\nWeb2, so their use cases are limited. Therefore, state sharding has been\nproposed to improve transaction throughput by dividing the blockchain network\nand managing states and transactions in parallel. However, Nightshade in the\nNEAR Protocol, a type of state sharding, provides a rollback protocol to cancel\nthe generation of blocks containing inconsistent transaction results because\nprocessing cross-shard transactions (CSTXs) in a 2-phase commit may cause state\ninconsistency. We present a new attack that interferes with the generation of\nnew blocks by repeatedly executing CSTXs that certainly causes state\ninconsistency, causing continuous rollback. We also propose a block-generation\nprotocol called Synchro to incorporate all the state changes of each CSTX into\nthe same block by coordinating the block prior to approving transactions in\neach shard. Synchro eliminates the occurrence of the state inconsistency caused\nby the CSTXs and the necessity of the rollback protocol. We use zero-knowledge\nproof to make Synchro scalable in the global validation phase. Although the\nactual overhead of the zero-knowledge proof has not yet been evaluated, we show\nthat Synchro could achieve the same transaction throughput as Nightshade\ntheoretically, depending on the future innovations in zero-knowledge proof\ntechniques.",

Liquid democracy, also known as delegative voting, allows\nvoters to vote directly or delegate their voting power to others, thereby\ncontributing to the resolution of problems such as low voter turnout. In recent\nyears, liquid democracy has been widely adopted by Delegated-Proof-of-Stake\n(DPoS) blockchains and implemented successfully on platforms with millions of\nusers. However, little is known regarding the characteristics and actual\neffectiveness of liquid democracy in decentralized governance. This paper\nexplored for the first time the practical implementation of liquid democracy in\nDPoS blockchain systems. Using actual data collected from two major DPoS\nblockchains, EOS and Steem, our study compared and evaluated the participation\nof different types of users of DPoS blockchain systems in liquid democracy, as\nwell as extracting and analyzing the delegation chains and networks formed\nduring the process of liquid democracy within the systems. We believe that the\nfindings of this paper will contribute to further studies on the design and\nimplementation of liquid democracy and other voting mechanisms in decentralized\ngovernance.",

As more data becomes available and model\narchitectures become more complex, the need for more computational power\nincreases. On the other hand, since the introduction of Bitcoin as the first\ncryptocurrency and the establishment of the concept of blockchain as a\ndistributed ledger, many variants and approaches have been proposed. However,\nmany of them have one thing in common, which is the Proof of Work (PoW)\nconsensus mechanism. PoW is mainly used to support the process of new block\ngeneration. While PoW has proven its robustness, its main drawback is that it\nrequires a significant amount of processing power to maintain the security and\nintegrity of the blockchain. This is due to applying brute force to solve a\nhashing puzzle. To utilize the computational power available in useful and\nmeaningful work while keeping the blockchain secure, many techniques have been\nproposed, one of which is known as Proof of Deep Learning (PoDL). PoDL is a\nconsensus mechanism that uses the process of training a deep learning model as\nproof of work to add new blocks to the blockchain. In this paper, we survey the\nvarious approaches for PoDL. We discuss the different types of PoDL algorithms,\ntheir advantages and disadvantages, and their potential applications.

            "summary": "As multi-robot systems continue to advance and become integral to various\napplications, managing conflicts and ensuring secure access control are\ncritical challenges that need to be addressed. Access control is essential in\nmulti-robot systems to ensure secure and authorized interactions among robots,\nprotect sensitive data, and prevent unauthorized access to resources. This\npaper presents a novel framework for customizable conflict resolution and\nattribute-based access control in multi-robot systems for ROS 2 leveraging the\nHyperledger Fabric blockchain. We introduce an attribute-based access control\n(ABAC) Fabric-ROS 2 bridge to enable secure communication and control between\nusers and robots. By defining conflict resolution policies based on task\npriorities, robot capabilities, and user-defined constraints, our framework\noffers a flexible way to resolve conflicts. Additionally, it incorporates\nattribute-based access control, granting access rights based on user and robot\nattributes. ABAC offers a modular approach to control access compared to\nexisting access control approaches in ROS 2, such as SROS2. Through this\nframework, multi-robot systems can be managed efficiently, securely, and\nadaptably, ensuring controlled access to resources and managing conflicts. Our\nexperimental evaluation shows that our framework marginally improves latency\nand throughput over exiting Fabric and ROS 2 integration solutions. At higher\nnetwork load, it is the only solution to operate reliably without a diverging\ntransaction commitment latency. We also demonstrate how conflicts arising from\nsimultaneous control or a robot by two users are resolved in real-time and\nmotion distortion is effectively eliminated.",

            "summary": "The rapid development of blockchain has led to more and more funding pouring\ninto the cryptocurrency market, which also attracted cybercriminals' interest\nin recent years. The Ponzi scheme, an old-fashioned fraud, is now popular on\nthe blockchain, causing considerable financial losses to many crypto-investors.\nA few Ponzi detection methods have been proposed in the literature, most of\nwhich detect a Ponzi scheme based on its smart contract source code or opcode.\nThe contract-code-based approach, while achieving very high accuracy, is not\nrobust: first, the source codes of a majority of contracts on Ethereum are not\navailable, and second, a Ponzi developer can fool a contract-code-based\ndetection model by obfuscating the opcode or inventing a new profit\ndistribution logic that cannot be detected (since these models were trained on\nexisting Ponzi logics only). A transaction-based approach could improve the\nrobustness of detection because transactions, unlike smart contracts, are\nharder to be manipulated. However, the current transaction-based detection\nmodels achieve fairly low accuracy. We address this gap in the literature by\ndeveloping new detection models that rely only on the transactions, hence\nguaranteeing the robustness, and moreover, achieve considerably higher\nAccuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score than existing transaction-based\nmodels. This is made possible thanks to the introduction of novel\ntime-dependent features that capture Ponzi behaviours characteristics derived\nfrom our comprehensive data analyses on Ponzi and non-Ponzi data from the\nXBlock-ETH repository",

A key challenge in scaling these protocols has been the computational\ncomplexity associated with authenticator verification. We demonstrate that\nCarnot effectively addresses this bottleneck by adeptly streamlining the\nverification and aggregation of $O(log(N))$ authenticators per node. This\nnotable advancement marks a substantial improvement over the prevailing $O(N)$\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Leveraging this inherent property, Carnot\ndemonstrates its capacity to seamlessly scale to networks comprising tens to\nhundreds of thousands of nodes.

DeFi aims to create\na transparent and efficient financial ecosystem using smart contracts and\nemerging decentralized applications. However, the growing popularity of DeFi\nhas made it a target for fraudulent activities, resulting in losses of billions\nof dollars due to various types of frauds. To address these issues, researchers\nhave explored the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to\ndetect such fraudulent activities. Yet, there is a lack of a systematic survey\nto organize and summarize those existing works and to identify the future\nresearch opportunities. In this survey, we provide a systematic taxonomy of\nvarious frauds in the DeFi ecosystem, categorized by the different stages of a\nDeFi project's life cycle: project development, introduction, growth, maturity,\nand decline. This taxonomy is based on our finding: many frauds have strong\ncorrelations in the stage of the DeFi project. According to the taxonomy, we\nreview existing AI-powered detection methods, including statistical modeling,\nnatural language processing and other machine learning techniques, etc. We find\nthat fraud detection in different stages employs distinct types of methods and\nobserve the commendable performance of tree-based and graph-related models in\ntackling fraud detection tasks. By analyzing the challenges and trends, we\npresent the findings to provide proactive suggestion and guide future research\nin DeFi fraud detection.

To address this challenge, this paper\npresents a novel collaborative learning framework designed to detect attacks in\nblockchain transactions and smart contracts by analyzing transaction features.\nOur framework exhibits the capability to classify various types of blockchain\nattacks, including intricate attacks at the machine code level (e.g., injecting\nmalicious codes to withdraw coins from users unlawfully), which typically\nnecessitate significant time and security expertise to detect. To achieve that,\nthe proposed framework incorporates a unique tool that transforms transaction\nfeatures into visual representations, facilitating efficient analysis and\nclassification of low-level machine codes. Furthermore, we propose a customized\ncollaborative learning model to enable real-time detection of diverse attack\ntypes at distributed mining nodes. In order to create a comprehensive dataset,\nwe deploy a pilot system based on a private Ethereum network and conduct\nmultiple attack scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the\nmost comprehensive and diverse collection of transactions and smart contracts\nsynthesized in a laboratory for cyberattack detection in blockchain systems.\nOur framework achieves a detection accuracy of approximately 94\\% through\nextensive simulations and real-time experiments with a throughput of over 1,100\ntransactions per second.

In this paper, we propose an MEV\naware protocol design called Masquerade, and show that it will increase user\nsatisfaction and confidence in the system. We propose a strict per-transaction\nlevel of ordering to ensure that a transaction is committed either way even if\nit is revealed. In this protocol, we introduce the notion of a \"token\" to\nmitigate the actions taken by an adversary in an attack scenario. Such tokens\ncan be purchased voluntarily by users, who can then choose to include the token\nnumbers in their transactions. If the users include the token in their\ntransactions, then our protocol requires the block-builder to order the\ntransactions strictly according to token numbers. We show through extensive\nsimulations that this reduces the probability that the adversaries can benefit\nfrom MEV transactions as compared to existing current practices.",

First, we derive an explicit functional form\nfor the long-run utility of the miner using a martingale approach, and reveal a\ncritical discontinuity of the utility function, namely a small deviation from\nbeing truthful will yield a discrete jump (up or down) in the miner's utility.\nWe show that because of this discontinuity the $\\texttt{BSP}(\\gamma)$ mechanism\nwill fail a key desired property in TFM, $c$-side contract proofness ($c$-SCP).\nAs a remedy, we introduce another parameter $\\theta$, and propose a new\n$\\texttt{BSP}(\\theta)$ mechanism, and prove that it satisfies all three desired\nproperties of TFM: user- and miner-incentive compatibility (UIC and MIC) as\nwell as $c$-SCP, provided the parameter $\\theta$ falls into a specific range,\nalong with a proper tick size imposed on user bids.",

However, the\nneed for large-scale datasets to train ML models creates challenges for\ncentralized ML algorithms. The massive computation loads required for\nprocessing and the potential privacy risks associated with storing and\nprocessing data on central cloud servers put these algorithms under severe\nstrain. To address these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a\npromising solution, allowing privacy preservation by training models locally\nand exchanging them to improve overall performance. Additionally, the\ncomputational load is distributed across multiple clients, reducing the burden\non central servers. This paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge,\nthe first review discussing recent advancements of FL in CV applications,\ncomparing them to conventional centralized training paradigms. It provides an\noverview of current FL applications in various CV tasks, emphasizing the\nadvantages of FL and the challenges of implementing it in CV. To facilitate\nthis, the paper proposes a taxonomy of FL techniques in CV, outlining their\napplications and security threats. It also discusses privacy concerns related\nto implementing blockchain in FL schemes for CV tasks and summarizes existing\nprivacy preservation methods. Moving on, the paper identifies open research\nchallenges and potential future research directions to further exploit the\npotential of FL and blockchain in CV applications.",

            "summary": "Blockchains require deterministic execution in order to reach consensus. This\nis often guaranteed in languages designed to write smart contracts, such as\nSolidity. Application-specific blockchains or ``appchains'' allow the\nblockchain application logic to be written using general-purpose programming\nlanguages, giving developers more flexibility but also additional\nresponsibilities. In particular, developers must ensure that their blockchain\napplication logic does not contain any sources of non-determinism. Any source\nof non-determinism may be a potential source of vulnerabilities.\n  This paper focuses on the use of Static Application Security Testing (SAST)\ntools to detect such sources of non-determinism at development time. We focus\non Cosmos, a prominent open-source project that lets developers build\ninterconnected networks of application-specific blockchains. Cosmos provides a\nSoftware Development Kit (SDK) that allows these chains to be implemented in\nthe Go programming language. We create a corpus of 11 representative\nCosmos-based appchains to analyze for sources of non-determinism in Go.\n  As part of our study, we identified cosmos-sdk-codeql, a set of CodeQL code\nanalysis rules for Cosmos applications. We find that these rules generate many\nfalse positives and propose a refactored set of rules that more precisely\ndetects sources of non-determinism only in code that runs as part of the\nblockchain logic. We demonstrate a significant increase in the precision of the\nrules, making the SAST tool more effective and hence potentially contributing\nto enhanced security for Cosmos-based blockchains.",

However, these smart contracts are susceptible to vulnerabilities\nthat hackers can exploit, resulting in significant financial losses. In\nresponse to this growing concern, various initiatives have emerged. Notably,\nthe SWC vulnerability list played an important role in raising awareness and\nunderstanding of smart contract weaknesses. However, the SWC list lacks\nmaintenance and has not been updated with new vulnerabilities since 2020. To\naddress this gap, this paper introduces the Smart Contract Weakness Enumeration\n(SWE), a comprehensive and practical vulnerability list up until 2023. We\ncollect 273 vulnerability descriptions from 86 top conference papers and\njournal papers, employing open card sorting techniques to deduplicate and\ncategorize these descriptions. This process results in the identification of 40\ncommon contract weaknesses, which are further classified into 20 sub-research\nfields through thorough discussion and analysis. SWE provides a systematic and\ncomprehensive list of smart contract vulnerabilities, covering existing and\nemerging vulnerabilities in the last few years. Moreover, SWE is a scalable,\ncontinuously iterative program. We propose two update mechanisms for the\nmaintenance of SWE. Regular updates involve the inclusion of new\nvulnerabilities from future top papers, while irregular updates enable\nindividuals to report new weaknesses for review and potential addition to SWE.",

Previous systems tied reservations to\nautonomous-system numbers or network addresses, which limits the flexibility of\nreservations. In contrast, our system decouples reservations from network\nidentities and, as a result, the control plane from the data plane. This design\nchoice facilitates multiple co-existing control-plane mechanisms and enables\ninnovative approaches, such as a control plane based on blockchain smart\ncontracts that offers tradeable bandwidth-reservation assets and end-to-end\nguarantees. The data-plane design ensures simplicity for efficient processing\non border routers, which streamlines implementation, deployment, and traffic\npolicing while maintaining robust security properties.",

To address this gap, we conducted both a\nbibliometric study of 2525 articles and a lexicometric study of 123 articles.\nThe bibliometric study provided holistic insights into the evolution and\ndistribution of blockchain research, including influential researchers and\ncountries, discipline composition, knowledge development trends, and emerging\nfrontiers. The lexicometric study identified the boundary concept structure\nwith a quantitative textual approach, extracting the strongest signifying\nepistemic communities. Our findings indicate that blockchain research draws\nfrom four major disciplines, making it a multidisciplinary field. With the\nincreasing maturity and development of technological infrastructure, the\napplication and management of blockchain become increasingly relevant issues.\nOur analysis suggests that blockchain can be considered more of a boundary\nobject than a disruptive change from knowledge perspectives. Therefore, this\npaper proposes a comprehensive understanding of the development path and\nepistemic concepts of blockchain research.",

Looking after those sensitive data that contributes to measure the\nlocalisation factors of the vehicle, conventional centralised techniques can be\nmisused to update the legitimate vehicular status maliciously. As investigated,\nthe existing centralized false data detection approach based on state and\nlikelihood estimation has a reprehensible trade-off in terms of accuracy,\ntrust, cost, and efficiency. Blockchain with Fuzzy-logic Intelligence has shown\nits potential to solve localisation issues, trust and false data detection\nchallenges encountered by today's autonomous vehicular system. The proposed\nBlockchain-based fuzzy solution demonstrates a novel false data detection and\nreputation preservation technique. The illustrated proposed model filters false\nand anomalous data based on the vehicles' rules and behaviours. Besides\nimproving the detection accuracy and eliminating the single point of failure,\nthe contributions include appropriating fuzzy AI functions within the Road-side\nUnit node before authorizing status data by a Blockchain network.

The employment of\nblockchain, however, introduces additional overhead. To enable a compact and\nefficient workflow, we design a novel lightweight consensus algorithm, named\nProof of Federated Edge Learning (PoFEL), to recycle the energy consumed for\nlocal model training. Specifically, the leader node is selected by evaluating\nthe intermediate FEL models from all edge servers instead of other\nenergy-wasting but meaningless calculations. This design thus improves the\nsystem efficiency compared with traditional BHFL frameworks. To prevent model\nplagiarism and bribery voting during the consensus process, we propose\nHash-based Commitment and Digital Signature (HCDS) and Bayesian Truth\nSerum-based Voting (BTSV) schemes. Finally, we devise an incentive mechanism to\nmotivate continuous contributions from clients to the learning task.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed BHFL system with the\ncorresponding consensus protocol and incentive mechanism achieves\neffectiveness, low computational cost, and fairness.",

As such, we address the challenge of selfish peers\nby devising a mechanism to reward sustained cooperation. Instead of relying on\nglobal accountability mechanisms, we propose a protocol that naturally\naggregates local evaluations of cooperation. Traditional mechanisms are often\nvulnerable to Sybil and misreporting attacks. However, our approach overcomes\nthese issues by limiting the benefits selfish peers can gain without incurring\nany cost.

We then present an\nattack, the $n$-split attack, where an adversary splits the honest miners\nbetween multiple chains, and show that it is successful for $\\beta m \\ge 1-\ne^{-(1-\\beta)m}$, thus proving that $\\beta m= 1- e^{-(1-\\beta)m}$ is the tight\nsecurity threshold of EC. This corresponds roughly to an adversary with $20\\%$\nof the total storage pledged to the chain. Finally, we propose two improvements\nto EC security that would increase this threshold.

            "summary": "We argue that transaction ordering techniques for capturing Maximal\nExtractable Value (MEV) in blockchains where fees can influence the execution\nsequence do not directly apply to blockchains where execution order is\ndetermined based on transactions' arrival times. The First-Come-First-Served\n(FCFS) nature of such blockchains can yield different optimization strategies\nfor MEV searchers, requiring further study. This paper explores the\napplicability of MEV extraction techniques from fee-based blockchains on an\nFCFS blockchain such as Algorand. Our results reveal similarities to recent\ntrends on fee-based blockchains like Ethereum, with most arbitrages occurring\nthrough backruns on pending transactions in the network. However, we attribute\nthe outcomes to different underlying reasons. While we do not observe any\nlatency optimizations between specific searchers and block proposers, we\ndiscuss that this is due to searchers adopting similar strategies and\nAlgorand's relay-based network infrastructure. We finally propose a novel\nstrategy for searchers through Batch Transaction Issuance, leading the network\nto congestion and enabling frontrunning-based ordering techniques.",

In order to make informed\ninvestment decisions, it is essential to comprehend the factors that impact\ncryptocurrency prices and to identify risky cryptocurrencies. This paper\nfocuses on analyzing historical data and using artificial intelligence\nalgorithms on on-chain parameters to identify the factors affecting a\ncryptocurrency's price and to find risky cryptocurrencies. We conducted an\nanalysis of historical cryptocurrencies' on-chain data and measured the\ncorrelation between the price and other parameters. In addition, we used\nclustering and classification in order to get a better understanding of a\ncryptocurrency and classify it as risky or not. The analysis revealed that a\nsignificant proportion of cryptocurrencies (39%) disappeared from the market,\nwhile only a small fraction (10%) survived for more than 1000 days. Our\nanalysis revealed a significant negative correlation between cryptocurrency\nprice and maximum and total supply, as well as a weak positive correlation\nbetween price and 24-hour trading volume. Moreover, we clustered\ncryptocurrencies into five distinct groups using their on-chain parameters,\nwhich provides investors with a more comprehensive understanding of a\ncryptocurrency when compared to those clustered with it. Finally, by\nimplementing multiple classifiers to predict whether a cryptocurrency is risky\nor not, we obtained the best f1-score of 76% using K-Nearest Neighbor.",

Development authorities require land\nfor infrastructure projects and other amenities, while landowners hold onto\ntheir land for both its usage and its financial value. Transferable Development\nRights (TDRs) serve as a mechanism to separate the development rights\nassociated with the land from the physical land itself. Development authorities\nacquire the land by offering compensation in the form of TDRs, which hold\nmonetary value. In this paper, we present the tokenization of development\nrights, focusing on the implementation in collaboration with a development\nauthority. While there have been previous implementations of land tokenization,\nwe believe our approach is the first to tokenize development rights\nspecifically. Our implementation addresses practical challenges related to\nrecord-keeping, ground verification of land, and the unique identification of\nstakeholders. We ensure the accurate evaluation of development rights by\nincorporating publicly available circle rates, which consider the ground\ndevelopment of the land and its surrounding areas.",

            "summary": "Fake products are items that are marketed and sold as genuine, high-quality\nproducts but are counterfeit or low-quality knockoffs. These products are often\ndesigned to closely mimic the appearance and branding of the genuine product to\ndeceive consumers into thinking they are purchasing the real thing. Fake\nproducts can range from clothing and accessories to electronics and other goods\nand can be found in a variety of settings, including online marketplaces and\nbrick-and-mortar stores. Blockchain technology can be used to help detect fake\nproducts in a few different ways. One of the most common ways is through the\nuse of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of\nthe agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of\ncode. This allows for a high level of transparency and traceability in supply\nchain transactions, making it easier to identify and prevent the sale of fake\nproducts and the use of unique product identifiers, such as serial numbers or\nQR codes, that are recorded on the blockchain. This allows consumers to easily\nverify the authenticity of a product by scanning the code and checking it\nagainst the information recorded on the blockchain. In this study, we will use\nsmart contracts to detect fake products and will evaluate based on Gas cost and\nethers used for each implementation.",

Blockchains have several properties\nthat can address these requirements. Previous systems utilized public\nblockchains, i.e., treated blockchain as a black box, and benefiting from the\nimmutability property. However, the blockchain was accessible to everyone,\ngiving rise to security concerns and moreover, efficient extraction of\nprovenance faces challenges due to the enormous scale and complexity of digital\ndata. This necessitates a tailored blockchain design for digital forensics. Our\nsolution, Forensiblock has a novel design that automates investigation steps,\nensures secure data access, traces data origins, preserves records, and\nexpedites provenance extraction. Forensiblock incorporates Role-Based Access\nControl with Staged Authorization (RBAC-SA) and a distributed Merkle root for\ncase tracking. These features support authorized resource access with an\nefficient retrieval of provenance records. Particularly, comparing two methods\nfor extracting provenance records off chain storage retrieval with Merkle root\nverification and a brute-force search the offchain method is significantly\nbetter, especially as the blockchain size and number of cases increase. We also\nfound that our distributed Merkle root creation slightly increases smart\ncontract processing time but significantly improves history access. Overall, we\nshow that Forensiblock offers secure, efficient, and reliable handling of\ndigital forensic data",

It\nenables nodes in wireless networks to reach consistency without any trusted\nentity. However, due to the instability of wireless communication links, the\nreliability of the PBFT consensus will be seriously affected. Meanwhile, it is\ndifficult for nodes in wireless scenarios to obtain a timely energy supply. The\nhigh-energy-consumption blockchain functions will quickly consume the power of\nnodes, thus, affecting consensus performance. Fortunately, the symbiotic radio\n(SR) system enabled by cognitive backscatter communications can provide a\nsolution to the above problems. In SR, the secondary transmitter (STx)\ntransmits messages by modulating its information over the radio frequency (RF)\nsignal of the primary transmitter (PTx) with extremely low energy consumption,\nand the STx can provide multipath gain to the PTx in return. In our paper, we\npropose the symbiotic PBFT (S-PBFT) consensus benefited from the mutualistic\ntransmission in SR, which can increase the consensus security by 54.82%, and\nsave energy consumption by about 10%.",

Decentralized blockchain-based solutions are becoming more appealing\nfor cloud auditing environments because of the immutable nature of blockchain.\nHowever, the decentralized structure of blockchain results in considerable\nsynchronization and communication overhead, which increases maintenance costs\nfor cloud service providers (CSP). This paper proposes a Merkle Hash Tree based\narchitecture named Entangled Merkle Forest to support version control and\ndynamic auditing of information in centralized cloud environments. We utilized\na semi-trusted third-party auditor to conduct the auditing tasks with minimal\nprivacy-preserving file metadata.

Many of these systems used secure\nprotocols like end-to-end encryption to ensure strong security in one-to-one\ncommunication.

Also, it allows the government\nto track and regulate their citizens' activities, which poses significant\nthreats to \"digital freedom\". Also, these systems have failed to achieve\nsecurity attributes like confidentiality, integrity, and privacy for group\ncommunications. In this paper, we present a novel blockchain-based secure\nmessaging system named Quarks that overcomes the security pitfalls of the\nexisting systems and eliminates centralized control. We have analyzed our\narchitecture with security models to demonstrate the system's reliability and\nusability. We have developed a Proof of Concept (PoC) of the Quarks system\nleveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and conducted load testing on\nthat. We noticed that our PoC system achieves all the desired attributes that\nare prevalent in a traditional centralized messaging scheme despite the limited\ncapacity of the development and testing environment.

Based on Multi-Authority Attribute-Based\nEncryption (MA-ABE), MARTSIA enables read-access control over shared data at\nthe level of message parts. User-defined policies determine whether an actor\ncan interpret the publicly stored information or not, depending on the actor's\nattributes declared by a consortium of certifiers. Still, all nodes in the\nblockchain network can attest to the publication of the (encrypted) data. We\nprovide a formal analysis of the security guarantees of MARTSIA, and illustrate\nthe proof-of-concept implementation over multiple blockchain platforms.

Recently, advances have been made in the generalization of these\nproperties, but there is still a lack of an overarching framework that provides\nthe full set of properties required for practical cross-chain commerce:\ntransaction atomicity, stablecoin support, privacy-preserving digital\nidentities, and general applicability.\n  In this paper, we present BlockChain I/O to provide such a framework.\nBlockChain I/O uses entities called cross-chain services to relay information\nbetween different chains. Cross-chain services cannot violate transaction\natomicity, and are disincentivized from other types of misbehavior -- i.e.,\ncausing delays or misrepresenting information -- through an audit system.\nBlockChain I/O uses stablecoins to mitigate price fluctuations, and a Digital\nID system to allow users to prove aspects of their identity without violating\nprivacy.

In this chapter, we\nwill survey recent progress on the trading and wealth evolution in a\ncryptocurrency where the new coins are issued according to the PoS protocol. We\nfirst consider the wealth evolution in the PoS protocol assuming no trading,\nand focus on the problem of decentralisation. Next we consider each miner's\ntrading incentive and strategy through the lens of optimal control, where the\nminer needs to trade off PoS mining and trading. Finally, we study the\ncollective behavior of the miners in a PoS trading environment by a mean field\nmodel. We use both stochastic and analytic tools in our study. A list of open\nproblems are also presented.",

In this work, we investigate the recipient anonymity\nand unlinkability guarantees of Umbra, the most widely used implementation of\nthe stealth address scheme on Ethereum, and its three off-chain scalability\nsolutions, e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. We define and evaluate four\nheuristics to uncover the real recipients of stealth payments. We find that for\nthe majority of Umbra payments, it is straightforward to establish the\nrecipient, hence nullifying the benefits of using Umbra. Specifically, we find\nthe real recipient of $48.5\\%$, $25.8\\%$, $65.7\\%$, and $52.6\\%$ of all Umbra\ntransactions on the Ethereum main net, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism\nnetworks, respectively.

            "summary": "Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an emerging identity system that facilitates\nsecure credential issuance and verification without placing trust in any\ncentralised authority. To bypass central trust, most SSI implementations place\nblockchain as a trusted mediator by placing credential transactions on-chain.\nYet, existing SSI platforms face trust issues as all credential issuers in SSI\nare not supported with adequate trust. Current SSI solutions provide trust\nsupport to the officiated issuers (e.g., government agencies), who must follow\na precise process to assess their credentials. However, there is no structured\ntrust support for individuals of SSI who may attempt to issue a credential\n(e.g., letter of consent) in the context of business processes. Therefore, some\nrisk-averse verifiers in the system may not accept the credentials from\nindividual issuers to avoid carrying the cost of mishaps from potentially\ninadmissible credentials without reliance on a trusted agency. This paper\nproposes a trust propagation protocol that supports individual users to be\ntrusted as verifiable issuers in the SSI platform by establishing a trust\npropagation credential template in the blockchain. Our approach utilises (i)\nthe sanitizable signature scheme to propagate the required trust to an\nindividual issuer, (ii) a voting mechanism to minimises the possibility of\ncollusion. Our implementation demonstrates that the solution is both practical\nand performs well under varying system loads.",

First, the natural of critical\ninfrastructure requires it to be well protected from various cyber attacks.\nSecond, performance is usually important for critical infrastructure and it\ncannot afford an expensive protection mechanism. While a large number of\nTEE-based critical infrastructure protection systems have been proposed to\naddress various security challenges (e.g., secure sensing and reliable\ncontrol), most existing works ignore one important feature, i.e., devices\ncomprised the critical infrastructure may be equipped with multiple\nincompatible TEE technologies and belongs to different owners. This feature\nmakes it hard for these devices to establish mutual trust and form a unified\nTEE environment. To address these challenges and fully unleash the potential of\nTEE technology for critical infrastructure protection, we propose DHTee, a\ndecentralized coordination mechanism. DHTee uses blockchain technology to\nsupport key TEE functions in a heterogeneous TEE environment, especially the\nattestation service. A Device equipped with one TEE can interact securely with\nthe blockchain to verify whether another potential collaborating device\nclaiming to have a different TEE meets the security requirements. DHTee is also\nflexible and can support new TEE schemes without affecting devices using\nexisting TEEs that have been supported by the system.",

However, there exist several critical challenges, such as the single\npoint of failure and potential stragglers in both edge servers and local\ndevices. To resolve these issues, we propose a decentralized and\nstraggler-tolerant blockchain-based HFL (BHFL) framework. Specifically, a\nRaft-based consortium blockchain is deployed on edge servers to provide a\ndistributed and trusted computing environment for global model aggregation in\nBHFL. To mitigate the influence of stragglers on learning, we propose a novel\naggregation method, HieAvg, which utilizes the historical weights of stragglers\nto estimate the missing submissions. Furthermore, we optimize the overall\nlatency of BHFL by jointly considering the constraints of global model\nconvergence and blockchain consensus delay. Theoretical analysis and\nexperimental evaluation show that our proposed BHFL based on HieAvg can\nconverge in the presence of stragglers, which performs better than the\ntraditional methods even when the loss function is non-convex and the data on\nlocal devices are non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID).",

The NFT minting process allows depositors to exchange their capital\nfor an NFT representing their stake in a validator, while the treasury contract\nmanages the registry of NFT holders and handles rewards distribution. Validator\nsmart contract wallets are employed to create a trustless connection between\nthe validator operator and the treasury, enabling autonomous staking and\nunstaking processes based on predefined conditions. In addition, the proposed\nsystem incorporates protection mechanisms for depositors, such as triggered\nexits in case of non-payment of rewards and a penalty payout from the validator\noperator. The arrangement benefits from the extensibility and interoperability\nof web3 technologies, with potential applications in the broader digital\necosystem.

Ethereum uses a\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which depends on financial incentives\nto ensure that validators perform certain duties and do not act maliciously.\nShould a validator attempt to defraud the system, legitimate validators will\nidentify this and then staked cryptocurrency is `burned' through a process of\nslashing.\n  In this paper, we show that an attacker who has compromised a set of\nvalidators could threaten to perform malicious actions that would result in\nslashing and thus, hold those validators to ransom. We use game theory to study\nhow an attacker can coerce payment from a victim, for example by deploying a\nsmart contract to provide a root of trust shared between attacker and victim\nduring the extortion process. Our game theoretic model finds that it is in the\ninterests of the validators to fully pay the ransom due to a lack of systemic\nprotections for validators. Financial risk is solely placed on the victim\nduring such an attack, with no mitigations available to them aside from\ncapitulation (payment of ransom) in many scenarios. Such attacks could be\ndisruptive to Ethereum and, likely, to many other PoS networks, if public trust\nin the validator system is eroded. We also discuss and evaluate potential\nmitigation measures arising from our analysis of the game theoretic model.",

As more large AI models proliferate (personalizing and\nspecializing to a variety of domains), there is a tremendous need to have a\nneutral trust-free platform that allows the hosting of AI models, clients\nreceiving AI services efficiently, yet in a trust-free, incentive compatible,\nByzantine behavior resistant manner. In this paper we propose SAKSHI, a\ntrust-free decentralized platform specifically suited for AI services. The key\ndesign principles of SAKSHI are the separation of the data path (where AI query\nand service is managed) and the control path (where routers and compute and\nstorage hosts are managed) from the transaction path (where the metering and\nbilling of services are managed over a blockchain). This separation is enabled\nby a \"proof of inference\" layer which provides cryptographic resistance against\na variety of misbehaviors, including poor AI service, nonpayment for service,\ncopying of AI models. This is joint work between multiple universities\n(Princeton University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Tsinghua\nUniversity, HKUST) and two startup companies (Witness Chain and Eigen Layer).",

The energy will be\nmore efficiently used while maintaining the ledger. However deep learning\nmodels are problem-specific and can be extremely complex. Current PoDL\nconsensuses still require much work to realize in the real world. In this\npaper, we proposed a novel consensus named\nProof-of-Federated-Learning-Subchain(PoFLSC) to fill the gap. We applied a\nsubchain to record the training, challenging, and auditing activities and\nemphasized the importance of valuable datasets in partner selection. We\nsimulated 20 miners in the subchain to demonstrate the effectiveness of PoFLSC.\nWhen we reduce the pool size concerning the reservation priority order, the\ndrop rate difference in the performance in different scenarios further exhibits\nthat the miner with a higher Shapley Value (SV) will gain a better opportunity\nto be selected when the size of the subchain pool is limited.

Traditional Identity Management Systems are centralized, which\nmakes them single-point-of-failure, vulnerable to attacks and data breaches,\nand non-scalable. In contrast, decentralized identity management based on the\nblockchain can ensure secure and transparent access to patient data while\npreserving privacy. This approach enables patients to control their personal\nhealth data while granting permission for medical personnel to access specific\ninformation as needed. We propose a decentralized identity management system\nfor healthcare systems named BDIMHS based on a permissioned blockchain with\nHyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries. We develop further descriptions of\nrequired functionalities and provide high-level procedures for network\ninitialization, enrollment, registration, issuance, verification and revocation\nfunctionalities. The proposed solution improves data security, privacy,\nimmutability, interoperability, and patient autonomy by using selective\ndisclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable\nCredentials.

The healthcare metaverses allow\nfor effective decision-making and data analytics for users. However, there\nstill exist critical challenges in building healthcare metaverses, such as the\nrisk of sensitive data leakage and issues with sensing data security and\nfreshness, as well as concerns around incentivizing data sharing. In this\npaper, we first design a user-centric privacy-preserving framework based on\ndecentralized Federated Learning (FL) for healthcare metaverses. To further\nimprove the privacy protection of healthcare metaverses, a cross-chain\nempowered FL framework is utilized to enhance sensing data security. This\nframework utilizes a hierarchical cross-chain architecture with a main chain\nand multiple subchains to perform decentralized, privacy-preserving, and secure\ndata training in both virtual and physical spaces. Moreover, we utilize Age of\nInformation (AoI) as an effective data-freshness metric and propose an\nAoI-based contract theory model under Prospect Theory (PT) to motivate sensing\ndata sharing in a user-centric manner. This model exploits PT to better capture\nthe subjective utility of the service provider.

Here, we explore the evolution of daily\ntransaction graphs of ERC20 token transactions, which sheds light on the\ntrader's behavior during the Black Swan Events -- 2018 crypto crash and the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. By using the tools from network science and differential\ngeometry, we analyze 0.98 billion of ERC20 token transaction data from November\n2015 to January 2023. Our analysis reveals that ERC20 financial ecosystem has\nevolved from a localized wealth formation period to a more mature financial\necosystem where wealth has dispersed among the traders in the network after the\ncrypto crash and during the pandemic period. Before the crash, most sellers\nonly sell the tokens, and buyers only buy the tokens. However, after the crash\nand during the pandemic period, sellers and buyers both performed buying and\nselling activities. In addition, we observe no significant negative impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on user behavior in the financial ecosystem.",

            "summary": "This paper introduces TeleBTC, a fully decentralized protocol designed to\nwrap Bitcoin (BTC) on programmable blockchains. The creation of a decentralized\nwrapped BTC presents challenges due to the non-programmable nature of Bitcoin,\nmaking it difficult to custody BTCs in a decentralized way. Existing solutions\nhave addressed this challenge by introducing an external layer of validators\nwho take custody of users' BTCs. However, the security and decentralization of\nthis layer are inferior to the underlying blockchains on which wrapped BTC is\nbuilt. Moreover, the process of joining or leaving for a validator has become\noverly complex and expensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\napproach that eliminates the need for such an external layer by leveraging the\nlight client bridge protocol. Additionally, we employ economic mechanisms such\nas incentivization and slashing, resulting in a secure and trust-minimized\nwrapped BTC solution. With TeleBTC, users can seamlessly transfer their BTC to\nother blockchains and utilize it within decentralized applications.\nFurthermore, they can unwrap their TeleBTC and reclaim the native BTC. To\naddress the high costs associated with light client bridges, we present an\noptimistic approach that minimizes the cost. This approach significantly\nreduces the operational expenses of running the protocol.",

            "summary": "One of the most important features of blockchain protocols is\ndecentralization, as their main contribution is that they formulate a\ndistributed ledger that will be maintained and extended without the need of a\ntrusted party. Bitcoin has been criticized for its tendency to centralization,\nas very few pools control the majority of the hashing power. Pass et al.\nproposed FruitChain [PODC 17] and claimed that this blockchain protocol\nmitigates the formation of pools by reducing the variance of the rewards in the\nsame way as mining pools, but in a fully decentralized fashion. Many follow up\npapers consider that the problem of centralization in Proof-of-Work (PoW)\nblockchain systems can be solved via lower rewards' variance, and that in\nFruitChain the formation of pools is unnecessary.\n  Contrary to the common perception, in this work, we prove that lower variance\nof the rewards does not eliminate the tendency of the PoW blockchain protocols\nto centralization; miners have also other incentives to create large pools, and\nspecifically to share the cost of creating the instance they need to solve the\nPoW puzzle.\n  We abstract the procedures of FruitChain as oracles and assign to each of\nthem a cost. Then, we provide a formal definition of a pool in a blockchain\nsystem, and by utilizing the notion of equilibrium with virtual payoffs (EVP)\n[AFT 21], we prove that there is a completely centralized EVP, where all the\nparties form a single pool controlled by one party called the pool leader. The\npool leader is responsible for creating the instance used for the PoW\nprocedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines\nthe construction of mining pools in the FruitChain system.",

            "summary": "With the rapid development of cloud computing, vast amounts of duplicated\ndata are being uploaded to the cloud, wasting storage resources. Deduplication\n(dedup) is an efficient solution to save storage costs of cloud storage\nproviders (CSPs) by storing only one copy of the uploaded data. However, cloud\nusers do not benefit directly from dedup and may be reluctant to dedup their\ndata. To motivate the cloud users towards dedup, CSPs offer incentives on\nstorage fees. The problems with the existing dedup schemes are that they do not\nconsider: (1) correctness - the incentive offered to a cloud user should be\ncomputed correctly without any prejudice. (2) fairness - the cloud user\nreceives the file link and access rights of the uploaded data if and only if\nthe CSP receives the storage fee. Meeting these requirements without a trusted\nparty is non-trivial, and most of the existing dedup schemes do not apply.\nAnother drawback is that most of the existing schemes emphasize incentives to\ncloud users but failed to provide a reliable incentive mechanism.\n  As public Blockchain networks emulate the properties of trusted parties, in\nthis paper, we propose a new Blockchain-based dedup scheme to meet the above\nrequirements. In our scheme, a smart contract computes the incentives on\nstorage fee, and the fairness rules are encoded into the smart contract for\nfacilitating fair payments between the CSPs and cloud users. We prove the\ncorrectness and fairness of the proposed scheme. We also design a new incentive\nmechanism and show that the scheme is individually rational and incentive\ncompatible.

            "summary": "The vision of the upcoming 6G technologies, characterized by ultra-dense\nnetwork, low latency, and fast data rate is to support Pervasive AI (PAI) using\nzero-touch solutions enabling self-X (e.g., self-configuration,\nself-monitoring, and self-healing) services. However, the research on 6G is\nstill in its infancy, and only the first steps have been taken to conceptualize\nits design, investigate its implementation, and plan for use cases. Toward this\nend, academia and industry communities have gradually shifted from theoretical\nstudies of AI distribution to real-world deployment and standardization. Still,\ndesigning an end-to-end framework that systematizes the AI distribution by\nallowing easier access to the service using a third-party application assisted\nby a zero-touch service provisioning has not been well explored. In this\ncontext, we introduce a novel platform architecture to deploy a zero-touch\nPAI-as-a-Service (PAIaaS) in 6G networks supported by a blockchain-based smart\nsystem. This platform aims to standardize the pervasive AI at all levels of the\narchitecture and unify the interfaces in order to facilitate the service\ndeployment across application and infrastructure domains, relieve the users\nworries about cost, security, and resource allocation, and at the same time,\nrespect the 6G stringent performance requirements. As a proof of concept, we\npresent a Federated Learning-as-a-service use case where we evaluate the\nability of our proposed system to self-optimize and self-adapt to the dynamics\nof 6G networks in addition to minimizing the users' perceived costs.",

A blockchain is a secure,\ndecentralized, and transparent system that allows for the creation of a\ntamper-proof ledger for transactions without the need for intermediaries.

Data governance is a common approach\nto managing data, but it faces many challenges such as data silos, data\nconsistency, privacy, security, and access control. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates data\ntrust in federated learning with InterPlanetary File System, blockchain, and\nsmart contracts to facilitate secure and mutually beneficial data sharing while\nproviding incentives, access control mechanisms, and penalizing any dishonest\nbehavior. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is\neffective in improving the accuracy of federated learning models while ensuring\nthe security and fairness of the data-sharing process. The research paper also\npresents a decentralized federated learning platform that successfully trained\na CNN model on the MNIST dataset using blockchain technology. The platform\nenables multiple workers to train the model simultaneously while maintaining\ndata privacy and security. The decentralized architecture and use of blockchain\ntechnology allow for efficient communication and coordination between workers.\nThis platform has the potential to facilitate decentralized machine learning\nand support privacy-preserving collaboration in various domains.",

However, the widespread adoption of this new automated technology\nposes significant research challenges in terms of authenticity, integrity,\ninteroperability, and efficiency. These challenges originate from the core\ntechnologies underlying the Metaverse and are exacerbated by its complex\nnature. As a solution to these challenges, this paper presents a novel\nframework based on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The framework employs the\nProof-of-Stake consensus algorithm, a blockchain-based technology, for data\ntransaction, validation, and resource management. PoS efficiently consume\nenergy and provide a streamlined validation approach instead of\nresource-intensive mining. This ability makes PoS an ideal candidate for\nMetaverse applications. By combining NFTs for user authentication and PoS for\ndata integrity, enhanced transaction throughput, and improved scalability, the\nproposed blockchain mechanism demonstrates noteworthy advantages. Through\nsecurity analysis, experimental and simulation results, it is established that\nthe NFT-based approach coupled with the PoS algorithm is secure and efficient\nfor Metaverse applications.",

It is necessary to increase the use of renewable energy sources (RESs)\nto meet the increasing energy demand due to high prices of fossil-fuel based\nenergy. Federated learning (FL) is the most emerging technique in the field of\nartificial intelligence. Federated learning helps to generate global model at\nserver side by ensemble locally trained models at remote edges sites while\npreserving data privacy. The global model used to predict energy demand to\nsatisfy the needs of consumers. In this article, we have proposed Blockchain\nbased safe distributed ledger technology for transaction of data between\nprosumer and consumer to ensure their transparency, traceability and security.\nFurthermore, we have also proposed a Federated learning model to forecast the\nenergy requirements of consumer and prosumer. Moreover, Blockchain has been\nused to store excess energy data from prosumer for better management of energy\nbetween prosumer and grid.

Although Online Food Delivery (OFD) is a popular delivery system\nin Bangladesh, it has yet to ensure item authenticity, especially with the\nincreasing demand for lightweight commodity delivery services across the\ncountry. The authenticity of products, involvement of multiple parties, and\nfair exchange are all challenging aspects of coast-to-coast services.\nTherefore, it is necessary for the three entities involved in the supply chain\ntransaction - Seller, Carrier, and Buyer - to establish at least two\npeer-to-peer operations to ensure reliability and efficiency. To address these\nlimitations and meet consumer expectations, the study proposes a framework for\na nationwide on-demand marketplace for lightweight commodity items and a\ndelivery system. Furthermore, transaction details are stored in a Blockchain to\nensure the transparency and reliability of the proposed system.",

Our findings revealed that participants supported\nseveral ideological goals for their projects, with decentralization being a\npivotal mechanism to enable user autonomy, distribute governance power, and\npromote financial inclusion. However, participants acknowledged the practical\ndifficulties in fulfilling these promises, including the need for rapid\ntechnology development, conflicts of interest among stakeholders due to\nplatform financing dynamics, and the challenge of expanding to mainstream users\nwho may not share the \"Web3 ethos.\" If negotiated ineffectively, these\nchallenges could lead to negative outcomes, such as corrupt governance,\nincreased inequality, and increased prevalence of scams and dubious investment\nschemes.

Earlier\nresearch identifies the impact of ethics and society on the price prediction of\nCryptoPunks. Since the booming year of the NFT market in 2021, the discussion\nof CryptoPunks has propagated on social media. Still, existing literature\nhasn't considered the social sentiment factors after the historical turning\npoint on NFT valuation. In this paper, we study how sentiments in social media,\ntogether with gender and skin tone, contribute to NFT valuations by an\nempirical analysis of social media, blockchain, and crypto exchange data. We\nevidence social sentiments as a significant contributor to the price prediction\nof CryptoPunks. Furthermore, we document structure changes in the valuation\nmechanics before and after 2021. Although people's attitudes towards\nCryptopunks are primarily positive, our findings reflect imbalances in\ntransaction activities and pricing based on gender and skin tone. Our result is\nconsistent and robust, controlling for the rarity of an NFT based on the set of\nhuman-readable attributes, including gender and skin tone.

Within this PoS framework, validators acquire a\ndistinct monopoly position during their assigned slots, given that block\nproposal rights are set deterministically, contrasting with Proof-of-Work (PoW)\nprotocols. Consequently, validators have the power to delay block proposals,\nstepping outside the honest validator specs, optimizing potential returns\nthrough MEV payments. Nonetheless, this strategic behaviour introduces the risk\nof orphaning if attestors fail to observe and vote on the block timely. Our\nquantitative analysis of this waiting phenomenon and its associated risks\nreveals an opportunity for enhanced MEV extraction, exceeding standard protocol\nrewards, and providing sufficient incentives for validators to play the game.\nNotably, our findings indicate that delayed proposals do not always result in\norphaning and orphaned blocks are not consistently proposed later than\nnon-orphaned ones. To further examine consensus stability under varying network\nconditions, we adopt an agent-based simulation model tailored for PoS-Ethereum,\nillustrating that consensus disruption will not be observed unless significant\ndelay strategies are adopted. Ultimately, this research offers valuable\ninsights into the advent of waiting games on Ethereum, providing a\ncomprehensive understanding of trade-offs and potential profits for validators\nwithin the blockchain ecosystem.",

            "summary": "Submitting fake certificates is a common problem in Southeast Asia, which\nprevents qualified candidates from getting the jobs they deserve. When applying\nfor a job, students must provide academic credentials as proof of their\nqualifications, acquired both inside and outside the classroom. Verifying\nacademic documents before hiring is crucial to prevent fraud. Employing\nblockchain technology has the potential to address this issue. Blockchain\nprovides an electronic certificate that is tamper-proof and non-repudiable,\nmaking it difficult for students to manipulate their academic credentials. This\npaper presents a prototype for an academic credential verification model that\nleverages the security features of blockchain and IPFS (Interplanetary File\nSystem). Certificates are temporarily stored in a database before being\ntransferred to IPFS, where a unique hash code is generated using a hashing\nalgorithm. This hash code serves as the certificate's unique identity and is\nstored in the blockchain nodes. Companies can verify an applicant's credentials\nby searching for the applicant and accessing their already verified\ncertificates. Utilizing IPFS as a middleman storage platform lowers the\nexpenses of directly storing massive data on the blockchain. To sum it up, the\nproposed solution would make the process of certificate verification more\nefficient, secure, and cost-effective. It would save time and resources that\nwould otherwise be used to manually verify certificates.",

            "summary": "Mining in proof-of-work blockchains has become an expensive affair requiring\nspecialized hardware capable of executing several megahashes per second at huge\nelectricity costs. Miners earn a reward each time they mine a block within the\nlongest chain, which helps offset their mining costs. It is therefore of\ninterest to miners to maximize the number of mined blocks in the blockchain and\nincrease revenue. A key factor affecting mining rewards earned is the\nconnectivity between miners in the peer-to-peer network. To maximize rewards a\nminer must choose its network connections carefully, ensuring existence of\npaths to other miners that are on average of a lower latency compared to paths\nbetween other miners. We formulate the problem of deciding whom to connect to\nfor miners as a combinatorial bandit problem. Each node picks its neighbors\nstrategically to minimize the latency to reach 90\\% of the hash power of the\nnetwork relative to the 90-th percentile latency from other nodes. A key\ncontribution of our work is the use of a network coordinates based model for\nlearning the network structure within the bandit algorithm. Experimentally we\nshow our proposed algorithm outperforming or matching baselines on diverse\nnetwork settings.",

To overcome these\nchallenges, a universal cost splitting mechanism is proposed that prioritises\nprivacy and accountability. It leverages a homomorphic encryption cryptosystem\nto provide privacy and employs blockchain technology to establish\naccountability. A dispute resolution mechanism is also introduced to minimise\nthe occurrence of erroneous bill calculations while ensuring accountability and\nnon-repudiation throughout the billing process.

In these applications, each user maintains a\nrelevant subset of the committed messages and the corresponding opening proofs\nwith the goal of ensuring a succinct global state. When the messages are\nupdated, users are given some global update information and update their\nopening proofs to match the new vector commitment. We investigate the relation\nbetween the size of the update information and the runtime complexity needed to\nupdate an individual opening proof. Existing vector commitment schemes require\nthat either the information size or the runtime scale linearly in the number\n$k$ of updated state elements. We construct a vector commitment scheme that\nasymptotically achieves both length and runtime that is sublinear in $k$,\nnamely $k^\\nu$ and $k^{1-\\nu}$ for any $\\nu \\in (0,1)$. We prove an\ninformation-theoretic lower bound on the relation between the update\ninformation size and runtime complexity that shows the asymptotic optimality of\nour scheme. For $\\nu = 1/2$, our constructions outperform Verkle commitments by\nabout a factor of $2$ in terms of both the update information size and runtime,\nbut makes use of larger public parameters.",

            "summary": "The incentive-compatibility properties of blockchain transaction fee\nmechanisms have been investigated with *passive* block producers that are\nmotivated purely by the net rewards earned at the consensus layer. This paper\nintroduces a model of *active* block producers that have their own private\nvaluations for blocks (representing, for example, additional value derived from\nthe application layer). The block producer surplus in our model can be\ninterpreted as one of the more common colloquial meanings of the term ``MEV.''\n  The main results of this paper show that transaction fee mechanism design is\nfundamentally more difficult with active block producers than with passive\nones: with active block producers, no non-trivial or approximately\nwelfare-maximizing transaction fee mechanism can be incentive-compatible for\nboth users and block producers. These results can be interpreted as a\nmathematical justification for the current interest in augmenting transaction\nfee mechanisms with additional components such as order flow auctions, block\nproducer competition, trusted hardware, or cryptographic techniques.",

An intriguing subject is the extent to which the utilization of on-chain\ndata can enhance an RL-based system's return performance compared to baselines.\nTherefore, in this study, we propose CryptoRLPM, a novel RL-based system\nincorporating on-chain data for end-to-end crypto PM. CryptoRLPM consists of\nfive units, spanning from information comprehension to trading order execution.\nIn CryptoRLPM, the on-chain data are tested and specified for each crypto to\nsolve the issue of ineffectiveness of metrics. Moreover, the scalable nature of\nCryptoRLPM allows changes in the portfolios' cryptos at any time. Backtesting\nresults on three portfolios indicate that CryptoRLPM outperforms all the\nbaselines in terms of accumulated rate of return (ARR), daily rate of return\n(DRR), and Sortino ratio (SR).

There has been growing anecdotal evidence that new means of NFT\nphishing attacks have emerged in Ethereum ecosystem. Most of the existing\nresearch focus on detecting phishing scam accounts for native cryptocurrency on\nthe blockchain, but there is a lack of research in the area of phishing attacks\nof emerging NFTs. Although a few studies have recently started to focus on the\nanalysis and detection of NFT phishing attacks, NFT phishing attack means are\ndiverse and little has been done to understand these various types of NFT\nphishing attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct\ncase retrospective analysis and measurement study of real-world historical NFT\nphishing attacks on Ethereum. By manually analyzing the existing scams reported\nby Chainabuse, we classify NFT phishing attacks into four patterns. For each\npattern, we further investigate the tricks and working principles of them.\nBased on 469 NFT phishing accounts collected up until October 2022 from\nmultiple channels, we perform a measurement study of on-chain transaction data\ncrawled from Etherscan to characterizing NFT phishing scams by analyzing the\nmodus operandi and preferences of NFT phishing scammers, as well as economic\nimpacts and whereabouts of stolen NFTs. We classify NFT phishing transactions\ninto one of the four patterns by log parsing and transaction record parsing. We\nfind these phishing accounts stole 19,514 NFTs for a total profit of 8,858.431\nETH (around 18.57 million dollars). We also observe that scammers remain highly\nactive in the last two years and favor certain categories and series of NFTs,\naccompanied with signs of gang theft.",

We introduce\na new attack that combines both these attacks and propose a machine\nlearning-based solution to mitigate the risks associated with them.\nSpecifically, we use the learning automaton, a powerful online learning method,\nto develop two models, namely the SDTLA and WVBM, which can effectively defend\nagainst selfish mining attacks. Our experimental results show that the SDTLA\nmethod increases the profitability threshold of selfish mining up to 47$\\%$,\nwhile the WVBM method performs even better and is very close to the ideal\nsituation where each miner's revenue is proportional to their shared hash\nprocessing power.

To explore interesting states, ItyFuzz introduces a\ndataflow waypoint mechanism to identify states with more potential momentum.\nItyFuzz also incorporates comparison waypoints to prune the space of states. By\nmaintaining snapshots of the states, ItyFuzz can synthesize concrete exploits\nlike reentrancy attacks quickly. Because ItyFuzz has second-level response time\nto test a smart contract, it can be used for on-chain testing, which has many\nbenefits compared to local development testing. Finally, we evaluate ItyFuzz on\nreal-world smart contracts and some hacked on-chain DeFi projects. ItyFuzz\noutperforms existing fuzzers in terms of instructional coverage and can find\nand generate realistic exploits for on-chain projects quickly.",

In this work,\nwe develop a framework that determines the optimal token supply policy of a\ncryptocurrency, as well as investigate how such policy may be algorithmically\nimplemented. Our findings suggest that the optimal policy complies with the\nFriedman rule and it is dependent on the risk free rate, as well as the growth\nof the cryptocurrency platform. Furthermore, we demonstrate a wide set of\nconditions under which such policy can be implemented via contractions and\nexpansions of token supply that can be realized algorithmically with block\nrewards, taxation of consumption and burning the proceeds, and blockchain\noracles.",

            "summary": "The popularization of intelligent healthcare devices and big data analytics\nsignificantly boosts the development of smart healthcare networks (SHNs). To\nenhance the precision of diagnosis, different participants in SHNs share health\ndata that contains sensitive information. Therefore, the data exchange process\nraises privacy concerns, especially when the integration of health data from\nmultiple sources (linkage attack) results in further leakage. Linkage attack is\na type of dominant attack in the privacy domain, which can leverage various\ndata sources for private data mining. Furthermore, adversaries launch poisoning\nattacks to falsify the health data, which leads to misdiagnosing or even\nphysical damage. To protect private health data, we propose a personalized\ndifferential privacy model based on the trust levels among users. The trust is\nevaluated by a defined community density, while the corresponding privacy\nprotection level is mapped to controllable randomized noise constrained by\ndifferential privacy. To avoid linkage attacks in personalized differential\nprivacy, we designed a noise correlation decoupling mechanism using a Markov\nstochastic process. In addition, we build the community model on a blockchain,\nwhich can mitigate the risk of poisoning attacks during differentially private\ndata transmission over SHNs. To testify the effectiveness and superiority of\nthe proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets.",

This extensive reach stems from\nblockchain's intrinsic ability to reliably manage digital transactions and\nsupply chains. Within the oil and gas sector, the merger of blockchain with\nsupply chain management and data handling is a notable trend. The supply chain\nencompasses several operations: extraction, transportation, trading, and\ndistribution of resources. Unfortunately, the current supply chain structure\nmisses critical features such as transparency, traceability, flexible trading,\nand secure data storage - all of which blockchain can provide. Nevertheless, it\nis essential to investigate blockchain's security and privacy in the oil and\ngas industry. Such scrutiny enables the smooth, secure, and usable execution of\ntransactions. For this purpose, we reviewed 124 peer-reviewed academic\npublications, conducting an in-depth analysis of 21 among them. We classified\nthe articles by their relevance to various phases of the supply chain flow:\nupstream, midstream, downstream, and data management. Despite blockchain's\npotential to address existing security and privacy voids in the supply chain,\nthere is a significant lack of practical implementation of blockchain\nintegration in oil and gas operations.

The security and privacy\nof patient data is still a big concern because healthcare data is sensitive and\nvaluable, and it is most targeted over the internet. Moreover, from the\nindustrial perspective, the cyber-physical system plays a crucial role in the\nexchange of data remotely using sensor nodes in distributed environments. In\nthe healthcare industry, Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to\nresolve most securities-related issues due to its decentralized, immutability,\nand transparency properties. In this paper, a blockchain-inspired secure and\nreliable data exchange architecture is proposed in the cyber-physical\nhealthcare industry 4.0. The proposed system uses the BigchainDB, Tendermint,\nInter-Planetary-File-System (IPFS), MongoDB, and AES encryption algorithms to\nimprove Healthcare 4.0. Furthermore, blockchain-enabled secure healthcare\narchitecture for accessing and managing the records between Doctors and\nPatients is introduced. The development of a blockchain-based Electronic\nHealthcare Record (EHR) exchange system is purely patient-centric, which means\nthe entire control of data is in the owner's hand which is backed by blockchain\nfor security and privacy. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed\narchitecture is robust to handle more security attacks and can recover the data\nif 2/3 of nodes are failed. The proposed model is patient-centric, and control\nof data is in the patient's hand to enhance security and privacy, even system\nadministrators can't access data without user permission.",

Unfortunately, recent evidence suggests these P2P\noverlays represent a significant bottleneck for transaction throughput and\nscalability. Furthermore, they enable a number of attacks. We argue that these\nperformance and security problems arise because current P2P overlays cannot\nfully capture the complexity of a blockchain system as they do not offer\nflexibility to accommodate node heterogeneity. We propose a novel approach to\naddress these issues: P2P Overlay Domains with Sovereignty (PODS), which allows\nnodes in a single overlay to belong to multiple heterogeneous groups, called\ndomains. Each domain features its own set of protocols, tailored to the\ncharacteristics and needs of its nodes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nPODS, we design and implement two novel node discovery protocols: FedKad and\nSovKad. Using a custom simulator, we show that node discovery using PODS\n(SovKad) architecture outperforms both single overlay (Kademlia) and\nmulti-overlay (FedKad) architectures in terms of hop count and success rate,\nthough FedKad requires slightly less bandwidth.",

However,\nlimited by the way of centralized processing, the model performance is greatly\naffected by factors like the silos problems of the models and data in reality.\nTherefore, the emergence of distributed artificial intelligence such as\nfederated learning (FL) makes it possible for the dynamic aggregation among\nmodels. However, the integration process of FL is still server-dependent, which\nmay cause a great risk to the overall model. Also, it only allows collaboration\nbetween homogeneous models, and does not have a good solution for the\ninteraction between heterogeneous models. Therefore, we propose a Distributed\nComputation Model (DCM) based on the consortium blockchain network to improve\nthe credibility of the overall model and effective coordination among\nheterogeneous models. In addition, a Distributed Hierarchical Integration (DHI)\nalgorithm is also designed for the global solution process. Within a group,\npermissioned nodes collect the local models' results from different\npermissionless nodes and then sends the aggregated results back to all the\npermissionless nodes to regularize the processing of the local models. After\nthe iteration is completed, the secondary integration of the local results will\nbe performed between permission nodes to obtain the global results.

            "summary": "Post-quantum security is critical in the quantum era. Quantum computers,\nalong with quantum algorithms, make the standard cryptography based on RSA or\nECDSA over FL or Blockchain vulnerable. The implementation of post-quantum\ncryptography (PQC) over such systems is poorly understood as PQC is still in\nits standardization phase. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to employ\nPQC over blockchain-based FL (BFL), where we combine a stateless signature\nscheme like Dilithium (or Falcon) with a stateful hash-based signature scheme\nlike the extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). We propose a linear-based\nformulaic approach to device role selection mechanisms based on multiple\nfactors to address the performance aspect. Our holistic approach of utilizing a\nverifiable random function (VRF) to assist in the blockchain consensus\nmechanism shows the practicality of the proposed approaches. The proposed\nmethod and extensive experimental results contribute to enhancing the security\nand performance aspects of BFL systems.",

To\nfacilitate secure EHR exchange across various patients and medical providers,\nwe develop a reliable access control method based on smart contracts. We\nincorporate Cryptocurrency, specifically Ethereum, in the suggested system to\nprotect sensitive health information from potential attackers. In our suggested\napproach, both physicians and patients are required to be authenticated.\nPatients can register, and a block with a unique hash value will be generated.\nOnce the patient discusses the disease with the physician, the physician can\ncheck the patient's condition and offer drugs.

BaseSAP expands upon\nprevious research to develop a modular protocol for executing unlikable\ntransactions on public blockchains. BaseSAP allows for developing additional\nstealth address layers using different cryptographic algorithms on top of the\nprimary implementation, capitalizing on its modularity. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed protocol, we present simulations of an advanced\nSecp256k1-based dual-key stealth address protocol. This protocol is designed on\ntop of BaseSAP and is deployed on the Goerli and Sepolia test networks as the\nfirst prototype implementation. Furthermore, we provide cost analyses and\nunderscore potential security ramifications and attack vectors that could\naffect the privacy of stealth addresses.

Here we present a\ngrassroots architecture for serverless, permissionless, peer-to-peer social\nnetworks termed grassroots social networking. The architecture is geared for\nroaming (address-changing) agents communicating over an unreliable network,\ne.g., smartphones communicating via UDP. The architecture incorporates (i) a\ndecentralized social graph, where each member controls, maintains and stores\nonly their local neighbourhood in the graph; (ii) member-created feeds, with\nauthors and followers; and (iii) a novel grassroots dissemination protocol, in\nwhich communication occurs only along the edges of the social graph. The\narchitecture realizes these components using the blocklace data structure -- a\ndistributed partially-ordered counterpart of the replicated totally-ordered\nblockchain. We provide two example grassroots social networking protocols --\nTwitter/LinkedIn-like and WhatsApp-like -- and address their safety, liveness,\nprivacy, and spam/deep-fake resistance, demonstrating how centrally-controlled\nsocial networks could be supplanted by a grassroots architecture.",

            "summary": "Proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies rely on a balance of security and\nfairness in order to maintain a sustainable ecosystem of miners and users.\nUsers demand fast and consistent transaction confirmation, and in exchange\ndrive the adoption and valuation of the cryptocurrency. Miners provide the\nconfirmations, however, they primarily seek rewards. In unfair systems, miners\ncan amplify their rewards by consolidating mining power. Centralization\nhowever, undermines the security guarantees of the system and might discourage\nusers.\n  In this paper we present Tailstorm, a cryptocurrency that strikes this\nbalance. Tailstorm merges multiple recent protocol improvements addressing\nsecurity, confirmation latency, and throughput with a novel incentive mechanism\nimproving fairness. We implement a parallel proof-of-work consensus mechanism\nwith $k$ PoWs per block to obtain state-of-the-art consistency guarantees.\nInspired by Bobtail and Storm, we structure the individual PoWs in a tree\nwhich, by including a list of transactions with each PoW, reduces confirmation\nlatency and improves throughput. Our proposed incentive mechanism discounts\nrewards based on the depth of this tree. Thereby, it effectively punishes\ninformation withholding, the core attack strategy used to reap an unfair share\nof rewards.\n  We back our claims with a comprehensive analysis. We present a generic system\nmodel which allows us to specify Bitcoin, $B_k$, and Tailstorm from a joint set\nof assumptions. We provide an analytical bound for the fairness of Tailstorm\nand Bitcoin in honest networks and we confirm the results through simulation.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of dishonest behaviour through reinforcement\nlearning. Our attack search reproduces known optimal strategies against\nBitcoin, uncovers new ones against $B_k$, and confirms that Tailstorm's reward\ndiscounting makes it more resilient to incentive layer attacks.",

In addition, the decentralized QFL system addresses the\nrisks associated with a centralized server-based approach. With extensive\nexperiments and analysis, we evaluate classical federated learning (CFL) and\nQFL in a distributed setting and demonstrate the practicality and benefits of\nthe proposed design. Our theoretical analysis and discussions develop a\ngenuinely decentralized financial system essential for the Metaverse.\nFurthermore, we present the application of blockchain-based QFL in a hybrid\nmetaverse powered by a metaverse observer and world model.

            "summary": "The practical Byzantine fault tolerant (PBFT) consensus protocol is one of\nthe basic consensus protocols in the development of blockchain technology. At\nthe same time, the PBFT consensus protocol forms a basis for some other\nimportant BFT consensus protocols, such as Tendermint, Streamlet, HotStuff, and\nLibraBFT. In general, the voting nodes may always fail so that they can leave\nthe PBFT-based blockchain system in a random time interval, making the number\nof timely available voting nodes uncertain. Thus, this uncertainty leads to the\nanalysis of the PBFT-based blockchain systems with repairable voting nodes\nbeing more challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel PBFT consensus\nprotocol with repairable voting nodes and study such a new blockchain system\nusing a multi-dimensional Markov process and the first passage time method.\nBased on this, we provide performance and reliability analysis, including\nthroughput, availability, and reliability, for the new PBFT-based blockchain\nsystem with repairable voting nodes. Furthermore, we provide an approximate\nalgorithm for computing the throughput of the new PBFT-based blockchain system.\nWe employ numerical examples to demonstrate the validity of our theoretical\nresults and illustrate how the key system parameters influence performance\nmeasures of the PBFT-based blockchain system with repairable voting nodes.

            "summary": "This paper presents a novel reference architecture for blockchain-enabled\nfederated learning (BCFL), a state-of-the-art approach that amalgamates the\nstrengths of federated learning and blockchain technology.We define smart\ncontract functions, stakeholders and their roles, and the use of interplanetary\nfile system (IPFS) as key components of BCFL and conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis. In traditional centralized federated learning, the selection of local\nnodes and the collection of learning results for each round are merged under\nthe control of a central server. In contrast, in BCFL, all these processes are\nmonitored and managed via smart contracts. Additionally, we propose an\nextension architecture to support both crossdevice and cross-silo federated\nlearning scenarios. Furthermore, we implement and verify the architecture in a\npractical real-world Ethereum development environment. Our BCFL reference\narchitecture provides significant flexibility and extensibility, accommodating\nthe integration of various additional elements, as per specific requirements\nand use cases, thereby rendering it an adaptable solution for a wide range of\nBCFL applications. As a prominent example of extensibility, decentralized\nidentifiers (DIDs) have been employed as an authentication method to introduce\npractical utilization within BCFL. This study not only bridges a crucial gap\nbetween research and practical deployment but also lays a solid foundation for\nfuture explorations in the realm of BCFL. The pivotal contribution of this\nstudy is the successful implementation and verification of a realistic BCFL\nreference architecture. We intend to make the source code publicly accessible\nshortly, fostering further advancements and adaptations within the community.",

            "summary": "Blockchain systems suffer from high storage costs as every node needs to\nstore and maintain the entire blockchain data. After investigating Ethereum's\nstorage, we find that the storage cost mostly comes from the index, i.e.,\nMerkle Patricia Trie (MPT), that is used to guarantee data integrity and\nsupport provenance queries. To reduce the index storage overhead, an initial\nidea is to leverage the emerging learned index technique, which has been shown\nto have a smaller index size and more efficient query performance. However,\ndirectly applying it to the blockchain storage results in even higher overhead\nowing to the blockchain's persistence requirement and the learned index's large\nnode size. Meanwhile, existing learned indexes are designed for in-memory\ndatabases, whereas blockchain systems require disk-based storage and feature\nfrequent data updates. To address these challenges, we propose COLE, a novel\ncolumn-based learned storage for blockchain systems. We follow the column-based\ndatabase design to contiguously store each state's historical values, which are\nindexed by learned models to facilitate efficient data retrieval and provenance\nqueries. We develop a series of write-optimized strategies to realize COLE in\ndisk environments. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the\nperformance of the proposed COLE system. Compared with MPT, COLE reduces the\nstorage size by up to 94% while improving the system throughput by 1.4X-5.4X.",

However,\nexisting stablecoin designs are tied to individual blockchain platforms, and\ntrusted parties or complex protocols are needed to exchange stablecoin tokens\nbetween blockchains.\n  Our goal is to design a practical stablecoin for cross-chain commerce.\nRealizing this goal requires addressing two challenges.

As such, there is a need for reliable\ncross-chain communication to enable blockchain interoperability. Blockchain\ninteroperability is challenging because transactions can typically not be\nreverted - as such, if one transaction is committed then the protocol must\nensure that all related transactions are committed as well. Existing\ninteroperability approaches, e.g., Cosmos and Polkadot, are limited in the\nsense that they only support interoperability between their own subchains, or\nrequire intrusive changes to existing blockchains. To overcome this limitation,\nwe propose PIEChain, a general, Kafka-based cross-chain communication\nframework.

            "summary": "In May 2022, an apparent speculative attack, followed by market panic, led to\nthe precipitous downfall of UST, one of the most popular stablecoins at that\ntime. However, UST is not the only stablecoin to have been depegged in the\npast. Designing resilient and long-term stable coins, therefore, appears to\npresent a hard challenge.\n  To further scrutinize existing stablecoin designs and ultimately lead to more\nrobust systems, we need to understand where volatility emerges. Our work\nprovides a game-theoretical model aiming to help identify why stablecoins\nsuffer from a depeg. This game-theoretical model reveals that stablecoins have\ndifferent price equilibria depending on the coin's architecture and mechanism\nto minimize volatility. Moreover, our theory is supported by extensive\nempirical data, spanning $1$ year. To that end, we collect daily prices for 22\nstablecoins and on-chain data from five blockchains including the Ethereum and\nthe Terra blockchain.",

Among the methods for\nsemantically representing agents, one has been essentially achieved by taking a\nbehaviouristic vision, through which one can describe how they operate and\nengage with their peers. The approach essentially aims at defining the\noperational capabilities of agents through the mental states related with the\nachievement of tasks. The OASIS ontology -- An Ontology for Agent, Systems, and\nIntegration of Services, presented in 2019 -- pursues the behaviouristic\napproach to deliver a semantic representation system and a communication\nprotocol for agents and their commitments.

In our design, private keys are not\nstored on any device, but are instead derived directly from a user's\nauthentication factors, such as passwords, soft tokens (e.g., Google\nAuthenticator), hard tokens (e.g., YubiKey), or out-of-band authentication\n(e.g., SMS). Public parameters (salts, one-time pads, etc.) needed to access\nthe wallet can be safely stored in public view, such as on a public blockchain,\nthereby providing strong availability guarantees. Users can then simply \"log\nin\" to their decentralized wallet on any device using standard credentials and\neven recover from lost credentials, thereby providing the usability of a\ncustodial wallet with the trust and security of a decentralized approach.",

            "summary": "Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity across various sectors, especially in\nfinance and investment. The popularity is partly due to their unique\nspecifications originating from blockchain-related characteristics such as\nprivacy, decentralisation, and untraceability. Despite their growing\npopularity, cryptocurrencies remain a high-risk investment due to their price\nvolatility and uncertainty. The inherent volatility in cryptocurrency prices,\ncoupled with internal cryptocurrency-related factors and external influential\nglobal economic factors makes predicting their prices and price movement\ndirections challenging. Nevertheless, the knowledge obtained from predicting\nthe direction of cryptocurrency prices can provide valuable guidance for\ninvestors in making informed investment decisions. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) approach, which can model\ncomplex systems in multivariate settings, to predict the price movement\ndirection of five popular altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) in the\nnext trading day. The efficacy of the proposed model in predicting\ncryptocurrency price directions is evaluated from two perspectives. Firstly,\nour proposed approach is compared to two baseline models, namely an\nauto-regressive integrated moving average and support vector regression.\nSecondly, from a feature engineering point of view, the impact of twenty-three\ndifferent features, grouped into four categories, on the DBN's prediction\nperformance is investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that the DBN\nsignificantly outperforms the baseline models. In addition, among the groups of\nfeatures, technical indicators are found to be the most effective predictors of\ncryptocurrency price directions.",

This paper presents an innovative\nframework, named RETINA, which provides a resilient and secure energy trading\nmechanism within smart grid systems. RETINA tackles the inherent security and\ninfrastructure challenges in smart grids by establishing a trust-based security\nlayer and facilitating energy transactions through blockchain technology. Our\nproposed solution integrates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the Web of\nTrust (WoT) concepts, promoting decentralized communication channels and robust\nkey management. We further introduce a smart contract-based energy trading\nmechanism that factors in trust, distance, and energy type (green or non-green)\nin cost calculation. The utility and robustness of RETINA have been validated\nin a virtualized testbed environment with 500 nodes, demonstrating superior\nperformance in terms of scalability and resilience compared to the existing WoT\nscheme. Furthermore, RETINA successfully enables a secure and efficient energy\ntrading scheme, promoting the use of renewable energy sources. Future\nenhancements will include application to a realistic smart grid deployment and\nthe integration of additional functionalities. This groundbreaking solution has\nthe potential to revolutionize the smart grid ecosystem, addressing its current\nlimitations and propelling the industry towards a future of advanced and secure\nenergy exchange.",

As assets serving as collateral are locked, this requirement prevents\nmany candidates from obtaining loans.

We use a credit score based on data recovered from the\nblockchain to predict how likely someone is to repay a loan.

Bitcoin\nis powered by blockchain, and interest in it has surged in the past few years.\nIt has many uses that need to be modeled. Modeling is used in many walks of\nlife to share ideas, reduce complexity, achieve close alignment of one person\nviewpoint with another and provide abstractions of a system at some level of\nprecision and detail. Software modeling is used in Model Driven Engineering\n(MDE), and Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) ease model development and provide\nintuitive syntax for domain experts. The present study has designed and\nevaluated a meta-model for the bitcoin application domain to facilitate\napplication development and help in truly understanding bitcoin. The proposed\nmeta-model, including stereotypes, tagged values, enumerations and a set of\nconstraints defined by Object Constraint Language (OCL), was defined as a\nUnified Modeling Language (UML) profile and was implemented in the Sparx\nEnterprise Architect (Sparx EA) modeling tool. A case study developed by our\nmeta-model is also presented.",

A\nSpatial Digital Twin (SDT) is a specific type of digital twin that emphasizes\nthe geospatial aspects of the physical entity, incorporating precise location\nand dimensional attributes for a comprehensive understanding within its spatial\nenvironment. The current body of research on SDTs primarily concentrates on\nanalyzing their potential impact and opportunities within various application\ndomains. As building an SDT is a complex process and requires a variety of\nspatial computing technologies, it is not straightforward for practitioners and\nresearchers of this multi-disciplinary domain to grasp the underlying details\nof enabling technologies of the SDT. In this paper, we are the first to\nsystematically analyze different spatial technologies relevant to building an\nSDT in layered approach (starting from data acquisition to visualization). More\nspecifically, we present the key components of SDTs into four layers of\ntechnologies: (i) data acquisition; (ii) spatial database management \\& big\ndata analytics systems; (iii) GIS middleware software, maps \\& APIs; and (iv)\nkey functional components such as visualizing, querying, mining, simulation and\nprediction. Moreover, we discuss how modern technologies such as AI/ML,\nblockchains, and cloud computing can be effectively utilized in enabling and\nenhancing SDTs. Finally, we identify a number of research challenges and\nopportunities in SDTs. This work serves as an important resource for SDT\nresearchers and practitioners as it explicitly distinguishes SDTs from\ntraditional DTs, identifies unique applications, outlines the essential\ntechnological components of SDTs, and presents a vision for their future\ndevelopment along with the challenges that lie ahead.",

            "summary": "Sharding is a prominent technique for scaling blockchains. By dividing the\nnetwork into smaller components known as shards, a sharded blockchain can\nprocess transactions in parallel without introducing inconsistencies through\nthe coordination of intra-shard and cross-shard consensus protocols. However,\nwe observe a critical security issue with sharded systems: transaction ordering\nmanipulations can occur when coordinating intra-shard and cross-shard consensus\nprotocols, leaving the system vulnerable to attack. Specifically, we identify a\nnovel security issue known as finalization fairness, which can be exploited\nthrough a front-running attack. This attack allows an attacker to manipulate\nthe execution order of transactions, even if the victim's transaction has\nalready been processed and added to the blockchain by a fair intra-shard\nconsensus.\n  To address the issue, we offer Haechi, a novel cross-shard protocol that is\nimmune to front-running attacks. Haechi introduces an ordering phase between\ntransaction processing and execution, ensuring that the execution order of\ntransactions is the same as the processing order and achieving finalization\nfairness. To accommodate different consensus speeds among shards, Haechi\nincorporates a finalization fairness algorithm to achieve a globally fair order\nwith minimal performance loss. By providing a global order, Haechi ensures\nstrong consistency among shards, enabling better parallelism in handling\nconflicting transactions across shards. These features make Haechi a promising\nsolution for supporting popular smart contracts in the real world. To evaluate\nHaechi's performance, we implemented the protocol using Tendermint and\nconducted extensive experiments on a geo-distributed AWS environment. Our\nresults demonstrate that Haechi achieves finalization fairness with little\nperformance sacrifice compared to existing cross-shard consensus protocols.",

            "summary": "In recent years, Blockchain-based Online Social Media (BOSM) platforms have\nevolved fast due to the advancement of blockchain technology. BOSM can\neffectively overcome the problems of traditional social media platforms, such\nas a single point of trust and insufficient incentives for users, by combining\na decentralized governance structure and a cryptocurrency-based incentive\nmodel, thereby attracting a large number of users and making it a crucial\ncomponent of Web3. BOSM allows users to downvote low-quality content and aims\nto decrease the visibility of low-quality content by sorting and filtering it\nthrough downvoting. However, this feature may be maliciously exploited by some\nusers to undermine the fairness of the incentive, reduce the quality of highly\nvisible content, and further reduce users' enthusiasm for content creation and\nthe attractiveness of the platform. In this paper, we study and analyze the\ndownvoting behavior using four years of data collected from Steemit, the\nlargest BOSM platform. We discovered that a significant number of bot accounts\nwere actively downvoting content. In addition, we discovered that roughly 9% of\nthe downvoting activity might be retaliatory. We did not detect any significant\ninstances of downvoting on content for a specific topic. We believe that the\nfindings in this paper will facilitate the future development of user behavior\nanalysis and incentive pattern design in BOSM and Web3.",

With classic BFT protocols,\nthe total number of replicas is known and fixed a priori. The resilience of BFT\nprotocols, i.e., the number of tolerated Byzantine replicas (denoted f ), is\nderived from the total number of replicas according to the quorum theory.\n  To guarantee that an attacker cannot control more than f replicas, so to\nguarantee safety, it is vital to ensure fault independence among all replicas.\nThis in practice is achieved by enforcing diverse configurations of replicas,\ni.e., each replica has a unique configuration, avoiding f fault compromises\nmore than f replicas.\n  While managing replica diversity in BFT protocols has been studied in\npermissioned environments with a small number of replicas, no prior work has\ndiscussed the fault independence in a permissionless environment (such as\npublic blockchains) where anyone can join and leave the system at any time.\nThis is particularly challenging due to the following two facts. First, with\npermissionless environment, any one can join as a replica at any time and no\nglobal coordinator can be relied on to manage replica diversity. Second, while\ngreat progress has been made to scale consensus algorithms to thousands of\nreplicas, the replica diversity cannot provide fault independence at this\nscale, limiting practical and meaningful resilience.\n  This paper provides the first discussion on the impact of fault independence\non permissionless blockchains, provides discussions on replica configuration\ndiversity, quantifies replica diversity by using entropy, and defines optimal\nfault independence.",

In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for smart contract\nexecution. It distinguishes between consensus nodes and execution nodes:\ndifferent groups of execution nodes can execute transactions in parallel;\nmeanwhile, consensus nodes can asynchronously order transactions and process\nexecution results. Moreover, it requires no coordination among execution nodes\nand can effectively prevent livelocks. We show two ways of applying this\nparadigm to blockchains. First, we show how we can make Ethereum support\nparallel and asynchronous contract execution \\emph{without hard-forks}. Then,\nwe propose a new public, permissionless blockchain. Our benchmark shows that,\nwith a fast consensus layer, it can provide a high throughput even for complex\ntransactions like Cryptokitties gene mixing. It can also protect simple\ntransactions from being starved by complex transactions.",

            "summary": "The immutable and trustable characteristics of blockchain enable smart\ncontracts to be applied in various fields. Unfortunately, smart contracts are\nsubject to various vulnerabilities, which are frequently exploited by\nattackers, causing financial damage to users.In this paper, we study the\nproblem of vulnerable smart contract function locating. We construct a novel\nMulti-Relational Nested contract Graph (MRNG) to better characterize the rich\nsyntactic and semantic information in the smart contract code, including the\nrelationships between data and instructions. An MRNG represents a smart\ncontract, where each node represents a function in the smart contract and each\nedge describes the calling relationship between the functions. In addition, we\ncreate a Multi-Relational Function Graph (MRFG) for each function, which\ncharacterizes the corresponding function code. That is, each function is\ncharacterized as an MRFG, which corresponds to a node in the MRNG. Each MRFG\nuses different types of edges to represent the different control and data\nrelationships between nodes within a function. We also propose a\nMulti-Relational Nested Graph Convolutional Network (MRN-GCN) to process the\nMRNG. MRN-GCN first extracts and aggregates features from each MRFG, using the\nedge-enhanced graph convolution network and self-attention mechanism. The\nextracted feature vector is then assigned to the corresponding node in the MRNG\nto obtain a new Featured Contract Graph (FCG) for the smart contract. Graph\nconvolution is used to further extract features from the FCG. Finally, a feed\nforward network with a Sigmoid function is used to locate the vulnerable\nfunctions. Experimental results on the real-world smart contract datasets show\nthat model MRN-GCN can effectively improve the accuracy, precision, recall and\nF1-score performance of vulnerable smart contract function locating.",

In this paper, we shed light on the impact of compiler versions\nof vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts. To this end, we collected\n503,572 contracts with Solidity source codes in the Ethereum blockchain and\nthen analyzed their vulnerabilities. For three vulnerabilities with high\nseverity, i.e., Locked Money, Using tx.origin, and Unchecked Call, we show that\ntheir appearance rates are decreased by virtue of major updates of the Solidity\ncompiler. We then found the following four key insights. First, after the\nrelease of version 0.6, the appearance rate for Locked Money has decreased.\nSecond, regardless of compiler updates, the appearance rate for Using tx.origin\nis significantly low. Third, although the appearance rate for Unchecked Call\nhas decreased in version 0.8, it still remains high due to various factors,\nincluding code clones. Fourth, through analysis of code clones, our promising\nresults show that the appearance rate for Unchecked Call can be further\ndecreased by removing the code clones.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin-NG is an extensible blockchain protocol based on the same trust model\nas Bitcoin. It divides each epoch into one Key-Block and multiple Micro-Blocks,\neffectively improving transaction processing capacity. Bitcoin-NG adopts a\nspecial incentive mechanism (i.e., the transaction fees in each epoch are split\nto the current and next leader) to maintain its security. However, there are\nsome limitations to the existing incentive analysis of Bitcoin-NG in recent\nworks. First, the incentive division method of Bitcoin-NG only includes some\nspecific mining attack strategies of adversary, while ignoring more stubborn\nattack strategies. Second, once adversaries find a whale transaction, they will\ndeviate from honest mining strategy to obtain extra reward. In this paper, we\nare committed to solving these two limitations. First, we propose a novel\nmining strategy named Greedy-Mine attack. Then, we formulate a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) model to analyze the competition of honest miners and\nadversaries. Furthermore, we analysis the extra reward of adversaries and\nsummarize the mining power proportion range required for malicious adversaries\nto launch Greedy-Mine to obtain extra returns. Finally, we make a\nbackward-compatibility progressive modification to Bitcoin-NG protocol that\nwould raise the threshold of propagation factor from 0 to 1. Meanwhile, we get\nthe winning condition of adversaries when adopting Greedy-Mine, compared with\nhonest mining. Simulation and experimental results indicate that Bitcoin-NG is\nnot incentive compatible, which is vulnerable to Greedy-Mine attack.",

            "summary": "The rapid expansion of the use of blockchain-based systems often leads to a\nchoice between customizable private blockchains and more secure, scalable and\ndecentralized but expensive public blockchains. This choice represents the\ntrade-off between privacy and customization at a low cost and security,\nscalability, and a large user base but at a high cost. In order to improve the\nscalability of secure public blockchains while enabling privacy and cost\nreduction, zk-rollups, a layer 2 solution, appear to be a promising avenue.\nThis paper explores the benefits of zk-rollups, including improved privacy, as\nwell as their potential to support transactions designed for specific\napplications. We propose an innovative design that allows multiple zk-rollups\nto co-exist on the same smart contracts, simplifying their creation and\ncustomization. We then evaluate the first implementation of our system\nhighlighting a low overhead on existing transaction types and on proof\ngeneration while strongly decreasing the cost of new transaction types and\ndrastically reducing zk-rollup creation costs.",

            "summary": "A non-fungible token (NFT) is a data unit stored on the blockchain. Nowadays,\nmore and more investors and collectors (NFT traders), who participate in\ntransactions of NFTs, have an urgent need to assess the performance of NFTs.\nHowever, there are two challenges for NFT traders when analyzing the\nperformance of NFT. First, the current rarity models have flaws and are\nsometimes not convincing. In addition, NFT performance is dependent on multiple\nfactors, such as images (high-dimensional data), history transactions\n(network), and market evolution (time series). It is difficult to take\ncomprehensive consideration and analyze NFT performance efficiently. To address\nthese challenges, we propose NFTVis, a visual analysis system that facilitates\nassessing individual NFT performance. A new NFT rarity model is proposed to\nquantify NFTs with images. Four well-coordinated views are designed to\nrepresent the various factors affecting the performance of the NFT. Finally, we\nevaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of our system using two case studies\nand user studies.",

            "summary": "As blockchain technology becomes more and more popular, a typical financial\nscam, the Ponzi scheme, has also emerged in the blockchain platform Ethereum.\nThis Ponzi scheme deployed through smart contracts, also known as the smart\nPonzi scheme, has caused a lot of economic losses and negative impacts.\nExisting methods for detecting smart Ponzi schemes on Ethereum mainly rely on\nbytecode features, opcode features, account features, and transaction behavior\nfeatures of smart contracts, which are unable to truly characterize the\nbehavioral features of Ponzi schemes, and thus generally perform poorly in\nterms of detection accuracy and false alarm rates. In this paper, we propose\nSourceP, a method to detect smart Ponzi schemes on the Ethereum platform using\npre-trained models and data flow, which only requires using the source code of\nsmart contracts as features. SourceP reduces the difficulty of data acquisition\nand feature extraction of existing detection methods. Specifically, we first\nconvert the source code of a smart contract into a data flow graph and then\nintroduce a pre-trained model based on learning code representations to build a\nclassification model to identify Ponzi schemes in smart contracts. The\nexperimental results show that SourceP achieves 87.2\\% recall and 90.7\\%\nF-score for detecting smart Ponzi schemes within Ethereum's smart contract\ndataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and\nsustainability. We also demonstrate through additional experiments that\npre-trained models and data flow play an important contribution to SourceP, as\nwell as proving that SourceP has a good generalization ability.",

Cloud-enabled\nHAPS, which aims to create HAPS-based datacenters that offer cloud services to\nusers, has particularly emerged as a promising key enabler to provide\nlarge-scale equitable services from the sky. Although offering cloud services\nfrom the HAPS proves to be efficient, its practical deployment at the\nstratosphere level still faces many challenges such as high energy\nrequirements, physical maintenance, and is particularly prone to security\nconsiderations. Safeguarding the cloud-enabled HAPS against various\ncyberattacks is a necessity to guarantee its safe operation. This paper\nproposes a blockchain model to secure cloud-enabled HAPS networks that contain\na large number of HAPS stations from recurring cyberattacks within the context\nof the environment and infrastructure monitoring (EIM) application. To this\nend, the paper first presents a detailed blockchain framework, and describes\nthe ways of integrating the developed framework into the various system\ncomponents. We then discuss the details of the system implementation, including\nthe storing and consuming of cloud transactions, the generation of new blocks,\nand the blockchain consensus protocol that is tailored to the EIM requirements.\nFinally, we present numerical simulations that illustrate the performance of\nthe system in terms of throughput, latency, and resilience to attacks.",

            "summary": "With the massive amount of digital data generated everyday, transactions of\ndigital goods become a trend. One of the essential requirements for such\ntransactions is fairness, which is defined as that both of the seller and the\nbuyer get what they want, or neither. Current fair trade protocols generally\ninvolve a trusted third-party (TTP), which achieves fairness by heavily relying\non the TTP's behaviors and the two parties' trust in the TTP. With the\nemergence of Blockchain, its decentralization and transparency make it a very\ngood candidate to replace the TTP. In this work, we attempt to design a secure\nand fair protocol for digital goods transactions through smart contracts on\nBlockchain. To ensure security of the digital goods, we propose an advanced\npassive proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme, which enables smart contracts to\ntransfer the decryption right to a buyer after receiving his/her payment.\nFurthermore, based on smart contracts and the proposed passive PRE scheme, a\nfair trade protocol for digital goods transactions is proposed, whose fairness\nis guaranteed by the arbitration protocol. The proposed protocol supports\nCiphertext publicity and repeatable sale, while involving less number of\ninteractions. Comprehensive experiment results validate the feasibility and\neffectiveness of the proposed protocol.",

            "summary": "Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is one of the latest\nachievements in AI development. The content generated by related applications,\nsuch as text, images and audio, has sparked a heated discussion. Various\nderived AIGC applications are also gradually entering all walks of life,\nbringing unimaginable impact to people's daily lives. However, the rapid\ndevelopment of such generative tools has also raised concerns about privacy and\nsecurity issues, and even copyright issues in AIGC. We note that advanced\ntechnologies such as blockchain and privacy computing can be combined with AIGC\ntools, but no work has yet been done to investigate their relevance and\nprospect in a systematic and detailed way. Therefore it is necessary to\ninvestigate how they can be used to protect the privacy and security of data in\nAIGC by fully exploring the aforementioned technologies. In this paper, we\nfirst systematically review the concept, classification and underlying\ntechnologies of AIGC. Then, we discuss the privacy and security challenges\nfaced by AIGC from multiple perspectives and purposefully list the\ncountermeasures that currently exist. We hope our survey will help researchers\nand industry to build a more secure and robust AIGC system.",

            "summary": "Current proposals for AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, aim to spur AI\nthat is trustworthy (e.g., AI Act) and accountable (e.g., AI Liability) What is\nmissing, however, is a robust regulatory discourse and roadmap to make AI, and\ntechnology more broadly, environmentally sustainable. This paper aims to take\nfirst steps to fill this gap. The ICT sector contributes up to 3.9 percent of\nglobal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-more than global air travel at 2.5\npercent. The carbon footprint and water consumption of AI, especially\nlarge-scale generative models like GPT-4, raise significant sustainability\nconcerns. The paper is the first to assess how current and proposed technology\nregulations, including EU environmental law, the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR), and the AI Act, could be adjusted to better account for\nenvironmental sustainability. The GDPR, for instance, could be interpreted to\nlimit certain individual rights like the right to erasure if these rights\nsignificantly conflict with broader sustainability goals. In a second step, the\npaper suggests a multi-faceted approach to achieve sustainable AI regulation.\nIt advocates for transparency mechanisms, such as disclosing the GHG footprint\nof AI systems, as laid out in the proposed EU AI Act. However, sustainable AI\nregulation must go beyond mere transparency. The paper proposes a regulatory\ntoolkit comprising co-regulation, sustainability-by-design principles,\nrestrictions on training data, and consumption caps, including integration into\nthe EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Finally, the paper argues that this regulatory\ntoolkit could serve as a blueprint for regulating other high-emission\ntechnologies and infrastructures like blockchain, Metaverse applications, and\ndata centers. The framework aims to cohesively address the crucial dual\nchallenges of our era: digital transformation and climate change mitigation.",

We propose to use a variant,\ncalled coarse-grained boson-sampling (CGBS), as a quantum Proof-of-Work (PoW)\nscheme for blockchain consensus. The users perform boson-sampling using input\nstates that depend on the current block information, and commit their samples\nto the network. Afterward, CGBS strategies are determined which can be used to\nboth validate samples and to reward successful miners. By combining rewards to\nminers committing honest samples together with penalties to miners committing\ndishonest samples, a Nash equilibrium is found that incentivizes honest nodes.\nThe scheme works for both Fock state boson sampling and Gaussian boson sampling\nand provides dramatic speedup and energy savings relative to computation by\nclassical hardware.",

In this paper, we put forth a novel system that\nemploys batch settlement techniques to augment the efficiency of transfers\nbetween rollups. Our proposed system comprises a settlement rollup responsible\nfor batch settling transfers among rollups and a smart contract structure that\ncarries out the settlements. Notably, we utilize a zero-knowledge proof\nalgorithm to guarantee the computational integrity of the settlement rollup\nwhile ensuring security through Ethereum smart contracts for proof verification\nand settlement execution. By implementing this approach, the proposed system\ncan effectively and securely execute asset transfers between rollups,\nultimately improving their scalability and usability.

In this landscape, proposers are the validators in the\nProof-of-Stake consensus protocol, while now relying on specialized block\nbuilders for creating blocks with the highest value for the proposer.\nAdditionally, relays act as mediators between builders and proposers. We study\nPBS adoption and show that the current landscape exhibits significant\ncentralization amongst the builders and relays. Further, we explore whether PBS\neffectively achieves its intended objectives of enabling hobbyist validators to\nmaximize block profitability and preventing censorship. Our findings reveal\nthat although PBS grants validators the opportunity to access optimized and\ncompetitive blocks, it tends to stimulate censorship rather than reduce it.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that relays do not consistently uphold their\ncommitments and may prove unreliable. Specifically, proposers do not always\nreceive the complete promised value, and the censorship or filtering\ncapabilities pledged by relays exhibit significant gaps.",

            "summary": "Permissionless blockchains promise to be resilient against censorship by a\nsingle entity. This suggests that deterministic rules, and not third-party\nactors, are responsible for deciding if a transaction is appended to the\nblockchain or not. In 2022, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\nsanctioned a Bitcoin mixer and an Ethereum application, putting the neutrality\nof permissionless blockchains to the test.\n  In this paper, we formalize quantify and analyze the security impact of\nblockchain censorship. We start by defining censorship, followed by a\nquantitative assessment of current censorship practices. We find that 46% of\nEthereum blocks were made by censoring actors that intend to comply with OFAC\nsanctions, indicating the significant impact of OFAC sanctions on the\nneutrality of public blockchains.\n  We further uncover that censorship not only impacts neutrality, but also\nsecurity. We show how after Ethereum's move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and\nadoption of Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) the inclusion of censored\ntransactions was delayed by an average of 85%. Inclusion delays compromise a\ntransaction's security by, e.g., strengthening a sandwich adversary. Finally we\nprove a fundamental limitation of PoS and Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols against\ncensorship resilience.",

In traditional quorum-based consensus protocols, quorums\nare defined using globally known assumptions shared among all participants.\nMotivated by decentralized applications on open networks, the Stellar\nblockchain relaxes these global assumptions by allowing each participant to\ndefine its quorums using local information. A similar model called Consensus\nwith Unknown Participants (CUP) studies the minimal knowledge required to solve\nconsensus in ad-hoc networks where each participant knows only a subset of\nother participants of the system. We prove that Stellar cannot solve consensus\nusing the initial knowledge provided to participants in the CUP model, even\nthough CUP can.

In addition, location-centric\ncharacteristics of many IoT applications paired with limited storage and\ncomputing power of IoT devices bring about more limitations, primarily due to\nthe location-agnostic designs in blockchains. We propose a hierarchical and\nlocation-aware consensus protocol (LH-Raft) for IoT-blockchain applications\ninspired by the original Raft protocol to address these limitations. The\nproposed LH-Raft protocol forms local consensus candidate groups based on\nnodes' reputation and distance to elect the leaders in each sub-layer\nblockchain. It utilizes a threshold signature scheme to reach global consensus\nand the local and global log replication to maintain consistency for blockchain\ntransactions. To evaluate the performance of LH-Raft, we first conduct an\nextensive numerical analysis based on the proposed reputation mechanism and the\ncandidate group formation model. We then compare the performance of LH-Raft\nagainst the classical Raft protocol from both theoretical and experimental\nperspectives. We evaluate the proposed threshold signature scheme using\nHyperledger Ursa cryptography library to measure various consensus nodes'\nsigning and verification time. Experimental results show that the proposed\nLH-Raft protocol is scalable for large IoT applications and significantly\nreduces the communication cost, consensus latency, and agreement time for\nconsensus processing.",

They are software programs\nthat run on top of a blockchain, and we may need to change them from time to\ntime (e.g., to fix bugs or address new use cases). Governance protocols define\nthe means for amending or changing these smart contracts without any\ncentralized authority. They distribute instead the decision-making power to\nevery user of the smart contract: Users vote on accepting or rejecting every\nchange. The focus of this work is to evaluate whether, how, and to what extent\nthese protocols ensure decentralized governance, the fundamental tenet of\nblockchains, in practice. This evaluation is crucial as smart contracts\ncontinue to transform our key, traditional, centralized institutions,\nparticularly banking and finance.\n  In this work, we review and characterize decentralized governance in\npractice, using Compound -- one of the widely used governance protocols -- as a\ncase study. We reveal a high concentration of voting power in Compound: 10\nvoters hold together 57.86% of the voting power. Although proposals to change\nor amend the protocol (or, essentially, the application they support) receive,\non average, a substantial number of votes (i.e., 89.39%) in favor, they require\nfewer than three voters to obtain 50% or more votes. We show that voting on\nCompound governance proposals can be unfairly expensive for small token\nholders, and also discover voting coalitions that can further marginalize these\nusers.

However,\nthe consensus time and communication overhead of blockchain increase\nsignificantly as the number of vehicles connected to the blockchain. To address\nthis issue, vehicular fog computing has been introduced to improve efficiency.\nHowever, existing studies ignore several key factors such as the number of\nvehicles in the fog computing system, which can impact the consensus\ncommunication overhead. Meanwhile, there is no comprehensive study on the\nstability of vehicular fog composition. The vehicle movement will lead to\ndynamic changes in fog. If the composition of vehicular fog is unstable, the\nblockchain formed by this fog computing system will be unstable, which can\naffect the consensus efficiency. With the above considerations, we propose an\nefficient and stable identity authentication (ESIA) empowered by hierarchical\nblockchain and fog computing. By grouping vehicles efficiently, ESIA has low\ncommunication complexity and achieves high stability. Moreover, to enhance the\nconsensus security of the hierarchical blockchain, the consensus process is\nfrom the bottom layer to the up layer (bottom-up), which we call B2UHChain.\nThrough theoretical analysis and simulation verification, our scheme achieves\nthe design goals of high efficiency and stability while significantly improving\nthe IoV scalability to the power of 1.5 (^1.5) under similar security to a\nsingle-layer blockchain.

            "summary": "Conventional blockchains use consensus algorithms that totally order updates\nacross all accounts, which is stronger than necessary to implement a replicated\nledger. This makes updates slower and more expensive than necessary. More\nrecent consensus-free replicated ledgers forego consensus algorithms, with\nsignificant increase in performance and decrease in infrastructure costs.\nHowever, current designs are based around reliable broadcast of update\noperations to all replicas which require reliable message delivery and\nreasoning over operation histories to establish convergence and safety.\n  In this paper, we present a replicated ledger as a state-based conflict-free\nreplicated data type (CRDT) based on grow-only counters. This design provides\ntwo major benefits: 1) it requires a weaker eventual transitive delivery of the\nlatest state rather than reliable broadcast of all update operations to all\nreplicas; 2) eventual convergence and safety properties can be proven easily\nwithout having to reason over operation histories: convergence comes from the\ncomposition of grow-only counters, themselves CRDTs, and safety properties can\nbe expressed over the state of counters, locally and globally. In addition,\napplications that tolerate temporary negative balances require no additional\nmechanisms and applications that require strictly non-negative balances can be\nsupported by enforcing sequential updates to the same account across replicas.\n  Our design is sufficient when executing on replicas that might crash and\nrecover, as common in deployments in which all replicas are managed by trusted\nentities. It may also provide a good foundation to explore new mechanisms for\ntolerating adversarial replicas.",

We propose a hierar-chical and\nlocation-aware consensus protocol for IoI-blockchain applications inspired by\nthe original Raft protocol to address these limitations. The proposed consensus\nprotocol generates the consensus candidate groups based on nodes' individual\nreputation and distance information to elect the leader in each sub-layer\nblockchain and uses our threshold signature scheme to reach global consensus.\nExperimental results show that the proposed consensus protocol is scalable for\nlarge IoT applications and significantly reduces the communication cost,\nnetwork latency, and agreement time by more than 50% compared with the Raft\nprotocol for consensus processing.",

Executing transactions across\nvarious blockchains is notably instrumental in unlocking the potential of novel\napplications, particularly in the financial sector, where their potential would\notherwise be significantly diminished. Therefore, interoperable ledgers are\ncrucial to ensure the expansion and further adoption of such a technology in\nvarious contexts.\n  In this paper, we present a protocol that uses a combination of trusted\nexecution environment (TEE) and blockchains to enable interoperability over\nindependent semi-centralized CBDC ledgers, guaranteeing the atomicity of\ninter-bank transfers. Our interoperability protocol uses a custom adaptation of\natomic swap protocol and is executed by any pair of CBDC instances to realize a\none-way transfer. It ensures features such as atomicity, verifiability,\ncorrectness, censorship resistance, and privacy while offering high scalability\nin terms of the number of CBDC instances. Our approach enables to possible\ndeployment scenarios that can be combined: (1) CBDC instances represent central\nbanks of multiple countries, and (2) CBDC instances represent the set of retail\nbanks and a paramount central bank of a single country. We provide a detailed\ndescription of our protocol as well as an extensive analysis of its benefits,\nfeatures, and security.\n  In this WIP paper, we made a proof-of-concept implementation and made a\npartial evaluation, while the more extensive evaluation will be made in our\nfuture work.",

On the other hand, it can\nhave far-reaching consequences for the rights of those affected. Argumentation\nschemes could remedy this untenable situation by rendering underlying premises\ntransparent.

In\nthe argumentation theory and AI community, argumentation schemes are\ninfluential as they state implicit premises for different types of arguments.\nThrough their critical questions, they aid the argumentation participants in\ncritically evaluating arguments. We specialise the notion of argumentation\nschemes to legal reasoning about cryptocurrency deanonymisation.

            "summary": "Several blockchain consensus protocols proposed to use of Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) to solve the limited processing throughput of traditional\nsingle-chain Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains. Many such protocols utilize a\nrandom transaction selection (RTS) strategy (e.g., PHANTOM, GHOSTDAG, SPECTRE,\nInclusive, and Prism) to avoid transaction duplicates across parallel blocks in\nDAG and thus maximize the network throughput. However, previous research has\nnot rigorously examined incentive-oriented greedy behaviors when transaction\nselection deviates from the protocol. In this work, we first perform a generic\ngame-theoretic analysis abstracting several DAG-based blockchain protocols that\nuse the RTS strategy, and we prove that such a strategy does not constitute a\nNash equilibrium, which is contradictory to the proof in the Inclusive paper.\nNext, we develop a blockchain simulator that extends existing open-source tools\nto support multiple chains and explore incentive-based deviations from the\nprotocol. We perform simulations with ten miners to confirm our conclusion from\nthe game-theoretic analysis. The simulations confirm that greedy actors who do\nnot follow the RTS strategy can profit more than honest miners and harm the\nprocessing throughput of the protocol because duplicate transactions are\nincluded in more than one block of different chains. We show that this effect\nis indirectly proportional to the network propagation delay. Finally, we show\nthat greedy miners are incentivized to form a shared mining pool to increase\ntheir profits. This undermines the decentralization and degrades the design of\nthe protocols in question. To further support our claims, we execute more\ncomplex experiments on a realistic Bitcoin-like network with more than 7000\nnodes.",

First, we contribute the Elliptic++ dataset, which extends the\nElliptic transaction dataset to include over 822k Bitcoin wallet addresses\n(nodes), each with 56 features, and 1.27M temporal interactions. This enables\nboth the detection of fraudulent transactions and the detection of illicit\naddresses (actors) in the Bitcoin network by leveraging four types of graph\ndata: (i) the transaction-to-transaction graph, representing the money flow in\nthe Bitcoin network, (ii) the address-to-address interaction graph, capturing\nthe types of transaction flows between Bitcoin addresses, (iii) the\naddress-transaction graph, representing the bi-directional money flow between\naddresses and transactions (BTC flow from input address to one or more\ntransactions and BTC flow from a transaction to one or more output addresses),\nand (iv) the user entity graph, capturing clusters of Bitcoin addresses\nrepresenting unique Bitcoin users. Second, we perform fraud detection tasks on\nall four graphs by using diverse machine learning algorithms. We show that\nadding enhanced features from the address-to-address and the\naddress-transaction graphs not only assists in effectively detecting both\nillicit transactions and illicit addresses, but also assists in gaining\nin-depth understanding of the root cause of money laundering vulnerabilities in\ncryptocurrency transactions and the strategies for fraud detection and\nprevention.

NFTs are capable of representing users' ownership on the blockchain\nand have experienced tremendous market sales due to their popularity.\nUnfortunately, the high value of NFTs also makes them a target for attackers.\nThe defects in NFT smart contracts could be exploited by attackers to harm the\nsecurity and reliability of the NFT ecosystem. Despite the significance of this\nissue, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing NFT smart\ncontracts, which may raise worries about the security of users' NFTs. To\naddress this gap, in this paper, we introduce 5 defects in NFT smart contracts.\nEach defect is defined and illustrated with a code example highlighting its\nfeatures and consequences, paired with possible solutions to fix it.\nFurthermore, we propose a tool named NFTGuard to detect our defined defects\nbased on a symbolic execution framework. Specifically, NFTGuard extracts the\ninformation of the state variables from the contract abstract syntax tree\n(AST), which is critical for identifying variable-loading and storing\noperations during symbolic execution. Furthermore, NFTGuard recovers\nsource-code-level features from the bytecode to effectively locate defects and\nreport them based on predefined detection patterns. We run NFTGuard on 16,527\nreal-world smart contracts and perform an evaluation based on the manually\nlabeled results. We find that 1,331 contracts contain at least one of the 5\ndefects, and the overall precision achieved by our tool is 92.6%.",

            "summary": "Distributed trust is a nebulous concept that has evolved from different\nperspectives in recent years. While one can attribute its current prominence to\nblockchain and cryptocurrency, the distributed trust concept has been\ncultivating progress in federated learning, trustworthy and responsible AI in\nan ecosystem setting, data sharing, privacy issues across organizational\nboundaries, and zero trust cybersecurity. This paper will survey the concept of\ndistributed trust in multiple disciplines. It will take a system/software\narchitecture point of view to look at trust redistribution/shift and the\nassociated tradeoffs in systems and applications enabled by distributed trust\ntechnologies.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technology has sparked renewed interest in planetary-scale\nByzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR). While recent\nworks have mainly focused on improving the scalability and throughput of these\nprotocols, few have addressed latency. We present FlashConsensus, a novel\ntransformation for optimizing the latency of quorum-based BFT consensus\nprotocols. FLASHCONSENSUS uses an adaptive resilience threshold that enables\nfaster transaction ordering when the system contains few faulty replicas. Our\nconstruction exploits adaptive weighted replication to automatically assign\nhigh voting power to the fastest replicas, forming small quorums that\nsignificantly speed up consensus. Even when using such quorums with a smaller\nresilience threshold, FlashConsensus still satisfies the standard SMR safety\nand liveness guarantees with optimal resilience, thanks to the judicious\nintegration of abortable SMR and BFT forensics techniques. Our experiments with\ntens of replicas spread in all continents show that FLASHCONSENSUS can order\ntransactions with finality in less than 0.4s, half the time of a PBFT-like\nprotocol (with optimal consensus latency) in the same network, and matching the\nlatency of this protocol running on the theoretically best possible internet\nlinks (transmitting at 67% of the speed of light).",

            "summary": "With the overall momentum of the blockchain industry, crypto-based crimes are\nbecoming more and more prevalent. After committing a crime, the main goal of\ncybercriminals is to obfuscate the source of the illicit funds in order to\nconvert them into cash and get away with it. Many studies have analyzed money\nlaundering in the field of the traditional financial sector and\nblockchain-based Bitcoin. But so far, little is known about the characteristics\nof crypto money laundering in the blockchain-based Web3 ecosystem. To fill this\ngap, and considering that Ethereum is the largest platform on Web3, in this\npaper, we systematically study the behavioral characteristics and economic\nimpact of money laundering accounts through the lenses of Ethereum heists.\nBased on a very small number of tagged accounts of exchange hackers, DeFi\nexploiters, and scammers, we mine untagged money laundering groups through\nheuristic transaction tracking methods, to carve out a full picture of security\nincidents. By analyzing account characteristics and transaction networks, we\nobtain many interesting findings about crypto money laundering in Web3,\nobserving the escalating money laundering methods such as creating counterfeit\ntokens and masquerading as speculators. Finally, based on these findings we\nprovide inspiration for anti-money laundering to promote the healthy\ndevelopment of the Web3 ecosystem.",

Using a simple and flexible agent-based model, this study employs a\ntime-continuous simulation algorithm to analyze the evolution of the blocktree\nand assess the impact of initial conditions on consensus quality. The model\nsimulates validator node behavior and the information propagation throughout\nthe peer-to-peer network of validators to analyze the resulting blockchain\nstructure. Key variables in the model include the topology of the peer-to-peer\nnetwork and average block and attestation latencies. Metrics to evaluate\nconsensus quality are established, and means to observe the model's\nresponsiveness to changes in parameters are provided. The simulations reveal a\nphase transition in which the system switches from a consensus state to a\nnon-consensus state, with a theoretical justification presented for this\nobservation.",

In this work, we address $k$-sum attacks from a novel\nangle by defining a Public Third Party (PTP), which is an automatic process\nthat can be verifiable by the public and restricts the signing phase from\ncontinuing until receiving commitments from all signers. Further, a two-round\nmulti-signature scheme MEMS with PTP is proposed, which is secure based on\ndiscrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model. As each signer\ncommunicates directly with the PTP instead of other co-signers, the total\namount of communications is significantly reduced. In addition, as PTP\nparticipates in the computation of the aggregation and signing algorithms, the\ncomputation cost left for each signer and verifier remains the same as the\nbasis Schnorr signature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the maximum\nefficiency that a Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme can achieve. Further,\nMEMS is applied in blockchain platform, e.g., Fabric, to improve the\ntransaction efficiency.",

According to the comparative analysis, Ethereum scored high\non network openness in terms of the number of participants and the cost of\nrunning the chain, but scored relatively low on capital concentration and\nstaking ratio, which is likely due to the low ratio of staked ether (ETH) to\ncirculating supply and the significant stakes in staking pools like Lido.\nPermissioned blockchains such as Klaytn and Polygon have limited openness,\nwhich suggests the need to take the level of openness into account when\ntransitioning into a permissionless blockchain architecture with a more\ndecentralized setting.",

With the advent of blockchain technology, value in reporting\naccurate prices without a third party has become apparent. There have been many\nattempts at trying to calculate prices without a third party, in which each of\nthese attempts have resulted in being exploited by an exploiter artificially\ninflating the price. The industry has then shifted to a more centralized\ndesign, fetching price data from multiple centralized sources and then applying\nstatistical methods to reach a consensus price. Even though this strategy is\nsecure compared to reading from a single source, enough number of sources need\nto report to be able to apply statistical methods. As more sources participate\nin reporting the price, the feed gets more secure with the slowest feed\nbecoming the bottleneck for query response time, introducing a tradeoff between\nsecurity and speed. This paper provides the design and implementation details\nof a novel method to algorithmically compute security prices in a way that\nartificially inflating targeted pools has no effect on the reported price of\nthe queried asset. We hypothesize that the proposed algorithm can report\naccurate prices given a set of possibly dishonest sources.",

            "summary": "The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which enable transactions with a\ndegree of pseudonymity, has led to a surge in various illicit activities,\nincluding ransomware payments and transactions on darknet markets. These\nillegal activities often utilize Bitcoin as the preferred payment method.\nHowever, current tools for detecting illicit behavior either rely on a few\nheuristics and laborious data collection processes or employ computationally\ninefficient graph neural network (GNN) models that are challenging to\ninterpret.\n  To overcome the computational and interpretability limitations of existing\ntechniques, we introduce an effective solution called Chainlet Orbits. This\napproach embeds Bitcoin addresses by leveraging their topological\ncharacteristics in transactions. By employing our innovative address embedding,\nwe investigate e-crime in Bitcoin networks by focusing on distinctive\nsubstructures that arise from illicit behavior.\n  The results of our node classification experiments demonstrate superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods, including both topological\nand GNN-based approaches. Moreover, our approach enables the use of\ninterpretable and explainable machine learning models in as little as 15\nminutes for most days on the Bitcoin transaction network.",

In particular, our design\nallows every node to delete some specific data without coordinating this\ndecision with others.

To stabilize the income from\nsolar energy generation, there have been limited traditional options, such as\nusing energy storage to pool excessive solar energy in off-peak periods or\nfinancial derivatives from future markets to hedge energy prices. In this\npaper, we explore a novel idea of \"parametric solar energy insurance\", by which\nsolar panel owners can insure their solar energy generation based on a\nverifiable geographically specific index (surface solar irradiation).\nParametric solar energy insurance offers opportunities of financial subsidies\nfor insufficient solar energy generation and amortizes the fluctuations of\nrenewable energy generation geographically. Furthermore, we propose to leverage\nblockchain and remote sensing (satellite imagery) to provide a publicly\nverifiable platform for solar energy insurance, which not only automates the\nunderwriting and claims of a solar energy insurance policy, but also improves\nits accountability and transparency. We utilize the state-of-the-art succinct\nzero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARK) to realize privacy-preserving blockchain-based\nsolar energy insurance on real-world permissionless blockchain platform\nEthereum.",

            "summary": "Most blockchain platforms from Ethereum onwards render smart contracts as\nstateful reactive objects that update their state and transfer crypto-assets in\nresponse to transactions. A drawback of this design is that when users submit a\ntransaction, they cannot predict in which state it will be executed. This\nexposes them to transaction-ordering attacks, a widespread class of attacks\nwhere adversaries with the power to construct blocks of transactions can\nextract value from smart contracts (the so-called MEV attacks). The UTXO model\nis an alternative blockchain design that thwarts these attacks by requiring new\ntransactions to spend past ones: since transactions have unique identifiers,\nreordering attacks are ineffective. Currently, the blockchains following the\nUTXO model either provide contracts with limited expressiveness (Bitcoin), or\nrequire complex run-time environments (Cardano). We present ILLUM, an\nIntermediate-Level Language for the UTXO Model. ILLUM can express real-world\nsmart contracts, e.g. those found in Decentralized Finance. We define a\ncompiler from ILLUM to a bare-bone UTXO blockchain with loop-free scripts. Our\ncompilation target only requires minimal extensions to Bitcoin Script: in\nparticular, we exploit covenants, a mechanism for preserving scripts along\nchains of transactions. We prove the security of our compiler: namely, any\nattack targeting the compiled contract is also observable at the ILLUM level.\nHence, the compiler does not introduce new vulnerabilities that were not\nalready present in the source ILLUM contract. Finally, we discuss the\nsuitability of ILLUM as a compilation target for higher-level contract\nlanguages.",

Fault-tolerant systems in general\nare essential in assuring continuity of service for mission critical\napplications. However, their implementation may be challenging and expensive.\nIn this study, IoT Systems with Byzantine Fault-Tolerance are considered.\nAnalytical models and solutions are presented as well as a detailed analysis\nfor the evaluation of the availability. Byzantine Fault Tolerance is\nparticularly important for blockchain mechanisms, and in turn for IoT, since it\ncan provide a secure, reliable and decentralized infrastructure for IoT devices\nto communicate and transact with each other. The proposed model is based on\ncontinuous-time Markov chains, and it analyses the availability of Byzantine\nFault-Tolerant systems. While the availability model is based on a\ncontinuous-time Markov chain where the breakdown and repair times follow\nexponential distributions, the number of the Byzantine nodes in the network\nstudied follows various distributions. The numerical results presented report\navailability as a function of the number of participants and the relative\nnumber of honest actors in the system. It can be concluded from the model that\nthere is a non-linear relationship between the number of servers and network\navailability; i.e. the availability is inversely proportional to the number of\nnodes in the system. This relationship is further strengthened as the ratio of\nbreak-down rate over repair rate increases.",

Federated learning (FL) has been\nacknowledged as a privacy-preserving machine learning technology, where\nmultiple parties cooperatively train ML models without exchanging raw data.\nHowever, the current FL architecture does not allow for an audit of the\ntraining process due to the various data-protection policies implemented by\neach FL participant. Furthermore, there is no global model verifiability\navailable in the current architecture. This paper proposes a smart\ncontract-based policy control for securing the Federated Learning (FL)\nmanagement system. First, we develop and deploy a smart contract-based local\ntraining policy control on the FL participants' side. This policy control is\nused to verify the training process, ensuring that the evaluation process\nfollows the same rules for all FL participants. We then enforce a smart\ncontract-based aggregation policy to manage the global model aggregation\nprocess. Upon completion, the aggregated model and policy are stored on\nblockchain-based storage. Subsequently, we distribute the aggregated global\nmodel and the smart contract to all FL participants. Our proposed method uses\nsmart policy control to manage access and verify the integrity of machine\nlearning models.

To address these\nchallenges, deploying blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in 6G\nnetworks may realize new breakthroughs in advancing network performances in\nterms of security, privacy, efficiency, cost, and more. In this paper, we\nprovide a detailed survey of existing works on the application of blockchain\nand AI to 6G wireless communications. More specifically, we start with a brief\noverview of blockchain and AI. Then, we mainly review the recent advances in\nthe fusion of blockchain and AI, and highlight the inevitable trend of\ndeploying both blockchain and AI in wireless communications. Furthermore, we\nextensively explore integrating blockchain and AI for wireless communication\nsystems, involving secure services and Internet of Things (IoT) smart\napplications.

            "summary": "Traditional Insurance, a popular approach of financial risk management, has\nsuffered from the issues of high operational costs, opaqueness, inefficiency\nand a lack of trust. Recently, blockchain-enabled \"parametric insurance\"\nthrough authorized data sources (e.g., remote sensing and IoT) aims to overcome\nthese issues by automating the underwriting and claim processes of insurance\npolicies on a blockchain. However, the openness of blockchain platforms raises\na concern of user privacy, as the private user data in insurance claims on a\nblockchain may be exposed to outsiders. In this paper, we propose a\nprivacy-preserving parametric insurance framework based on succinct\nzero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), whereby an insuree submits a zero-knowledge\nproof (without revealing any private data) for the validity of an insurance\nclaim and the authenticity of its data sources to a blockchain for transparent\nverification. Moreover, we extend the recent zk-SNARKs to support robust\nprivacy protection for multiple heterogeneous data sources and improve its\nefficiency to cut the incurred gas cost by 80%. As a proof-of-concept, we\nimplemented a working prototype of bushfire parametric insurance on real-world\nblockchain platform Ethereum, and present extensive empirical evaluations.",

            "summary": "Gas is the transaction-fee metering system of the Ethereum network. Users of\nthe network are required to select a gas price for submission with their\ntransaction, creating a risk of overpaying or delayed/unprocessed transactions\nin this selection. In this work, we investigate data in the aftermath of the\nLondon Hard Fork and shed insight into the transaction dynamics of the net-work\nafter this major fork. As such, this paper provides an update on work previous\nto 2019 on the link between EthUSD BitUSD and gas price. For forecasting, we\ncompare a novel combination of machine learning methods such as Direct\nRecursive Hybrid LSTM, CNNLSTM, and Attention LSTM. These are combined with\nwavelet threshold denoising and matrix profile data processing toward the\nforecasting of block minimum gas price, on a 5-min timescale, over multiple\nlookaheads. As the first application of the matrix profile being applied to gas\nprice data and forecasting we are aware of, this study demonstrates that matrix\nprofile data can enhance attention-based models however, given the hardware\nconstraints, hybrid models outperformed attention and CNNLSTM models. The\nwavelet coherence of inputs demonstrates correlation in multiple variables on a\n1 day timescale, which is a deviation of base free from gas price. A\nDirect-Recursive Hybrid LSTM strategy outperforms other models. Hybrid models\nhave favourable performance up to a 20 min lookahead with performance being\ncomparable to attention models when forecasting 25/50-min ahead. Forecasts over\na range of lookaheads allow users to make an informed decision on gas price\nselection and the optimal window to submit their transaction in without fear of\ntheir transaction being rejected. This, in turn, gives more detailed insight\ninto gas price dynamics than existing recommenders, oracles and forecasting\napproaches, which provide simple heuristics or limited lookahead horizons.",

Several schemes have attempted to\naddress this, one of which uses coded computation to lighten the load. Here we\nseek to address one issue with all such coded blockchain schemes known to the\nauthors: transaction confirmation. In a coded blockchain, only the leader has\naccess to the uncoded block, while the nodes receive encoded data that makes it\neffectively impossible for them to identify which transactions were included in\nthe block. As a result, a Byzantine leader might choose not to notify a sender\nor receiver of a transaction that the transaction went into the block, and even\nwith an honest leader, they would not be able to produce a proof of a\ntransaction's inclusion. To address this, we have constructed a protocol to\nsend the nodes enough information so that a client sending or receiving a\ntransaction is guaranteed to not only be notified but also to receive a proof\nof that transaction's inclusion in the block. Crucially, we do this without\nsubstantially increasing the bit complexity of the original coded blockchain\nprotocol.",

The objective is to\nidentify $L$ optimal stops for mining, thereby maximizing the probability of\nsuccessfully adding a block to the blockchain; we also present a model to\noptimize the number of stops (mining instants). The formulation is equivalent\nto a multiple stopping time POMDP. Since POMDPs are in general computationally\nintractable to solve, we show mathematically using submodularity arguments that\nthe optimal mining policy has a useful structure: 1) it is monotone in belief\nspace, and 2) it exhibits a threshold structure, which divides the belief space\ninto two connected sets. Exploiting the structural results, we formulate a\ncomputationally-efficient linear mining policy for the blockchain-enabled IoT\ndevice. We present a policy gradient technique to optimize the parameters of\nthe linear mining policy.

Users submit their transactions to the\nnetwork's clocks, which run an agreement protocol that provides each\ntransaction with a timestamp of receipt which is then used to define the\ntransactions' order. By separating agreement from ordering, our protocol is\nefficient and has a simpler design compared to other available solutions.\nMoreover, our protocol brings to the blockchain world the paradigm of\nasynchronous fallback, where the algorithm operates with stronger fairness\nguarantees during periods of synchronous use, switching to an asynchronous mode\nonly during times of increased network delay.",

            "summary": "Distributed detection over a blockchain-aided Internet of Things (BIoT)\nnetwork in the presence of attacks is considered, where the integrated\nblockchain is employed to secure data exchanges over the BIoT as well as data\nstorage at the agents of the BIoT. We consider a general adversary model where\nattackers jointly exploit the vulnerability of IoT devices and that of the\nblockchain employed in the BIoT. The optimal attacking strategy which minimizes\nthe Kullback-Leibler divergence is pursued. It can be shown that this\noptimization problem is nonconvex, and hence it is generally intractable to\nfind the globally optimal solution to such a problem. To overcome this issue,\nwe first propose a relaxation method that can convert the original nonconvex\noptimization problem into a convex optimization problem, and then the analytic\nexpression for the optimal solution to the relaxed convex optimization problem\nis derived. The optimal value of the relaxed convex optimization problem\nprovides a detection performance guarantee for the BIoT in the presence of\nattacks. In addition, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm which is based\non a capped water-filling method to solve the relaxed convex optimization\nproblem, and moreover, we show that the convergence of the proposed coordinate\ndescent algorithm can be guaranteed.",

In this work, we\nstudy how rationality spreads in a community. To this end, through an\nagent-based model, we analyse the dynamics of a population whose individuals,\nendowed with a rational attitude controlled by a numerical parameter, play a\nsimple game. The latter consists of multiple strategies, each associated with a\ngiven reward. The proposed model is then used as a benchmark for studying the\nbehaviour of Bitcoin users, inferred by analysing transactions recorded in the\nBlockchain. Remarkably, a population undergoing a sharp transition from\nirrational to rational attitudes shows a behavioural pattern similar to that of\nBitcoin users, whose rationality showed up as soon as their cryptocurrency\nbecame worth just a few cents (USD). To conclude, a behavioural analysis that\nrelies on an entropy measure combined with a simple agent-based model allows us\nto detect the rise of rationality across a community. Although further\ninvestigations are essential to corroborate our results, we deem the proposed\napproach could also get used for studying other social phenomena and\nbehaviours.",

We argue that DCR graphs are a suitable formalization\ntool for smart contracts because they explicitly and visually capture the\nmentioned features.

However, equilibria obtained\nin this fashion do not hold in general in vivo, when games are deployed on a\nblockchain. Being able to deploy side contracts changes fundamental\ngame-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game, specifically a Stackelberg\ngame with multiple commitments, wherein agents strategize to deploy the best\ncontracts. Not taking these commitment capabilities into account thus fails to\ncapture an important aspect of deploying smart contracts in practice. A game\nthat remains secure when the agents can deploy contracts is said to be\nStackelberg resilient. We show that Stackelberg resilience can be computed\nefficiently for any two-player game of perfect information and show that it is\nhard to compute in general. We show that if a game is Stackelberg\n$k$-resilient, that is, resilient when there are $k$ contracts, it is also\nresilient when there are fewer contracts. We demonstrate the non-triviality of\nside contract resilience by analyzing two smart contracts for decentralized\ncommerce from the literature. These contracts have the same intended\nfunctionality, but we show that only one is Stackelberg resilient.\n  Our work highlights an issue that is necessary to address to ensure the\nsecure deployment of smart contracts and suggests that other contracts already\ndeployed on major blockchains may be susceptible to these attacks.",

To overcome these limitations, we introduce BRAIN, a\nBlockchain-based Reliable AI Network, a novel platform specifically designed to\nensure reliable inference and training of large models. BRAIN harnesses a\nunique two-phase transaction mechanism, allowing real-time processing via\npipelining by separating request and response transactions. Each\nrandomly-selected inference committee commits and reveals the inference\nresults, and upon reaching an agreement through a smart contract, then the\nrequested operation is executed using the consensus result. Additionally, BRAIN\ncarries out training by employing a randomly-selected training committee. They\nsubmit commit and reveal transactions along with their respective scores,\nenabling local model aggregation based on the median value of the scores.\nExperimental results demonstrate that BRAIN delivers considerably higher\ninference throughput at reasonable gas fees.

            "summary": "Oracle networks feeding off-chain information to a blockchain are required to\nsolve a distributed agreement problem since these networks receive information\nfrom multiple sources and at different times. We make a key observation that in\nmost cases, the value obtained by oracle network nodes from multiple\ninformation sources are in close proximity. We define a notion of agreement\ndistance and leverage the availability of a state machine replication (SMR)\nservice to solve this distributed agreement problem with an honest simple\nmajority of nodes instead of the conventional requirement of an honest super\nmajority of nodes. Values from multiple nodes being in close proximity,\ntherefore, forming a coherent cluster, is one of the keys to its efficiency.\nOur asynchronous protocol also embeds a fallback mechanism if the coherent\ncluster formation fails.\n  Through simulations using real-world exchange data from seven prominent\nexchanges, we show that even for very small agreement distance values, the\nprotocol would be able to form coherent clusters and therefore, can safely\ntolerate up to $1/2$ fraction of Byzantine nodes. We also show that, for a\nsmall statistical error, it is possible to choose the size of the oracle\nnetwork to be significantly smaller than the entire system tolerating up to a\n$1/3$ fraction of Byzantine failures. This allows the oracle network to operate\nmuch more efficiently and horizontally scale much better.",

            "summary": "A key constraint that limits the implementation of blockchain in Internet of\nThings (IoT) is its large storage requirement resulting from the fact that each\nblockchain node has to store the entire blockchain. This increases the burden\non blockchain nodes, and increases the communication overhead for new nodes\njoining the network since they have to copy the entire blockchain. In order to\nreduce storage requirements without compromising on system security and\nintegrity, coded blockchains, based on error correcting codes with fixed rates\nand lengths, have been recently proposed. This approach, however, does not fit\nwell with dynamic IoT networks in which nodes actively leave and join. In such\ndynamic blockchains, the existing coded blockchain approaches lead to high\ncommunication overheads for new joining nodes and may have high decoding\nfailure probability. This paper proposes a rateless coded blockchain with\ncoding parameters adjusted to network conditions. Our goals are to minimize\nboth the storage requirement at each blockchain node and the communication\noverhead for each new joining node, subject to a target decoding failure\nprobability. We evaluate the proposed scheme in the context of real-world\nBitcoin blockchain and show that both storage and communication overhead are\nreduced by 99.6\\% with a maximum $10^{-12}$ decoding failure probability.",

The rapid growth of Ethereum and smart contract blockchains\ngenerally calls for well-designed Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) to allocate\nlimited storage and computation resources. However, existing research on TFMs\nmust consider the waiting time for transactions, which is essential for\ncomputer security and economic efficiency. Integrating data from the Ethereum\nblockchain and memory pool (mempool), we explore how two types of events affect\ntransaction latency. First, we apply regression discontinuity design (RDD) to\nstudy the causal inference of the Merge, the most recent significant upgrade of\nEthereum. Our results show that the Merge significantly reduces the long\nwaiting time, network loads, and market congestion. In addition, we verify our\nresults' robustness by inspecting other compounding factors, such as censorship\nand unobserved delays of transactions via private changes. Second, examining\nthree major protocol changes during the merge, we identify block interval\nshortening as the most plausible cause for our empirical results. Furthermore,\nin a mathematical model, we show block interval as a unique mechanism design\nchoice for EIP1559 TFM to achieve better security and efficiency, generally\napplicable to the market congestion caused by demand surges. Finally, we apply\ntime series analysis to research the interaction of Non-Fungible token (NFT)\ndrops and market congestion using Facebook Prophet, an open-source algorithm\nfor generating time-series models. Our study identified NFT drops as a unique\nsource of market congestion -- holiday effects -- beyond trend and season\neffects. Finally, we envision three future research directions of TFM.",

However, it is particularly difficult, mainly due to the\npresence of Byzantine processes that act arbitrarily and the unknown message\ndelays in general networks.\n  Although it is well known that both safety and liveness are at risk as soon\nas n/3 Byzantine processes fail, very few works attempted to characterize\nprecisely the faults that produce safety violations from the faults that\nproduce termination violations.\n  In this paper, we present a new lower bound on the solvability of the\nconsensus problem by distinguishing deceitful faults violating safety and\nbenign faults violating termination from the more general Byzantine faults, in\nwhat we call the Byzantine-deceitful-benign fault model. We show that one\ncannot solve consensus if $n \\leq 3t + d + 2q$ with t, d, and q are Byzantine,\ndeceitful, and benign processes. We show that this bound is tight by presenting\nthe Basilic class of consensus protocols that solve consensus when $n > 3t + d\n+ 2q$. These protocols differ in the number of processes from which they wait\nto receive messages before progressing.\n  Then, we build upon the Basilic class in order to present Zero-Loss\nBlockchain (ZLB), the first blockchain that tolerates an adversary controlling\nmore than half of the system, with up to less than a third of them Byzantine.\nZLB is an open blockchain that combines recent theoretical advances in\naccountable Byzantine agreement to exclude undeniably faulty processes.\nInterestingly, ZLB does not need a known bound on the delay of messages but\nprogressively reduces the portion of faulty processes below 13 , and reaches\nconsensus. Geo-distributed experiments show that ZLB outperforms HotStuff and\nis almost as fast as the scalable Red Belly Blockchain that cannot tolerate n/3\nfaults.",

            "summary": "We study an auction with $m$ identical items in a context where $n$ agents\ncan arbitrarily commit to strategies. In general, such commitments\nnon-trivially change the equilibria by inducing a metagame of choosing which\nstrategies to commit to. In this model, we demonstrate a strategy that an\nattacker may commit to that ensures they receive one such item for free, while\nforcing the remaining agents to enter into a lottery for the remaining items\n(albeit for free). The attack is thus detrimental to the auctioneer who loses\nmost of their revenue. For various types of auctions that are not too\ncongested, we show that the strategy works as long as the agents have\nvaluations that are somewhat concentrated. In this case, all agents will\nvoluntarily cooperate with the attacker to enter into the lottery, because\ndoing so gives them a chance of receiving a free item that would have otherwise\ncost an amount commensurate with their valuation. The attack is robust to a\nlarge constant fraction of the agents being either oblivious to the attack or\nhaving exceptionally high valuations (thus reluctant to enter into the\nlottery). For these agents, the attacker may coerce them into cooperating by\npromising them a free item rather than entering in to the lottery. We show that\nthe conditions for the attack to work hold with high probability when (1) the\nauction is not too congested, and (2) the valuations are sampled i.i.d. from\neither a uniform distribution or a Pareto distribution. The attack works for\nfirst-price auctions, second-price auctions and the transaction fee mechanism\nEIP-1559 used by the Ethereum blockchain.",

Maximal\nExtractable Value or MEV has been one of the major concerns in blockchain\ndesigns as it creates a centralizing force which ultimately affects user\ntransactions. In this article, we dive into the technicality behind MEV, where\nwe explain the concept behind the novel Proposal Builder Separation design as\nan effort by Flashbots to increase decentralization through modularity. We\nunderline potential vulnerability factors under the PBS design, which open\nspace for MEV extracting adversarial strategies by inside participants. We\ndiscuss the shift of trust from validators to builders in PoS blockchains such\nas Ethereum, acknowledging the impact that the later ones may have on users'\ntransactions (in terms of front running) and censorship resistance (in terms of\ntransaction inclusion). We recognize that under PBS, centralized (dominant)\nentities such as builders could potentially harm users by extracting MEV via\nfront running strategies. Finally, we suggest adequate design and policy\nmeasures which could potentially mitigate these negative effects while\nprotecting blockchain users.",

Unfortunately, blockchain-based Metaverse faces serious challenges\nsuch as massive resource demands, scalability, and security concerns. To\naddress these issues, this paper proposes a novel sharding-based blockchain\nframework, namely MetaShard, for Metaverse applications. Particularly, we first\ndevelop an effective consensus mechanism, namely Proof-of-Engagement, that can\nincentivize MUs' data and computing resource contribution. Moreover, to improve\nthe scalability of MetaShard, we propose an innovative sharding management\nscheme to maximize the network's throughput while protecting the shards from\n51% attacks. Since the optimization problem is NP-complete, we develop a hybrid\napproach that decomposes the problem (using the binary search method) into\nsub-problems that can be solved effectively by the Lagrangian method. As a\nresult, the proposed approach can obtain solutions in polynomial time, thereby\nenabling flexible shard reconfiguration and reducing the risk of corruption\nfrom the adversary. Extensive numerical experiments show that, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art commercial solvers, our proposed approach can achieve up to\n66.6% higher throughput in less than 1/30 running time.

One way of addressing this problem is through the\nuse of gas price oracles that utilize historical block data to recommend gas\nprices. However, when transaction volumes increase rapidly, these oracles often\nunderestimate or overestimate the price. In this paper, we demonstrate how\nGaussian process models can predict the distribution of the minimum price in an\nupcoming block when transaction volumes are increasing. This is effective\nbecause these processes account for time correlations between blocks. We\nperformed an empirical analysis using the Gaussian process model on historical\nblock data and compared the performance with GasStation-Express and Geth gas\nprice oracles. The results suggest that when transactions volumes fluctuate\ngreatly, the Gaussian process model offers a better estimation. Further, we\ndemonstrated that GasStation-Express and Geth can be improved upon by using a\nsmaller training sample size which is properly pre-processed. Based on the\nresults of empirical analysis, we recommended a gas price oracle made up of a\nhybrid model consisting of both the Gaussian process and GasStation-Express.\nThis oracle provides efficiency, accuracy, and better cost.",

Still, IoT faces the potential challenges of\nreal-time processing, resource management, and storage services. Edge computing\n(EC) has been introduced to tackle the underlying challenges of IoT by\nproviding real-time processing, resource management, and storage services\nnearer to IoT devices on the network's edge. To make EC more efficient and\neffective, solutions using BC and IOTA have been devoted to this area. However,\nBC and IOTA came with their pitfalls. This survey outlines the pitfalls of BC\nand IOTA in EC and provides research directions to be investigated further.",

A classical DoS attack targets the\ncomputer network to limit, restrict, or stop accessing the system of authorized\nusers which is ineffective against renowned cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,\nEthereum, etc. Unlike the conventional DoS, the BDoS affects the system's\nmechanism design to manipulate the incentive structure to discourage honest\nminers to participate in the mining process. In contrast, in a selfish mining\nattack, the adversary miner keeps its discovered block private to fork the\nchain intentionally that aiming to increase the incentive of the adversary\nminer.

This setting is more challenging than the traditional permissioned\nsetting, in which the set of nodes that will be running the protocol is fixed\nand known at the time of protocol deployment. The goal of this paper is to\nprovide a framework for reasoning about the rich design space of blockchain\nprotocols and their capabilities and limitations in the permissionless setting.\n  We propose a hierarchy of settings with different \"degrees of\npermissionlessness\", specified by the amount of knowledge that a protocol has\nabout the current participants: These are the fully permissionless, dynamically\navailable and quasi-permissionless settings.\n  The paper also proves several results illustrating the utility of our\nanalysis framework for reasoning about blockchain protocols in these settings.\nFor example:\n  (1) In the fully permissionless setting, even with synchronous communication\nand with severe restrictions on the total size of the Byzantine players, every\ndeterministic protocol for Byzantine agreement has a non-terminating execution.\n  (2) In the dynamically available and partially synchronous setting, no\nprotocol can solve the Byzantine agreement problem with high probability, even\nif there are no Byzantine players at all.\n  (3) In the quasi-permissionless and partially synchronous setting, by\ncontrast, assuming a bound on the total size of the Byzantine players, there is\na deterministic protocol solving state machine replication.\n  (4) In the quasi-permissionless and synchronous setting, every proof-of-stake\nstate machine replication protocol that uses only time-malleable cryptographic\nprimitives is vulnerable to long-range attacks.",

Our protocol leverages\nsecure multiparty computation (SMPC) techniques that enable decentralized\ncomputation of the final payment price without disclosing additional\ninformation. The total computational complexity of our proposed protocol,\nincluding preparation, is $O(n^2 k)$, and the complexity for the main auction\nis $O(n k)$.

The IoT is\nunder massive experimentation to operate in a distributed manner, making it\nfavourable to be utilized in the healthcare ecosystem. However, un- der the IoT\nhealthcare ecosystem (IoT-HS), the nodes of the IoT networks are unveiled to an\naberrant level of security threats. Regulating an adequate volume of sensitive\nand personal data, IoT-HS undergoes various security challenges for which a\ndistributed mechanism to address such concerns plays a vital role. Although\nBlockchain, having a distributed ledger, is integral to solving security\nconcerns in IoT-HSs, it undergoes major problems, including massive storage and\ncomputational requirements. Also, Holochain, which has low computational and\nmemory requirements, lacks authentication distribution availability. Therefore,\nthis paper proposes a hybrid Holochain and Blockchain-based privacy\nperseverance and security framework for IoT-HSs that combines the benefits\nHolochain and Blockchain provide, overcoming the computational, memory, and\nauthentication challenges. This framework is more suited for IoT scenarios\nwhere resource needs to be optimally utilized.

            "summary": "UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is rapidly gaining traction in various human\nactivities and has become an integral component of the satellite-air-ground-sea\n(SAGS) integrated network. As high-speed moving objects, UAVs not only have\nextremely strict requirements for communication delay, but also cannot be\nmaliciously controlled as a weapon by the attacker. Therefore, an efficient and\nsecure communication method designed for UAV networks is necessary. We propose\na communication mechanism ESCM. For high efficiency, ESCM provides a routing\nprotocol based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to accelerate\ncommunications between UAVs. Meanwhile, we use blockchain to guarantee the\nsecurity of UAV networks. However, blockchain has unstable links in\nhigh-mobility networks resulting in low consensus efficiency and high\ncommunication overhead. Consequently, ESCM introduces digital twin (DT), which\ntransforms the UAV network into a static network by mapping UAVs from the\nphysical world into Cyberspace. This virtual UAV network is called CyberUAV.\nThen, in CyberUAV, we design a blockchain consensus based on network coding,\nnamed Proof of Network Coding (PoNC). Analysis and simulation show that the\nabove modules in ESCM have advantages over existing schemes. Through ablation\nstudies, we demonstrate that these modules are indispensable for efficient and\nsecure communication of UAV networks.",

            "summary": "With blockchain technology rapidly progress, the smart contracts have become\na common tool in a number of industries including finance, healthcare,\ninsurance and gaming. The number of smart contracts has multiplied, and at the\nsame time, the security of smart contracts has drawn considerable attention due\nto the monetary losses brought on by smart contract vulnerabilities. Existing\nanalysis techniques are capable of identifying a large number of smart contract\nsecurity flaws, but they rely too much on rigid criteria established by\nspecialists, where the detection process takes much longer as the complexity of\nthe smart contract rises. In this paper, we propose HyMo as a multi-modal\nhybrid deep learning model, which intelligently considers various input\nrepresentations to consider multimodality and FastText word embedding\ntechnique, which represents each word as an n-gram of characters with BiGRU\ndeep learning technique, as a sequence processing model that consists of two\nGRUs to achieve higher accuracy in smart contract vulnerability detection. The\nmodel gathers features using various deep learning models to identify the smart\ncontract vulnerabilities. Through a series of studies on the currently publicly\naccessible dataset such as ScrawlD, we show that our hybrid HyMo model has\nexcellent smart contract vulnerability detection performance. Therefore, HyMo\nperforms better detection of smart contract vulnerabilities against other\napproaches.",

Therefore, the\nproposed framework leverages a blockchain network for secure model aggregation.\nEach blockchain node hosts an SGX-enabled processor that securely performs the\nFL-based aggregation tasks to generate a global model. Blockchain nodes can\nverify the authenticity of the aggregated model, run a blockchain consensus\nmechanism to ensure the integrity of the model, and add it to the distributed\nledger for tamper-proof storage.

Our results show that, BlockGPT identifies abnormal transactions by\nranking 49 out of 124 attacks among the top-3 most abnormal transactions\ninteracting with their victim contracts.

As smart contracts become increasingly popular and carry trillion\ndollars worth of digital assets, they become more of an appealing target for\nattackers, who have exploited vulnerabilities in smart contracts to cause\ncatastrophic economic losses. Notwithstanding a proliferation of work that has\nbeen developed to detect an impressive list of vulnerabilities, the bad\nrandomness vulnerability is overlooked by many existing tools. In this paper,\nwe make the first attempt to provide a systematic analysis of random numbers in\nEthereum smart contracts, by investigating the principles behind pseudo-random\nnumber generation and organizing them into a taxonomy. We also lucubrate\nvarious attacks against bad random numbers and group them into four categories.\nFurthermore, we present RNVulDet - a tool that incorporates taint analysis\ntechniques to automatically identify bad randomness vulnerabilities and detect\ncorresponding attack transactions. To extensively verify the effectiveness of\nRNVulDet, we construct three new datasets: i) 34 well-known contracts that are\nreported to possess bad randomness vulnerabilities, ii) 214 popular contracts\nthat have been rigorously audited before launch and are regarded as free of bad\nrandomness vulnerabilities, and iii) a dataset consisting of 47,668 smart\ncontracts and 49,951 suspicious transactions. We compare RNVulDet with three\nstate-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detectors, and our tool\nsignificantly outperforms them. Meanwhile, RNVulDet spends 2.98s per contract\non average, in most cases orders-of-magnitude faster than other tools. RNVulDet\nsuccessfully reveals 44,264 attack transactions. Our implementation and\ndatasets are released, hoping to inspire others.",

            "summary": "Smart contracts are small programs on the blockchain that often handle\nvaluable assets. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can be costly, as time has\nshown over and over again. Countermeasures are high in demand and include best\npractice recommendations as well as tools supporting development, program\nverification, and post-deployment analysis. Many tools focus on detecting the\nabsence or presence of a subset of the known vulnerabilities, delivering\nresults of varying quality. Most comparative tool evaluations resort to\nselecting a handful of tools and testing them against each other. In the best\ncase, the evaluation is based on a smallish ground truth. For Ethereum, there\nare commendable efforts by several author groups to manually classify\ncontracts. However, a comprehensive ground truth is still lacking. In this\nwork, we construct a ground truth based on publicly available benchmark sets\nfor Ethereum smart contracts with manually checked ground truth data. We\ndevelop a method to unify these sets. Additionally, we devise strategies for\nmatching entries that pertain to the same contract, such that we can determine\noverlaps and disagreements between the sets and consolidate the disagreements.\nFinally, we assess the quality of the included ground truth sets. Our work\nreduces inconsistencies, redundancies, and incompleteness while increasing the\nnumber of data points and heterogeneity.",

            "summary": "Employee data can be used to facilitate work, but their misusage may pose\nrisks for individuals. Inverse transparency therefore aims to track all usages\nof personal data, allowing individuals to monitor them to ensure accountability\nfor potential misusage. This necessitates a trusted log to establish an\nagreed-upon and non-repudiable timeline of events. The unique properties of\nblockchain facilitate this by providing immutability and availability. For\npower asymmetric environments such as the workplace, permissionless blockchain\nis especially beneficial as no trusted third party is required. Yet, two issues\nremain: (1) In a decentralized environment, no arbiter can facilitate and\nattest to data exchanges. Simple peer-to-peer sharing of data, conversely,\nlacks the required non-repudiation. (2) With data governed by privacy\nlegislation such as the GDPR, the core advantage of immutability becomes a\nliability. After a rightful request, an individual's personal data need to be\nrectified or deleted, which is impossible in an immutable blockchain.\n  To solve these issues, we present Kovacs, a decentralized data exchange and\nusage logging system for inverse transparency built on blockchain. Its\nnew-usage protocol ensures non-repudiation, and therefore accountability, for\ninverse transparency. Its one-time pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees\nunlinkability and enables proof of ownership, which allows data subjects to\nexercise their legal rights regarding their personal data. With our\nimplementation, we show the viability of our solution. The decentralized\ncommunication impacts performance and scalability, but exchange duration and\nstorage size are still reasonable. More importantly, the provided information\nsecurity meets high requirements. We conclude that Kovacs realizes\ndecentralized inverse transparency through secure and GDPR-compliant use of\npermissionless blockchain.",

In a blockchain application\nwhere the task of the application which makes use of the data stored in a\nblockchain has to be accomplished by a time instant, the employed blockchain is\nessentially finitely-long. In this paper, we consider a general finitely-long\nblockchain model which is generalized from most existing works on finitely-long\nblockchain applications, and take the first step towards characterizing the\nvulnerability of finitely-long blockchains in securing data against\ndouble-spending attacks. For the first time, we develop a general closed-form\nexpression for the probability of success in launching a double-spending attack\non a finitely-long blockchain. This probability essentially characterizes the\nvulnerability of finitely-long blockchains. Then, we prove that the probability\nof success in launching a double-spending attack on a finitely-long blockchain\nis no greater than that on an infinitely-long blockchain, which implies that\nfinitely-long blockchains are less vulnerable to double-spending attacks than\ninfinitely-long blockchains. Moreover, we show that unlike infinitely-long\nblockchains which can be surely paralyzed by a 51% attack, finitely-long\nblockchains are more resistant to 51% attacks.",

            "summary": "Due to advantages in security and privacy, blockchain is considered a key\nenabling technology to support 6G communications. Practical Byzantine Fault\nTolerance (PBFT) and RAFT are seen as the most applicable consensus mechanisms\n(CMs) in blockchain-enabled wireless networks. However, previous studies on\nPBFT and RAFT rarely consider the channel performance of the physical layer,\nsuch as path loss and channel fading, resulting in research results that are\nfar from real networks. Additionally, 6G communications will widely deploy\nhigh-frequency signals such as terahertz (THz) and millimeter wave (mmWave),\nwhile performances of PBFT and RAFT are still unknown when these signals are\ntransmitted in wireless PBFT or RAFT networks. Therefore, it is urgent to study\nthe performance of non-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks with THz and\nmmWave signals, to better make PBFT and RAFT play a role in the 6G era. In this\npaper, we study and compare the performance of THz and mmWave signals in\nnon-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks, considering Rayleigh Fading (RF) and\nclose-in Free Space (FS) reference distance path loss. Performance is evaluated\nby five metrics: consensus success rate, latency, throughput, reliability gain,\nand energy consumption. Meanwhile, we find and derive that there is a maximum\ndistance between two nodes that can make CMs inevitably successful, and it is\nnamed the active distance of CMs. The research results analyze the performance\nof non-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks, and provide important references\nfor the future transmission of THz and mmWave signals in PBFT and RAFT\nnetworks.",

To address the core issue, we propose a technology that enables\nprogrammers to focus on design-level properties rather than specific low-level\nattack patterns. Our proposed technology, called Theorem-Carrying-Transaction\n(TCT), combines the benefits of runtime checking and symbolic proof. Under the\nTCT protocol, every transaction must carry a theorem that proves its adherence\nto the safety properties in the invoked contracts, and the blockchain checks\nthe proof before executing the transaction. The unique design of TCT ensures\nthat the theorems are provable and checkable in an efficient manner. We believe\nthat TCT holds a great promise for enabling provably secure smart contracts in\nthe future. As such, we call for collaboration toward this vision.",

            "summary": "Sharding scales throughput by splitting blockchain nodes into parallel\ngroups. However, different shards' independent and random scheduling for\ncross-shard transactions results in numerous conflicts and aborts, since\ncross-shard transactions from different shards may access the same account. A\ndeterministic ordering can eliminate conflicts by determining a global order\nfor transactions before processing, as proved in the database field.\nUnfortunately, due to the intertwining of the Byzantine environment and\ninformation isolation among shards, there is no trusted party able to\npredetermine such an order for cross-shard transactions. To tackle this\nchallenge, this paper proposes Prophet, a conflict-free sharding blockchain\nbased on Byzantine-tolerant deterministic ordering. It first depends on\nuntrusted self-organizing coalitions of nodes from different shards to\npre-execute cross-shard transactions for prerequisite information about\nordering. It then determines a trusted global order based on stateless ordering\nand post-verification for pre-executed results, through shard cooperation.\nFollowing the order, the shards thus orderly execute and commit transactions\nwithout conflicts. Prophet orchestrates the pre-execution, ordering, and\nexecution processes in the sharding consensus for minimal overhead. We\nrigorously prove the determinism and serializability of transactions under the\nByzantine and sharded environment. An evaluation of our prototype shows that\nProphet improves the throughput by $3.11\\times$ and achieves nearly no aborts\non 1 million Ethereum transactions compared with state-of-the-art sharding.",

DAOs typically emerge around\nthe management of decentralized financial applications and thus benefit from\nthe rapid growth of innovation in this sector. In response, global regulators\nincreasingly voice the intent to regulate these activities. This may impose an\nexcessive compliance burden on DAOs, unless they are deemed sufficiently\ndecentralized to be regulated. Yet, decentralization is an abstract concept\nwith scarce legal precedence. We investigate dimensions of decentralization\nthrough thematic analysis, combining extant literature with a series of expert\ninterviews. We propose a definition of 'sufficient decentralization' and\npresent a general framework for the assessment of decentralization. We derive\nfive dimensions for the assessment of decentralization in DAOs: Token-weighted\nvoting, Infrastructure, Governance, Escalation and Reputation. We present a\ndiscretionary sample application of the framework and five propositions on the\nfuture regulation and supervision of DAOs.

            "summary": "Blockchain has been used in several domains. However, this technology still\nhas major limitations that are largely related to one of its core components,\nnamely the consensus protocol/algorithm. Several solutions have been proposed\nin literature and some of them are based on the use of Machine Learning (ML)\nmethods. The ML-based consensus algorithms usually waste the work done by the\n(contributing/participating) nodes, as only winners' ML models are\nconsidered/used, resulting in low energy efficiency. To reduce energy waste and\nimprove scalability, this paper proposes an AI-enabled consensus algorithm\n(named AICons) driven by energy preservation and fairness of rewarding nodes\nbased on their contribution. In particular, the local ML models trained by all\nnodes are utilised to generate a global ML model for selecting winners, which\nreduces energy waste. Considering the fairness of the rewards, we innovatively\ndesigned a utility function for the Shapley value evaluation equation to\nevaluate the contribution of each node from three aspects, namely ML model\naccuracy, energy consumption, and network bandwidth. The three aspects are\ncombined into a single Shapley value to reflect the contribution of each node\nin a blockchain system. Extensive experiments were carried out to evaluate\nfairness, scalability, and profitability of the proposed solution. In\nparticular, AICons has an evenly distributed reward-contribution ratio across\nnodes, handling 38.4 more transactions per second, and allowing nodes to get\nmore profit to support a bigger network than the state-of-the-art schemes.",

In just a\nfew years, over 4,000 DAOs have been launched in various domains, such as\ninvestment, education, health, and research. Despite such rapid growth and\ndiversity, it is unclear how these DAOs actually work in practice and to what\nextent they are effective in achieving their goals. Given this, we aim to\nunpack how (well) DAOs work in practice. We conducted an in-depth analysis of a\ndiverse set of 10 DAOs of various categories and smart contracts, leveraging\non-chain (e.g., voting results) and off-chain data (e.g., community\ndiscussions) as well as our interviews with DAO organizers/members.\nSpecifically, we defined metrics to characterize key aspects of DAOs, such as\nthe degrees of decentralization and autonomy. We observed CompoundDAO,\nAssangeDAO, Bankless, and Krausehouse having poor decentralization in voting,\nwhile decentralization has improved over time for one-person-one-vote DAOs\n(e.g., Proof of Humanity). Moreover, the degree of autonomy varies among DAOs,\nwith some (e.g., Compound and Krausehouse) relying more on third parties than\nothers.

            "summary": "Context: Smart contracts are computerized self-executing contracts that\ncontain clauses, which are enforced once certain conditions are met. Smart\ncontracts are immutable by design and cannot be modified once deployed, which\nensures trustlessness. Despite smart contracts' immutability benefits,\nupgrading contract code is still necessary for bug fixes and potential feature\nimprovements. In the past few years, the smart contract community introduced\nseveral practices for upgrading smart contracts. Upgradeable contracts are\nsmart contracts that exhibit these practices and are designed with\nupgradeability in mind. During the upgrade process, a new smart contract\nversion is deployed with the desired modification, and subsequent user requests\nwill be forwarded to the latest version (upgraded contract). Nevertheless,\nlittle is known about the characteristics of the upgrading practices, how\ndevelopers apply them, and how upgrading impacts contract usage.\n  Objectives: This paper aims to characterize smart contract upgrading patterns\nand analyze their prevalence based on the deployed contracts that exhibit these\npatterns. Furthermore, we intend to investigate the reasons why developers\nupgrade contracts (e.g., introduce features, fix vulnerabilities) and how\nupgrades affect the adoption and life span of a contract in practice.\n  Method: We collect deployed smart contracts metadata and source codes to\nidentify contracts that exhibit certain upgrade patterns (upgradeable\ncontracts) based on a set of policies. Then we trace smart contract versions\nfor each upgradable contract and identify the changes in contract versions\nusing similarity and vulnerabilities detection tools. Finally, we plan to\nanalyze the impact of upgrading on contract usage based on the number of\ntransactions received and the lifetime of the contract version.",

To address these challenges, we propose a filter to limit the tip\npool size and to avoid referencing old blocks. Furthermore, we present\nexperimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of this filter in\nreducing the negative impacts of various attacks.

Despite this, the transaction fee mechanisms\ncurrently deployed in popular platforms as well as previous modeling attempts\nfor the associated mechanism design problem focus on an approach that favors\nincreasing prices in favor of those clients who value immediate service during\nperiods of congestion. To address this issue, we introduce a model that\ncaptures the traffic diversity of blockchain systems and a tiered pricing\nmechanism that is capable of implementing more inclusive transaction policies.\nIn this model, we demonstrate formally that EIP-1559, the transaction fee\nmechanism currently used in Ethereum, is not inclusive and demonstrate\nexperimentally that its prices surge horizontally during periods of congestion.\nOn the other hand, we prove formally that our mechanism achieves stable prices\nin expectation and we provide experimental results that establish that prices\nfor transactions can be kept low for low urgency transactions, resulting in a\ndiverse set of transaction types entering the blockchain. At the same time,\nperhaps surprisingly, our mechanism does not necessarily sacrifice revenue\nsince the lowering of the prices for low urgency transactions can be covered\nfrom high urgency ones due to the price discrimination ability of the\nmechanism.",

            "summary": "Coded computing has proved to be useful in distributed computing. We have\nobserved that almost all coded computing systems studied so far consider a\nsetup of one master and some workers. However, recently emerging technologies\nsuch as blockchain, internet of things, and federated learning introduce new\nrequirements for coded computing systems. In these systems, data is generated\nin a distributed manner, so central encoding/decoding by a master is not\nfeasible and scalable. This paper presents a fully distributed coded computing\nsystem that consists of $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ data owners and $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$\nworkers, where data owners employ workers to do some computations on their\ndata, as specified by a target function $f$ of degree $d\\in\\mathbb{N}$. As\nthere is no central encoder, workers perform encoding themselves, prior to\ncomputation phase. The challenge in this system is the presence of adversarial\ndata owners that do not know the data of honest data owners but cause\ndiscrepancies by sending different data to different workers, which is\ndetrimental to local encodings in workers. There are at most\n$\\beta\\in\\mathbb{N}$ adversarial data owners, and each sends at most\n$v\\in\\mathbb{N}$ different versions of data. Since the adversaries and their\npossibly colluded behavior are not known to workers and honest data owners,\nworkers compute tags of their received data, in addition to their main\ncomputational task, and send them to data owners to help them in decoding. We\nintroduce a tag function that allows data owners to partition workers into sets\nthat previously had received the same data from all data owners. Then, we\ncharacterize the fundamental limit of the system, $t^*$, which is the minimum\nnumber of workers whose work can be used to correctly calculate the desired\nfunction of data of honest data owners. We show that $t^*=v^{\\beta}d(K-1)+1$,\nand present converse and achievable proofs.",

Unfortunately, most federated\nlearning solutions cannot efficiently verify the execution of each\nparticipant's local machine learning model and protect the privacy of user\ndata, simultaneously. In this article, we first propose a Zero-Knowledge\nProof-based Federated Learning (ZKP-FL) scheme on blockchain. It leverages\nzero-knowledge proof for both the computation of local data and the aggregation\nof local model parameters, aiming to verify the computation process without\nrequiring the plaintext of the local data. We further propose a Practical\nZKP-FL (PZKP-FL) scheme to support fraction and non-linear operations.\nSpecifically, we explore a Fraction-Integer mapping function, and use Taylor\nexpansion to efficiently handle non-linear operations while maintaining the\naccuracy of the federated learning model. We also analyze the security of\nPZKP-FL. Performance analysis demonstrates that the whole running time of the\nPZKP-FL scheme is approximately less than one minute in parallel execution.",

The smart contract is a key part of blockchain systems and\nspecifies an agreement between transaction participants. Nowadays, smart\ncontracts are being deployed carrying residual faults, including severe\nvulnerabilities that lead to different types of failures at runtime. Fault\ndetection tools can be used to detect faults that may then be removed from the\ncode before deployment. However, in the case of smart contracts, the common\nopinion is that tools are immature and ineffective. In this work, we carry out\na fault injection campaign to empirically analyze the runtime impact that\nrealistic faults present in smart contracts may have on the reliability of\nblockchain systems. We place particular attention on the faults that elude\npopular smart contract verification tools and show if and in which ways the\nfaults lead the blockchain system to fail at runtime.

            "summary": "Many applications, e.g., digital twins, rely on sensing data from Internet of\nThings (IoT) networks, which is used to infer event(s) and initiate actions to\naffect an environment. This gives rise to concerns relating to data integrity\nand provenance. One possible solution to address these concerns is to employ\nblockchain. However, blockchain has high resource requirements, thereby making\nit unsuitable for use on resource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, this\npaper proposes a novel approach, called two-layer directed acyclic graph\n(2LDAG), whereby IoT devices only store a digital fingerprint of data generated\nby their neighbors. Further, it proposes a novel proof-of-path (PoP) protocol\nthat allows an operator or digital twin to verify data in an on-demand manner.\nThe simulation results show 2LDAG has storage and communication cost that is\nrespectively two and three orders of magnitude lower than traditional\nblockchain and also blockchains that use a DAG structure. Moreover, 2LDAG\nachieves consensus even when 49\\% of nodes are malicious.",

            "summary": "With the rising emergence of decentralized and opportunistic approaches to\nmachine learning, end devices are increasingly tasked with training deep\nlearning models on-devices using crowd-sourced data that they collect\nthemselves. These approaches are desirable from a resource consumption\nperspective and also from a privacy preservation perspective. When the devices\nbenefit directly from the trained models, the incentives are implicit -\ncontributing devices' resources are incentivized by the availability of the\nhigher-accuracy model that results from collaboration. However, explicit\nincentive mechanisms must be provided when end-user devices are asked to\ncontribute their resources (e.g., computation, communication, and data) to a\ntask performed primarily for the benefit of others, e.g., training a model for\na task that a neighbor device needs but the device owner is uninterested in. In\nthis project, we propose a novel blockchain-based incentive mechanism for\ncompletely decentralized and opportunistic learning architectures. We leverage\na smart contract not only for providing explicit incentives to end devices to\nparticipate in decentralized learning but also to create a fully decentralized\nmechanism to inspect and reflect on the behavior of the learning architecture.",

With\nthe advent of quantum computing, there are concerns regarding the vulnerability\nof this architecture against cyber-attacks. In this study, a potential threat\nis investigated in a blockchain-based VANET, and a corresponding quantum\ncyber-attack is developed. Specifically, a quantum impersonation attack using\nQuantum-Shor algorithm is developed to break the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)\nencrypted digital signatures of VANET and thus create a threat for the\ntrust-based blockchain scheme of VANET. A blockchain-based VANET,\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, and vehicular mobility are simulated\nusing OMNET++, the extended INET library, and vehicles-in-network simulation\n(VEINS) along with simulation of urban mobility (SUMO), respectively. A small\nkey RSA based message encryption is implemented using IBM Qiskit, which is an\nopen-source quantum software development kit. The findings reveal that the\nquantum cyber-attack, example, impersonation attack is able to successfully\nbreak the trust chain of a blockchain-based VANET.

            "summary": "MANET is a collection of mobile nodes that communicate through wireless\nnetworks as they move from one point to another. MANET is an\ninfrastructure-less network with a changeable topology; as a result, it is very\nsusceptible to attacks. MANET attack prevention represents a serious\ndifficulty. Malicious network nodes are the source of network-based attacks. In\na MANET, attacks can take various forms, and each one alters the network's\noperation in its unique way. In general, attacks can be separated into two\ncategories: those that target the data traffic on a network and those that\ntarget the control traffic. This article explains the many sorts of assaults,\ntheir impact on MANET, and the MANET-based defence measures that are currently\nin place. The suggested SRA that employs blockchain technology (SRABC) protects\nMANET from attacks and authenticates nodes. The secure routing algorithm (SRA)\nproposed by blockchain technology safeguards control and data flow against\nthreats. This is achieved by generating a Hash Function for every transaction.\nWe will begin by discussing the security of the MANET. This article's second\nsection explores the role of blockchain in MANET security. In the third\nsection, the SRA is described in connection with blockchain. In the fourth\nphase, PDR and Throughput are utilised to conduct an SRA review using\nBlockchain employing PDR and Throughput. The results suggest that the proposed\ntechnique enhances MANET security while concurrently decreasing delay. The\nperformance of the proposed technique is analysed and compared to the routing\nprotocols Q-AODV and DSR.",

A primary characteristic of smart\ncontracts on the Ethereum blockchain is that they are immutable once\nimplemented, no changes can be made. Taking human error into account, as well\nas technology improvements and newly discovered vulnerabilities, there has been\na need to upgrade these smart contracts, which may hold enormous amounts of\nEther and hence become the target of attacks. Several such attacks have caused\ntremendous losses in the past, as well as millions of dollars in Ether which\nhas been locked away in broken contracts. Thus far we have collected many\nupgradable proxy patterns and studied their features to build a comprehensive\ncatalog of patterns. We present a summary of these upgradable proxy patterns\nwhich we collected and studied. We scraped the source code for approximately\n100000 verified contracts from Etherscan.io, the most popular block explorer\nfor Ethereum, out of which we extracted around 64k unique files - most\ncontaining multiple contracts. We have begun to automate the analysis of these\ncontracts using the popular static analysis tool Slither, while at the same\ntime implementing much more robust detection of upgradable proxies using this\nframework. Comparing the results of the original implementation to our own, we\nhave found that approximately 70 percent of the contracts which were initially\nflagged as upgradeable proxies are false positives which we have eliminated.",

In this paper, we propose a\nMetric-Based Feedback Methodology (MBFM) that integrates bug bounty programs\nwith threat modelling to improve the overall security posture of an\norganization. By analyzing and categorizing vulnerability data, the methodology\nenables identifying root causes and refining threat models to prioritize\nsecurity efforts more effectively. The paper outlines the proposed methodology\nand its assumptions and provides a foundation for future research to develop\nthe methodology into a versatile framework. Further research should focus on\nautomating the process, integrating additional security testing approaches, and\nleveraging machine learning algorithms for vulnerability prediction and\nteam-specific recommendations.",

To address these issues, we propose to change the foundation of\nblockchain-based process enactment: from on-chain smart contracts to state\nchannels, an overlay network on top of a blockchain. State channels allow\nconducting most transactions off-chain while mostly retaining the core security\nproperties offered by blockchain. Our proposal, process channels, is a\nmodel-driven approach to enacting processes on state channels, with the aim to\nretain the desired blockchain properties while reducing the on-chain footprint\nas much as possible. We here focus on the principled approach of state channels\nas a platform, to enable manifold future optimizations in various directions,\nlike latency and confidentiality. We implement our approach prototypical and\nevaluate it both qualitatively (w.r.t. assumptions and guarantees) and\nquantitatively (w.r.t. correctness and gas cost). In short, while the initial\ndeployment effort is higher with state channels, it typically pays off after a\nfew process instances; and as long as the new assumptions hold, so do the\nguarantees.",

For example, in the US and in the EU, identification and\nposition broadcasting is already a requirement for the use of drones. However,\nthe current solutions do not validate the position of the UAV but its identity,\nwhile trusting the given position. Therefore, a more advanced solution enabling\nthe proof of location is needed to avoid spoofing. We propose the combination\nof a permissioned blockchain managed by public authorities together with\nUWB-based communication to approach this. Specifically, we leverage the\nidentity management tools from Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned\nblockchain framework, and ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging, leading to situated\ncommunication (i.e., simultaneous communication and localization). This\napproach allows us to prove both the UAV identity and also the location it\nbroadcasts through interaction with ground infrastructure in known locations.\nOur initial experiments show that the proposed approach is viable and UWB\ntransceivers can be used for UAVs to validate both their identity and position\nwith ground infrastructure deployed in known locations.",

As the amount of patient data grows, it has\nbecome increasingly challenging to protect patients' privacy. Patient data is\ncommonly stored in the cloud, making it difficult for users to control and\nprotect their information. Moreover, the recent rise in security and\nsurveillance breaches in the healthcare industry has highlighted the need for a\nbetter approach to data storage and protection. Traditional models that rely on\nthird-party control over patients' healthcare data are no longer reliable, as\nthey have proven vulnerable to security breaches. To address these issues,\nblockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution. Blockchain-based\nprotocols have the potential to provide a secure and efficient system for\ne-health applications that does not require trust in third-party\nintermediaries. The proposed protocol outlined in this paper uses a\nblockchain-based approach to manage patient data securely and efficiently.\nUnlike Bitcoin, which is primarily used for financial transactions, the\nprotocol described here is designed specifically for e-health applications. It\nemploys a consensus mechanism that is more suitable for resource constrained\nIoT devices, thereby reducing network costs and increasing efficiency. The\nproposed protocol also provides a privacy-preserving access control mechanism\nthat enables patients to have more control over their healthcare data. By\nleveraging blockchain technology, the protocol ensures that only authorized\nindividuals can access the patient's data, which helps prevent data breaches\nand other security issues. Finally, the security and privacy of the proposed\nprotocol are analysed to ensure that it meets the necessary standards for data\nprotection.",

            "summary": "Systems and blockchains often have security vulnerabilities and can be\nattacked by adversaries, with potentially significant negative consequences.\nTherefore, infrastructure providers increasingly rely on bug bounty programs,\nwhere external individuals probe the system and report any vulnerabilities\n(bugs) in exchange for rewards (bounty). We develop a simple contest model of\nbug bounty. A group of individuals of arbitrary size is invited to undertake a\ncostly search for bugs. The individuals differ with regard to their abilities,\nwhich we capture by different costs to achieve a certain probability to find\nbugs if any exist. Costs are private information. We study equilibria of the\ncontest and characterize the optimal design of bug bounty schemes. In\nparticular, the designer can vary the size of the group of individuals invited\nto search, add a paid expert, insert an artificial bug with some probability,\nand pay multiple prizes.",

            "summary": "Multi-party business processes rely on the collaboration of various players\nin a decentralized setting. Blockchain technology can facilitate the automation\nof these processes, even in cases where trust among participants is limited.\nTransactions are stored in a ledger, a replica of which is retained by every\nnode of the blockchain network. The operations saved thereby are thus publicly\naccessible. While this enhances transparency, reliability, and persistence, it\nhinders the utilization of public blockchains for process automation as it\nviolates typical confidentiality requirements in corporate settings. In this\npaper, we propose MARTSIA: A Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems\nfor Interoperating Applications. MARTSIA enables precise control over process\ndata at the level of message parts. Based on Multi-Authority Attribute-Based\nEncryption (MA-ABE), MARTSIA realizes a number of desirable properties,\nincluding confidentiality, transparency, and auditability. We implemented our\napproach in proof-of-concept prototypes, with which we conduct a case study in\nthe area of supply chain management. Also, we show the integration of MARTSIA\nwith a state-of-the-art blockchain-based process execution engine to secure the\ndata flow.",

            "summary": "The use of blockchains for automated and adversarial trading has become\ncommonplace. However, due to the transparent nature of blockchains, an\nadversary is able to observe any pending, not-yet-mined transactions, along\nwith their execution logic. This transparency further enables a new type of\nadversary, which copies and front-runs profitable pending transactions in\nreal-time, yielding significant financial gains.\n  Shedding light on such \"copy-paste\" malpractice, this paper introduces the\nBlockchain Imitation Game and proposes a generalized imitation attack\nmethodology called Ape. Leveraging dynamic program analysis techniques, Ape\nsupports the automatic synthesis of adversarial smart contracts. Over a\ntimeframe of one year (1st of August, 2021 to 31st of July, 2022), Ape could\nhave yielded 148.96M USD in profit on Ethereum, and 42.70M USD on BNB Smart\nChain (BSC).\n  Not only as a malicious attack, we further show the potential of transaction\nand contract imitation as a defensive strategy. Within one year, we find that\nApe could have successfully imitated 13 and 22 known Decentralized Finance\n(DeFi) attacks on Ethereum and BSC, respectively. Our findings suggest that\nblockchain validators can imitate attacks in real-time to prevent intrusions in\nDeFi.",

When transaction\nfees become miners' primary revenue, an imbalance in reward may lead to miners\nadopting deviant mining strategies. Scaling the block capacity is one of the\npotential approaches to alleviate the problem. To address this issue, this\npaper reviews and evaluates six state-of-the-art compression protocols for\nBlockchains. Specifically, we designed a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate two\nof the six protocols to observe their compression performance under larger\nblock capacities. Furthermore, extensive simulation experiments were conducted\nto observe the mining behaviour when the block capacity is increased.\nExperimental results reveal an interesting trade-off between volatility and\nscalability. When the throughput is higher than a critical point, it worsens\nthe volatility and threatens Blockchain security. In the experiments, we\nfurther analyzed the relationship between volatility and scalability properties\nwith respect to the distribution of transaction values. Based on the analysis\nresults, we proposed the recommended maximum block size for each protocol. At\nlast, we discuss the further improvement of the compression protocols.",

However,\nexisting sharding solutions use locks for transaction isolation which lowers\nthe system throughput and may introduce deadlocks. In this paper, we propose a\nlockless transaction method for ensuring transaction isolation without using\nlocks, which improves the concurrency and throughput of the transactions. In\nour method, transactions are split into subtransactions to enable parallel\nprocessing in multiple shards. We use versions for the transaction accounts to\nimplement consistency among the shards. We provide formal proof for liveness\nand correctness. We also evaluate experimentally our proposed protocol and\ncompare the execution time and throughput with lock-based approaches. The\nexperiments show that the transaction execution time is considerably shorter\nthan the lock-based time and near to the ideal (no-lock) execution time.",

            "summary": "Synchronization of transaction pools (mempools) has shown potential for\nimproving the performance and block propagation delay of state-of-the-art\nblockchains. Indeed, various heuristics have been proposed in the literature to\nthis end, all of which incorporate exchanges of unconfirmed transactions into\ntheir block propagation protocol. In this work, we take a different approach,\nmaintaining transaction synchronization outside (and independently) of the\nblock propagation channel. In the process, we formalize the synchronization\nproblem within a graph theoretic framework and introduce a novel algorithm\n(SREP - Set Reconciliation-Enhanced Propagation) with quantifiable guarantees.\nWe analyze the algorithm's performance for various realistic network\ntopologies, and show that it converges on any connected graph in a number of\nsteps that is bounded by the diameter of the graph. We confirm our analytical\nfindings through extensive simulations that include comparison with\nMempoolSync, a recent approach from the literature. Our simulations show that\nSREP incurs reasonable overall bandwidth overhead and, unlike MempoolSync,\nscales gracefully with the size of the network.",

            "summary": "Distributed ledger systems have become more prominent and successful in\nrecent years, with a focus on blockchains and cryptocurrency. This has led to\nvarious misunderstandings about both the technology itself and its\ncapabilities, as in many cases blockchain and cryptocurrency is used\nsynonymously and other applications are often overlooked. Therefore, as a\nwhole, the view of distributed ledger technology beyond blockchains and\ncryptocurrencies is very limited. Existing vocabularies and ontologies often\nfocus on single aspects of the technology, or in some cases even just on one\nproduct. This potentially leads to other types of distributed ledgers and their\npossible use cases being neglected. In this paper, we present a knowledge graph\nand an ontology for distributed ledger technologies, which includes security\nconsiderations to model aspects such as threats and vulnerabilities,\napplication domains, as well as relevant standards and regulations. Such a\nknowledge graph improves the overall understanding of distributed ledgers,\nreveals their strengths, and supports the work of security personnel, i.e.\nanalysts and system architects. We discuss potential uses and follow semantic\nweb best practices to evaluate and publish the ontology and knowledge graph.",

We find that a large amount of pricing\ninformation is contained in on-chain data, but that it is generally hard to\nrecover precise prices except on short time scales of retraining the model.

In this paper, we\nformulate a joint optimization model with three metrics, namely latency,\nsecurity, and computational cost, that are particularly important for\nIoT-enabled healthcare. However, it is computationally intractable to identify\nthe exact optimal solution of this problem for practical sized systems. Thus,\nwe propose an algorithm called the Adaptive Discrete Particle Swarm Algorithm\n(ADPSA) to obtain near-optimal solutions in a low-complexity manner. With its\nroots in the classical Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, our\nproposed ADPSA can effectively manage the numerous binary and integer variables\nin the formulation.

In the\ntraditional money laundering scenario, researchers have uncovered the prevalent\ntraits of money laundering. However, since money laundering on Ethereum is an\nemerging means, little is known about money laundering on Ethereum. To fill the\ngap, in this paper, we conduct an in-depth study on Ethereum money laundering\nnetworks through the lens of a representative security event on \\textit{Upbit\nExchange} to explore whether money laundering on Ethereum has traditional\ntraits. Specifically, we construct a money laundering network on Ethereum by\ncrawling the transaction records of \\textit{Upbit Hack}. Then, we present five\nquestions based on the traditional traits of money laundering networks. By\nleveraging network analysis, we characterize the money laundering network on\nEthereum and answer these questions.

Practical Byzantine Fault\nTolerance (PBFT) is seen as the most applicable consensus mechanism in\nblockchain-enabled wireless networks. However, previous studies on PBFT do not\nconsider the channel performance of the physical layer, such as path loss and\nchannel fading, resulting in research results that are far from real networks.\nAdditionally, 6G communications will widely deploy high frequency signals such\nas millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz), while the performance of PBFT\nis still unknown when these signals are transmitted in wireless PBFT networks.\nTherefore, it is urgent to study the performance of non-ideal wireless PBFT\nnetworks with mmWave and THz siganls, so as to better make PBFT play a role in\n6G era. In this paper, we study and compare the performance of mmWave and THz\nsignals in non-ideal wireless PBFT networks, considering Rayleigh Fading (RF)\nand close-in Free Space (FS) reference distance path loss. Performance is\nevaluated by consensus success rate and delay. Meanwhile, we find and derive\nthat there is a maximum distance between two nodes that can make PBFT consensus\ninevitably successful, and it is named active distance of PBFT in this paper.\nThe research results not only analyze the performance of non-ideal wireless\nPBFT networks, but also provide an important reference for the future\ntransmission of mmWave and THz signals in PBFT networks.",

We show this gap is positive under a\nsimple model with mild assumptions where we assume transactions are, roughly\nspeaking, uniformly drawn from a reasonable distribution.

As any computer program, smart contracts are subject to the\npresence of residual faults, including severe security vulnerabilities, which\nrequire that the vulnerable contract is terminated in the blockchain. In this\ncontext, research began to be developed to prevent the deployment of smart\ncontract holding vulnerabilities, mostly in the form of vulnerability detection\ntools. Along with these efforts, several and heterogeneous vulnerability\nclassification schemes arised (e.g., most notably DASP and SWC). At the time of\nwriting, these are mostly outdated initiatives, despite the fact that smart\ncontract vulnerabilities are continuously being discovered and the associated\nrich information being mostly disregarded. In this paper, we propose OpenSCV, a\nnew and Open hierarchical taxonomy for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, which is\nopen to community contributions and matches the current state of the practice,\nwhile being prepared to handle future modifications and evolution. The taxonomy\nwas built based on the analysis of research on vulnerability classification,\ncommunity-maintained classification schemes, and research on smart contract\nvulnerability detection. We show how OpenSCV covers the announced detection\nability of current vulnerability detection tools, and highlight its usefulness\nas a resource in smart contract vulnerability research.",

            "summary": "As all software, blockchain nodes are exposed to faults in their underlying\nexecution stack. Unstable execution environments can disrupt the availability\nof blockchain nodes interfaces, resulting in downtime for users. This paper\nintroduces the concept of N-version Blockchain nodes. This new type of node\nrelies on simultaneous execution of different implementations of the same\nblockchain protocol, in the line of Avizienis' N-version programming vision. We\ndesign and implement an N-version blockchain node prototype in the context of\nEthereum, called N-ETH. We show that N-ETH is able to mitigate the effects of\nunstable execution environments and significantly enhance availability under\nenvironment faults. To simulate unstable execution environments, we perform\nfault injection at the system-call level. Our results show that existing\nEthereum node implementations behave asymmetrically under identical instability\nscenarios. N-ETH leverages this asymmetric behavior available in the diverse\nimplementations of Ethereum nodes to provide increased availability, even under\nour most aggressive fault-injection strategies. We are the first to validate\nthe relevance of N-version design in the domain of blockchain infrastructure.\nFrom an industrial perspective, our results are of utmost importance for\nbusinesses operating blockchain nodes, including Google, ConsenSys, and many\nother major blockchain companies.",

One way to reduce message complexity is to\nrandomly assign network nodes into committees or shards. Keeping committee\nsizes small is then desirable in order to achieve lower message complexity, but\nthis comes with a penalty of reduced reliability as there is a higher\nprobability that a large number of faulty nodes will end up in a committee.

            "summary": "Smart contracts are programs deployed on a blockchain and are immutable once\ndeployed. Reentrancy, one of the most important vulnerabilities in smart\ncontracts, has caused millions of dollars in financial loss. Many reentrancy\ndetection approaches have been proposed. It is necessary to investigate the\nperformance of these approaches to provide useful guidelines for their\napplication. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on the\ncapability of five well-known or recent reentrancy detection tools such as\nMythril and Sailfish. We collect 230,548 verified smart contracts from\nEtherscan and use detection tools to analyze 139,424 contracts after\ndeduplication, which results in 21,212 contracts with reentrancy issues. Then,\nwe manually examine the defective functions located by the tools in the\ncontracts. From the examination results, we obtain 34 true positive contracts\nwith reentrancy and 21,178 false positive contracts without reentrancy. We also\nanalyze the causes of the true and false positives. Finally, we evaluate the\ntools based on the two kinds of contracts. The results show that more than\n99.8% of the reentrant contracts detected by the tools are false positives with\neight types of causes, and the tools can only detect the reentrancy issues\ncaused by call.value(), 58.8% of which can be revealed by the Ethereum's\nofficial IDE, Remix. Furthermore, we collect real-world reentrancy attacks\nreported in the past two years and find that the tools fail to find any issues\nin the corresponding contracts. Based on the findings, existing works on\nreentrancy detection appear to have very limited capability, and researchers\nshould turn the rudder to discover and detect new reentrancy patterns except\nthose related to call.value().",

            "summary": "Smart contracts are self-executing programs on a blockchain to ensure\nimmutable and transparent agreements without the involvement of intermediaries.\nDespite the growing popularity of smart contracts for many blockchain platforms\nlike Ethereum, smart contract developers cannot prevent copying their smart\ncontracts from competitors due to the absence of technical means available.\nHowever, applying existing software watermarking techniques is challenging\nbecause of the unique properties of smart contracts, such as a code size\nconstraint, non-free execution cost, and no support for dynamic allocation\nunder a virtual machine environment. This paper introduces a novel software\nwatermarking scheme, dubbed SmartMark, aiming to protect the piracy of smart\ncontracts. SmartMark builds the control flow graph of a target contract runtime\nbytecode and locates a series of bytes randomly selected from a collection of\nopcodes to represent a watermark. We implement a full-fledged prototype for\nEthereum, applying SmartMark to 27,824 unique smart contract bytecodes. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that SmartMark can effectively embed a watermark\ninto smart contracts and verify its presence, meeting the requirements of\ncredibility and imperceptibility while incurring a slight performance\ndegradation. Furthermore, our security analysis shows that SmartMark is\nresilient against foreseeable watermarking corruption attacks; e.g., a large\nnumber of dummy opcodes are needed to disable a watermark effectively,\nresulting in producing illegitimate smart contract clones that are not\neconomical.",

While this paradigm partly mitigates the\nprivacy issues of users' sensitive data, the performance of the FL process can\nbe threatened and reached a bottleneck due to the growing cyber threats and\nprivacy violation techniques. To expedite the proliferation of FL process, the\nintegration of blockchain for FL environments has drawn prolific attention from\nthe people of academia and industry.

This can seriously hinder the widespread deployment of\nthe metaverse. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) is a solution to the above\nproblems. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm with privacy-preserving\nfeatures designed for a large number of edge devices. Federated learning for\nmetaverse (FL4M) will be a powerful tool. Because FL allows edge devices to\nparticipate in training tasks locally using their own data, computational\npower, and model-building capabilities. Applying FL to the metaverse not only\nprotects the data privacy of participants but also reduces the need for high\ncomputing power and high memory on servers. Until now, there have been many\nstudies about FL and the metaverse, respectively. In this paper, we review some\nof the early advances of FL4M, which will be a research direction with\nunlimited development potential. We first introduce the concepts of metaverse\nand FL, respectively. Besides, we discuss the convergence of key metaverse\ntechnologies and FL in detail, such as big data, communication technology, the\nInternet of Things, edge computing, blockchain, and extended reality.

            "summary": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a type of digital asset that represents a\nproof of ownership over a particular digital item such as art, music, or real\nestate. Due to the non-fungible nature of NFTs, duplicate tokens should not\npossess the same value. However, with the surge of new blockchains and a\nmassive influx of NFTs being created, a wealth of NFT data is being generated\nwithout a method of tracking similarity. This enables people to create almost\nidentical NFTs by changing one pixel or one byte of data. Despite the\nsimilarity among NFTs, each NFT is assigned a completely different token ID. To\naddress the NFT duplication issue, we developed a modular, easily-extendable,\nhardware-agnostic, cloud-centered NFT processing system that represents NFTs as\nvectors. We established a database containing a vector representation of the\nNFTs in accordance with the Ethereum Request for Comment 721 (ERC-721) token\nstandards to initiate the process of aggregating NFT data from various\nblockchains. Finally, we developed an NFT visualization dashboard application\nwith a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to provide non-technical\nusers access to the aggregated NFT data. The Universal NFT Vector Database is\nan off-chain framework for NFT data aggregation based on similarity, which\nprovides an organized way to query and analyze NFT data that was previously\nunavailable through on-chain solutions.",

The second phase of World Wide Web, named\nWeb 2.0, has been extensively attracting worldwide people that participate in\nbuilding and enjoying the virtual world. Nowadays, the next internet\nrevolution: Web3 is going to open new opportunities for traditional social\nmodels. The decentralization property of Web3 is capable of breaking the\nmonopoly of the internet companies. Moreover, Web3 will lead a paradigm shift\nfrom the Web as a publishing medium to a medium of interaction and\nparticipation. This change will deeply transform the relations among users and\nplatforms, forces and relations of production, and the global economy.\nTherefore, it is necessary that we technically, practically, and more broadly\ntake an overview of Web3. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of\nWeb3, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and\noutlook. This article first introduces several major technologies of Web3.\nThen, we illustrate the type of Web3 applications in detail. Blockchain and\nsmart contracts ensure that decentralized organizations will be less trusted\nand more truthful than that centralized organizations. Decentralized finance\nwill be global, and open with financial inclusiveness for unbanked people. This\npaper also discusses the relationship between the Metaverse and Web3, as well\nas the differences and similarities between Web 3.0 and Web3. Inspired by the\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs theory, we further conduct a novel hierarchy of\nneeds theory within Web3. Finally, several worthwhile future research\ndirections of Web3 are discussed.",

Yet, a major ongoing challenge is to make BFT\nconsensus applicable to large-scale environments. A large body of recent work\naddresses this challenge by developing novel ideas to improve the scalability\nof BFT consensus, thus opening the path for a new generation of BFT protocols\ntailored to the needs of blockchain. In this survey, we create a\nsystematization of knowledge about the novel scalability-enhancing techniques\nthat state-of-the-art BFT consensus protocols use.

These types of\napplications require a high level of security that is hard to achieve due to\nthe transparency of public blockchains. Numerous tools support developers and\nauditors in the task of detecting weaknesses. As a young technology,\nblockchains and utilities evolve fast, making it challenging for tools and\ndevelopers to keep up with the pace.\n  In this work, we study the robustness of code analysis tools and the\nevolution of weakness detection on a dataset representing six years of\nblockchain activity. We focus on Ethereum as the crypto ecosystem with the\nlargest number of developers and deployed programs. We investigate the behavior\nof single tools as well as the agreement of several tools addressing similar\nweaknesses.\n  Our study is the first that is based on the entire body of deployed bytecode\non Ethereum's main chain. We achieve this coverage by considering bytecodes as\nequivalent if they share the same skeleton. The skeleton of a bytecode is\nobtained by omitting functionally irrelevant parts. This reduces the 48 million\ncontracts deployed on Ethereum up to January 2022 to 248328 contracts with\ndistinct skeletons. For bulk execution, we utilize the open-source framework\nSmartBugs that facilitates the analysis of Solidity smart contracts, and\nenhance it to accept also bytecode as the only input. Moreover, we integrate\nsix further tools for bytecode analysis. The execution of the 12 tools included\nin our study on the dataset took 30 CPU years.

However, as a significant\ndrawback in comparison to centralized business process orchestration, smart\ncontract state typically leaks potentially sensitive information about the\nstate of the collaboration.\n  We describe a novel approach where the process manager smart contract only\nstores cryptographic commitments to the state and checks zero-knowledge proofs\non update proposals.

            "summary": "In the present academic landscape, the process of collecting data is slow,\nand the lax infrastructures for data collaborations lead to significant delays\nin coming up with and disseminating conclusive findings. Therefore, there is an\nincreasing need for a secure, scalable, and trustworthy data-sharing ecosystem\nthat promotes and rewards collaborative data-sharing efforts among researchers,\nand a robust incentive mechanism is required to achieve this objective.\nReputation-based incentives, such as the h-index, have historically played a\npivotal role in the academic community. However, the h-index suffers from\nseveral limitations. This paper introduces the SCIENCE-index, a\nblockchain-based metric measuring a researcher's scientific contributions.\nUtilizing the Microsoft Academic Graph and machine learning techniques, the\nSCIENCE-index predicts the progress made by a researcher over their career and\nprovides a soft incentive for sharing their datasets with peer researchers. To\nincentivize researchers to share their data, the SCIENCE-index is augmented to\ninclude a data-sharing parameter. DataCite, a database of openly available\ndatasets, proxies this parameter, which is further enhanced by including a\nresearcher's data-sharing activity. Our model is evaluated by comparing the\ndistribution of its output for geographically diverse researchers to that of\nthe h-index. We observe that it results in a much more even spread of\nevaluations. The SCIENCE-index is a crucial component in constructing a\ndecentralized protocol that promotes trust-based data sharing, addressing the\ncurrent inequity in dataset sharing. The work outlined in this paper provides\nthe foundation for assessing scientific contributions in future data-sharing\nspaces powered by decentralized applications.",

The\ndistributed character of the platform, together with the \"randomness\" or \"luck\"\nfactor that both proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS) provide when\nelecting the next block proposer, pushed the industry to model and improve the\nreward system of the system. With several improvements to predict PoW block\nproposal rewards and to maximize the extractable rewards of the same ones, the\nultimate Ethereum's transition to PoS applied in the Paris Hard-Fork, more\ngenerally known as \"The Merge\", has meant a significant modification on the\nreward system in the platform. In this paper, we aim to break down both\ntheoretically and empirically the new reward system in this post-merge era. We\npresent a highly detailed description of the different rewards and their share\namong validators' rewards. Ultimately, we offer a study that uses the presented\nreward model to analyze the performance of the network during this transition.",

Our method utilizes Google\nBlockly, a visual programming language, to make updating NFT metadata more\naccessible and engaging for young learners. By leveraging a familiar and\nengaging visual programming language, students can develop their computational\nthinking skills and explore blockchain technology in a fun and intuitive way.\nThe paper discusses the benefits of using NFTs as a learning tool, including\nhow they can help students understand the concept of digital ownership and\nvalue.

Without trusted third parties, their execution is\nnot controlled by entities exercising centralized coordination but is instead\nrealized through technologies supporting distribution such as blockchains and\nserverless computing.

This paper extends an approach for execution and instance tracking\non blockchains and cloud platforms permitting distributed parties to observe\nthe instances and states of executable models. The approach is extended with\n(1.) a metamodel describing the concepts for instance tracking on cloud\nplatforms independent of concrete models or implementation, (2.) a\nmultidimensional data model realizing the concepts accordingly, permitting the\nverifiable storage, tracking, and analysis of execution states for distributed\nparties, and (3.) an implementation on the Ethereum blockchain and Amazon Web\nServices (AWS) using state machine models. Towards supporting decentralized\napplications with high scalability and distribution requirements, the approach\nestablishes a consistent view on instances for distributed parties to track and\nanalyze the execution along multiple dimensions such as specific clients and\nexecution engines.",

A central primitive in P2P networks is the peer selection algorithm,\nwhich decides how a node should select a fixed number of neighbors to connect\nwith. In this paper, we consider the design of a peer-selection algorithm for\nunstructured P2P networks with the goal of minimizing the broadcast latency. We\npropose Goldfish, a novel solution that dynamically decides the neighbor set by\nexploiting the past experiences as well as exploring new neighbors. The key\ntechnical contributions come from bringing ideas of matrix completion for\nestimating message delivery times for every possible message for every peer\never connected, and a streaming algorithm to efficiently perform the estimation\nwhile achieving good performance. The matrix completion interpolates the\ndelivery times to all virtual connections in order to select the best\ncombination of neighbors. Goldfish employs a streaming algorithm that only uses\na short recent memory to finish matrix interpolation. When the number of\npublishing source is equal to a node's maximal number of connections, Goldfish\nfound the global optimal solution with 92.7% probability by exploring every\nnode only once. In more complex situations where nodes are publishing based on\nexponential distribution and adjusting connection in real time, we compare\nGoldfish with a baseline peer selection system, and show Goldfish saves\napproximately 14.5% less time under real world geolocation and propagation\nlatency.",

Many modern\ndistributed systems are naturally permissionless, in the sense that a central\npermissioning authority would defeat their design purpose: this includes\nblockchains, filesharing protocols, some voting systems, and more. By their\npermissionless nature, such systems are heterogeneous: participants may only\nhave a partial view of the system, and they may also have different goals and\nbeliefs. Thus, the traditional notion of consensus -- i.e. system-wide\nagreement -- may not be adequate, and we may need to generalise it.\n  This is a challenge: how should we understand what heterogeneous consensus\nis; what mathematical framework might this require; and how can we use this to\nbuild understanding and mathematical models of robust, effective, and secure\npermissionless systems in practice?\n  We analyse heterogeneous consensus using semitopology as a framework. This is\nlike topology, but without the restriction that intersections of opens be open.\n  Semitopologies have a rich theory which is related to topology, but with its\nown distinct character and mathematics. We introduce novel well-behavedness\nconditions, including an anti-Hausdorff property and a new notion of `topen\nset', and we show how these structures relate to consensus. We give a\nrestriction of semitopologies to witness semitopologies, which are an\nalgorithmically tractable subclass corresponding to Horn clause theories,\nhaving particularly good mathematical properties. We introduce and study\nseveral other basic notions that are specific and novel to semitopologies, and\nstudy how known quantities in topology, such as dense subsets and closures,\ndisplay interesting and useful new behaviour in this new semitopological\ncontext.",

Blockchain-based IOPC can establish trusted data sharing\namong participants, attracting more and more attention. The core of such study\nis to translate the graphical model (e.g., BPMN) into program code called smart\ncontract that can be executed in the blockchain environment. In this context, a\nproper smart contract plays a vital role in the correct implementation of\nblock-chain-based IOPC. In fact, the quality of graphical model affects the\nsmart con-tract generation. Problematic models (e.g., deadlock) will result in\nincorrect contracts (causing unexpected behaviours). To avoid this undesired\nimplementation, this paper explores to generate smart contracts by using the\nverified formal model as input instead of graphical model. Specifically, we\nintroduce a prototype framework that supports the automatic generation of smart\ncontracts, providing an end-to-end solution from modeling, verification,\ntranslation to implementation. One of the cores of this framework is to provide\na CSP#-based formalization for the BPMN collaboration model from the\nperspective of message interaction. This formalization provides precise\nexecution semantics and model verification for graphical models, and a verified\nformal model for smart contract generation. Another novelty is that it\nintroduces a syntax tree-based translation algorithm to directly map the formal\nmodel into a smart contract. The required formalism, verification and\ntranslation techniques are transparent to users without imposing additional\nburdens. Finally, a set of experiments shows the effectiveness of the\nframework.",

By adopting a bounded\nbandwidth model to capture congestion, and through an improved analysis method,\nwe identify the resilience of PoW NC for a given block production rate. In PoS,\nwe augment our attack with equivocations to further increase congestion, making\nthe vanilla PoS NC protocol insecure against any adversarial power except at\nvery low block production rates.

In the blockchain-backed Web3 communities, known\nfor their transparency and security, airdrop serves as a widespread incentive\nmechanism for allocating capital and power. However, it remains a controversy\non how to justify airdrop to incentive and empower the decentralized\ngovernance. In this paper, we use ParaSwap as an example to propose a role\ntaxonomy methodology through a data-driven study to understand the\ncharacteristic of community members and the effectiveness of airdrop. We find\nthat users receive more rewards tend to take positive actions towards the\ncommunity. We summarize several arbitrage patterns and confirm the current\ndetection is not sufficient in screening out airdrop hunters. In conjunction\nwith the results, we discuss from the aspects of interaction, financialization,\nand system design to conclude the challenges and possible research directions\nfor decentralized communities.",

            "summary": "The network economical sharing economy, with direct exchange as a core\ncharacteristic, is implemented both, on a commons and platform economical\nbasis. This is due to a gain in importance of trust, collaborative consumption\nand democratic management as well as technological progress, in the form of\nnear zero marginal costs, open source contributions and digital transformation.\nConcurrent to these commons-based drivers, the grey area between commerce and\nprivate exchange is used to exploit work, safety and tax regulations by central\nplatform economists. Instead of central intermediators, the blockchain\ntechnology makes decentralized consensus finding, using Proof-of-Work (PoW)\nwithin a self-sustaining Peer-to-Peer network, possible. Therefore, a\nblockchain-based open source mediation seems to offer a commons-compatible\nimplementation of the sharing economy. This thesis is investigated through a\nqualitative case study of Sardex and Interlace with their blockchain\napplication, based on expert interviews and a structured content analysis. To\ndetect the most commons-compatible implementation, the different implementation\noptions through conventional platform intermediators, an open source blockchain\nwith PoW as well as Interlaces' permissioned blockchain approach, are compared.\nThe following confrontation is based on deductive criteria, which illustrates\nthe inherent characteristics of a commons-based sharing economy.",

Due to the decentralization and anonymity of Ethereum, Ponzi schemes\nhave been easily deployed and caused significant losses to investors. However,\nthere are still no explainable and effective methods to help investors easily\nidentify Ponzi schemes and validate whether a smart contract is actually a\nPonzi scheme. To fill the research gap, we propose PonziLens, a novel\nvisualization approach to help investors achieve early identification of Ponzi\nschemes by investigating the operation codes of smart contracts. Specifically,\nwe conduct symbolic execution of opcode and extract the control flow for\ninvesting and rewarding with critical opcode instructions. Then, an intuitive\ndirected-graph based visualization is proposed to display the investing and\nrewarding flows and the crucial execution paths, enabling easy identification\nof Ponzi schemes on Ethereum. Two usage scenarios involving both Ponzi and\nnon-Ponzi schemes demonstrate the effectiveness of PonziLens.",

Most of\nthese platforms remain opaque, leading to many questions about data accuracy,\nprovenance and lineage, privacy implications, consent management, and the lack\nof fair incentives for data providers. With their transparency, immutability,\nnon-repudiation, and decentralization properties, blockchains could not be more\napt to answer these questions and enhance trust in a data-sharing platform.\nHowever, blockchains are not good at handling the four Vs of big data (i.e.,\nvolume, variety, velocity, and veracity) due to their limited performance,\nscalability, and high cost. Given many related works proposes blockchain-based\ntrustworthy data-sharing solutions, there is increasing confusion and\ndifficulties in understanding and selecting these technologies and platforms in\nterms of their sharing mechanisms, sharing services, quality of services, and\napplications. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on\nblockchain-based data-sharing architectures and applications to fill the gap.\nFirst, we present the foundations of blockchains and discuss the challenges of\ncurrent data-sharing techniques. Second, we focus on the convergence of\nblockchain and data sharing to give a clear picture of this landscape and\npropose a reference architecture for blockchain-based data sharing. Third, we\ndiscuss the industrial applications of blockchain-based data sharing, ranging\nfrom healthcare and smart grid to transportation and decarbonization. For each\napplication, we provide lessons learned for the deployment of Blockchain-based\ndata sharing. Finally, we discuss research challenges and open research\ndirections.",

Hyperledger Fabric\n(HF) is a common enterprise-level platform that is being offered as\nBlockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) by cloud providers. In HF, every new transaction\nrequires a preliminary endorsement by multiple mutually untrusted parties\ncalled organizations, which contributes to the delay in storing the transaction\nin the blockchain. The endorsement policy is specific to each application and\ndefines the required approvals by the endorser peers (EPs) of the involved\norganizations. In this paper, given an input endorsement policy, we studied the\noptimal choice to distribute the endorsement requests to the proper EPs. We\nproposed the OPEN algorithm, devised to minimize the latency due to both\nnetwork delays and the processing times at the EPs. By extensive simulations,\nwe showed that OPEN can reduce the endorsement latency up to 70% compared to\nthe state-of-the-art solution and approximated well the introduced optimal\npolicies while offering a negligible implementation overhead compared to them.",

            "summary": "Large-scale, fault-tolerant, distributed systems are the backbone for many\ncritical software services. Since they must execute correctly in a possibly\nadversarial environment with arbitrary communication delays and failures, the\nunderlying algorithms are intricate. In particular, achieving consistency and\ndata retention relies on intricate consensus (state machine replication)\nprotocols. Ensuring the reliability of implementations of such protocols\nremains a significant challenge because of the enormous number of exceptional\nconditions that may arise in production. We propose a methodology and a tool\ncalled Netrix for testing such implementations that aims to exploit\nprogrammer's knowledge to improve coverage, enables robust bug reproduction,\nand can be used in regression testing across different versions of an\nimplementation. As evaluation, we apply our tool to a popular proof of stake\nblockchain protocol, Tendermint, which relies on a Byzantine consensus\nalgorithm, a benign consensus algorithm, Raft, and BFT-Smart. We were able to\nidentify 4 deviations of the Tendermint implementation from the protocol\nspecification and check their absence on an updated implementation.\nAdditionally, we were able to reproduce 4 previously known bugs in Raft.",

            "summary": "With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has\nbeen paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various\neducational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on\nblockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by\ndevelopers for its ``event-triggered\" mechanism for building education\nintelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to\nthe immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified,\nso problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the\neducational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart\ncontract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of\nsmart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great\nchallenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network\n(GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational\nblockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly,\nthe basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according\nto the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG)\nare built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection.\nThe experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the\nvulnerability detection of smart contracts. Compared with the traditional\napproaches, it can get good results with fewer layers of the GCN model, which\nshows that the contract bytecode and GCN model are efficient in vulnerability\ndetection.",

            "summary": "Maximum extractable value (MEV) has been extensively studied. In most papers,\nthe researchers have worked with the Ethereum blockchain almost exclusively.\nEven though, Ethereum and other blockchains have dynamic gas prices this is not\nthe case for all blockchains; many of them have fixed gas prices. Extending the\nresearch to other blockchains with fixed gas price could broaden the scope of\nthe existing studies on MEV. To our knowledge, there is not a vast\nunderstanding of MEV in fixed gas price blockchains. Therefore, we propose to\nstudy Terra Classic as an example to understand how MEV activities affect\nblockchains with fixed gas price. We first analysed the data from Terra Classic\nbefore the UST de-peg event in May 2022 and described the nature of the\nexploited arbitrage opportunities. We found more than 188K successful\narbitrages, and most of them used UST as the initial token. The capital to\nperform the arbitrage was less than 1K UST in 50% of the cases, and 80% of the\narbitrages had less than four swaps. Then, we explored the characteristics that\nattribute to higher MEV. We found that searchers who use more complex\nmechanisms, i.e. different contracts and accounts, made higher profits.\nFinally, we concluded that the most profitable searchers used a strategy of\nrunning bots in a multi-instance environment, i.e. running bots with different\nvirtual machines. We measured the importance of the geographic distribution of\nthe virtual machines that run the bots. We found that having good geographic\ncoverage makes the difference between winning or losing the arbitrage\nopportunities. That is because, unlike MEV extraction in Ethereum, bots in\nfixed gas price blockchains are not battling a gas war; they are fighting in a\nlatency war.",

However, most previous\nworks on organ donation systems have focused on using Ethereum-based blockchain\nsolutions, which offer limited control, a fixed set of consensus protocols, and\nno support for concurrent executions. In contrast, our work has utilized the\nHyperledger Fabric framework to develop a network model of the organ donation\nsystem. We have designed and deployed a prototype system with smart contracts\nusing Amazon Managed Blockchain Service. Additionally, we have built a client\napplication that uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the network and perform\nvarious actions. To evaluate the performance of our system, we conducted\nextensive testing using the Hyperledger Caliper benchmarking tool. In our test\nbench, the system achieved a peak actual send rate of 389.1 transactions per\nsecond (TPS) for creating new records and 508.4 TPS for reading records. At a\nsend rate of 800 TPS, the system took an average of 12.16 seconds to serve a\nrequest for creating a record and an average of 3.71 seconds to serve a request\nfor reading a record.

We argue that a programming language for writing such\non-ledger logic should satisfy three desiderata: (1) Provide concepts to\ncapture the legal rules that govern real-world business workflows. (2) Include\nsimple means for specifying policies for access and authorization. (3) Support\nthe composition of simple workflows into complex ones, even when the simple\nworkflows have already been deployed.\n  We present the open-source smart contract language Daml based on Haskell with\nstrict evaluation. Daml achieves these desiderata by offering novel primitives\nfor representing, accessing, and modifying data on the ledger, which are\nmimicking the primitives of today's legal systems. Robust access and\nauthorization policies are specified as part of these primitives, and Daml's\nbuilt-in authorization rules enable delegation, which is key for workflow\ncomposability. These properties make Daml well-suited for orchestrating\nbusiness workflows across multiple, otherwise heterogeneous parties.\n  Daml contracts run (1) on centralized ledgers backed by a database, (2) on\ndistributed deployments with Byzantine fault tolerant consensus, and (3) on top\nof conventional blockchains, as a second layer via an atomic commit protocol.",

            "summary": "At present, electric shared micromobility services (ESMS) have become an\nimportant part of the mobility as a service (MaaS) paradigm for sustainable\ntransportation systems. However, current ESMS suffer from critical design\nissues such as a lack of integration, transparency and user-centric approaches,\nresulting in high operational costs and poor service quality. A key operational\nchallenge in ESMS is related to parking, particularly how to ensure a shared\nvehicle has a parking space when the user is approaching the destination. For\ninstance, our recent study illustrated that up to 12.9% of shared E-bike users\nin Dublin, Ireland cannot park their E-bikes properly due to a lack of planning\nand user-centric guidance. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose\nU-Park, a user-centric smart parking recommendation system for ESMS aiming at\nmaking personalised recommendations to ESMS users by considering a given user's\nhistorical mobility data, current trip trajectory and parking space\navailability. We propose the system architecture, implement it, and evaluate\nits performance based on a real-world dataset from an Irish-based shared E-bike\ncompany, Moby bikes. Our results illustrate that U-Park can effectively predict\na user's destination in a shared E-bike system with around 97.33% accuracy\nwithout direct user inputs, and such results can be subsequently used to\nrecommend the best parking station for the user depending on the availability\nof predicted parking spaces. Finally, a blockchain-empowered module is blended\nto manage various transactions due to its advantage in safety and transparency\nin this process, including prepays and parking fines.",

Specifically, leveraging fraud proof, we first propose a protocol to\nprotect the ownership and copyright of AIGC, called Proof-of-AIGC. Then, we\ndesign an incentive mechanism to guarantee the legitimate and timely executions\nof the funds-AIGC ownership exchanges among anonymous users. Furthermore, we\nbuild a multi-weight subjective logic-based reputation scheme, with which AIGC\nproducers can determine which edge service provider is trustworthy and reliable\nto handle their services. Through numerical results, the superiority of the\nproposed approach is demonstrated. Last but not least, we discuss important\nopen directions for further research.",

By taking advantage of blockchain technology,\ndigital assets are broadly grouped into fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFT).\nHere non-fungible tokens refer to those with unique and non-substitutable\nproperties. NFT has widely attracted attention, and its protocols, standards,\nand applications are developing exponentially. It has been successfully applied\nto digital fantasy artwork, games, collectibles, etc. However, there is a lack\nof research in utilizing NFT in issues such as Intellectual Property. Applying\nfor a patent and trademark is not only a time-consuming and lengthy process but\nalso costly. NFT has considerable potential in the intellectual property\ndomain. It can promote transparency and liquidity and open the market to\ninnovators who aim to commercialize their inventions efficiently. The main\nobjective of this paper is to examine the requirements of presenting\nintellectual property assets, specifically patents, as NFTs. Hence, we offer a\nlayered conceptual NFT-based patent framework. Furthermore, a series of open\nchallenges about NFT-based patents and the possible future directions are\nhighlighted. The proposed framework provides fundamental elements and guidance\nfor businesses in taking advantage of NFTs in real-world problems such as grant\npatents, funding, biotechnology, and so forth.",

Currently, existing clustering heuristics only consider\nconfirmed transactions recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain. However, unconfirmed\ntransactions in the mempool have yet to be utilized to improve the performance\nof the clustering heuristics.\n  In this paper, we bridge this gap by combining unconfirmed and confirmed\ntransactions for clustering Bitcoin addresses effectively. First, we present a\ndata collection system for capturing unconfirmed transactions. Two case studies\nare performed to show the presence of user behaviors in unconfirmed\ntransactions not present in confirmed transactions. Next, we apply the\nstate-of-the-art clustering heuristics to unconfirmed transactions, and the\nclustering results can reduce the number of entities after applying, for\nexample, the co-spend heuristics in confirmed transactions by 2.3%. Finally, we\npropose three novel clustering heuristics to capture specific behavior patterns\nin unconfirmed transactions, which further reduce the number of entities after\nthe application of the co-spend heuristics by 9.8%. Our results demonstrate the\nutility of unconfirmed transactions in address clustering and further shed\nlight on the limitations of anonymity in cryptocurrencies. To the best of our\nknowledge, this paper is the first to apply the unconfirmed transactions in\nBitcoin to cluster addresses.",

Differently from\nKleros, dispute resolution is guaranteed despite the users having the final\nsay. Moreover, the proposed model does not use a native token on the platform,\nbut aims to reward stakeholders through a social incentive mechanism based on\nsoulbound tokens, introduced by Weyl, Ohlhaver, and Buterin in 2022.

ACSE challenges could stem from a lack of standardized\nprocesses, socio-technical limitations, and scarcity of human expertise etc.\nthat can impede the development of existing and emergent classes of software\n(e.g., IoTs, blockchain, quantum systems). Software Development Bots (DevBots)\ntrained on large language models can help synergise architects' knowledge with\nartificially intelligent decision support to enable rapid architecting in a\nhuman-bot collaborative ACSE. An emerging solution to enable this collaboration\nis ChatGPT, a disruptive technology not primarily introduced for software\nengineering, but is capable of articulating and refining architectural\nartifacts based on natural language processing. We detail a case study that\ninvolves collaboration between a novice software architect and ChatGPT for\narchitectural analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of a services-driven software\napplication. Preliminary results indicate that ChatGPT can mimic an architect's\nrole to support and often lead ACSE, however; it requires human oversight and\ndecision support for collaborative architecting.

            "summary": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been a promising paradigm for communicating\nand edge processing of data on the move. We aim to employ Federated Learning\n(FL) and prominent features of blockchain into MEC architecture such as\nconnected autonomous vehicles to enable complete decentralization,\nimmutability, and rewarding mechanisms simultaneously. FL is advantageous for\nmobile devices with constrained connectivity since it requires model updates to\nbe delivered to a central point instead of substantial amounts of data\ncommunication. For instance, FL in autonomous, connected vehicles can increase\ndata diversity and allow model customization, and predictions are possible even\nwhen the vehicles are not connected (by exploiting their local models) for\nshort times. However, existing synchronous FL and Blockchain incur extremely\nhigh communication costs due to mobility-induced impairments and do not apply\ndirectly to MEC networks. We propose a fully asynchronous Blockchained\nFederated Learning (BFL) framework referred to as BFL-MEC, in which the mobile\nclients and their models evolve independently yet guarantee stability in the\nglobal learning process. More importantly, we employ post-quantum secure\nfeatures over BFL-MEC to verify the client's identity and defend against\nmalicious attacks. All of our design assumptions and results are evaluated with\nextensive simulations.",

            "summary": "In most electricity theft detection schemes, consumers' power consumption\ndata is directly input into the detection center. Although it is valid in\ndetecting the theft of consumers, the privacy of all consumers is at risk\nunless the detection center is assumed to be trusted. In fact, it is\nimpractical. Moreover, existing schemes may result in some security problems,\nsuch as the collusion attack due to the presence of a trusted third party, and\nmalicious data tampering caused by the system operator (SO) being attacked.\nAiming at the problems above, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving\nelectricity theft detection scheme without a third party. Specifically, the\nproposed scheme uses an improved functional encryption scheme to enable\nelectricity theft detection and load monitoring while preserving consumers'\nprivacy; distributed storage of consumers' data with blockchain to resolve\nsecurity problems such as data tampering, etc. Meanwhile, we build a long\nshort-term memory network (LSTM) model to perform higher accuracy for\nelectricity theft detection. The proposed scheme is evaluated in a real\nenvironment, and the results show that it is more accurate in electricity theft\ndetection within acceptable communication and computational overhead. Our\nsystem analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can resist various\nsecurity attacks and preserve consumers' privacy.",

Several recent works\nshowed that the transaction fee mechanism design fundamentally departs from\nclassical mechanism design. They then systematically explored the mathematical\nlandscape of this new decentralized mechanism design problem in two settings:\nin the plain setting where no cryptography is employed, and in a\ncryptography-assisted setting where the rules of the mechanism are enforced by\na multi-party computation protocol. Unfortunately, in both settings, prior\nworks showed that if we want the mechanism to incentivize honest behavior for\nboth users as well as miners (possibly colluding with users), then the miner\nrevenue has to be zero. Although adopting a relaxed, approximate notion of\nincentive compatibility gets around this zero miner-revenue limitation, the\nscaling of the miner revenue is nonetheless poor.\n  In this paper, we show that if we make a mildly stronger reasonable-world\nassumption than prior works, we can circumvent the known limitations on miner\nrevenue, and design auctions that generate optimal miner revenue. We also\nsystematically explore the mathematical landscape of transaction fee mechanism\ndesign under the new reasonable-world and demonstrate how such assumptions can\nalter the feasibility and infeasibility landscape.",

            "summary": "Dynamic participation has recently become a crucial requirement for devising\npermissionless consensus protocols. This notion, originally formalized by Pass\nand Shi (ASIACRYPT 2017) through their \"sleepy model\", captures the essence of\na system's ability to handle participants joining or leaving during a protocol\nexecution. A dynamically available consensus protocol preserves safety and\nliveness while allowing dynamic participation. Blockchain protocols, such as\nBitcoin's consensus protocol, have implicitly adopted this concept. In the\ncontext of Ethereum's consensus protocol, Gasper, Neu, Tas, and Tse (S&P 2021)\npresented an attack against LMD-GHOST -- the component of Gasper designed to\nensure dynamic availability. Consequently, LMD-GHOST results unable to fulfill\nits intended function of providing dynamic availability for the protocol.\nDespite attempts to mitigate this issue, the modified protocol still does not\nachieve dynamic availability, highlighting the need for more secure dynamically\navailable protocols. In this work, we present RLMD-GHOST, a synchronous\nconsensus protocol that not only ensures dynamic availability but also\nmaintains safety during bounded periods of asynchrony. This protocol is\nparticularly appealing for practical systems where strict synchrony assumptions\nmay not always hold, contrary to general assumptions in standard synchronous\nprotocols. Additionally, we present the \"generalized sleepy model\", within\nwhich our results are proven. Building upon the original sleepy model proposed\nby Pass and Shi, our model extends it with more generalized and stronger\nconstraints on the corruption and sleepiness power of the adversary. This\napproach allows us to explore a wide range of dynamic participation regimes,\nspanning from complete dynamic participation to no dynamic participation, i.e.,\nwith every participant online.",

The protocol achieves about 100x more throughput compared\nto Bitcoin and can be easily scaled to millions of nodes.

In this work, we\nstudy the incentive issue in Algorand through the lens of game theory. We model\nthe Algorand protocol as a Bayesian game and propose a novel reward scheme to\naddress the incentive issue in Algorand. We derive necessary conditions to\nensure that participation in the protocol is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium under\nour proposed reward scheme even in the presence of a malicious adversary.

The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong\nincentive for integrating it into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the\nvery attractive decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received both\nby the research and industry in the past years and it is being increasingly\ndeployed nowadays in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT,\nhealthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate what\nwould be the pros and cons and what would be the best applications when these\ntwo technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of technical\nliterature research on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and\nincludes a first legal analysis of this integration to shed light on challenges\nand potentials. While this combination is still in its infancy and a growing\nbody of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in\nan advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic understanding\nof blockchains applicability in the biometric sector. This study demonstrates\nthat combining blockchain and biometrics would be beneficial for novel\napplications in biometrics such as the PKI mechanism, distributed trusted\nservice, and identity management. However, blockchain networks at their current\nstage are not efficient and economical for real-time applications. From a legal\npoint of view, the allocation of accountability remains a main issue, while\nother difficulties remain, such as conducting a proper Data Protection Impact\nAssessment.

To achieve efficient and reliable\nresource utilization with user-centric services, we propose an energy efficient\nblockchain-enabled UC-MEC system where blockchain operations and resource\noptimization are jointly performed. Firstly, we design a resource-aware,\nreliable, replicated, redundant, and fault-tolerant (R-RAFT) consensus\nmechanism to implement secure and reliable resource trading. Then, an\noptimization framework based on alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) is proposed to minimize the total energy consumed by wireless\ntransmission, consensus and task computing, where APs clustering, computing\nresource allocation and bandwidth allocation are jointly considered.

The\nFOMC statement release strongly affects the volatility of digital asset\nreturns, while the effect of the Minutes release is weaker.

            "summary": "In blockchain systems, the scarcity of a resource is used as a Sybil\nprotection mechanism. In Proof-of-Work blockchains, that resource is computing\npower. In the event of a fork, the scarcity of this resource theoretically\nprevents miners from producing blocks on both branches of a fork. In\nProof-of-Stake blockchains, because that resource is token stake, the\ncomputational cost of creating a block is negligible. In the event of a fork,\nand if no specific measures have been taken, rational block producers should\nextend both branches of the fork. In blockchains with sequential block\nproduction, a punishment mechanism known as slashing is often cited as a\nprotection against the nothing-at-stake problem. However, in the context of a\nblockchain with parallel block production, it seems that slashing is not\nsufficient against the numerous divergence opportunities. In this paper, we\npropose a novel protection against the nothing-at-stake problem that takes the\nmost out of BFT and Nakamoto-based consensus. By combining those approaches, we\nwish to scale up blockchains by allowing parallel block production without\nreconciliation.",

            "summary": "Satellite-ground integrated digital twin networks (SGIDTNs) are regarded as\ninnovative network architectures for reducing network congestion, enabling\nnearly-instant data mapping from the physical world to digital systems, and\noffering ubiquitous intelligence services to terrestrial users. However, the\nchallenges, such as the pricing policy, the stochastic task arrivals, the\ntime-varying satellite locations, mutual channel interference, and resource\nscheduling mechanisms between the users and cloud servers, are critical for\nimproving quality of service in SGIDTNs. Hence, we establish a blockchain-aided\nStackelberg game model for maximizing the pricing profits and network\nthroughput in terms of minimizing overhead of privacy protection, thus\nperforming computation offloading, decreasing channel interference, and\nimproving privacy protection. Next, we propose a Lyapunov stability\ntheory-based model-agnostic metalearning aided multi-agent deep federated\nreinforcement learning (MAML-MADFRL) framework for optimizing the CPU cycle\nfrequency, channel selection, task-offloading decision, block size, and cloud\nserver price, which facilitate the integration of communication, computation,\nand block resources. Subsequently, the extensive performance analyses show that\nthe proposed MAMLMADFRL algorithm can strengthen the privacy protection via the\ntransaction verification mechanism, approach the optimal time average penalty,\nand fulfill the long-term average queue size via lower computational\ncomplexity. Finally, our simulation results indicate that the proposed\nMAML-MADFRL learning framework is superior to the existing baseline methods in\nterms of network throughput, channel interference, cloud server profits, and\nprivacy overhead.",

Smart contracts are self-executing codes of agreement between\ninterested parties commonly implemented using blockchains. A block contains a\nset of transactions representing changes to the system and a hash of the\nprevious block. The SCTs are executed multiple times during the block\nproduction and validation phases across the network. The execution is\nsequential in most blockchain technologies.\n  In this work, we incorporate a direct acyclic graph (DAG) based parallel\nscheduler framework for concurrent execution of SCTs. The dependencies among a\nblock's transactions are represented through a concurrent DAG data structure\nthat assists in throughput optimization. We have created a DAG scheduler module\nthat can be incorporated into blockchain platforms for concurrent execution\nwith ease. We have also formally established the safety and liveness properties\nof the DAG scheduler. For evaluation, our framework is implemented in\nHyperledger Sawtooth V1.2.6.

            "summary": "Learning Automaton (LA) is an adaptive self-organized model that improves its\naction-selection through interaction with an unknown environment. LA with\nfinite action set can be classified into two main categories: fixed and\nvariable structure. Furthermore, variable action-set learning automaton (VASLA)\nis one of the main subsets of variable structure learning automaton. In this\npaper, we propose VDHLA, a novel hybrid learning automaton model, which is a\ncombination of fixed structure and variable action set learning automaton. In\nthe proposed model, variable action set learning automaton can increase,\ndecrease, or leave unchanged the depth of fixed structure learning automaton\nduring the action switching phase. In addition, the depth of the proposed model\ncan change in a symmetric (SVDHLA) or asymmetric (AVDHLA) manner. To the best\nof our knowledge, it is the first hybrid model that intelligently changes the\ndepth of fixed structure learning automaton. Several computer simulations are\nconducted to study the performance of the proposed model with respect to the\ntotal number of rewards and action switching in stationary and non-stationary\nenvironments. The proposed model is compared with FSLA and VSLA. In order to\ndetermine the performance of the proposed model in a practical application, the\nselfish mining attack which threatens the incentive-compatibility of a\nproof-of-work based blockchain environment is considered. The proposed model is\napplied to defend against the selfish mining attack in Bitcoin and compared\nwith the tie-breaking mechanism, which is a well-known defense. Simulation\nresults in all environments have shown the superiority of the proposed model.",

Smart contracts gained popularity and accrued hundreds\nof billions of dollars in market capitalization in recent years. Unfortunately,\nlike all other programs, smart contracts are prone to security vulnerabilities\nthat have incurred multimillion-dollar damages over the past decade. As a\nresult, many automated threat mitigation solutions have been proposed to\ncounter the security issues of smart contracts. These threat mitigation\nsolutions include various tools and methods that are challenging to compare.\nThis survey develops a comprehensive classification taxonomy of smart contract\nthreat mitigation solutions within five orthogonal dimensions: defense\nmodality, core method, targeted contracts, input-output data mapping, and\nthreat model. We classify 133 existing threat mitigation solutions using our\ntaxonomy and confirm that the proposed five dimensions allow us to concisely\nand accurately describe any smart contract threat mitigation solution. In\naddition to learning what the threat mitigation solutions do, we also show how\nthese solutions work by synthesizing their actual designs into a set of uniform\nworkflows corresponding to the eight existing defense core methods. We further\ncreate an integrated coverage map for the known smart contract vulnerabilities\nby the existing threat mitigation solutions. Finally, we perform the\nevidence-based evolutionary analysis, in which we identify trends and future\nperspectives of threat mitigation in smart contracts and pinpoint major\nweaknesses of the existing methodologies. For the convenience of smart contract\nsecurity developers, auditors, users, and researchers, we deploy a regularly\nupdated comprehensive open-source online registry of threat mitigation\nsolutions.",

Prioritization transparency\nstates that the participants are aware of the transaction or prioritization\nfees paid by every such contending transaction. Neither of these notions of\ntransparency holds well today. Private relay networks, for instance, allow\nusers to send transactions privately to miners. Besides, users can offer fees\nto miners via either direct transfers to miners' wallets or off-chain payments\n-- neither of which are public. In this work, we characterize the lack of\ncontention and prioritization transparency in Bitcoin and Ethereum resulting\nfrom such practices. We show that private relay networks are widely used and\nprivate transactions are quite prevalent. We show that the lack of transparency\nfacilitates miners to collude and overcharge users who may use these private\nrelay networks despite them offering little to no guarantees on transaction\nprioritization. The lack of these transparencies in blockchains has crucial\nimplications for transaction issuers as well as the stability of blockchains.\nFinally, we make our data sets and scripts publicly available.",

Unfortunately, they also introduce\nan enormous amount of incentive asymmetry compared to alternatives like fixed\nblock rewards.

We start\nby surveying a variety of mining attacks including undercutting, fee sniping,\nand fee-optimized selfish mining. Then, we move to analyzing mechanistic\nnotions of user incentive compatibility, myopic miner incentive compatibility,\nand off-chain-agreement-proofness, as well as why they are provably\nincompatible in their full form. Then, we discuss weaker notions of nearly and\n$\\gamma$-weak incentive compatibility, and how all of these forms of incentive\ncompatibility hold or fail in the trustless auctioneer setup of blockchains,\nexamining classical mechanisms as well as more recent ones such as Ethereum's\nEIP-1559 mechanism and \\cite{chung}'s burning second-price auction.

We believe this development has transformed blockchain\nusage. In our work, we perform a historical analysis of Ethereum's transaction\ngraph. We study how much interaction between transactions there was\nhistorically and how much there is now. We find that the rise of DeFi and NFT\nmarketplaces has led to an increase in \"centralization\" in the transaction\ngraph. More transactions are now interconnected: currently there are around 200\ntransactions per block with 4000 interdependencies between them.

However, the use of blockchain technology may\nlead to a rapid increase in the complexity of system design and development. It\nis challenging to address widespread and complicated business, changeable\nprocesses, and massive data in practice, which are the main factors restricting\nthe wide application of a blockchain-based traceability system (BTS).\nTherefore, in this paper, we reviewed relevant studies and proposed a reference\narchitecture for BTSs. The proposed reference architecture can improve the\ncohesiveness, maintainability, and extensibility of BTSs through domain-driven\ndesign (DDD) and microservices. Considering the efficiency reduction caused by\nmassive data and complicated data structure, we further changed the traditional\nsingle blockchain framework into multiple sub-chain networks, which could\nimprove development efficiency and system performance. With the guidance of the\narchitecture trade-off analysis method (ATAM), we evaluated our reference\narchitecture and implemented a prototype in the salmon supply chain scenario.\nThe results show that our solution is effective and adaptable to meet the\nrequirements of BTSs.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be\novercome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability\nissue is due to the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the total order of\nthe chain of blocks and of the transactions within each block. However, total\norder is often not fully necessary, since important advanced applications of\nsmart-contracts do not require a total order among all operations. A much\nhigher scalability can potentially be achieved if a more relaxed order can be\nexploited. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed concurrent data type,\ncalled Setchain, which improves scalability significantly. A Setchain\nimplements a grow-only set whose elements are not ordered, unlike conventional\nblockchain operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a\nsynchronization barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of\nthe latest elements added, agreed by consensus. Therefore, two operations in\nthe same epoch are not ordered, while two operations in different epochs are\nordered by their respective epoch number. We present different\nByzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and\nreport on an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation. Our results\nshow that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers,\nsince it implements grow-only sets with epoch synchronization instead of total\norder. Since Setchain barriers can be synchronized with the underlying\nblockchain, Setchain objects can be used as a sidechain to implement many\ndecentralized solutions with much faster operations than direct implementations\non top of blockchains. Finally, we also present an algorithm that encompasses\nin a single process the combined behavior of Byzantine servers, which\nsimplifies correctness proofs by encoding the general attacker in a concrete\nimplementation.",

            "summary": "A land record (LR) contains very sensitive information related to land e.g.\nowner, buyer, etc. Currently, almost all over the world, the LR is maintained\nby different governmental offices and most of them maintain the LR with\npaper-based approach. Some of the works focus to digitalize the existing land\nrecord management system (LRMS) but with some security concerns. A\nblockchain-based LRMS can be effective enough to solve the existing issues.\nThis paper proposes a blockchain-based LRMS that (i) digitalizes the existing\npaper-based system, (ii) ensures LR privacy using an asymmetric cryptosystem,\n(iii) preserves LR integrity, (iv) facilitates a platform for trading land\nthrough an advertising agency, and (v) accelerates the process of changing\nownership that saves time significantly. Besides, this paper also proposes a\nnew way of character to integer mapping named C2I table that reduces around 33%\noverhead of text to integer conversion compared to ASCII table. The\nexperimental results, analyses, and comparisons indicate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed LRMS over the state-of-the-art systems.",

            "summary": "In crowdsourcing systems, requesters publish tasks, and interested workers\nprovide answers to get rewards. Worker anonymity motivates participation since\nit protects their privacy. Anonymity with unlinkability is an enhanced version\nof anonymity because it makes it impossible to ``link'' workers across the\ntasks they participate in. Another core feature of crowdsourcing systems is\nworker quality which expresses a worker's trustworthiness and quantifies their\nhistorical performance. Notably, worker quality depends on the participation\nhistory, revealing information about it, while unlinkability aims to\ndisassociate the workers' identities from their past activity. In this work, we\npresent AVeCQ, the first crowdsourcing system that reconciles these properties,\nachieving enhanced anonymity and verifiable worker quality updates. AVeCQ\nrelies on a suite of cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, to (i)\nguarantee workers' privacy, (ii) prove the correctness of worker quality scores\nand task answers, and (iii) commensurate payments. AVeCQ is developed\nmodularly, where the requesters and workers communicate over a platform that\nsupports pseudonymity, information logging, and payments. In order to compare\nAVeCQ with the state-of-the-art, we prototype it over Ethereum. AVeCQ\noutperforms the state-of-the-art in three popular crowdsourcing tasks (image\nannotation, average review, and Gallup polls). For instance, for an Average\nReview task with $5$ choices and $128$ participating workers AVeCQ is 40\\%\nfaster (including overhead to compute and verify the necessary proofs and\nblockchain transaction processing time) with the task's requester consuming\n87\\% fewer gas units.",

In this digital era, many key fraudulent schemes are\nrampant in many companies and one of them is certificate fraud. It is possible\nto validate a candidate's qualifications using traditional methods, but there\nare drawbacks such as security issues and time consumption. In this paper, a\nblockchain-based academic certificate authentication system will be used to\nensure authenticity and make the assertion of the decentralized system secure.\nHowever, the system will generate, authenticate and make corrections on\nacademic certificates. Ultimately, some blockchain-based authentication systems\nalready exist, they can't correct any errors that occur during generation.

It will integrate processing, communication,\nintelligence, sensing, and storage of things. All devices and their virtual\ncounterparts will become part of the service-provisioning process. In essence,\n6G is a purposefully cooperative network that heavily depends on the\ncapabilities of edge and end-devices. Digital Twin (DT) will become an\nessential part of 6G, not only in terms of providing a virtual representation\nof the physical elements and their dynamics and functionalities but rather DT\nwill become a catalyst in the realization of the cooperative 6G environment. DT\nwill play a main role in realizing the full potential of the 6G network by\nutilizing the collected data at the cyber twin and then implementing using the\nphysical twin to ensure optimal levels of accuracy and efficiency. With that\nsaid, such a cooperative non-conventional network infrastructure cannot rely on\nconventional centralized intrusion detection and prevention systems. Zero-trust\nis a new security framework that aims at protecting distributed data, devices,\ncomponents and users. This article presents a new framework that integrates the\nzero-trust architecture in DT-enabled 6G networks. Unlike conventional\nzero-trust solutions, the proposed framework adapts a decentralized mechanism\nto ensure the security, privacy and authenticity of both the physical devices\nand their DT counterparts. Blockchain plays an integral part in the\nauthentication of DTs and the communicated data.

Recent blockchains aim to replace PoW through Proof-of-Stake\n(PoS) and Malicious Fault-Tolerant (MFT) consensus protocols. However, the\nsafety of the ledger created by these protocols is at the mercy of the\nlong-term safe-keeping of the private keys of participants. As a result, these\nblockchains face long-range attacks. To ameliorate this situation, we present\nthe design of our novel Power-of-Collaboration (PoC) protocol, which guards\nexisting PoS and MFT blockchains against long-range attacks.

Attackers are taking\nadvantage of this transformation and pose a new global threat to financial\nstability and integrity.

Blockchain can bring big and\nfar-reaching effects on the trustworthiness, safety, accessibility,\ncost-effectiveness, and openness of the financial sector. The present paper\ngives an in-depth look at how blockchain and federated learning (FL) are used\nin financial services. It starts with an overview of recent developments in\nboth use cases. This paper explores and discusses existing financial service\nvulnerabilities, potential threats, and consequent risks. So, we explain the\nproblems that can be fixed in financial services and how blockchain and FL\ncould help solve them.

            "summary": "The emergence of blockchain technology has renewed the interest in\nconsensus-based data management systems that are resilient to failures. To\nmaximize the throughput of these systems, we have recently seen several\nprototype consensus solutions that optimize for throughput at the expense of\noverall implementation complexity, high costs, and reliability. Due to this, it\nremains unclear how these prototypes will perform in real-world environments.\nIn this paper, we present SPOTLESS, a novel concurrent rotational consensus\nprotocol made practical. Central to SPOTLESS is the combination of (1) a\nchained rotational consensus design for replicating requests with a reduced\nmessage cost and low-cost failure recovery that eliminates the traditional\ncomplex, error-prone view-change protocol; (2) the novel Rapid View\nSynchronization protocol that enables SPOTLESS to work in more general network\nassumptions, without a need for a Global Synchronization Time to synchronize\nview, and recover valid earlier views with the aid of non-faulty replicas\nwithout the need to rely on the primary; (3) a high-performance concurrent\nconsensus architecture in which independent instances of the chained consensus\noperate concurrently to process requests with high throughput, thereby avoiding\nthe bottlenecks seen in other rotational protocols. Due to the concurrent\nconsensus architecture, SPOTLESS greatly outperforms traditional primary-backup\nconsensus protocols such as PBFT (by up to 430%), NARWHAL-HS (by up to 137%),\nand HOTSTUFF (by up to 3803%). Due to its reduced message cost, SPOTLESS is\neven able to outperform RCC, a state-of-the-art high-throughput concurrent\nconsensus protocol, by up to 23%. Furthermore, SPOTLESS is able to maintain a\nstable and low latency and consistently high throughput even during failures.",

A key aspect in MERLIN is its independence on financial features, as\nit exploits only the primary data a user interested in NFT trading would like\nto deal with, i.e., NFT images and textual descriptions. By learning dense\nrepresentations of such data, a price-category classification task is performed\nby MERLIN models, which can also be tuned according to user preferences in the\ninference phase to mimic different risk-return investment profiles.\nExperimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset has shown that MERLIN\nmodels achieve significant performances according to several financial\nassessment criteria, fostering profitable investments, and also beating\nbaseline machine-learning classifiers based on financial features.",

The model can be specialised to apply to chains with\nfixed or variable block times, traditional priority queue disciplines with\n`honest' schedulers, or adversarial public mempools. We find conditions under\nwhich the model behaves as a bulk-service queue with priority discipline and\nderive practical expressions for the relative block and message number of a\ntransaction.\n  We study this setup in the context of orders to a CFMM DEX where the\nexecution price a user receives may be quite sensitive to its positioning in\nthe chain -- in particular, to a string of transactions scheduled for prior\nexecution which is not knowable at the time of order creation. We derive\nstatistical models for the price impact of this order flow both in the presence\nand absence of MEV extraction activity.",

This makes\ninteroperability across metaverses becomes one of the fundamental technology\nenablers in the metaverse space. The aim of interoperability is to provide a\nseamless experience for users to interact with metaverses. However, the\ndevelopment of cross-metaverse interoperability is still in its initial stage\nin both industry and academia. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art\ncross-metaverse interoperability schemes. These schemes are designed for\nspecific interoperating scenarios and do not generalize for all types of\nmetaverses. To this end, we propose MetaOpera, a generalized cross-metaverse\ninteroperability protocol. By connecting to the MetaOpera, users, and objects\nin metaverses that rely on centralized servers or decentralized blockchains are\nable to interoperate with each other. We also develop a proof-of-concept\nimplementation for MetaOpera, evaluate its performance, and compare it with a\nstate-of-the-art cross-metaverse scheme based on Sidechains. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the size of cross-metaverse proof and the average time of\ncross-metaverse transactions using the proposed solution are respectively about\neight times and three times smaller than the Sidechains scheme. This paper also\nsuggests a number of open issues and challenges faced by cross-metaverse\ninteroperability that may inspire future research.",

In of-ABC, transactions\nsubmitted to a sufficient number of blockchain validators are ordered before or\nalong with later transactions. FBA then executes transactions with a uniform\nprice double auction that prioritizes price instead of transaction order within\nthe same committed batch.\n  To demonstrate the merits of our order-but-not-execute-in-order design, we\ncompare the welfare loss and liquidity provision in DEX under FBA and its\ncontinuous counterpart, the Continuous Limit Order Book (CLOB). Assuming that\nthe exchange is realized over an of-ABC protocol, we find that (1) FBA always\nachieves better social welfare when no party is privately informed about asset\nvaluations. Even otherwise, FBA incurs less welfare loss compared to CLOB when\n(2) price takers and public information reflecting asset value changes arrives\nsufficiently frequently compared to private information, or (3) the priority\nfees are small, or (4) the market is more balanced on both sides. Our empirical\nanalysis on dYdX transactions indicates additional $8\\%-83\\%$ costs when\ntransactions are executed continuously.

But financial activity\nrequires transactions to be included in a timely manner. Unfortunately,\nclassical liveness is not strong enough to guarantee this, particularly in the\npresence of a motivated adversary who benefits from censoring transactions. We\ndefine censorship resistance as the amount it would cost the adversary to\ncensor a transaction for a fixed interval of time as a function of the\nassociated tip. This definition has two advantages, first it captures the fact\nthat transactions with a higher miner tip can be more costly to censor, and\ntherefore are more likely to swiftly make their way onto the chain. Second, it\napplies to a finite time window, so it can be used to assess whether a\nblockchain is capable of hosting financial activity that relies on timely\ninclusion.\n  We apply this definition in the context of auctions. Auctions are a building\nblock for many financial applications, and censoring competing bids offers an\neasy-to-model motivation for our adversary. Traditional proof-of-stake\nblockchains have poor enough censorship resistance that it is difficult to\nretain the integrity of an auction when bids can only be submitted in a single\nblock. As the number of bidders $n$ in a single block auction increases, the\nprobability that the winner is not the adversary, and the economic efficiency\nof the auction, both decrease faster than $1/n$. Running the auction over\nmultiple blocks, each with a different proposer, alleviates the problem only if\nthe number of blocks grows faster than the number of bidders. We argue that\nblockchains with more than one concurrent proposer have can have strong\ncensorship resistance. We achieve this by setting up a prisoner's dilemma among\nthe proposers using conditional tips.",

            "summary": "Akbarpour and Li (2020) formalized credibility as an auction desideratum\nwhere the auctioneer cannot benefit by implementing undetectable deviations\nfrom the promised auction and showed that, in the plain model, the ascending\nprice auction with reserves is the only credible, strategyproof,\nrevenue-optimal auction. Ferreira and Weinberg (2020) proposed the Deferred\nRevelation Auction (DRA) as a communication efficient auction that avoids the\nuniqueness results from Akbarpour and Li (2020) assuming the existence of\ncryptographic commitments and as long as bidder valuations are MHR. They also\nshowed DRA is not credible in settings where bidder valuations are\n$\\alpha$-strongly regular unless $\\alpha > 1$. In this paper, we ask if\nblockchains allow us to design a larger class of credible auctions. We answer\nthis question positively, by showing that DRA is credible even for\n$\\alpha$-strongly regular distributions for all $\\alpha > 0$ if implemented\nover a secure and censorship-resistant blockchain. We argue ledgers provide two\nproperties that limit deviations from a self-interested auctioneer. First, the\nexistence of smart contracts allows one to extend the concept of credibility to\nsettings where the auctioneer does not have a reputation -- one of the main\nlimitations for the definition of credibility from Akbarpour and Li (2020).\nSecond, blockchains allow us to implement mechanisms over a public broadcast\nchannel, removing the adaptive undetectable deviations driving the negative\nresults of Ferreira and Weinberg (2020).",

As a\nresult digital assets such as social media content cryptocurrencies and\nnon-fungible tokens have become increasingly valuable and widespread, leading\nto the need for clear and secure mechanisms for transferring these assets upon\nthe testators death or incapacitation. This study proposes a framework for\ndigital inheritance using soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet as a\nuse case in the Polkadot and Kusama blockchain networks. The findings discussed\nwithin this study suggest that while soulbound tokens and the social recovery\npallet offer a promising solution for creating a digital inheritance plan the\nfindings also raise important considerations for testators digital executors\nand developers.

In contrast to the stylized centralized\nplatform, the decentralized platform is powered by blockchain technology, which\nallows for secure and transparent Peer-to-Peer transactions among users.\nTraditional single-chain-based blockchains suffer from the well-known\nblockchain trilemma. Beyond the single-chain-based scheme, decentralized\nhigh-throughput blockchains adopt parallel protocols to reconcile the\nblockchain trilemma, implementing any tasking and desired allocation. However,\nunneglectable network latency may induce partial observability, resulting in\nincoordination and misallocation issues for the decentralized transaction\npackaging process at the current high-throughput blockchain protocols.\n  To address this problem, we consider a strategic coordination mechanism for\nthe decentralized transaction packaging process by using a game-theoretic\napproach. Under a tractable two-period model, we find a Bayesian Nash\nequilibrium of the miner's strategic transaction packaging under partial\nobservability. Along with novel algorithms for computing equilibrium payoffs,\nwe show that the decentralized platform can achieve an efficient and stable\nmarket outcome. The model also highlights that the proposed mechanism can\nendogenously offer a base fee per gas without any restructuration of the\ninitial blockchain transaction fee mechanism. The theoretical results that\nunderlie the algorithms also imply bounds on the computational complexity of\nequilibrium payoffs.",

In order to keep up with the computational complexity of simulations\nand analysis of real data, distributed computing approaches are commonly\nemployed.

But the use of semantic communication raises a security issue\nbecause attackers could send malicious semantic data with similar semantic\ninformation but different desired content to break Metaverse services and cause\nwrong output of AIGC. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose a\nblockchain-aided semantic communication framework for AIGC services in virtual\ntransportation networks to facilitate interactions of the physical and virtual\ndomains among VSPs and edge devices. We illustrate a training-based targeted\nsemantic attack scheme to generate adversarial semantic data by various loss\nfunctions. We also design a semantic defense scheme that uses the blockchain\nand zero-knowledge proofs to tell the difference between the semantic\nsimilarities of adversarial and authentic semantic data and to check the\nauthenticity of semantic data transformations. Simulation results show that the\nproposed defense method can reduce the semantic similarity of the adversarial\nsemantic data and the authentic ones by up to 30% compared with the attack\nscheme.",

            "summary": "Distributed algorithms solving agreement problems like consensus or state\nmachine replication are essential components of modern fault-tolerant\ndistributed services. They are also notoriously hard to understand and reason\nabout. Their complexity stems from the different assumptions on the environment\nthey operate with, i.e., process or network link failures, Byzantine failures\netc. In this paper, we propose a novel abstract representation of the dynamics\nof such protocols which focuses on quorums of responses (votes) to a request\n(proposal) that form during a run of the protocol. We show that focusing on\nsuch quorums, a run of a protocol can be viewed as working over a tree\nstructure where different branches represent different possible outcomes of the\nprotocol, the goal being to stabilize on the choice of a fixed branch. This\nabstraction resembles the description of recent protocols used in Blockchain\ninfrastructures, e.g., the protocol supporting Bitcoin or HotStuff. We show\nthat this abstraction supports reasoning about the safety of various\nalgorithms, e.g., Paxos, PBFT, Raft, and HotStuff, in a uniform way. In\ngeneral, it provides a novel induction based argument for proving that such\nprotocols are safe.",

            "summary": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) opens up a challenging research area\ntowards improving secure data sharing which currently has several limitations.\nPrimarily, the lack of inbuilt guarantees of honest behavior of participating,\nsuch as end-users or cloud behaving maliciously may result in disputes. Given\nsuch challenges, we propose a fair, accountable, and secure data sharing\nscheme, $\\textit{FairShare}$ for IIoT. In this scheme, data collected from IoT\ndevices are processed and stored in cloud servers with intermediate fog nodes\nfacilitating computation. Authorized clients can access this data against some\nfee to make strategic decisions for improving the operational services of the\nIIoT system. By enabling blockchain, $\\textit{FairShare}$ prevents fraudulent\nactivities and thereby achieves fairness such that each party gets their\nrightful outcome in terms of data or penalty/rewards while simultaneously\nensuring accountability of the services provided by the parties. Additionally,\nsmart contracts are designed to act as a mediator during any dispute by\nenforcing payment settlement. Further, security and privacy of data are ensured\nby suitably applying cryptographic techniques like proxy re-encryption. We\nprove $\\textit{FairShare}$ to be secure as long as at least one of the parties\nis honest. We validate $\\textit{FairShare}$ with a theoretical overhead\nanalysis. We also build a prototype in Ethereum to estimate performance and\njustify comparable results with a state-of-the-art scheme both via simulation\nand a realistic testbed setup. We observe an additional communication overhead\nof 256 bytes and a cost of deployment of 1.01 USD in Ethereum which are\nconstant irrespective of file size.",

Thus, the decentralized autonomous\norganization running the protocols saw no alternative to intervention -\nrestricting users' ability to borrow.\n  We investigate the effects of the merge and the aforementioned intervention\non the two biggest lending protocols on Ethereum: AAVE and Compound. Our\nanalysis finds that borrowing rates were extremely volatile, jumping by two\norders of magnitude, and borrowing at times reached 100% of the available\nfunds.

Meanwhile, various vulnerabilities in smart\ncontracts have been exploited by attackers to steal cryptocurrencies worth\nmillions of dollars. The automatic detection of smart contract vulnerabilities\ntherefore is an essential research problem. Existing solutions to this problem\nparticularly rely on human experts to define features or different rules to\ndetect vulnerabilities. However, this often causes many vulnerabilities to be\nignored, and they are inefficient in detecting new vulnerabilities. In this\nstudy, to overcome such challenges, we propose a framework to automatically\ndetect vulnerabilities in smart contracts on the blockchain. More specifically,\nfirst, we utilize novel feature vector generation techniques from bytecode of\nsmart contract since the source code of smart contracts are rarely available in\npublic. Next, the collected vectors are fed into our novel metric\nlearning-based deep neural network(DNN) to get the detection result. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks, and the quantitative\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",

            "summary": "Ethereum is a permissionless blockchain ecosystem that supports execution of\nsmart contracts, the key enablers of decentralized finance (DeFi) and\nnon-fungible tokens (NFT). However, the expressiveness of Ethereum smart\ncontracts is a double-edged sword: while it enables blockchain programmability,\nit also introduces security vulnerabilities, i.e., the exploitable\ndiscrepancies between expected and actual behaviors of the contract code. To\naddress these discrepancies and increase the vulnerability coverage, we propose\na new smart contract security testing approach called transaction\nencapsulation. The core idea lies in the local execution of transactions on a\nfully-synchronized yet isolated Ethereum node, which creates a preview of\noutcomes of transaction sequences on the current state of blockchain. This\napproach poses a critical technical challenge -- the well-known\ntime-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) problem, i.e., the assurance that the final\ntransactions will exhibit the same execution paths as the encapsulated test\ntransactions. In this work, we determine the exact conditions for guaranteed\nexecution path replicability of the tested transactions, and implement a\ntransaction testing tool, TxT, which reveals the actual outcomes of Ethereum\ntransactions. To ensure the correctness of testing, TxT deterministically\nverifies whether a given sequence of transactions ensues an identical execution\npath on the current state of blockchain. We analyze over 1.3 billion Ethereum\ntransactions and determine that 96.5% of them can be verified by TxT. We\nfurther show that TxT successfully reveals the suspicious behaviors associated\nwith 31 out of 37 vulnerabilities (83.8% coverage) in the smart contract\nweakness classification (SWC) registry. In comparison, the vulnerability\ncoverage of all the existing defense approaches combined only reaches 40.5%.",

Recently, it finds applications in blockchain,\nwhere several users want to jointly authorize a payment through a\nmulti-signature. However, in this setting, there is no centralized authority\nand it could suffer from a rogue key attack where the attacker can generate his\nown keys arbitrarily. Further, to minimize the storage on blockchain, it is\ndesired that the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature are both as\nshort as possible. In this paper, we find a compiler that converts a kind of\nidentification (ID) scheme (which we call a linear ID) to a multi-signature so\nthat both the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature have a size\nindependent of the number of signers. Our compiler is provably secure. The\nadvantage of our results is that we reduce a multi-party problem to a weakly\nsecure two-party problem. We realize our compiler with two ID schemes.

Typically, equilibria of games are analyzed in vitro, under the\nassumption that players cannot arbitrarily commit to strategies. However,\nequilibria thus obtained do not hold in general in vivo, when games are\ndeployed on a blockchain. Being able to deploy side contracts changes\nfundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game wherein agents\nstrategize to deploy the best contracts. Not taking side contracts into account\nthus fails to capture an important aspect of deploying smart contracts in\npractice. A game that remains secure when the players can deploy side contracts\nis said to be side contract resilient. We demonstrate the non-triviality of\nside contract resilience by analyzing two smart contracts for decentralized\ncommerce. These contracts have the same intended functionality, but we show\nthat only one is side contract resilient. We then demonstrate a side contract\nattack on first-price auctions, which are the transaction mechanisms used by\nmost major blockchains. We show that an agent may deploy a contract ensuring\ntheir transaction is included in the next block at almost zero cost while\nforcing most other agents to enter into a lottery for the remaining block\nspace. This benefits all the users, but is detrimental to the miners. This\nmight be cause for re-evaluation of the use of auctions in transaction fee\nmechanisms. We show that the attack works under certain conditions that hold\nwith high probability from natural distributions. The attack also works against\nthe transaction mechanism EIP-1559. Our work highlights an issue that is\nnecessary to address to ensure the secure deployment of smart contracts and\nsuggests that other contracts already deployed on major blockchains may be\nsusceptible to these attacks.",

Farmers are\nnot getting the accurate price and compensation of their products because of\nseveral reasons. The intermediate persons or say middlemen are controlling the\nprices and product delivery on their own. Due to lack of education,\ntechnological advancement, market knowledge, post-harvesting processes, and\nmiddleman involvement, farmers are always deprived of their actual pay and\nefforts. The use of blockchain technology can help such farmers to automate the\nprocess with high trust. We have presented our case study and analysis for the\nIndian sugarcane farming with data collected from farmers. The system\nimplementation, testing, and result analysis has been shown based on the case\nstudy. The overall purpose of our research is to emphasize and motivate the\nagricultural products and benefit the farmers with the use of blockchain\ntechnology.",

            "summary": "Data availability (DA) attack is a well-known problem in certain blockchains\nwhere users accept an invalid block with unavailable portions. Previous works\nhave used LDPC and 2-D Reed Solomon (2DRS) codes with Merkle trees to mitigate\nDA attacks. These codes perform well across various metrics such as DA\ndetection probability and communication cost. However, these codes are\ndifficult to apply to blockchains with large blocks due to large decoding\ncomplexity and coding fraud proof size (2D-RS codes), and intractable code\nguarantees for large code lengths (LDPC codes). In this paper, we focus on\nlarge block size applications and address the above challenges by proposing the\nnovel Polar Coded Merkle Tree (PCMT): a Merkle tree encoded using the encoding\ngraph of polar codes. We provide a specialized polar code design algorithm\ncalled Sampling Efficient Freezing and an algorithm to prune the polar encoding\ngraph. We demonstrate that the PCMT built using the above techniques results in\na better DA detection probability and communication cost compared to LDPC\ncodes, has a lower coding fraud proof size compared to LDPC and 2D-RS codes,\nprovides tractable code guarantees at large code lengths (similar to 2D-RS\ncodes), and has comparable decoding complexity to 2D-RS and LDPC codes.",

This review explores the benefits and challenges of\npatient-centric RPM architectures enabled with Internet of Things wearable\ndevices and sensors using the cloud, fog, edge, and blockchain technologies.\nThe role of AI in RPM ranges from physical activity classification to chronic\ndisease monitoring and vital signs monitoring in emergency settings. This\nreview results show that AI-enabled RPM architectures have transformed\nhealthcare monitoring applications because of their ability to detect early\ndeterioration in patients' health, personalize individual patient health\nparameter monitoring using federated learning, and learn human behavior\npatterns using techniques such as reinforcement learning.

To our\nknowledge, Shackled is the first and only fully on-chain 3D rendering engine\nfor Ethereum. In this work, we 1) provide three unique datasets for the purpose\nof using and benchmarking Shackled, 2) execute said benchmarks and provide\nresults, 3) demonstrate a potential use case of Shackled in the domain of\ntokenised generative art, 4) provide a no-code user interface to Shackled, 5)\nenumerate the challenges associated with programming complex algorithms in\nSolidity smart contracts, and 6) outline potential directions for improving the\nShackled platform.

It binds a data entry with a\nmembership configuration profile that describes responsible vehicles for\nachieving consensus for the data entry. As such, V-Guard produces chained\nconsensus results of both data entries and their residing membership profiles,\nwhich enables consensus to be achieved seamlessly under changing memberships.\nIn addition, V-Guard separates the ordering of transactions from consensus,\nallowing concurrent ordering instances and periodic consensus instances to\norder and commit data entries.

            "summary": "Hyperledger Fabric is a popular permissioned blockchain system that features\na highly modular and extensible system for deploying permissioned blockchains\nwhich are expected to have a major effect on a wide range of sectors. Unlike\ntraditional blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric\nuses the EOV model for transaction processing: the submitted transactions are\nexecuted by the endorsing peer, ordered and batched by the ordering services,\nand validated by the validating peers. Due to this EOV workflow, a\nwell-documented issue that arises is the multi-version concurrency control\nconflict. This happens when two transactions try to writes and read the same\nkey in the ledger at the same time. Existing solutions to address this problem\nincludes eliminating blocks in favor of streaming transactions, repairing\nconflicts during the ordering phase, and automatically merging the conflicting\ntransactions using CRDT (Conflict Free Replicated Data) techniques. In this\npaper, we propose a novel solution called Early Detection for MVCC Conflicts.\nOur solution detects the conflicting transactions at an early stage of the\ntransaction execution instead of processing them until the validation phase to\nbe aborted. The advantage of our solution is that it detects conflict as soon\nas possible to minimize the overhead of conflicting transaction on the network\nresulting in the reduction of the end-to-end transaction latency and the\nincrease of the system's effective throughput. We have successfully implemented\nour solution in Hyperledger Fabric. We propose three different implementations\nwhich realize early detection. Our results show that our solutions all perform\nbetter than the baseline Fabric, with our best solution SyncMap which improves\nthe goodput by up to 23% and reduces the latency by up to 80%.",

This paper introduces\nan approach to evaluating consensus algorithms and blockchain platforms in a\nhostile network environment with the presence of byzantine and other network\nfailures. The approach starts by using stochastic modeling to model the\nbehaviors of consensus algorithms under different typical and faulty\noperational scenarios. Next, we implemented a blockchain application using\ndifferent consensus protocols and tested their performance using chaos\nengineering techniques. To demonstrate our generic evaluation approach, we\nanalyze the performance of four permissioned blockchain platforms and their\nconsensus protocols. Our results showed that stochastic modeling is an\ninexpensive and efficient technique for analyzing consensus protocols. But they\ndo not represent the actual performance of the consensus protocols in a\nproduction environment. Moreover, an experiment with chaos engineering\nindicates that if two different blockchain platforms use the same blockchain\nalgorithm or protocol, we should not assume they will have similar performance.\nTherefore, It is also essential to consider the role of platform architecture\nand how the protocols are engineered in a given platform.",

            "summary": "A smart contract is a digital program of transaction protocol (rules of\ncontract) based on the consensus architecture of blockchain. Smart contracts\nwith Blockchain are modern technologies that have gained enormous attention in\nscientific and practical applications. A smart contract is the central aspect\nof a blockchain that facilitates blockchain as a platform outside the\ncryptocurrency spectrum. The development of blockchain technology, with a focus\non smart contracts, has advanced significantly in recent years. However\nresearch on the smart contract idea has weaknesses in the implementation\nsectors based on a decentralized network that shares an identical state. This\npaper extensively reviews smart contracts based on multi criteria analysis\nchallenges and motivations. Therefore, implementing blockchain in\nmulti-criteria research is required to increase the efficiency of interaction\nbetween users via supporting information exchange with high trust. Implementing\nblockchain in the multi-criteria analysis is necessary to increase the\nefficiency of interaction between users via supporting information exchange and\nwith high confidence, detecting malfunctioning, helping users with performance\nissues, reaching a consensus, deploying distributed solutions and allocating\nplans, tasks and joint missions. The smart contract with decision-making\nperformance, planning and execution improves the implementation based on\nefficiency, sustainability and management.\n  Furthermore the uncertainty and supply chain performance lead to improved\nusers confidence in offering new solutions in exchange for problems in smart\ncontacts. Evaluation includes code analysis and performance while development\nperformance can be under development.",

This is because optimizing smart contracts has direct\nconsequences on reducing the costs of deploying and executing the contracts, as\nthere are fees to pay related to their bytes-size and to their resource\nconsumption (called gas). Optimizing memory usage is considered a challenging\nproblem that, among other things, requires a precise inference of the memory\nlocations being accessed. This is also the case for the Ethereum Virtual\nMachine (EVM) bytecode generated by the most-widely used compiler,\n\\texttt{solc}, whose rather unconventional and low-level memory usage\nchallenges automated reasoning. This paper presents a static analysis,\ndeveloped at the level of the EVM bytecode generated by \\texttt{solc}, that\ninfers write memory accesses that are needless and thus can be safely removed.\nThe application of our implementation on more than 19,000 real smart contracts\nhas detected about 6,200 needless write accesses in less than 4 hours.\nInterestingly, many of these writes were involved in memory usage patterns\ngenerated by \\texttt{solc} that can be greatly optimized by removing entire\nblocks of bytecodes. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimization tools\ncannot infer such needless write accesses, and hence cannot detect these\ninefficiencies that affect both the deployment and the execution costs of\nEthereum smart contracts.",

However, since\nblockchains handle multiple aspects ranging from organizational governance to\nsmart contract design, a holistic approach that encompasses all the different\nlayers of a given blockchain system is required to ensure that all optimization\nopportunities are taken into consideration. In this vein, we define a\nmulti-level optimization recommendation approach that identifies optimization\nopportunities within a blockchain at the system, data, and user level. Multiple\nmetrics and attributes are derived from a blockchain log and nine optimization\nrecommendations are formalized. We implement an automated optimization\nrecommendation tool, BlockOptR, based on these concepts. The system is\nextensively evaluated with a wide range of workloads covering multiple\nreal-world scenarios. After implementing the recommended optimizations, we\nobserve an average of 20% improvement in the success rate of transactions and\nan average of 40% improvement in latency.",

In this work, we argue that deployment is crucial to\nunderstanding decentralized mechanisms in a real-world environment and an\nenabler to building more robust and sustainable systems. We highlight the\nmerits of deployment by comparing this approach with other experimental setups\nand show how our lab applied a deployment-first methodology. We then outline\nhow we use Tribler, our peer-to-peer file-sharing application, to deploy and\nmonitor decentralized mechanisms at scale.

            "summary": "Blockchain smart contracts have given rise to a variety of interesting and\ncompelling applications and emerged as a revolutionary force for the Internet.\nQuite a few practitioners have devoted themselves to developing tools for\ndetecting bugs in smart contracts. One line of efforts revolve around static\nanalysis techniques, which heavily suffer from high false-positive rates.\nAnother line of works concentrate on fuzzing techniques. Unfortunately, current\nfuzzing approaches for smart contracts tend to conduct fuzzing starting from\nthe initial state of the contract, which expends too much energy revolving\naround the initial state and thus is usually unable to unearth bugs triggered\nby other states. Moreover, most existing methods treat each branch equally,\nfailing to take care of the branches that are rare or more likely to possess\nbugs. This might lead to resources wasted on normal branches. In this paper, we\ntry to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) In generating function\ninvocation sequences, we explicitly consider data dependencies between\nfunctions to facilitate exploring richer states. We further prolong a function\ninvocation sequence S1 by appending a new sequence S2, so that S2 can start\nfuzzing from states that are different from the initial state. (2) We\nincorporate a branch distance-based measure to evolve test cases iteratively\ntowards a target branch. (3) We engage a branch search algorithm to discover\nrare and vulnerable branches, and design an energy allocation mechanism to take\ncare of exercising these crucial branches. We implement IR-Fuzz and extensively\nevaluate it over 12K real-world contracts. Empirical results show that: (i)\nIR-Fuzz achieves 28% higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing\napproaches, and (ii) IR-Fuzz detects more vulnerabilities and increases the\naverage accuracy of vulnerability detection by 7% over current methods.",

            "summary": "IoT has enabled the rapid growth of smart remote healthcare applications.\nThese IoT-based remote healthcare applications deliver fast and preventive\nmedical services to patients at risk or with chronic diseases. However,\nensuring data security and patient privacy while exchanging sensitive medical\ndata among medical IoT devices is still a significant concern in remote\nhealthcare applications. Altered or corrupted medical data may cause wrong\ntreatment and create grave health issues for patients. Moreover, current remote\nmedical applications' efficiency and response time need to be addressed and\nimproved. Considering the need for secure and efficient patient care, this\npaper proposes a lightweight Blockchain-based and Fog-enabled remote patient\nmonitoring system that provides a high level of security and efficient response\ntime. Simulation results and security analysis show that the proposed\nlightweight blockchain architecture fits the resource-constrained IoT devices\nwell and is secure against attacks. Moreover, the augmentation of Fog computing\nimproved the responsiveness of the remote patient monitoring system by 40%.",

            "summary": "The metaverse gradually evolves into a virtual world containing a series of\ninterconnected sub-metaverses. Diverse digital resources, including identities,\ncontents, services, and supporting data, are key components of the\nsub-metaverse. Therefore, a Domain Name System (DNS)-like system is necessary\nfor efficient management and resolution. However, the legacy DNS was designed\nwith security vulnerabilities and trust risks due to centralized issues.\nBlockchain is used to mitigate these concerns due to its decentralized\nfeatures. Additionally, it supports identity management as a default feature,\nmaking it a natural fit for the metaverse. While there are several DNS\nalternatives based on the blockchain, they either manage only a single type of\nidentifiers or isolate identities from other sorts of identifiers, making it\ndifficult for sub-metaverses to coexist and connect with each other. This paper\nproposes a Multi-Identifier management and resolution System (MIS) in the\nmetaverse, supporting the registration, resolution, and inter-translation\nfunctions. The basic MIS is portrayed as a four-tier architecture on a\nconsortium blockchain due to its manageability, enhanced security, and\nefficiency properties. On-chain data is lightweight and compressed to save on\nstorage while accelerating reading and writing operations. The resource data is\nencrypted based on the attributes of the sub-metaverse in the storage tier for\nprivacy protection and access control. For users with decentralization\npriorities, a modification named EMIS is built on top of Ethereum. Finally, MIS\nis implemented on two testbeds and is available online as the open-source\nsystem. The first testbed consists of 4 physical servers located in the UK and\nMalaysia while the second is made up of 200 virtual machines (VMs) spread over\n26 countries across all 5 continents on Google Cloud.",

            "summary": "A decentralized identity system that can provide users with self-sovereign\ndigital identities to facilitate complete control over their own data is\nparamount to Web 3.0. The accounting system on blockchain is an ideal archetype\nfor realizing Web 3.0 decentralized identity: users can create their accounts\nwithout registering with a central agent. Such an identity system is endowed\nwith anonymity property: nobody knows the account's owner because the\nrelationship between an account and the owner is invisible. Thus, user privacy\nis well protected even though the account's data is public. However, a\ndisadvantage of such complete anonymity is that users can create multiple\naccounts without authentication to obfuscate their activities on the\nblockchain. In particular, the current anonymous blockchain account system\ncannot accurately register the social relationships and interactions between\nreal human users, given the amorphous mappings between users and blockchain\nidentities. Mistrust can be a major hurdle to the large-scale deployment of Web\n3.0. This work proposes ZKBID, a zero-knowledge blockchain-account-based Web\n3.0 decentralized identity scheme, to overcome endemic mistrust in blockchain\naccount systems. ZKBID links souls (blockchain accounts) to humans (users) in a\none-to-one manner to truly reflect the societal relationships and interactions\nbetween humans on the blockchain. With ZKBID, the users are accountable for\ntheir accounts anonymously, preserving privacy. ZKBID authenticates users using\nface match and then maps authenticated users to accounts. Zero-knowledge proofs\nencode the face match results, and user-account mappings employ linkable ring\nsignatures to preserve anonymity. We implemented ZKBID and built a blockchain\ntest network for evaluation purposes. Our tests demonstrate the effectiveness\nof ZKBID and suggest proper ways to configure ZKBID system parameters.",

However, the subsequent rapid decline in NFT market fever in the\nsecond quarter of 2022 casts doubts on the ostensible boom in the NFT market.\nTo date, there has been no comprehensive and systematic study of the NFT trade\nmarket or of the NFT bubble and hype phenomenon. To fill this gap, we conduct\nan in-depth investigation of the whole Ethereum ERC721 and ERC1155 NFT\necosystem via graph analysis and apply several metrics to measure the\ncharacteristics of NFTs. By collecting data from the whole blockchain, we\nconstruct three graphs, namely NFT create graph, NFT transfer graph, and NFT\nhold graph, to characterize the NFT traders, analyze the characteristics of\nNFTs, and discover many observations and insights.

This problem is further augmented by the discovery of novel\nor cold-start items. For example, after a user displays interest in bitcoin\nfinancial investment shows in the podcast space, a recommender system may want\nto suggest, e.g., a newly released blockchain episode from a more technical\nshow. Episode correlations help the discovery, especially when interaction data\nof episodes is limited. Accordingly, we build upon the classical Two-Tower\nmodel and introduce the novel Multi-Source Augmentations using a Contrastive\nLearning framework (MSACL) to enhance episode embedding learning by\nincorporating positive episodes from numerous correlated semantics.

            "summary": "Blockchain, also coined as decentralized AI, has the potential to empower AI\nto be more trustworthy by creating a decentralized trust of privacy, security,\nand audibility. However, systematic studies on the design principle of\nblockchain as a trust engine for an integrated society of\ncyber-physical-social-system (CPSS) are still absent. In this article, we\nprovide an initiative for seeking the design principle of blockchain for a\nbetter digital world. Using a hybrid method of qualitative and quantitative\nstudies, we examine the past origin, the current development, and the future\ndirections of blockchain design principles. We have three findings. First, the\nanswer to whether blockchain lives up to its original design principle as a\ndistributed database is controversial. Second, the current development of the\nblockchain community reveals a taxonomy of 7 categories, namely, privacy and\nsecurity, scalability, decentralization, applicability, governance and\nregulation, system design, and cross-chain interoperability. Both research and\npractice are more centered around the first category of privacy and security\nand the fourth category of applicability. Future scholars, practitioners, and\npolicy-makers have vast opportunities in other, much less exploited facets and\nthe synthesis at the interface of multiple aspects. Finally, in\ncounter-examples, we conclude that a synthetic solution that crosses discipline\nboundaries is necessary to close the gaps between the current design of\nblockchain and the design principle of a trust engine for a truly intelligent\nworld.",

Then it goes through\nthe privacy and security issues inside the metaverse from data-centric,\nlearning-centric, and human-centric points-of-view. The authors address private\nand secure mechanisms for privatizing sensitive data attributes and securing\nmachine learning algorithms running in a distributed manner within the\nmetaverse platforms. Novel visions and less-investigated methods are reviewed\nto help mobile network operators and metaverse service providers facilitate the\nrealization of secure and private MaaS through different layers of the\nmetaverse, ranging from the access layer to the social interactions among\nclients. Later in the article, it has been explained how the paradigm of edge\ncomputing can strengthen different aspects of the metaverse. Along with that,\nthe challenges of using edge computing in the metaverse have been\ncomprehensively investigated. Additionally, the paper has comprehensively\ninvestigated and analyzed 10 main challenges of MaaS platforms and thoroughly\ndiscussed how blockchain technology provides solutions for these constraints.\nAt the final, future vision and directions, such as content-centric security\nand zero-trust metaverse, some blockchain's unsolved challenges are also\ndiscussed to bring further insights for the network designers in the metaverse\nera.",

Differently\nfrom traditional financial scenarios, executing Know Your Customer verification\non Ethereum is rather difficult due to the pseudonymous nature of the\nblockchain. Fortunately, as the transaction records stored in the Ethereum\nblockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts\nor detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control\ntechniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of\nde-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification. However,\nthese techniques cannot be used to ascertain the potential risks for all\naccounts and are limited by specific heuristic strategies or insufficient label\ninformation. These constraints motivate us to seek an effective rating method\nfor quantifying the spread of risk in a transaction network. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to address the problem of account risk rating on\nEthereum by proposing a novel model called RiskProp, which includes a\nde-anonymous score to measure transaction anonymity and a network propagation\nmechanism to formulate the relationships between accounts and transactions. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of RiskProp in overcoming the limitations of\nexisting models by conducting experiments on real-world datasets from Ethereum.\nThrough case studies on the detected high-risk accounts, we demonstrate that\nthe risk assessment by RiskProp can be used to provide warnings for investors\nand protect them from possible financial losses, and the superior performance\nof risk score-based account classification experiments further verifies the\neffectiveness of our rating method.",

            "summary": "The increase in the adoption of blockchain technology in different\napplication domains e.g., healthcare systems, supplychain management, has\nraised the demand for a data query mechanism on blockchain. Since current\nblockchain systems lack the support for querying data with embedded security\nand privacy guarantees, there exists inherent security and privacy concerns on\nthose systems. In particular, existing systems require users to submit queries\nto blockchain operators (e.g., a node validator) in plaintext. This directly\njeopardizes users' privacy as the submitted queries may contain sensitive\ninformation, e.g., location or gender preferences, that the users may not be\ncomfortable sharing. On the other hand, currently, the only way for users to\nensure integrity of the query result is to maintain the entire blockchain\ndatabase and perform the queries locally. Doing so incurs high storage and\ncomputational costs on the users, precluding this approach to be practically\ndeployable on common light-weight devices (e.g., smartphones). To this end,\nthis paper proposes $\\pi$QLB, a query language for blockchain systems that\nensures both confidentiality of query inputs and integrity of query results.\nAdditionally, $\\pi$QLB enables SQL-like queries over the blockchain data by\nintroducing relational data semantics into the existing blockchain database.\n$\\pi$QLB has applied the recent cryptography primitive, i.e., function secret\nsharing (FSS), to achieve confidentiality. To support integrity, we extend the\ntraditional FSS setting in such a way that integrity of FSS results can be\nefficiently verified. Successful verification indicates absence of malicious\nbehaviors on the servers, allowing the user to establish trust from the result.\nTo the best of our knowledge, $\\pi$QLB is the first query model designed for\nblockchain databases with support for confidentiality, integrity, and SQL-like\nqueries.",

            "summary": "Compact block, which replaces transactions in the block with their hashes, is\nan effective means to speed up block propagation in the Bitcoin network. The\ncompact block mechanism in Bitcoin counts on the fact that many nodes may\nalready have the transactions (or most of the transactions) in the block,\ntherefore sending the complete block containing the full transactions is\nunnecessary. This fact, however, does not hold in the Ethereum network.\nAdopting compact block directly in Ethereum may degrade the block propagation\nspeed significantly because the probability of a node not having a transaction\nin the sending block is relatively high in Ethereum and requesting the missing\ntransactions after receiving the compact block takes much additional time. This\npaper proposes hybrid-compact block (HCB), an efficient compact block\npropagation scheme for Ethereum and other similar blockchains. First, we\ndevelop a Secondary Pool to store the low-fee transactions, which are removed\nfrom the primary transaction pool, to conserve storage space. As simple\nauxiliary storage, the Secondary Pool does not affect the normal block\nprocessing of the primary pool in Ethereum. Second, we design a machine\nlearning-based transaction prediction module to precisely predict the missing\ntransactions caused by network latency and selfish behaviors. We implemented\nour HCB scheme and other compact-block-like schemes (as benchmarks) and\ndeployed a number of worldwide nodes over the Ethereum MainNet to\nexperimentally investigate them. Experimental results show that HCB performs\nbest among the existing compact-block-like schemes and can reduce propagation\ntime by more than half with respect to the current block propagation scheme in\nEthereum.",

            "summary": "Metaverse is an evolving orchestrator of the next-generation Internet\narchitecture that produces an immersive and self-adapting virtual world in\nwhich humans perform activities similar to those in the real world, such as\nplaying sports, doing work, and socializing. It is becoming a reality and is\ndriven by ever-evolving advanced technologies such as extended reality,\nartificial intelligence, and blockchain. In this context, Metaverse will play\nan essential role in developing smart cities, which becomes more evident in the\npost COVID 19 pandemic metropolitan setting. However, the new paradigm imposes\nnew challenges, such as developing novel privacy and security threats that can\nemerge in the digital Metaverse ecosystem. Moreover, it requires the\nconvergence of several media types with the capability to quickly process\nmassive amounts of data to keep the residents safe and well-informed, which can\nraise issues related to scalability and interoperability. In light of this,\nthis research study aims to review the literature on the state of the art of\nintegrating the Metaverse architecture concepts in smart cities. First, this\npaper presents the theoretical architecture of Metaverse and discusses\ninternational companies interest in this emerging technology. It also examines\nthe notion of Metaverse relevant to virtual reality, identifies the prevalent\nthreats, and determines the importance of communication infrastructure in\ninformation gathering for efficient Metaverse operation. Next, the notion of\nblockchain technologies is discussed regarding privacy preservation and how it\ncan provide tamper-proof content sharing among Metaverse users. Finally, the\napplication of distributed Metaverse for social good is highlighted.",

            "summary": "Scalability problems in programmable blockchains have created a strong demand\nfor secure methods that move the bulk of computation outside the blockchain.\nOne of the preferred solutions to this problem involves off-chain computers\nthat compete interactively to prove to the limited blockchain that theirs is\nthe correct result of a given intensive computation. Each off-chain computer\nspends effort linear on the cost of the computation, while the blockchain\nadjudicates disputes spending only logarithmic effort. However, this effort is\nmultiplied by the number of competitors, rendering disputes that involve a\nsignificant number of parties impractical and susceptible to Sybil attacks. In\nthis paper, we propose a practical dispute resolution algorithm by which a\nsingle honest competitor can win disputes while spending effort linear on the\ncost of the computation, but only logarithmic on the number of dishonest\ncompetitors. This algorithm is a novel, stronger primitive for building\npermissionless fraud-proof protocols, which doesn't rely on complex economic\nincentives to be enforced.",

            "summary": "Front-running attacks have been a major concern on the blockchain. Attackers\nlaunch front-running attacks by inserting additional transactions before\nupcoming victim transactions to manipulate victim transaction executions and\nmake profits. Recent studies have shown that front-running attacks are\nprevalent on the Ethereum blockchain and have caused millions of US dollars\nloss. Vulnerable smart contracts, blockchain programs invoked by transactions,\nare held responsible for front-running attacks. Although techniques to detect\nfront-running vulnerabilities have been proposed, their performance on\nreal-world vulnerable contracts is unclear. There is no large-scale benchmark\nbased on real attacks to evaluate their capabilities. This motivates us to\nbuild a benchmark consisting of 513 real-world attacks with vulnerable code\nlabeled in 235 distinct smart contracts. We propose automated techniques to\neffectively collect real-world attacks and localize the corresponding\nvulnerable code at scale. Our experiments show that our approaches are\neffective, achieving higher recall in finding real attacks and higher precision\nin pinpointing vulnerabilities compared to the existing techniques. The\nevaluation of seven state-of-the-art vulnerability detection techniques on the\nbenchmark reveals their inadequacy in detecting front-running vulnerabilities,\nwith a low recall of at most 6.04%. Our further analysis identifies four common\nlimitations in existing techniques: lack of support for inter-contract\nanalysis, inefficient constraint solving for cryptographic operations, improper\nvulnerability patterns, and lack of token support.",

While current\ntechnologies still fail to address this problem fully, many research works\npropose sharding or other techniques that extensively adopt parallel processing\nof transactions. In these approaches, a potentially large number of committees\nof nodes independently perform consensus and process new transactions. Hence,\nin addition to regular intra-committee communication, (1) new transactions have\nto be delivered to the right committee, (2) committees need to communicate to\nprocess inter-shard transactions or (3) to exchange intermediate results. To\ncontrast slowly adaptive adversaries, committees should be frequently changed.\nHowever, efficient communication to frequently-changing committees is hard.\n  We propose a simple approach that allows us to implicitly select committee\nmembers and effectively deliver messages to all members of a specific\ncommittee, even when committees are changed frequently.

            "summary": "The scalability problem has been one of the most significant barriers\nlimiting the adoption of blockchains. Blockchain sharding is a promising\napproach to this problem. However, the sharding mechanism introduces a\nsignificant number of cross-shard transactions, which are expensive to process.\n  This paper focuses on the transaction allocation problem to reduce the number\nof cross-shard transactions for better scalability. In particular, we\nsystematically formulate the transaction allocation problem and convert it to\nthe community detection problem on a graph. A deterministic and fast allocation\nscheme TxAllo is proposed to dynamically infer the allocation of accounts and\ntheir associated transactions. It directly optimizes the system throughput,\nconsidering both the number of cross-shard transactions and the workload\nbalance among shards.\n  We evaluate the performance of TxAllo on an Ethereum dataset containing over\n91 million transactions. Our evaluation results show that for a blockchain with\n60 shards, TxAllo reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio from 98% (by using\ntraditional hash-based allocation) to about 12%. In the meantime, the workload\nbalance is well maintained. Compared with other methods, the execution time of\nTxAllo is almost negligible. For example, when updating the allocation every\nhour, the execution of TxAllo only takes 0.5 seconds on average, whereas other\nconcurrent works, such as BrokerChain (INFOCOM'22) leveraging the classic METIS\nmethod, require 422 seconds.",

            "summary": "Blockchain has become a popular emergent technology in many industries. It is\nsuitable for a broad range of applications, from its base role as an immutable\ndistributed ledger to the deployment of distributed applications. Many\norganizations are adopting the technology, but choosing a specific blockchain\nimplementation in an emerging field exposes them to significant technology\nrisk. Selecting the wrong implementation could expose an organization to\nsecurity vulnerabilities, reduce access to its target audience, or cause issues\nin the future when switching to a more mature protocol. Blockchain\ninteroperability aims to solve this adaptability problem by increasing the\nextensibility of blockchain, enabling the addition of new use cases and\nfeatures without sacrificing the performance of the original blockchain.\nHowever, most existing blockchain platforms need to be designed for\ninteroperability, and simple operations like sending assets across platforms\ncreate problems. Cryptographic protocols that are secure in isolation may\nbecome insecure when several different (individually secure) protocols are\ncomposed. Similarly, utilizing trusted custodians may undercut most of the\nbenefits of decentralization offered by blockchain-based systems. Even though\nthere is some research and development in the field of blockchain\ninteroperability, a characterization of the interoperability solutions for\nvarious infrastructure options is lacking. This paper presents a methodology\nfor characterizing blockchain interoperability solutions that will help focus\non new developments and evaluate existing and future solutions in this space.",

            "summary": "Decentralized Storage Networks (DSNs) can gather storage resources from\nmutually untrusted providers and form worldwide decentralized file systems.\nCompared to traditional storage networks, DSNs are built on top of blockchains,\nwhich can incentivize service providers and ensure strong security. However,\nexisting DSNs face two major challenges. First, deduplication can only be\nachieved at the directory-level. Missing file-level deduplication leads to\nunavoidable extra storage and bandwidth cost. Second, current DSNs realize file\nindexing by storing extra metadata while blockchain ledgers are not fully\nexploited. To overcome these problems, we propose FileDAG, a DSN built on\nDAG-based blockchain to support file-level deduplication in storing\nmulti-versioned files. When updating files, we adopt an increment generation\nmethod to calculate and store only the increments instead of the entire updated\nfiles. Besides, we introduce a two-layer DAG-based blockchain ledger, by which\nFileDAG can provide flexible and storage-saving file indexing by directly using\nthe blockchain database without incurring extra storage overhead. We implement\nFileDAG and evaluate its performance with extensive experiments. The results\ndemonstrate that FileDAG outperforms the state-of-the-art industrial DSNs\nconsidering storage cost and latency.",

However, the aggregator role introduces various security and\ntrust challenges. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based flexibility\ntrading framework dubbed PlexiChain to address the security and trust\nchallenges the aggregator poses in the centralised aggregator model. The\nsecurity evaluations performed using a real-world dataset show that PlexiChain\nis robust against known security attacks, such as MadIoT and False Data\nInjection attacks.

In such situations, the enterprise can\nbenefit from the concept of federated learning, in which machine learning\nmodels are constructed at various geographic sites. In this paper, we introduce\na general framework, namely BDSP, to share data among enterprises based on\nBlockchain and federated learning techniques. Specifically, we propose a\ntransparency contribution accounting mechanism to estimate the valuation of\ndata and implement a proof-of-concept for further evaluation.

            "summary": "Web3 aims at creating a decentralized platform that is competitive with\nmodern cloud infrastructures that support today's Internet. However, Web3 is\nstill limited, supporting only applications in the domains of content creation\nand sharing, decentralized financing, and decentralized communication. This is\nmainly due to the technologies supporting Web3: blockchain, IPFS, and libp2p,\nthat although provide a good collection of tools to develop Web3 applications,\nare still limited in terms of design and performance. This motivates the need\nto better understand these technologies as to enable novel optimizations that\ncan push Web3 to its full potential. Unfortunately, understanding the current\nbehavior of a fully decentralized large-scale distributed system is a difficult\ntask, as there is no centralized authority that has full knowledge of the\nsystem operation.\n  To this end, in this paper we characterize the workload of IPFS, a key\nenabler of Web3. To achieve this, we have collected traces from accesses\nperformed by users to one of the most popular IPFS gateways located in North\nAmerica for a period of two weeks. Through the fine analysis of these traces,\nwe gathered the amount of requests to the system, and found the providers of\nthe requested content. With this data, we characterize both the popularity of\nrequested and provided content, as well as their geo-location (by matching IP\naddress with the MaxMind database). Our results show that most of the requests\nin IPFS are only to a few different content, that is provided by large portion\nof peers in the system. Furthermore, our analysis also shows that most requests\nare provided by the two largest portions of providers in the system, located in\nNorth America and Europe. With these insights, we conclude that the current\nIPFS architecture is sub-optimal and propose a research agenda for the future.",

Existing\ncross-chain protocols suffer from the scalability problem when processing\non-chain transactions.

However, existing channel schemes can only be applied\nto operations within a single blockchain, failing to support cross-chain\nservices. Therefore in this paper, we propose Cross-Channel, the first\noff-chain channel to support cross-chain services. We introduce a novel\nhierarchical channel structure, a new hierarchical settlement protocol, and a\nsmart general fair exchange protocol, to ensure scalability, fairness, and\natomicity of cross-chain interactions. Besides, Cross-Channel provides strong\nsecurity and practicality by avoiding high latency in asynchronous networks.\nThrough a 50-instance deployment of Cross-Channel on AliCloud, we demonstrate\nthat Cross-Channel is well-suited for processing cross-chain transactions in\nhigh-frequency and large-scale, and brings a significantly enhanced throughput\nwith a small amount of gas and delay overhead.",

            "summary": "Transaction fee markets are essential components of blockchain economies, as\nthey resolve the inherent scarcity in the number of transactions that can be\nadded to each block. In early blockchain protocols, this scarcity was resolved\nthrough a first-price auction in which users were forced to guess appropriate\nbids from recent blockchain data. Ethereum's EIP-1559 fee market reform\nstreamlines this process through the use of a base fee that is increased (or\ndecreased) whenever a block exceeds (or fails to meet) a specified target block\nsize. Previous work has found that the EIP-1559 mechanism may lead to a base\nfee process that is inherently chaotic, in which case the base fee does not\nconverge to a fixed point even under ideal conditions. However, the impact of\nthis chaotic behavior on the fee market's main design goal -- blocks whose\nlong-term average size equals the target -- has not previously been explored.\nAs our main contribution, we derive near-optimal upper and lower bounds for the\ntime-average block size in the EIP-1559 mechanism despite its possibly chaotic\nevolution. Our lower bound is equal to the target utilization level whereas our\nupper bound is approximately 6% higher than optimal. Empirical evidence is\nshown in great agreement with these theoretical predictions. Specifically, the\nhistorical average was approximately 2.9% larger than the target rage under\nProof-of-Work and decreased to approximately 2.0% after Ethereum's transition\nto Proof-of-Stake. We also find that an approximate version of EIP-1559\nachieves optimality even in the absence of convergence.",

However, the integration of these devices\nbrings many security issues. To address these concerns, Blockchain technology\nhas been widely adopted due to its robust security characteristics, including\nimmutability, cryptography, and distributed consensus. However, implementing\nblockchain within these networks is highly challenging due to the limited\nresources of the employed devices and the resource-intensive requirements of\nthe blockchain. To overcome these challenges, a multitude of researchers have\nproposed lightweight blockchain solutions specifically designed for\nresource-constrained networks. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of\nlightweight blockchain solutions proposed in the literature. More precisely, we\nidentify five areas within the \"lightweight\" concept, namely, blockchain\narchitecture, device authentication, cryptography model, consensus algorithm,\nand storage method. We discuss the various methods employed in each\n\"lightweight\" category, highlighting existing gaps and identifying areas for\nimprovement. Our review highlights the missing points in existing systems and\npaves the way to building a complete lightweight blockchain solution for\nnetworks of resource-constrained devices.",

The\ndecentralized bank is a typical DeFi application. Ideally, a decentralized bank\nshould be decentralized in the transaction. However, many recent studies have\nfound that decentralized banks have not achieved a significant degree of\ndecentralization. This research conducts a comparative study among mainstream\ndecentralized banks. We apply core-periphery network features analysis using\nthe transaction data from four decentralized banks, Liquity, Aave, MakerDao,\nand Compound. We extract six features and compare the banks' levels of\ndecentralization cross-sectionally. According to the analysis results, we find\nthat: 1) MakerDao and Compound are more decentralized in the transactions than\nAave and Liquity. 2) Although decentralized banking transactions are supposed\nto be decentralized, the data show that four banks have primary external\ntransaction core addresses such as Huobi, Coinbase, and Binance, etc. We also\ndiscuss four design features that might affect network decentralization. Our\nresearch contributes to the literature at the interface of decentralized\nfinance, financial technology (Fintech), and social network analysis and\ninspires future protocol designs to live up to the promise of decentralized\nfinance for a truly peer-to-peer transaction network.",

Blockchain, as a trust\nmachine, is a cooperative institution in cyberspace that supports cooperation\nthrough distributed trust with consensus protocols. While studies in computer\nscience focus on fault tolerance problems with consensus algorithms, economic\nresearch utilizes incentive designs to analyze agent behaviors. To achieve\ncooperation on blockchains, emerging interdisciplinary research introduces\nrationality and game-theoretical solution concepts to study the equilibrium\noutcomes of various consensus protocols. However, existing studies do not\nconsider the possibility for agents to learn from historical observations.\nTherefore, we abstract a general consensus protocol as a dynamic game\nenvironment, apply a solution concept of bounded rationality to model agent\nbehavior, and resolve the initial conditions for three different stable\nequilibria. In our game, agents imitatively learn the global history in an\nevolutionary process toward equilibria, for which we evaluate the outcomes from\nboth computing and economic perspectives in terms of safety, liveness,\nvalidity, and social welfare. Our research contributes to the literature across\ndisciplines, including distributed consensus in computer science, game theory\nin economics on blockchain consensus, evolutionary game theory at the\nintersection of biology and economics, bounded rationality at the interplay\nbetween psychology and economics, and cooperative AI with joint insights into\ncomputing and social science. Finally, we discuss that future protocol design\ncan better achieve the most desired outcomes of our honest stable equilibria by\nincreasing the reward-punishment ratio and lowering both the cost-punishment\nratio and the pivotality rate.",

For\nthis aim, we propose a protocol of challenge-response using a memory chip. For\nthe central management, a central node controls the entry of electronic\nappliances with a memory chip into the network, and excludes a fake node (e.g.,\nthe spoofing entity) from the network that the central node manages. For the\ndecentralized communications, Merkle's tree turns out to be composed of memory\nchips to which the logical nodes are uniquely linked, respectively. The root of\nMerkle turns out to be the memory chip that stores the latest record of data\ntransactions. We can register this memory chip as a new block by satisfying the\nrequirement of the proof-of-consensus.

We argue that this\napproach (1) precludes the trust-minimized, permissionless participation of\nmultiple Ethereum client programs, magnifying monoculture failure risk; (2)\nleads to an unnecessarily large and complex trusted computing base that is\ndifficult to independently audit; and, (3) suffers from a frequently-triggered,\nyet opaque upgrade process--both further increasing auditing overhead and\ncomplicating on-chain access control. In this work, we aim to build a secure,\ntrust-minimized ORU that addresses these problems, while preserving scalability\nand dispute resolution efficiency.

The score function depends on several\nparameters (weights, caps, thresholds) that can be configured by applications\nusing GossipSub. The specification for GossipSub is written in English and its\nresilience to attacks from misbehaving peers is supported empirically by\nemulation testing using an implementation in Golang.\n  In this work we take a foundational approach to understanding the resilience\nof GossipSub to attacks from misbehaving peers. We build the first formal model\nof GossipSub, using the ACL2s theorem prover. Our model is officially endorsed\nby the GossipSub developers. It can simulate GossipSub networks of arbitrary\nsize and topology, with arbitrarily configured peers, and can be used to prove\nand disprove theorems about the protocol. We formalize fundamental security\nproperties stating that the score function is fair, penalizes bad behavior, and\nrewards good behavior. We prove that the score function is always fair, but can\nbe configured in ways that either penalize good behavior or ignore bad\nbehavior. Using our model, we run GossipSub with the specific configurations\nfor two popular real-world applications: the FileCoin and Eth2.0 blockchains.\nWe show that all properties hold for FileCoin. However, given any Eth2.0\nnetwork (of any topology and size) with any number of potentially misbehaving\npeers, we can synthesize attacks where these peers are able to continuously\nmisbehave by never forwarding topic messages, while maintaining positive scores\nso that they are never pruned from the network by GossipSub.",

            "summary": "Blockchains offer strong security guarantees, but they cannot protect the\nordering of transactions. Powerful players, such as miners, sequencers, and\nsophisticated bots, can reap significant profits by selectively including,\nexcluding, or re-ordering user transactions. Such profits are called\nMiner/Maximal Extractable Value or MEV. MEV bears profound implications for\nblockchain security and decentralization. While numerous countermeasures have\nbeen proposed, there is no agreement on the best solution. Moreover, solutions\ndeveloped in academic literature differ quite drastically from what is widely\nadopted by practitioners. For these reasons, this paper systematizes the\nknowledge of the theory and practice of MEV countermeasures. The contribution\nis twofold. First, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of 30 proposed MEV\ncountermeasures, covering four different technical directions. Secondly, we\nempirically studied the most popular MEV-auction-based solution with rich\nblockchain and mempool data. We also present the Mempool Guru system, a public\nservice system that collects, persists, and analyzes the Ethereum mempool data\nfor research. In addition to gaining insights into MEV auction platforms'\nreal-world operations, our study shed light on the prevalent censorship by MEV\nauction platforms as a result of the recent OFAC sanction, and its implication\non blockchain properties.",

            "summary": "A typical blockchain protocol uses consensus to make sure that mutually\nmistrusting users agree on the order in which their operations on shared data\nare executed. However, it is known that asset transfer systems, by far the most\npopular application of blockchains, can be implemented without consensus.\nAssuming that no account can be accessed concurrently and every account belongs\nto a single owner, one can efficiently implement an asset transfer system in a\npurely asynchronous, consensus-free manner. It has also been shown that\nimplementing asset transfer with shared accounts is impossible without\nconsensus.\n  In this paper, we propose CryptoConcurrency, an asset transfer protocol that\nallows concurrent accesses to be processed in parallel, without involving\nconsensus, whenever possible. More precisely, if concurrent transfer operations\non a given account do not lead to overspending, i.e. can all be applied without\nthe account balance going below zero, they proceed in parallel. Otherwise, the\naccount's owners may have to access an external consensus object. Notably, we\navoid relying on a central, universally-trusted, consensus mechanism and allow\neach account to use its own consensus implementation, which only the owners of\nthis account trust. This provides greater decentralization and flexibility.",

The high security in blockchain is undoubtedly a\ncritical factor for the network to handle important data item. On the other\nhand, according to the dilemma in blockchain, an overemphasis on distributed\nsecurity will lead to poor transaction-processing capability, which limits the\napplication of blockchain in data sharing scenarios with high-throughput and\nlow-latency requirements. To enable demand-oriented distributed services, this\npaper investigates the relationship between capability and security in\nblockchain from the perspective of block propagation and forking problem.\nFirst, a Markov chain is introduced to analyze the gossiping-based block\npropagation among edge servers, which aims to derive block propagation delay\nand forking probability. Then, we study the impact of forking on blockchain\ncapability and security metrics, in terms of transaction throughput,\nconfirmation delay, fault tolerance, and the probability of malicious\nmodification. The analytical results show that with the adjustment of block\ngeneration time or block size, transaction throughput improves at the sacrifice\nof fault tolerance, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the decline in security can be\noffset by adjusting confirmation threshold, at the cost of increasing\nconfirmation delay. The analysis of capability-security trade-off can provide a\ntheoretical guideline to manage blockchain performance based on the\nrequirements of data sharing scenarios.",

Often\nthese identifiers were simple alphanumeric strings, and which were assigned by\ngovernment agencies. These identifiers are then linked in some way to the\ncitizen, and where citizens often have to request access to documents that\nprove certain aspects of their citizenship. These systems, too, often use\npaper-based approaches and have little in the way of real digital trust. But,\nin an information age, we now have the ability to provide unique digital\nidentifiers for each citizen, and then for them to claim access to their\ncitizenship documents. This might be in the form of their academic\nqualifications, their tax status, or even their driver's licence. While, at one\ntime, these documents were either held by the trusted issuers of the\ninformation, or in a paper form, we now have the opportunity for these\ndocuments to be linked to a citizen wallet. This would allow citizens the\nopportunity to request documents once, but use them many times. A core part of\nthis is the unique private key associated with the citizen, and in the usage of\ndigital signing by trusted entities. While many countries have struggled to\nimplement a digital identity scheme, the EU Commission has the ambition to\nprovide every EU citizen with a digital wallet, and thus moved towards improved\nfreedom of movement and integration of the countries within the EU. The scale\nof this cannot be underestimated, and it could break down the barriers that\nhave been created by legacy systems.

UPX and SPX tokens purchase electricity from the utility company's\ndistribution lines and the photovoltaic panels. On July 1, 17 students in our\nschool dormitory participated in an experiment to confirm the operation of the\nEDISON-X system. Based on the results of this experiment, we discuss the energy\ntrading system using blockchain technology for the effective usage of renewable\nenergy. We develop topology and network science methodologies to understand the\ncharacteristics of energy trading. We test the hypothesis that market\ntransactions become less active when ``cavities'' appear using persistent\nhomology. The preliminary result implies that the hypothesis could be adopted.\nWe, however, need more data samples.",

However, the\nexisting smart contracts are not designed to provide secrecy in this context\nwithout sacrificing verifiability. Without a trusted third party for\nnotarization, the protocol for the verification of smart contracts has to be\nbuilt on cryptographic primitives. We propose a blockchain-based solution that\novercomes this challenge by storing the verifiable evidence as accessible data\non a blockchain in an appropriate manner. This solution allows for\ncryptographic data verification but not revealing the data itself. In addition,\nwith our proposal, it is possible to verify contracts whose form of existence\nhas been destroyed as long as the contract is real and the people involved\nremember it.",

However, concerns have emerged about possible wash trading, a\nform of market manipulation in which one party repeatedly trades an NFT to\ninflate its volume artificially. Our research examines the effects of wash\ntrading on the NFT market in Ethereum from the beginning until January 2022,\nusing multiple approaches. We find that wash trading affects 5.66% of all NFT\ncollections, with a total artificial volume of \\$3,406,110,774. We look at two\nways to profit from wash trading: Artificially increasing the price of the NFT\nand taking advantage of the token reward systems provided by some marketplaces.\nOur findings show that exploiting the token reward systems of NFTMs is much\nmore profitable (mean gain of successful operations is \\$1.055M on LooksRare),\nmore likely to succeed (more than 80% of operations), and less risky than\nreselling an NFT at a higher price using wash trading (50% of activities result\nin a loss).

The protection of sensitive\ninformation is achieved through the addition of noise into the query response\nwhich hides the individual records in a dataset. However, the noise addition\nnegatively impacts the accuracy which gives rise to privacy-utility trade-off.\nMoreover, the DP budget or cost $\\epsilon$ is often fixed and it accumulates\ndue to the sequential composition which limits the number of queries.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose a framework known as optimized\nprivacy-utility trade-off framework for data sharing in IoT (OPU-TF-IoT).\nFirstly, OPU-TF-IoT uses an adaptive approach to utilize the DP budget\n$\\epsilon$ by considering a new metric of population or dataset size along with\nthe query. Secondly, our proposed heuristic search algorithm reduces the DP\nbudget accordingly whereas satisfying both data owner and data user. Thirdly,\nto make the utilization of DP budget transparent to the data owners, a\nblockchain-based verification mechanism is also proposed. Finally, the proposed\nframework is evaluated using real-world datasets and compared with the\ntraditional DP model and other related state-of-the-art works. The results\nconfirm that our proposed framework not only utilize the DP budget $\\epsilon$\nefficiently, but it also optimizes the number of queries. Furthermore, the data\nowners can effectively make sure that their data is shared accordingly through\nour blockchain-based verification mechanism which encourages them to share\ntheir data into the IoT system.",

The multichannel mechanism, private data collection\nand querying mechanism of HF enable private data sharing, transparency,\ntraceability, and verification across the supply chain. However, the existing\nquerying mechanism of HF needs further improvement for statistical data sharing\nbecause the query is evaluated on the original data recorded on the ledger. As\na result, it gives rise to privacy issues such as leak of business secrets,\ntracking of resources and assets, and disclose of personal information.\nTherefore, we solve this problem by proposing a differentially private enhanced\npermissioned blockchain for private data sharing in the context of supply chain\nin IIoT which is known as (EDH-IIoT). We propose algorithms to efficiently\nutilize the $\\epsilon$ through the reuse of the privacy budget for the repeated\nqueries. Furthermore, the reuse and tracking of $\\epsilon$ enable the data\nowner to get ensure that $\\epsilon$ does not exceed the threshold which is the\nmaximum privacy budget ($\\epsilon_{t}$). Finally, we model two privacy attacks\nnamely linking attack and composition attack to evaluate and compare privacy\npreservation, and the efficiency of reuse of {\\epsilon} with the default\nchaincode of HF and traditional differential privacy model, respectively. The\nresults confirm that EDH-IIoT obtains an accuracy of 97% in the shared data for\n$\\epsilon_{t}$ = 1, and a reduction of 35.96% in spending of $\\epsilon$.",

            "summary": "Crypto-coins (also known as cryptocurrencies) are tradable digital assets.\nNotable examples include Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. Ownerships of cryptocoins\nare registered on distributed ledgers (i.e., blockchains). Secure encryption\ntechniques guarantee the security of the transactions (transfers of coins\nacross owners), registered into the ledger. Cryptocoins are exchanged for\nspecific trading prices. While history has shown the extreme volatility of such\ntrading prices across all different sets of crypto-assets, it remains unclear\nwhat and if there are tight relations between the trading prices of different\ncryptocoins. Major coin exchanges (i.e., Coinbase) provide trend correlation\nindicators to coin owners, suggesting possible acquisitions or sells. However,\nthese correlations remain largely unvalidated. In this paper, we shed lights on\nthe trend correlations across a large variety of cryptocoins, by investigating\ntheir coin-price correlation trends over a period of two years. Our\nexperimental results suggest strong correlation patterns between main coins\n(Ethereum, Bitcoin) and alt-coins. We believe our study can support forecasting\ntechniques for time-series modeling in the context of crypto-coins. We release\nour dataset and code to reproduce our analysis to the research community.",

Large-scale\nconcurrent access for massive wireless devices to accomplish the consensus\nprocedure may consume prohibitive communication and computing resources, and\nthus may limit the application of blockchain in wireless conditions. As most\nexisting consensus protocols are designed for wired networks, directly apply\nthem for wireless users may exhaust their scarce spectrum and computing\nresources. In this paper, we propose AirCon, a byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT)\nconsensus protocol for wireless users via the over-the-air computation. The\nnovelty of AirCon is to take advantage of the intrinsic characteristic of the\nwireless channel and automatically achieve the consensus in the physical layer\nwhile receiving from the end users, which greatly reduces the communication and\ncomputational cost that would be caused by traditional consensus protocols. We\nimplement the AirCon protocol integrated into an LTE system and provide\nsolutions to the critical issues for over-the-air consensus implementation.\nExperimental results are provided to show the feasibility of the proposed\nprotocol, and simulation results to show the performance of the AirCon protocol\nunder different wireless conditions.",

It is mainly driven by\nblockchain, semantic communication, edge computing, and artificial\nintelligence, which can construct value networks to achieve participatory\neconomics based on participatory decision making. Web 3.0 can capture the\ncharacteristics of blockchain, semantic extraction, and communication to\nachieve decentralized semantic sharing and transfer information precisely.\nHowever, current Web 3.0 solutions focus on the blockchain while overlooking\nother new technologies' roles in Web 3.0. To further unleash the advantages of\nsemantic extraction and communication in Web 3.0, in this paper, we propose a\nblockchain-based semantic exchange framework to realize fair and efficient\ninteractions. In this framework, we first attempt to tokenize semantic\ninformation into Non-Fungible Token (NFT) for semantic exchange. Then we\nutilize a Stackelberg game to maximize buying and pricing strategies for\nsemantic trading. We also leverage Zero-Knowledge Proof to share authentic\nsemantic information without publishing it before receiving payments, which can\nachieve a fair and privacy-preserving trading compared with current NFT\nmarketplaces. A case study about urban planning is given to show clearly the\nproposed mechanisms. Finally, several challenges and opportunities are\nidentified.",

            "summary": "Private blockchain as a replicated transactional system shares many\ncommonalities with distributed database. However, the intimacy between private\nblockchain and deterministic database has never been studied. In essence,\nprivate blockchain and deterministic database both ensure replica consistency\nby determinism. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis to uncover\nthe connections between private blockchain and deterministic database. While\nprivate blockchains have started to pursue deterministic transaction executions\nrecently, deterministic databases have already studied deterministic\nconcurrency control protocols for almost a decade. This motivates us to propose\nHarmony, a novel deterministic concurrency control protocol designed for\nblockchain use. We use Harmony to build a new relational blockchain, namely\nHarmonyBC, which features low abort rates, hotspot resiliency, and inter-block\nparallelism, all of which are especially important to disk-oriented blockchain.\nEmpirical results on Smallbank, YCSB, and TPC-C show that HarmonyBC offers 2.0x\nto 3.5x throughput better than the state-of-the-art private blockchains.",

These technologies provide\nsecurity, integrity, as well as confidentiality in their respective\napplications. Cloud computing has also been a popular comprehensive technology\nfor several years. Confidential information is often shared with the cloud\ninfrastructure to give customers access to remote resources, such as\ncomputation and storage operations. However, cloud computing also presents\nsubstantial security threats, issues, and challenges. Therefore, to overcome\nthese difficulties, we propose integrating Blockchain and SDN in the cloud\ncomputing platform. In this research, we introduce the architecture to better\nsecure clouds. Moreover, we leverage a distributed Blockchain approach to\nconvey security, confidentiality, privacy, integrity, adaptability, and\nscalability in the proposed architecture. BC provides a distributed or\ndecentralized and efficient environment for users. Also, we present an SDN\napproach to improving the reliability, stability, and load balancing\ncapabilities of the cloud infrastructure.

            "summary": "Bitcoin is one of the decentralized cryptocurrencies powered by a\npeer-to-peer blockchain network. Parties who trade in the bitcoin network are\nnot required to disclose any personal information. Such property of anonymity,\nhowever, precipitates potential malicious transactions to a certain extent.\nIndeed, various illegal activities such as money laundering, dark network\ntrading, and gambling in the bitcoin network are nothing new now. While a\nproliferation of work has been developed to identify malicious bitcoin\ntransactions, the behavior analysis and classification of bitcoin addresses are\nlargely overlooked by existing tools. In this paper, we propose BAClassifier, a\ntool that can automatically classify bitcoin addresses based on their\nbehaviors. Technically, we come up with the following three key designs. First,\nwe consider casting the transactions of the bitcoin address into an address\ngraph structure, of which we introduce a graph node compression technique and a\ngraph structure augmentation method to characterize a unified graph\nrepresentation. Furthermore, we leverage a graph feature network to learn the\ngraph representations of each address and generate the graph embeddings.\nFinally, we aggregate all graph embeddings of an address into the address-level\nrepresentation, and engage in a classification model to give the address\nbehavior classification. As a side contribution, we construct and release a\nlarge-scale annotated dataset that consists of over 2 million real-world\nbitcoin addresses and concerns 4 types of address behaviors. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art\nbitcoin address classifiers and existing classification models, where the\nprecision and F1-score are 96% and 95%, respectively.

However, high computational costs remain the primary roadblock\nhindering the successful application of TDA in real-world studies, particularly\nwith machine learning on large complex networks.\n  Indeed, most modern networks such as citation, blockchain, and online social\nnetworks often have hundreds of thousands of vertices, making the application\nof existing TDA methods infeasible. We develop two new, remarkably simple but\neffective algorithms to compute the exact persistence diagrams of large graphs\nto address this major TDA limitation. First, we prove that $(k+1)$-core of a\ngraph $\\mathcal{G}$ suffices to compute its $k^{th}$ persistence diagram,\n$PD_k(\\mathcal{G})$. Second, we introduce a pruning algorithm for graphs to\ncompute their persistence diagrams by removing the dominated vertices. Our\nexperiments on large networks show that our novel approach can achieve\ncomputational gains up to 95%.\n  The developed framework provides the first bridge between the graph theory\nand TDA, with applications in machine learning of large complex networks.

            "summary": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to establish flexible and\nreliable emergency networks in disaster sites when terrestrial communication\ninfrastructures go down. Nevertheless, potential security threats may occur on\nUAVs during data transmissions due to the untrusted environment and open-access\nUAV networks. Moreover, UAVs typically have limited battery and computation\ncapacity, making them unaffordable for heavy security provisioning operations\nwhen performing complicated rescue tasks. In this paper, we develop\nRescueChain, a secure and efficient information sharing scheme for UAV-assisted\ndisaster rescue. Specifically, we first implement a lightweight\nblockchain-based framework to safeguard data sharing under disasters and\nimmutably trace misbehaving entities. A reputation-based consensus protocol is\ndevised to adapt the weakly connected environment with improved consensus\nefficiency and promoted UAVs' honest behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a\nnovel vehicular fog computing (VFC)-based off-chain mechanism by leveraging\nground vehicles as moving fog nodes to offload UAVs' heavy data processing and\nstorage tasks. To offload computational tasks from the UAVs to ground vehicles\nhaving idle computing resources, an optimal allocation strategy is developed by\nchoosing payoffs that achieve equilibrium in a Stackelberg game formulation of\nthe allocation problem. For lack of sufficient knowledge on network model\nparameters and users' private cost parameters in practical environment, we also\ndesign a two-tier deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to seek the\noptimal payment and resource strategies of UAVs and vehicles with improved\nlearning efficiency. Simulation results show that RescueChain can effectively\naccelerate consensus process, improve offloading efficiency, reduce energy\nconsumption, and enhance user payoffs.",

            "summary": "Blockchain protocols implement total-order broadcast in a permissionless\nsetting, where processes can freely join and leave. In such a setting, to\nsafeguard against Sybil attacks, correct processes rely on cryptographic proofs\ntied to a particular type of resource to make them eligible to order\ntransactions. For example, in the case of Proof-of-Work (PoW), this resource is\ncomputation, and the proof is a solution to a computationally hard puzzle.\nConversely, in Proof-of-Stake (PoS), the resource corresponds to the number of\ncoins that every process in the system owns, and a secure lottery selects a\nprocess for participation proportionally to its coin holdings.\n  Although many resource-based blockchain protocols are formally proven secure\nin the literature, the existing security proofs fail to demonstrate why\nparticular types of resources cause the blockchain protocols to be vulnerable\nto distinct classes of attacks. For instance, PoS systems are more vulnerable\nto long-range attacks, where an adversary corrupts past processes to re-write\nthe history, than Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Storage systems.\nProof-of-Storage-based and Proof-of-Stake-based protocols are both more\nsusceptible to private double-spending attacks than Proof-of-Work-based\nprotocols; in this case, an adversary mines its chain in secret without sharing\nits blocks with the rest of the processes until the end of the attack.\n  In this paper, we formally characterize the properties of resources through\nan abstraction called resource allocator and give a framework for understanding\nlongest-chain consensus protocols based on different underlying resources. In\naddition, we use this resource allocator to demonstrate security trade-offs\nbetween various resources focusing on well-known attacks (e.g., the long-range\nattack and nothing-at-stake attacks).",

However, the openness of the\nblockchain may allow a malicious third party to introduce disinformation. In\nthis study, we employ ZKP and near-field communication (NFC) chips to eliminate\nthe possibility of disinformation introduction. ZKP is used to prove/validate\nchanges in the state of wood objects, and the unique nonce associated with that\nstate is encrypted and recorded on an NFC chip. The nonce is concealed and id\nof the wood object is defined as hash value of this nonce. We developed a\nprototype system based on an Android application and an Ethereum smart\ncontract.

This facilitates fully automated, guaranteed transactional\nexecution of atomic resource exchanges and more complex contracts, without a\nmultitude of intermediaries and expensive or slow semi-manual processes.\n  A didactic objective is separating money characteristics from technology\naspects such as specific blockchain and distributed ledger systems to help\ndisentangle discussions of digital money design from implementation techniques.\n  We finally discuss the power and role of programmable (contract-backed)\ndigital money in case studies: tokenization of invoice debt using smart\ncontracts on Ethereum, with stablecoins serving as digital money; smart\ncontracts for disbursing payments transparently and reliably in accordance with\nsocial legislation; and a Danish e-krone for crowdfunding public and private\ncommunity projets.\n  These contributions are made in independent chapters by participants of the\nWorking Group on Digital Cash at Copenhagen FinTech in 2018 and 2019, which\nhave not been published before.\n  Collectively, the contributions illustrate the design space and potential of\ndigital money when powered by smart digital contracts that effectively\neliminate both counterparty risk (somebody does not pay or does not deliver)\nand settlement risk (a trade fails and needs to be aborted) orders of magnitude\nfaster than in current financial practice.",

However, research has mostly ignored the\nsecure storage and privacy protection issues of collected personal\nneurophysiological data. Therefore, in this article, we try to bridge this gap\nand propose a secure privacy-preserving protocol for implementing BCI\napplications. We first transformed brain signals into images and used\ngenerative adversarial network to generate synthetic signals to protect data\nprivacy. Subsequently, we applied the paradigm of transfer learning for signal\nclassification. The proposed method was evaluated by a case study and results\nindicate that real electroencephalogram data augmented with artificially\ngenerated samples provide superior classification performance. In addition, we\nproposed a blockchain-based scheme and developed a prototype on Ethereum, which\naims to make storing, querying and sharing personal neurophysiological data and\nanalysis reports secure and privacy-aware. The rights of three main transaction\nbodies - construction workers, BCI service providers and project managers - are\ndescribed and the advantages of the proposed system are discussed. We believe\nthis paper provides a well-rounded solution to safeguard private data against\ncyber-attacks, level the playing field for BCI application developers, and to\nthe end improve professional well-being in the industry.",

Our scheme requires the seller to provide consumers with the correct\nencryption keys for proper execution and encourage a rational data executor to\nbehave faithfully for maximum benefits from rewards. We analyze the strategies\nof consumers, sellers, and dealers in the trading game and point out that\neveryone should be honest about their interests so that the game will reach\nNash equilibrium.

However, the power of smart contracts is enabled\nby interacting with stochastic off-chain data, which in turn opens the\npossibility to undermine the block-state consistency. To address this issue, an\noracle smart contract is used to provide a single consistent source of external\ndata; but, simultaneously, this introduces a single point of failure, which is\ncalled the oracle problem. To address the oracle problem, we propose an\nadaptive conformal consensus (ACon$^2$) algorithm that derives a consensus set\nof data from multiple oracle contracts via the recent advance in online\nuncertainty quantification learning. Interesting, the consensus set provides a\ndesired correctness guarantee under distribution shift and Byzantine\nadversaries.

            "summary": "We present in this paper a cryptocurrency called Mobile Fungible Token (MFT)\nor \"MiftyCoin\", which is mined with Proof of Human Work (PoH). Blocks in MFT's\nblockchain are mined by users solving unique 24-tile puzzles autogenerated as a\nfunction of block hash values. Each tile in the puzzle is a 4-sided domino-like\nsquare, where the number of dots per square is a function of a subset of the\nbits of a corresponding byte in the block's hash value. The objective is to\nfind a set of tile moves that end up in an arrangement with an optimal score;\nwhere each matching tile side increases the score by one. The block with the\nhighest score gets a reward. More information about MiftyCoin is available at:\nhttps://www.miftycoin.com.",

            "summary": "The increasing popularity of Internet of Everything and small-cell devices\nhas enormously accelerated traffic loads. Consequently, increased bandwidth and\nhigh data rate requirements stimulate the operation at the millimeter wave and\nthe Tera-Hertz spectrum bands in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G)\nwireless networks. Furthermore, efficient spectrum allocation, maximizing the\nspectrum utilization, achieving efficient spectrum sharing (SS), and managing\nthe spectrum to enhance the system performance remain challenging. To this end,\nrecent studies have implemented artificial intelligence and machine learning\ntechniques, enabling intelligent and efficient spectrum leveraging. However,\ndespite many recent research advances focused on maximizing utilization of the\nspectrum bands, achieving efficient sharing, allocation, and management of the\nenormous available spectrum remains challenging. Therefore, the current article\nacquaints a comprehensive survey on intelligent SS methodologies for 5G and B5G\nwireless networks, considering the applications of artificial intelligence for\nefficient SS. Specifically, a thorough overview of SS methodologies is\nconferred, following which the various spectrum utilization opportunities\narising from the existing SS methodologies in intelligent wireless networks are\ndiscussed. Subsequently, to highlight critical limitations of the existing\nmethodologies, recent literature on existing SS methodologies is reviewed in\ndetail, classifying them based on the implemented technology, i.e., cognitive\nradio, machine learning, blockchain, and multiple other techniques. Moreover,\nthe related SS techniques are reviewed to highlight significant challenges in\nthe B5G intelligent wireless network. Finally, to provide an insight into the\nprospective research avenues, the article is concluded by presenting several\npotential research directions and proposed solutions.",

In our\nscheme, the transaction owner can set the updatable policy associated with the\ntransaction, and only users who meet the policy can become the redactor of the\ntransaction. In order to prevent redactors from abusing redacting right, we\nintroduce the concept of a witness group. A redacted transaction is legal if\nand only if it contains the signatures of redactor and witness group. We first\ngive the concept of witness group, and then show the proposed scheme. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that scheme is feasible and efficient through a series of\nexperiments and analysis.",

Unlike traditional in-game goods, once they had been\nwritten to the blockchains, P2E goods cannot be restored by the game operation\nteams even with chargeback fraud such as payment fraud, cancellation, or\nrefund. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel chargeback fraud prediction\nmethod, PU GNN, which leverages graph attention networks with PU loss to\ncapture both the players' in-game behavior with P2E token transaction patterns.\nWith the adoption of modified GraphSMOTE, the proposed model handles the\nimbalanced distribution of labels in chargeback fraud datasets.

Most existing approaches\nusually study networks with a single type of connection between vertices, while\nin many applications interactions between objects vary, yielding multiplex\nnetworks. We propose ANOMULY, a general, unsupervised edge anomaly detection\nframework for multiplex dynamic networks. In each relation type, ANOMULY sees\nnode embeddings at different GNN layers as hierarchical node states and employs\na GRU cell to capture temporal properties of the network and update node\nembeddings over time. We then add an attention mechanism that incorporates\ninformation across different types of relations. Our case study on brain\nnetworks shows how this approach could be employed as a new tool to understand\nabnormal brain activity that might reveal a brain disease or disorder.\nExtensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that ANOMULY\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Concurrent transaction execution\nis a promising technique to accelerate transaction processing and increase the\noverall throughput. Existing concurrency control algorithms, however, fail to\nobtain enough speedups in real-world blockchains due to the high-contention\nworkloads.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel operation-level concurrency control\nalgorithm designed for blockchains. The core idea behind our algorithm is that\nonly operations depending on conflicts should be executed serially, while all\nother conflict-free operations can be executed concurrently. Therefore, in\ncontrast to the traditional approaches, which block or abort the entire\ntransaction when encountering conflicts, our algorithm introduces a redo phase\nto resolve conflicts at the operation level by re-executing conflicting\noperations only. We also develop a set of data dependency tracking mechanisms\nto achieve precise identification and speedy re-execution for conflicting\noperations. We implement an open-source prototype based on Go Ethereum and\nevaluate it using real-world Ethereum blocks. The evaluation results show that\nour algorithm achieves an average speedup of 4.28$\\times$. If combined with\nstate prefetching techniques, our approach can further accelerate the\ntransaction execution by 7.11$\\times$.",

            "summary": "In this work, we propose a stateless blockchain called CompactChain, which\ncompacts the entire state of the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) based\nblockchain systems into two RSA accumulators. The first accumulator is called\nTransaction Output (TXO) commitment which represents the TXO set. The second\none is called Spent Transaction Output (STXO) commitment which represents the\nSTXO set. In this work, we discuss three algorithms - (i) To update the TXO and\nSTXO commitments by the miner. The miner also provides the proofs for the\ncorrectness of the updated commitments; (ii) To prove the transaction's\nvalidity by providing a membership witness in TXO commitment and non-membership\nwitness against STXO commitment for a coin being spent by a user; (iii) To\nupdate the witness for the coin that is not yet spent; The experimental results\nevaluate the performance of the CompactChain in terms of time taken by a miner\nto update the commitments and time taken by a validator to verify the\ncommitments and validate the transactions. We compare the performance of\nCompactChain with the existing state-of-art works on stateless blockchains.\nCompactChain shows a reduction in commitments update complexity and transaction\nwitness size which inturn reduces the mempool size and propagation latency\nwithout compromising the system throughput (Transactions per second (TPS)).",

Numerous system security updates have been approved\nand installed in order to sort out security holes and bugs, and prevent attacks\nthat could expose personal or other valuable information. But those updates are\nnot sufficient and appropriate and new bugs keep showing up. In Bluetooth\ntechnology, pairing is identified as the step where most bugs are found and\nmost attacks target this particular process part of Bluetooth.

Blockchain technology is promising to be\nincorporated well in a network of smart devices, and secure an Internet of\nThings (IoT), where Bluetooth technology is being extensively used. This work\npresents a vulnerability discovered in Bluetooth pairing process, and proposes\na Blockchain solution approach to secure pairing and mitigate this\nvulnerability. The paper first introduces the Bluetooth technology and delves\ninto how Blockchain technology can be a solution to certain security problems.\nThen a solution approach shows how Blockchain can be integrated and implemented\nto ensure the required level of security.

            "summary": "In a space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), managing resources for the\ngrowing number of highly-dynamic and heterogeneous radios is a challenging\ntask. Symbiotic communication (SC) is a novel paradigm, which leverages the\nanalogy of the natural ecosystem in biology to create a radio ecosystem in\nwireless networks that achieves cooperative service exchange and resource\nsharing, i.e., service/resource trading, among numerous radios. As a result,\nthe potential of symbiotic communication can be exploited to enhance resource\nmanagement in SAGIN. Despite the fact that different radio resource bottlenecks\ncan complement each other via symbiotic relationships, unreliable information\nsharing among heterogeneous radios and multi-dimensional resources managing\nunder diverse service requests impose critical challenges on trusted trading\nand intelligent decision-making. In this article, we propose a secure and smart\nsymbiotic SAGIN (S^4) framework by using blockchain for ensuring trusted\ntrading among heterogeneous radios and machine learning (ML) for guiding\ncomplex service/resource trading. A case study demonstrates that our proposed\nS^4 framework provides better service with rational resource management when\ncompared with existing schemes. Finally, we discuss several potential research\ndirections for future symbiotic SAGIN.",

Thus, by transitivity, processes that do not even know of\nany common process may nevertheless have intersecting quorums and solve, for\nexample, reliable broadcast.

In this paper, private\nblockchain-based architecture Decentralized Smart City of Things (DSCoT) is\nproposed. It actively utilizes fog computing for all the users and smart\ndevices connected to a fog node in a particular management system in a smart\ncity, i.e., a smart house or hospital, etc. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have\nbeen utilized for representation to define smart device attributes. NFTs in the\nproposed DSCoT architecture provide devices and user authentication (IoT)\nfunctionality. DSCoT has been designed to provide a smart city solution that\nensures robust security features such as Confidentiality, Integrity,\nAvailability (CIA), and authorization by defining new attributes and functions\nfor Owner, User, Fog, and IoT devices authentication. The evaluation of the\nproposed functions and components in terms of Gas consumption and time\ncomplexity has shown promising results.

Despite its critical needs, state-of-the-art\nprivacy-preserving audit log schemes (e.g., Ghostor (NSDI '20), Calypso (VLDB\n'19)) do not fully obtain a high level of privacy, integrity, and immutability\nsimultaneously, in which certain information (e.g., user identities) is still\nleaked in the log.\n  In this paper, we propose Harpocrates, a new privacy-preserving and immutable\naudit log scheme. Harpocrates permits data store, share, and access operations\nto be recorded in the audit log without leaking sensitive information (e.g.,\ndata identifier, user identity), while permitting the validity of data\noperations to be publicly verifiable. Harpocrates makes use of blockchain\ntechniques to achieve immutability and avoid a single point of failure, while\ncryptographic zero-knowledge proofs are harnessed for confidentiality and\npublic verifiability. We analyze the security of our proposed technique and\nprove that it achieves non-malleability and indistinguishability. We fully\nimplemented Harpocrates and evaluated its performance on a real blockchain\nsystem (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric) deployed on a commodity platform (i.e.,\nAmazon EC2).

This comprises\nnew projects, maintenance and repairs, public employee compensation, and\nagricultural schemes. Low-level corruption, which is sometimes difficult to\ntrace and hinders state growth, is a big challenge for the top administration.\nIn order to eradicate corruption and bring transparency, technology can be used\nin an efficient way. An important task to exterminate corruption is to keep\ntrack of all the financial transactions of an undergoing project. This research\nuses blockchain technology to keep track of fund management systems and assure\nthe transparency of any financial statement. This paper proposes to use a\ngateway where all transaction records are updated in the system and visible to\nall stakeholders. We find research gaps in the literature and focus on\nincluding government funds and local currency usage. The proposed model's\nmotive is to generate a funding model that attains two sub-goals: designing a\nfund management methodology in which authorized individuals can receive and\nwithdraw allocated funds in crypto currency, and evaluating a smart contract to\nincorporate the money and identify transparency and tracking. The proposed\nmodel executes every feature of our system in just 8.3786ms on average.",

We propose a solution for such a problem based on the\nblockchain-based two-factor authentication scheme SmartOTPs, which we modify\nfor our purposes and utilize in the setting of two and half-factor\nauthentication against a centralized service provider. Our proposed solution\nconsists of four entities that interact together to ensure authentication: (1)\nthe user, (2) the authenticator, (3) the service provider, and (4) the smart\ncontract. Out of two and a half factors of our solution, the first factor\nstands for the private key, and the second and a half factor stands for\none-time passwords (OTPs) and their precursors, where OTPs are obtained from\nthe precursors (a.k.a., pre-images) by cryptographically secure hashing. We\ndescribe the protocol for bootstrapping our approach as well as the\nauthentication procedure. We make the security analysis of our solution, where\non top of the main attacker model that steals secrets from the client, we\nanalyze man-in-the-middle attacks and malware tampering with the client. In the\ncase of stolen credentials, we show that our solution enables the user to\nimmediately detect the attack occurrence and proceed to re-initialization with\nfresh credentials.",

Despite its usefulness, the\nblockchain is vulnerable to cyber assaults; for example, in January 2019 a 51%\nattack on Ethereum Classic successfully exposed flaws in the platform's\nsecurity. From a statistical point of view, attacks represent a highly unusual\noccurrence that deviates significantly from the norm. Blockchain attack\ndetection may benefit from Deep Learning, a field of study whose aim is to\ndiscover insights, patterns, and anomalies within massive data repositories. In\nthis work, we define an trusted two way intrusion detection system based on a\nHierarchical weighed fuzzy algorithm and self-organized stacked network (SOSN)\ndeep learning model, that is trained exploiting aggregate information extracted\nby monitoring blockchain activities. Here initially the smart contract handles\nthe node authentication. The purpose of authenticating the node is to ensure\nthat only specific nodes can submit and retrieve the information. We implement\nHierarchical weighed fuzzy algorithm to evaluate the trust ability of the\ntransaction nodes. Then the transaction verification step ensures that all\nmalicious transactions or activities on the submitted transaction by\nself-organized stacked network deep learning model. The whole experimentation\nwas carried out under matlab environment. Extensive experimental results\nconfirm that our suggested detection method has better performance over\nimportant indicators such as Precision, Recall, F-Score, overhead.",

To\ntackle this challenge, we propose to use distributed ledger technology (DLT) to\nachieve FLock, a secure and reliable decentralized Federated Learning system\nbuilt on blockchain. To guarantee model quality, we design a novel peer-to-peer\n(P2P) review and reward/slash mechanism to detect and deter malicious clients,\npowered by on-chain smart contracts. The reward/slash mechanism, in addition,\nserves as incentives for participants to honestly upload and review model\nparameters in the FLock system.

            "summary": "Decentralization has been touted as the principal security advantage which\npropelled blockchain systems at the forefront of developments in the financial\ntechnology space. Its exact semantics nevertheless remain highly contested and\nambiguous, with proponents and critics disagreeing widely on the level of\ndecentralization offered. To address this, we put forth a systematization of\nthe current landscape with respect to decentralization and we derive a\nmethodology that can help direct future research towards defining and measuring\ndecentralization. Our approach dissects blockchain systems into multiple\nlayers, or strata, each possibly encapsulating multiple categories, and enables\na unified method for measuring decentralization in each one. Our layers are (1)\nhardware, (2) software, (3) network, (4) consensus, (5) economics\n(\"tokenomics\"), (6) API, (7) governance, and (8) geography. Armed with this\nstratification, we examine for each layer which pertinent properties of\ndistributed ledgers (safety, liveness, privacy, stability) can be at risk due\nto centralization and in what way. Our work highlights the challenges in\nmeasuring and achieving decentralization, points to the degree of\n(de)centralization of various existing systems, where such assessment can be\nmade from presently available public information, and suggests potential\nmetrics and directions where future research is needed. We also introduce the\n\"Minimum Decentralization Test\", as a way to assess the decentralization state\nof a blockchain system and, as an exemplary case, we showcase how it can be\napplied to Bitcoin.",

As a lightweight test-generation approach, grey-box\nfuzzing can open up the possibility of improving the security of EOSIO smart\ncontracts. However, developing a practical grey-box fuzzer for EOSIO smart\ncontracts from scratch is time-consuming and requires a deep understanding of\nEOSIO internals. In this work, we proposed AntFuzzer, the first highly\nextensible grey-box fuzzing framework for EOSIO smart contracts. AntFuzzer\nimplements a novel approach that interfaces AFL to conduct AFL-style grey-box\nfuzzing on EOSIO smart contracts. Compared to black-box fuzzing tools,\nAntFuzzer can effectively trigger those hard-to-cover branches. It achieved an\nimprovement in code coverage on 37.5% of smart contracts in our benchmark\ndataset. AntFuzzer provides unified interfaces for users to easily develop new\ndetection plugins for continually emerging vulnerabilities. We have implemented\n6 detection plugins on AntFuzzer to detect major vulnerabilities of EOSIO smart\ncontracts. In our large-scale fuzzing experiments on 4,616 real-world smart\ncontracts, AntFuzzer successfully detected 741 vulnerabilities.

This article tries to build a model from the\nperspective of blockchain to make some breakthroughs.Internet Of Rights(IOR)\nmodel uses multi-chain technology to logically break down the consensus\nmechanism into layers, including storage consensus, permission consensus, role\nconsensus, transaction consensus etc. thus to build a new infrastructure, which\nenables data sources with complex organizational structures and interactions to\ncollaborate smoothly on the premise of protecting data privacy. With\nblockchain's nature of decentralization, openness, autonomy, immutability, and\ncontrollable anonymity, Internet Of Rights(IOR) model registers the ownership\nof data, enables applications to build ecosystem based on responsibilities and\nrights. It also provides cross-domain processing with privacy protection, as\nwell as the separation of data governance and rule governance. With the\nprocessing capabilities of artificial intelligence and big data technology, as\nwell as the ubiquitous data collection capabilities of the Internet of Things,\nInternet Of Rights(IOR) model may provide a new infrastructure concept for\nrealizing swarm intelligence and building a new paradigm of the Internet, i.e.\nintelligent governance.",

Ultra-low latency,\nhigh throughput, and high availability are a few of the main characteristics of\nmodern networks. Network Providers (NPs) are responsible for the development\nand maintenance of network infrastructures ready to support the most demanding\napplications that should be available not only in urban areas but in every\ncorner of the earth. The NPs must collaborate to offer high-quality services\nand keep their overall cost low. The collaboration among competitive entities\ncan in principle be regulated by a trusted 3rd party or by a distributed\napproach/technology which can guarantee integrity, security, and trust. This\npaper examines the use of blockchain technology for resource management and\nnegotiation among NPs and presents the results of experiments conducted in a\ndedicated real testbed. The implementation of the resource management mechanism\nis described in a Smart Contract (SC) and the testbeds use the Raft and the\nIBFT consensus mechanisms respectively. The goal of this paper is two-fold: to\nassess its performance in terms of transaction throughput and latency so that\nwe can assess the granularity at which this solution can operate (e.g. support\nresource re-allocation among NPs on micro-service level or not) and define\nimplementation-specific parameters like the consensus mechanism that is the\nmost suitable for this use case based on performance metrics.",

In this paper,\nwe propose two alternative protocols for structuring composable and robust\ncross-chain swaps.

Their needs are\nexpressed as predicates which capture acceptable payoff of each participant.\nOur proposed protocols are thus more expressive due to the introduction of\npredicates.

            "summary": "With the development of Web 3.0 which emphasizes decentralization, blockchain\ntechnology ushers in its revolution and also brings numerous challenges,\nparticularly in the field of cryptocurrency. Recently, a large number of\ncriminal behaviors continuously emerge on blockchain, such as Ponzi schemes and\nphishing scams, which severely endanger decentralized finance. Existing\ngraph-based abnormal behavior detection methods on blockchain usually focus on\nconstructing homogeneous transaction graphs without distinguishing the\nheterogeneity of nodes and edges, resulting in partial loss of transaction\npattern information. Although existing heterogeneous modeling methods can\ndepict richer information through metapaths, the extracted metapaths generally\nneglect temporal dependencies between entities and do not reflect real\nbehavior. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Metapath Feature Augmentation\n(TMFAug) as a plug-and-play module to capture the real metapath-based\ntransaction patterns during Ponzi scheme detection on Ethereum. The proposed\nmodule can be adaptively combined with existing graph-based Ponzi detection\nmethods. Extensive experimental results show that our TMFAug can help existing\nPonzi detection methods achieve significant performance improvements on the\nEthereum dataset, indicating the effectiveness of heterogeneous temporal\ninformation for Ponzi scheme detection.",

            "summary": "Ethereum is one of the most valuable blockchain networks in terms of the\ntotal monetary value locked in it, and arguably been the most active network\nwhere new blockchain innovations in research and applications are demonstrated.\nBut, this also leads to Ethereum network being susceptible to a wide variety of\nthreats and attacks in an attempt to gain unreasonable advantage or to\nundermine the value of the users. Even with the state-of-art classical ML\nalgorithms, detecting such attacks is still hard. This motivated us to build a\nhybrid system of quantum-classical algorithms that improves phishing detection\nin financial transaction networks. This paper presents a classical ensemble\npipeline of classical and quantum algorithms and a detailed study benchmarking\nexisting Quantum Machine Learning algorithms such as Quantum Support Vector\nMachine and Variational Quantum Classifier. With the current generation of\nquantum hardware available, smaller datasets are more suited to the QML models\nand most research restricts to hundreds of samples. However, we experimented on\ndifferent data sizes and report results with a test data of 12K transaction\nnodes, which is to the best of the authors knowledge the largest QML experiment\nrun so far on any real quantum hardware. The classical ensembles of\nquantum-classical models improved the macro F-score and phishing F-score. One\nkey observation is QSVM constantly gives lower false positives, thereby higher\nprecision compared with any other classical or quantum network, which is always\npreferred for any anomaly detection problem. This is true for QSVMs when used\nindividually or via bagging of same models or in combination with other\nclassical/quantum models making it the most advantageous quantum algorithm so\nfar. The proposed ensemble framework is generic and can be applied for any\nclassification task",

            "summary": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can significantly improve transportation\nefficiency and ensure traffic safety. Authentication is regarded as the\nfundamental defense line against attacks in IoV. However, the state-of-the-art\napproaches suffer from several drawbacks, including bottlenecks of the single\ncloud server model, high computational overhead of operations, excessive trust\nin cloud servers and roadside units (RSUs), and leakage of vehicle trajectory\nprivacy. In this paper, BEPHAP, a Blockchain-based Efficient Privacy-preserving\nHandover Authentication Protocol with key agreement for internet of vehicles,\nis introduced to address these problems. BEPHAP achieves anonymous cross-domain\nmutual handover authentication with key agreement based on the tamper-proof\nblockchain, symmetric cryptography, and the chameleon hash function under a\nsecurity model that cloud servers and RSUs may launch attacks. BEPHAP is\nparticularly well suited for IoV since it allows vehicles only need to perform\nlightweight cryptographic operations during the authentication phase. BEPHAP\nalso achieves data confidentiality, unlinkability, traceability,\nnon-repudiation, non-frameability, and key escrow freeness. Formal verification\nbased on ProVerif and formal security proofs based on the BAN logic indicates\nthat BEPHAP is resistant to various typical attacks, such as man-in-the-middle\nattacks, impersonation attacks, and replay attacks. Performance analysis\ndemonstrates that BEPHAP surpasses existing works in both computation and\ncommunication efficiencies. And the message loss rate remains 0 at 5000\nrequests per second, which meets the requirement of IoV.",

The\nresult is a blockchain being possibly produced in a tree-like form while\nparticipants try to finalize blocks. We categorize different attacks\njeopardizing the liveness of the protocol. The Ethereum community has responded\nby creating patches against some of them. We discovered a new attack on the\npatched protocol. To support our analysis, we propose a new high-level\nformalization of the properties of liveness and availability of the Ethereum\nblockchain, and we provide a pseudo-code. We believe this formalization to be\nhelpful for other analyses as well. Our results yield that the Ethereum\nProof-of-Stake has safety but only probabilistic liveness.

As alternatives, energy-conservation and energy-recycling\nmechanisms heaved in sight. In this paper, we propose proof of user similarity\n(PoUS), a distinct energy-recycling consensus mechanism, harnessing the\nvaluable computing power to calculate the similarities of users, and enact the\ncalculation results into the packing rule. However, the expensive calculation\nrequired in PoUS challenges miners in participating, and may induce plagiarism\nand lying risks. To resolve these issues, PoUS embraces the best-effort schema\nby allowing miners to compute partially. Besides, a voting mechanism based on\nthe two-parties computation and Bayesian truth serum is proposed to guarantee\nprivacy-preserved voting and truthful reports. Noticeably, PoUS distinguishes\nitself in recycling the computing power back to blockchain since it turns the\nresource wastage to facilitate refined cohort analysis of users, serving as the\nspatial measurer and enabling a searchable blockchain. We build a prototype of\nPoUS and compare its performance with PoW. The results show that PoUS\noutperforms PoW in achieving an average TPS improvement of 24.01% and an\naverage confirmation latency reduction of 43.64%.

            "summary": "In a practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) blockchain network, the\nvoting nodes may always leave the network while some new nodes can also enter\nthe network, thus the number of voting nodes is constantly changing. Such a new\nPBFT with dynamic nodes is called a dynamic PBFT. Clearly, the dynamic PBFT can\nmore strongly support the decentralization and distributed structure of\nblockchain. However, analyzing dynamic PBFT blockchain systems will become more\ninteresting and challenging.\n  In this paper, we propose a large-scale Markov modeling technique to analyze\nthe dynamic PBFT voting processes and its dynamic PBFT blockchain system. To\nthis end, we set up a large-scale Markov process (and further a\nmulti-dimensional Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD) process) and provide performance\nanalysis for both the dynamic PBFT voting processes and the dynamic PBFT\nblockchain system. In particular, we obtain an effective computational method\nfor the throughput of the complicated dynamic PBFT blockchain system. Finally,\nwe use numerical examples to check the validity of our theoretical results and\nindicate how some key system parameters influence the performance measures of\nthe dynamic PBFT voting processes and of the dynamic PBFT blockchain system.\nTherefore, by using the theory of multi-dimensional QBD processes and the\nRG-factorization technique, we hope that the methodology and results developed\nin this paper shed light on the study of dynamic PBFT blockchain systems such\nthat a series of promising research can be developed potentially.",

            "summary": "Blockchain is considered the critical backbone technology for secure and\ntrusted Internet of Things (IoT) in the future 6G network. However, deploying a\nblockchain system in a complex wireless IoT network is challenging due to the\nlimited resources, complex wireless environment, and the property of\nself-interested IoT devices. The existing incentive mechanism of blockchain is\nnot compatible with the wireless IoT network. In this paper, to incentivize IoT\ndevices to join the construction of the wireless blockchain network, we propose\na multi-dimensional contract to optimize the blockchain utility while\naddressing the issues of adverse selection and moral hazard. Specifically, the\nproposed contract considers the IoT device's hash power and communication cost\nand especially explores the connectivity of devices from the perspective of\ncomplex network theory. We investigate the energy consumption and the block\nconfirmation probability of the wireless blockchain network via simulations\nunder varied network sizes and average link probability. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that our proposed contract mechanism is feasible, achieves 35% more\nutility than existing approaches, and increases utility by 4 times compared\nwith the original PoW-based incentive mechanism.",

            "summary": "Blockchain intercommunication systems enable the exchanges of messages\nbetween blockchains. This interoperability promotes innovation, unlocks\nliquidity and access to assets. However, blockchains are isolated systems that\noriginally were not designed for interoperability. This makes cross-chain\ncommunication, or bridges for short, insecure by nature. More precisely,\ncross-chain systems face security challenges in terms of selfish rational\nplayers such as maximal extractable value (MEV) and censorship.\n  We propose to solve these challenges using zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for\ncross-chain communication. Securing cross-chain communication is remarkably\nmore complex than securing single-chain events as such a system must preserve\nuser security against both on- and off-chain analysis.\n  To achieve this goal, we propose the following pair of contributions: the\nDACT protocol and the SurferMonkey infrastructure that supports the DACT\nprotocol. The DACT protocol is a global solution for the anonymity and security\nchallenges of agnostic blockchain intercommunication. DACT breaks on- and\noff-chain analysis thanks to the use of ZKPs. SurferMonkey is a decentralized\ninfrastructure that implements DACT in practice. Since SurferMonkey works at\nthe blockchain application layer, any decentralized application (dApp) can use\nSurferMonkey to send any type of message to a dApp on another blockchain. With\nSurferMonkey, users can neither be censored nor be exposed to MEV. By applying\ndecentralized proactive security, we obtain resilience against selfish rational\nplayers, and raise the security bar against cyberattacks. We have implemented a\nproof of concept (PoC) of SurferMonkey by reverse engineering Tornado Cash and\nby applying IDEN3 ZKP circuits. SurferMonkey enables new usecases, ranging from\nanonymous voting and gaming, to a new phase of anonymous decentralized finance\n(aDeFi).",

            "summary": "There are a multitude of Blockchain-based physical infrastructure systems,\noperating on a crypto-currency enabled token economy, where infrastructure\nsuppliers are rewarded with tokens for enabling, validating, managing and/or\nsecuring the system. However, today's token economies are largely designed\nwithout infrastructure systems in mind, and often operate with a fixed token\nsupply (e.g., Bitcoin). This paper argues that token economies for\ninfrastructure networks should be structured differently - they should\ncontinually incentivize new suppliers to join the network to provide services\nand support to the ecosystem. As such, the associated token rewards should\ngracefully scale with the size of the decentralized system, but should be\ncarefully balanced with consumer demand to manage inflation and be designed to\nultimately reach an equilibrium. To achieve such an equilibrium, the\ndecentralized token economy should be adaptable and controllable so that it\nmaximizes the total utility of all users, such as achieving stable (overall\nnon-inflationary) token economies.\n  Our main contribution is to model infrastructure token economies as dynamical\nsystems - the circulating token supply, price, and consumer demand change as a\nfunction of the payment to nodes and costs to consumers for infrastructure\nservices. Crucially, this dynamical systems view enables us to leverage tools\nfrom mathematical control theory to optimize the overall decentralized\nnetwork's performance. Moreover, our model extends easily to a Stackelberg game\nbetween the controller and the nodes, which we use for robust, strategic\npricing. In short, we develop predictive, optimization-based controllers that\noutperform traditional algorithmic stablecoin heuristics by up to $2.4 \\times$\nin simulations based on real demand data from existing decentralized wireless\nnetworks.",

However, security and privacy\nthreats hinder us from building a utopia. A metaverse embraces various\ntechniques, while at the same time inheriting their pitfalls and thus exposing\nlarge attack surfaces. Blockchain, proposed in 2008, was regarded as a key\nbuilding block of metaverses. it enables transparent and trusted computing\nenvironments using tamper-resistant decentralized ledgers. Currently,\nblockchain supports Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-fungible Tokens (NFT)\nfor metaverses. However, the power of a blockchain has not been sufficiently\nexploited. In this article, we propose a novel trustless architecture of\nblockchain-enabled metaverse, aiming to provide efficient resource integration\nand allocation by consolidating hardware and software components. To realize\nour design objectives, we provide an On-Demand Trusted Computing Environment\n(OTCE) technique based on local trust evaluation. Specifically, the\narchitecture adopts a hypergraph to represent a metaverse, in which each\nhyperedge links a group of users with certain relationship. Then the trust\nlevel of each user group can be evaluated based on graph analytics techniques.\nBased on the trust value, each group can determine its security plan on demand,\nfree from interference by irrelevant nodes. Besides, OTCEs enable large-scale\nand flexible application environments (sandboxes) while preserving a strong\nsecurity guarantee.",

            "summary": "Financial fraud cases are on the rise even with the current technological\nadvancements. Due to the lack of inter-organization synergy and because of\nprivacy concerns, authentic financial transaction data is rarely available. On\nthe other hand, data-driven technologies like machine learning need authentic\ndata to perform precisely in real-world systems. This study proposes a\nblockchain and smart contract-based approach to achieve robust Machine Learning\n(ML) algorithm for e-commerce fraud detection by facilitating\ninter-organizational collaboration. The proposed method uses blockchain to\nsecure the privacy of the data. Smart contract deployed inside the network\nfully automates the system. An ML model is incrementally upgraded from\ncollaborative data provided by the organizations connected to the blockchain.\nTo incentivize the organizations, we have introduced an incentive mechanism\nthat is adaptive to the difficulty level in updating a model. The organizations\nreceive incentives based on the difficulty faced in updating the ML model. A\nmining criterion has been proposed to mine the block efficiently. And finally,\nthe blockchain network istested under different difficulty levels and under\ndifferent volumes of data to test its efficiency. The model achieved 98.93%\ntesting accuracy and 98.22% Fbeta score (recall-biased f measure) over eight\nincremental updates. Our experiment shows that both data volume and difficulty\nlevel of blockchain impacts the mining time. For difficulty level less than\nfive, mining time and difficulty level has a positive correlation. For\ndifficulty level two and three, less than a second is required to mine a block\nin our system. Difficulty level five poses much more difficulties to mine the\nblocks.",

But\nlittle is known about the real bug fixes in Solidity smart contract projects.\nTo understand the bug fixes and enrich the knowledge of bug fixes in real-world\nprojects, we conduct an empirical study on historical bug fixes from 46\nreal-world Solidity smart contract projects in this paper. We provide a\nmulti-faceted discussion and mainly explore the following four questions: File\nType and Amount, Fix Complexity, Bug distribution, and Fix Patches. We distill\nfour findings during the process to explore these four questions.

With careful selection of software\noptimizations and FPGA accelerator configuration, we improved energy efficiency\nof validator peer by 10$\\times$ compared to vanilla validator peer (i.e.,\nenergy-aware provisioning of validator peer can deliver 10$\\times$ more\nthroughput while consuming the same amount of energy).

            "summary": "We leverage blockchain technology for drone node authentication in internet\nof drone things (IoDT). During the authentication procedure, the credentials of\ndrone nodes are examined to remove malicious nodes from the system. In IoDT,\ndrones are responsible for gathering data and transmitting it to cluster heads\n(CHs) for further processing. The CH collects and organizes data. Due to\ncomputational load, their energy levels rapidly deplete. To overcome this\nproblem, we present a low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (R2D) protocol\nbased on distance, degree, and residual energy. R2D is used to replace CHs with\nnormal nodes based on the biggest residual energy, the degree, and the shortest\ndistance from BS. The cost of keeping a big volume of data on the blockchain is\nhigh. We employ the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), to address this issue.\nMoreover, IPFS protects user data using the industry-standard encryption\ntechnique AES-128. This standard compares well to other current encryption\nmethods. Using a consensus mechanism based on proof of work requires a high\namount of computing resources for transaction verification. The suggested\napproach leverages a consensus mechanism known as proof of authority (PoA) to\naddress this problem . The results of the simulations indicate that the\nsuggested system model functions effectively and efficiently. A formal security\nanalysis is conducted to assess the smart contract's resistance to attacks.",

The\nFaaS workers, called Paranoid Stateful Lambdas (PSLs), collaborate with one\nanother to perform large parallel computations. We exploit cryptographically\nhardened and mobile bundles of data, called DataCapsules, to provide persistent\nstate for our PSLs, whose execution is protected using hardware-secured TEEs.\nTo make PSLs easy to program and performant, we build the familiar Key-Value\nStore interface on top of DataCapsules in a way that allows amortization of\ncryptographic operations. We demonstrate PSLs functioning in an edge\nenvironment running on a group of Intel NUCs with SGXv2.\n  As described, our Secure Concurrency Layer (SCL), provides\neventually-consistent semantics over written values using untrusted and\nunordered multicast. All SCL communication is encrypted, unforgeable, and\nprivate. For durability, updates are recorded in replicated DataCapsules, which\nare append-only cryptographically-hardened blockchain with confidentiality,\nintegrity, and provenance guarantees. Values for inactive keys are stored in a\nlog-structured merge-tree (LSM) in the same DataCapsule. SCL features a variety\nof communication optimizations, such as an efficient message passing framework\nthat reduces the latency up to 44x from the Intel SGX SDK, and an actor-based\ncryptographic processing architecture that batches cryptographic operations and\nincreases throughput by 81x.",

Existing solutions to boost the trust using a\nstronger blockchain, e.g., via checkpointing, requires the weaker blockchain to\ngive up sovereignty. In this paper, we propose a family of protocols in which\nmultiple blockchains interact to create a combined ledger with boosted trust.\nWe show that even if several of the interacting blockchains cease to provide\nsecurity guarantees, the combined ledger continues to be secure - our\nTrustBoost protocols achieve the optimal threshold of tolerating the insecure\nblockchains. This optimality, along with the necessity of blockchain\ninteractions, is formally shown within the classic shared memory model,\ntackling the long standing open challenge of solving consensus in the presence\nof both Byzantine objects and processes. Furthermore, our proposed construction\nof TrustBoost simply operates via smart contracts and require no change to the\nunderlying consensus protocols of the participating blockchains, a form of\n``consensus on top of consensus''. The protocols are lightweight and can be\nused on specific (e.g., high value) transactions; we demonstrate the\npracticality by implementing and deploying TrustBoost as cross-chain smart\ncontracts in the Cosmos ecosystem using approximately 3,000 lines of Rust code,\nmade available as open source. Our evaluation shows that using 10 Cosmos chains\nin a local testnet, TrustBoost has a gas cost of roughly $2 with a latency of 2\nminutes per request, which is in line with the cost on a high security chain\nsuch as Bitcoin or Ethereum",

            "summary": "The always-available liquidity of automated market makers (AMMs) has been one\nof the most important catalysts in early cryptocurrency adoption. However, it\nhas become increasingly evident that AMMs in their current form are not viable\ninvestment options for passive liquidity providers. This is large part due to\nthe cost incurred by AMMs providing stale prices to arbitrageurs against\nexternal market prices, formalized as loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) [Milionis\net al., 2022].\n  In this paper, we present Diamond, an automated market making protocol that\naligns the incentives of liquidity providers and block producers in the\nprotocol-level retention of LVR. In Diamond, block producers effectively\nauction the right to capture any arbitrage that exists between the external\nmarket price of a Diamond pool, and the price of the pool itself. The proceeds\nof these auctions are shared by the Diamond pool and block producer in a way\nthat is proven to remain incentive compatible for the block producer. Given the\nparticipation of competing arbitrageurs to capture LVR, LVR is minimized in\nDiamond.\n  We formally prove this result, and detail an implementation of Diamond. We\nalso provide comparative simulations of Diamond to relevant benchmarks, further\nevidencing the LVR-protection capabilities of Diamond.\n  With this new protection, passive liquidity provision on blockchains can\nbecome rationally viable, beckoning a new age for decentralized finance.",

Edge computing has\nbeen established as a standard architecture for developing IoT solutions, since\nit can optimize the workload and capacity of systems that depend on cloud\nservices by deploying necessary computing power close to where the information\nis being produced and consumed. However, as the network scale in size, reaching\nconsensus becomes an increasingly challenging task. Distributed ledger\ntechnologies (DLTs), which can be described as a network of distributed\ndatabases that incorporate cryptography, can be leveraged to achieve consensus\namong participants. In recent years DLTs have gained traction due to the\npopularity of blockchains, the most-well known type of implementation. The\nreliability and trust that can be achieved through transparent and traceable\ntransactions are other key concepts that bring IoT and DLT together. We present\nthe design, development and conducted experiments of a proof-of-concept system\nthat uses DLT smart contracts for efficiently selecting edge nodes for\noffloading computational tasks. In particular, we integrate network performance\nindicators in smart contracts with a Hyperledger Blockchain to optimize the\noffloading on computation under dynamic connectivity solutions.

A central concept in\ncryptocurrencies is \"mining pools\", groups of cooperating cryptocurrency miners\nwho agree to share block rewards in proportion to their contributed mining\npower. Despite many promised benefits of cryptocurrencies, they are equally\nutilized for malicious activities; e.g., ransomware payments, stealthy command,\ncontrol, etc. Thus, understanding the interplay between cryptocurrencies,\nparticularly the mining pools, and other essential infrastructure for profiling\nand modeling is important.\n  In this paper, we study the interplay between mining pools and public clouds\nby analyzing their communication association through passive domain name system\n(pDNS) traces. We observe that 24 cloud providers have some association with\nmining pools as observed from the pDNS query traces, where popular public cloud\nproviders, namely Amazon and Google, have almost 48% of such an association.\nMoreover, we found that the cloud provider presence and cloud\nprovider-to-mining pool association both exhibit a heavy-tailed distribution,\nemphasizing an intrinsic preferential attachment model with both mining pools\nand cloud providers. We measure the security risk and exposure of the cloud\nproviders, as that might aid in understanding the intent of the mining: among\nthe top two cloud providers, we found almost 35% and 30% of their associated\nendpoints are positively detected to be associated with malicious activities,\nper the virustotal.com scan. Finally, we found that the mining pools presented\nin our dataset are predominantly used for mining Metaverse currencies,\nhighlighting a shift in cryptocurrency use, and demonstrating the prevalence of\nmining using public clouds.",

In recent\nyears, blockchain has been widely adopted in supply chain traceability to\nprovide transparency and authenticity, while the efficiency issue is\nunderstudied. In practice, as the numerous product records accumulate, the\ntime- and storage- efficiencies will decrease remarkably. To the best of our\nknowledge, this paper is the first work studying the efficiency issue in\nblockchain-based supply chain traceability. Compared to the traditional method,\nwhich searches the records stored in a single chunk sequentially, we replicate\nthe records in multiple chunks and employ parallel search to boost the time\nefficiency. However, allocating the record searching primitives to the chunks\nwith maximized parallelization ratio is challenging. To this end, we model the\nrecords and chunks as a bipartite graph and solve the allocation problem using\na maximum matching algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the time\noverhead can be reduced by up to 85.1% with affordable storage overhead.",

Digital advances such as blockchain technology has led to a\nmassive wave of \\textit{Decentralized Ledger Technology} (\\textit{DLT})\ninitiatives, protocols and solutions. This advance makes it possible to\nimplement trustless systems in the real world, which, combined with appropriate\neconomic and participatory incentives, would foster the proper functioning and\ndrive the adoption of a decentralized platform among different actors. This\npaper describes an alternative to current commercial structures and networks by\nintroducing \\textit{Lyzis Labs}, which is is an incentive-driven and democratic\nprotocol designed to support a decentralized online marketplace, based on\nblockchain technology. The proposal, \\textit{Lyzis Marketplace}, allows to\nconnect two or more people in a decentralized and secure way without having to\nrely on a \\textit{Trusted Third Party} (\\textit{TTP}) in order to perform\nphysical asset exchanges while mainly providing transparent and fully protected\ndata storage.

These systems have great potential\nfor improving security and privacy, but face a significant hurdle on the path\nto deployment. We initiate study of the following problem: a single\norganization is, by definition, a single party, and so how can a single\norganization build a distributed-trust system where corruptions are\nindependent? We instead consider an alternative formulation of the problem:\nrather than ensuring that a distributed-trust system is set up correctly by\ndesign, what if instead, users can audit a distributed-trust deployment? We\npropose a framework that enables a developer to efficiently and cheaply set up\nany distributed-trust system in a publicly auditable way. To do this, we\nidentify two application-independent building blocks that we can use to\nbootstrap arbitrary distributed-trust applications: secure hardware and an\nappend-only log. We show how to leverage existing implementations of these\nbuilding blocks to deploy distributed-trust systems, and we give\nrecommendations for infrastructure changes that would make it easier to deploy\ndistributed-trust systems in the future.",

In this article, we make the following\ncontributions. We first introduce the basic concepts such as the development\nprocess, definition, and characteristics of the Metaverse. After that, we\nanalyze the overall framework and supporting technologies of the Metaverse and\nsummarize the status of common fields. Finally, we focus on the security and\nprivacy issues that exist in the Metaverse, and give corresponding solutions or\ndirections. We also discuss the challenges and possible research directions of\nthe Metaverse. We believe this comprehensive review can provide an overview of\nthe Metaverse and research directions for some multidisciplinary studies.",

            "summary": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets stored on a blockchain\nrepresenting real-world objects such as art or collectibles. An NFT collection\ncomprises numerous tokens; each token can be transacted multiple times. It is a\nmultibillion-dollar market where the number of collections has more than\ndoubled in 2022. In this paper, we want to obtain a generative model that,\ngiven the early transactions history (first quarter Q1) of a newly minted\ncollection, generates subsequent transactions (quarters Q2, Q3, Q4), where the\ngenerative model is trained using the transaction history of a few mature\ncollections. The goal is to use the generated transactions to project the\npotential market value of this newly minted collection over the next few\nquarters. A technical challenge exists in that different collections have\ndiverse characteristics, and the generative model should generate based on the\nappropriate \"contexts\" of the collection. Our method takes a two-step approach.\nFirst, it employs unsupervised learning on the early transactions to extract\ncharacteristics (which we call contexts) of NFT collections. Next, it generates\nfuture transactions of each token based on these contexts and the early\ntransactions, projecting the target collection's potential market value.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate our contextual generative approach's NFT\nprojection capabilities.",

Investment\ndecisions rely on data and adequate preprocessing and application of analytics\nto them.

Using data\nthat consist of the transaction history of eight highly valued NFT collections,\na selection of such challenges is illustrated. These are: price differentiation\nby token traits, the possible existence of lateral swaps and wash trades in the\ntransaction history and finally, severe volatility.

Nodes with multiple channels can serve as relays for multihop payments\nby providing their liquidity and withholding part of the payment amount as a\nfee. Relay nodes might after a while end up with one or more unbalanced\nchannels, and thus need to trigger a rebalancing operation. In this paper, we\nstudy how a relay node can maximize its profits from fees by using the\nrebalancing method of submarine swaps. We introduce a stochastic model to\ncapture the dynamics of a relay node observing random transaction arrivals and\nperforming occasional rebalancing operations, and express the system evolution\nas a Markov Decision Process. We formulate the problem of the maximization of\nthe node's fortune over time over all rebalancing policies, and approximate the\noptimal solution by designing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based\nrebalancing policy. We build a discrete event simulator of the system and use\nit to demonstrate the DRL policy's superior performance under most conditions\nby conducting a comparative study of different policies and parameterizations.\nOur work is the first to introduce DRL for liquidity management in the complex\nworld of PCNs.",

Ethereum is the most notable example of a blockchain that supports smart\ncontracts leveraged for countless applications including games, auctions and\nfinancial products. Unfortunately, the traditional method of running contract\ncode on-chain is very expensive, for instance, on the Ethereum platform, fees\nhave dramatically increased, rendering the system unsuitable for complex\napplications. A prominent solution to address this problem is to execute code\noff-chain and only use the blockchain as a trust anchor. While there has been\nsignificant progress in developing off-chain systems over the last years,\ncurrent off-chain solutions suffer from various drawbacks including costly\nblockchain interactions, lack of data privacy, huge capital costs from locked\ncollateral, or supporting only a restricted set of applications.\n  In this paper, we present POSE -- a practical off-chain protocol for smart\ncontracts that addresses the aforementioned shortcomings of existing solutions.\nPOSE leverages a pool of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to execute the\ncomputation efficiently and to swiftly recover from accidental or malicious\nfailures. We show that POSE provides strong security guarantees even if a large\nsubset of parties is corrupted. We evaluate our proof-of-concept implementation\nwith respect to its efficiency and effectiveness.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin is the first of its kind, a truly decentralized and anonymous\ncryptocurrency. To realize it, it has developed blockchain technology using the\nconcept of `Proof of Work' (PoW). The miners, nodes responsible for writing\ntransaction databases, solve a cryptographic puzzle to claim the right to write\nto the database. Though bitcoin and many other relevant cryptocurrencies, such\nas ether use revolutionary ideas, the main criticism involves computing\nresources and energy consumption to solve puzzles that have otherwise no use.\nThere are attempts to use the PoW to do something useful, commonly referred to\nas Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW). In this paper, we attempt to (i) make PoUW more\nusable -- describe how a central problem setter can crowdsource their work as\nPoUW and (ii) in the true spirit of blockchains, decentralize the role of\nproblem setter, whom we call puzzlers. We propose a formal framework to do so,\nnamely PUPoW. PUPoW has an inbuilt provision of payments from the puzzler to\nthe miner who solves its puzzle. Additionally, miners have the option to not\nrely on a continuous feed of the puzzles and instead use original PoW puzzles.\n  We also propose a way to use PUPOW for solving TOR vanity URL generation and\nbitcoin vanity address generation problems. We call this PUPoW blockchain\nsolving vanity address generation problems as VanityCoin. Both problems require\ngenerating public keys from private keys such that resultant addresses are of\ninterest. Such key pairs are found only by a brute-force search. However, there\nare privacy concerns that miners would know the private keys of the puzzlers.\nWe resolve this by splitting the private keys, and the miners would know only\none part of it. In summary, we are proposing how PoW can be made practically\nhelpful, and we believe such an approach is needed for PoW blockchains to\nsurvive.",

Analyzers rely on techniques like symbolic execution or model\nchecking, but few of them can provide strong soundness properties and guarantee\nthe analysis termination at the same time. As smart-contracts often manipulate\neconomic assets, proving numerical properties beyond the absence of runtime\nerrors is also desirable. Smart-contract execution models differ considerably\nfrom mainstream programming languages and vary from one blockchain to another,\nmaking state-of-the-art analyses hard to adapt. For instance, smart-contract\ncalls may modify a persistent storage impacting subsequent calls. This makes it\ndifficult for tools to infer invariants required to formally ensure the absence\nof exploitable vulnerabilities. The Michelson smart-contract language, used in\nthe Tezos blockchain, is strongly typed, stack-based, and has a strict\nexecution model leaving few opportunities for implicit runtime errors. We\npresent a work in progress static analyzer for Michelson based on Abstract\nInterpretation and implemented within MOPSA, a modular static analyzer. Our\ntool supports the Michelson semantic features, including inner calls to\nexternal contracts. It can prove the absence of runtime errors and infer\ninvariants on the persistent storage over an unbounded number of calls. It is\nalso being extended to prove high-level numerical and security properties.

Constant function market makers (CFMMs) are\nanother market design innovation praised for their computational simplicity and\napplicability to liquidity provision via smart contracts. Liquidity provision\nin batch exchanges is an important problem, and CFMMs have recently shown\npromise in being useful within batch exchanges. Different real-world\nimplementations have used fundamentally different approaches towards\nintegrating CFMMs in batch exchanges, and there is a lack of formal\nunderstanding of different design tradeoffs.\n  We first provide a minimal set of axioms that are well-accepted rules of\nbatch exchanges and CFMMs. These are asset conservation, uniform valuations, a\nbest response for limit orders, and non-decreasing CFMM trading function. In\ngeneral, many market solutions may satisfy all our axioms. We then describe\nseveral economically useful properties of market solutions. These include\nPareto optimality for limit orders, price coherence of CFMMs (as a defence\nagainst cyclic arbitrage), joint price discovery for CFMMs (as a defence\nagainst parallel running), path independence for simple instances, and a\nlocally computable response of the CFMMs in equilibrium (to provide them\npredictability on trade size given a market price). We show fundamental\nconflicts between some pairs of these properties. We then provide two ways of\nintegrating CFMMs in batch exchanges, which attain different subsets of these\nproperties. We further provide a convex program for computing Arrow-Debreu\nexchange market equilibria when all agents have weak gross substitute (WGS)\ndemand functions on two assets -- this program extends the literature on\nArrow-Debreu exchange markets and may be of independent interest.",

The most common type of blockchain systems, public (permisionless)\nblockchain systems have some unique features that lead to a tension with\nEuropean Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other similar\ndata protection laws. In this paper, we report the results of a systematic\nliterature review (SLR) on 114 research papers discussing and/or addressing\nsuch a tension. To be the best of our know, our SLR is the most comprehensive\nreview of this topic, leading a more in-depth and broader analysis of related\nresearch work on this important topic. Our results revealed that three main\ntypes of issues: (i) difficulties in exercising data subjects' rights such as\nthe `right to be forgotten' (RTBF) due to the immutable nature of public\nblockchains; (ii) difficulties in identifying roles and responsibilities in the\npublic blockchain data processing ecosystem (particularly on the identification\nof data controllers and data processors); (iii) ambiguities regarding the\napplication of the relevant law(s) due to the distributed nature of\nblockchains. Our work also led to a better understanding of solutions for\nimproving the GDPR compliance of public blockchain systems. Our work can help\ninform not only blockchain researchers and developers, but also policy makers\nand law markers to consider how to reconcile the tension between public\nblockchain systems and data protection laws (the GDPR and beyond).",

            "summary": "Blockchain systems essentially consist of two levels: The network level has\nthe responsibility of distributing an ordered stream of transactions to all\nnodes of the network in exactly the same way, even in the presence of a certain\namount of malicious parties (byzantine fault tolerance). On the node level,\neach node then receives this ordered stream of transactions and executes it\nwithin some sort of transaction processing system, typically to alter some kind\nof state. This clear separation into two levels as well as drastically\ndifferent application requirements have led to the materialization of the\nnetwork level in form of so-called blockchain frameworks. While providing all\nthe \"blockchain features\", these frameworks leave the node level backend\nflexible or even left to be implemented depending on the specific needs of the\napplication.\n  In the following paper, we present how to integrate a highly versatile\ntransaction processing system, namely a relational DBMS, into such a blockchain\nframework. As framework, we use the popular Tendermint Core, now part of the\nIgnite/Cosmos eco-system, which can run both public and permissioned networks\nand combine it with relational DBMSs as the backend. This results in a\n\"relational blockchain\", which is able to run deterministic SQL on a fully\nreplicated relational database. Apart from presenting the integration and its\npitfalls, we will carefully evaluate the performance implications of such\ncombinations, in particular, the throughput and latency overhead caused by the\nblockchain layer on top of the DBMS. As a result, we give recommendations on\nhow to run such a systems combination efficiently in practice.",

            "summary": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have recently surged to mainstream attention by\nallowing the exchange of digital assets via blockchains. NFTs have also been\nadopted by artists to sell digital art. One of the promises of NFTs is\nbroadening participation to the arts market, a traditionally closed and opaque\nsystem, to sustain a wider and more diverse set of artists and collectors. A\nkey sign of this effect would be the disappearance or at least reduction in\nimportance of seller-buyer preferential ties, whereby the success of an artist\nis strongly dependent on the patronage of a single collector. We investigate\nNFT art seller-buyer networks considering several galleries and a large set of\nnearly 40,000 sales for over 230M USD in total volume. We find that NFT art is\na highly concentrated market driven by few successful sellers and even fewer\nsystematic buyers. High concentration is present in both the number of sales\nand, even more strongly, in their priced volume. Furthermore, we show that,\nwhile a broader-participation market was present in the early phase of NFT art\nadoption, preferential ties have dominated during market growth, peak and\nrecent decline. We consistently find that the top buyer accounts on average for\nover 80% of buys for a given seller. Similar trends apply to buyers and their\ntop seller. We conclude that NFT art constitutes, at the present, a highly\nconcentrated market driven by preferential seller-buyer ties.",

The protocol also\ndiffers from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others by forming a directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG) instead of a chain. It does not totally order all transactions,\nestablishes a partial order among them, and accepts transactions in the DAG\nthat satisfy specific properties. Such parallelism is widely regarded as a\ntechnique that increases the efficiency of consensus.\n  Despite its success, Avalanche consensus lacks a complete abstract\nspecification and a matching formal analysis. To address this drawback, this\nwork provides first a detailed formulation of Avalanche through pseudocode.\nThis includes features that are omitted from the original whitepaper or are\nonly vaguely explained in the documentation. Second, the paper gives an\nanalysis of the formal properties fulfilled by Avalanche in the sense of a\ngeneric broadcast protocol that only orders related transactions.

            "summary": "As transaction fees skyrocket today, blockchains become increasingly\nexpensive, hurting their adoption in broader applications.\n  This work tackles the saving of transaction fees for economic blockchain\napplications. The key insight is that other than the existing \"default\" mode to\nexecute application logic fully on-chain, i.e., in smart contracts, and in fine\ngranularity, i.e., user request per transaction, there are alternative\nexecution modes with advantages in cost-effectiveness.\n  On Ethereum, we propose a holistic middleware platform supporting flexible\nand secure transaction executions, including off-chain states and batching of\nuser requests. Furthermore, we propose control-plane schemes to adapt the\nexecution mode to the current workload for optimal runtime cost.\n  We present a case study on the institutional accounts (e.g., coinbase.com)\nintensively sending Ether on Ethereum blockchains. By collecting real-life\ntransactions, we construct workload benchmarks and show that our work saves 18%\n~ 47% per invocation than the default baseline while introducing 1.81 ~ 16.59\nblocks delay.",

They provide capacity\nexpansion strategies to address massive connectivity issues and guarantee\nultra-high throughput and low latency, especially in extreme or emergency\nsituations where network density, bandwidth, and traffic patterns fluctuate. On\nthe one hand, 6G technology integrates AI/ML, IoT, and blockchain to establish\nultra-reliable, intelligent, secure, and ubiquitous UAV networks. 6G networks,\non the other hand, rely on new enabling technologies such as air interface and\ntransmission technologies, as well as a unique network design, posing new\nchallenges for the swarm of UAVs. Keeping these challenges in mind, this\narticle focuses on the security and privacy, intelligence, and\nenergy-efficiency issues faced by swarms of UAVs operating in 6G mobile\nnetworks. In this state-of-the-art review, we integrated blockchain and AI/ML\nwith UAV networks utilizing the 6G ecosystem.

To promote the development of automated valuation\ntechniques, preferably those that are generally applicable to multiple asset\nclasses, we construct DASH, the first Digital Asset Sales History dataset that\nfeatures multiple digital asset classes spanning from classical to\nblockchain-based ones. Consisting of 280K transactions of domain names\n(DASH_DN), email addresses (DASH_EA), and non-fungible token (NFT)-based\nidentifiers (DASH_NFT), such as Ethereum Name Service names, DASH advances the\nfield in several aspects: the subsets DASH_DN, DASH_EA, and DASH_NFT are the\nlargest freely accessible domain name transaction dataset, the only publicly\navailable email address transaction dataset, and the first NFT transaction\ndataset that focuses on identifiers, respectively.\n  We build strong conventional feature-based models as the baselines for DASH.\nWe next explore deep learning models based on fine-tuning pre-trained language\nmodels, which have not yet been explored for digital asset valuation in the\nprevious literature. We find that the vanilla fine-tuned model already performs\nreasonably well, outperforming all but the best-performing baselines. We\nfurther propose improvements to make the model more aware of the time\nsensitivity of transactions and the popularity of assets. Experimental results\nshow that our improved model consistently outperforms all the other models\nacross all asset classes on DASH.",

Furthermore, these protocols serialize the transactions by\nordering them into a total global order. The serializability preserves the\ncorrectness of the application's state stored on the blockchain. However, using\ncoordination-based protocols to attain the global order of transactions can\nlimit the throughput and induce high latency. In contrast, application-level\ncorrectness requirements exist that are not dependent on the order of\ntransactions, known as invariant-confluence (I-confluence). The I-confluent\napplications can execute in a coordination-free manner benefiting from the\nimproved performance compared to the coordination-based approaches. The safety\nand liveness of I-confluent applications are studied in non-Byzantine\nenvironments, but the correct execution of such applications remains a\nchallenge in Byzantine coordination-free environments. This work introduces\nOrderlessChain, a coordination-free permissioned blockchain for the safe and\nlive execution of I-confluent applications in a Byzantine environment. We\nimplemented a prototype of our system, and our evaluation results demonstrate\nthat our coordination-free approach performs better than coordination-based\nblockchains.",

            "summary": "The web of today whether you prefer to call it web 2.0, web 3.0, web 5.0 or\neven the metaverse is at a critical stage of evolution and challenge, largely\ncentered around its crisis of identity. Like teenagers who cannot assess\nproperly their reason for being and do not seem ready to take responsibility\nfor their actions, we are constantly blaming the very system we are trying to\nget away from. To truly realize the benefits from innovation and technology,\nthis crisis has to be resolved, not just through tactical solutions but through\ndevelopments that enhance the sustainability of the web and its benefits.\nSignificant strides are being made in the evolution of digital services enabled\nby technology, regulation, and the sheer pace of societal change. The journey\nto the decentralized web is mirroring the convergence of the physical and\ndigital worlds across all economies and is increasingly embracing the digital\nnative world. Technology has provided the foundational platform for individuals\nand entities to create and manage wealth, potentially without the need for big\ninstitutions. Ironically, despite all of the advancements, we are still facing\nan unprecedented and increasing wealth gap. Clearly, the system is broken, not\njust around the edges but at the very core of the democratic underpinning of\nour society. In this whitepaper, we propose how artificial intelligence on\nblockchain can be used to generate a new class of identity through direct human\ncomputer interaction. We demonstrate how this, combined with new perspectives\nfor sustaining community and governance embedded within the use of blockchain\ntechnology, will underpin a sustainable solution to protect identity,\nauthorship and privacy at the same time while contributing to restore trust\namongst members of a future decentralized nation and hence contribute to\nsolving the web most significant identity crisis.",

We\nput a DNA inside the agent. DNA is a simple text, a whole roadmap of a network\nof agents or a system with details. A Dynamic Numerical Abstract of a\nmultiagent system. It is also a reproductive part for an \\emph{agent} that\nmakes the agent take actions and decide independently and reproduce coworkers.\nBy defining different DNA structures, one can establish new agents and\ndifferent nets for different usages. We initiate such thinking as \\emph{DNA\nprogramming}. This strategy leads to a new field of programming. This type of\nprogramming can help us manage large systems with various elements with an\nincredibly organized customizable structure. An agent can reproduce another\nagent. We put one or a few agents around a given network, and the agents will\nreproduce themselves till they can reach others and pervade the whole network.\nAn agent's position or other environmental or geographical characteristics make\nit possible for an agent to know its active set of \\emph{genes} on its DNA. The\nactive set of genes specifies its duties. There is a database that includes a\nlist of functions s.t. each one is an implementation of what a \\emph{gene}\nrepresents. To utilize a decentralized database, we may use a blockchain-based\nstructure.\n  This design can adapt to a system that manages many static and dynamic\nnetworks. This network could be a distributed system, a decentralized system, a\ntelecommunication network such as a 5G monitoring system, an IoT management\nsystem, or even an energy management system. The final system is the\ncombination of all the agents and the overlay net that connects the agents. We\ndenote the final net as the \\emph{body} of the system.",

            "summary": "Blockchains have seen growing traction with cryptocurrencies reaching a\nmarket cap of over 1 trillion dollars, major institution investors taking\ninterests, and global impacts on governments, businesses, and individuals. Also\ngrowing significantly is the heterogeneity of the ecosystem where a variety of\nblockchains co-exist. Cross-chain bridge is a necessary building block in this\nmulti-chain ecosystem. Existing solutions, however, either suffer from\nperformance issues or rely on trust assumptions of committees that\nsignificantly lower the security. Recurring attacks against bridges have cost\nusers more than 1.5 billion USD. In this paper, we introduce zkBridge, an\nefficient cross-chain bridge that guarantees strong security without external\ntrust assumptions. With succinct proofs, zkBridge not only guarantees\ncorrectness, but also significantly reduces on-chain verification cost. We\npropose novel succinct proof protocols that are orders-of-magnitude faster than\nexisting solutions for workload in zkBridge. With a modular design, zkBridge\nenables a broad spectrum of use cases and capabilities, including message\npassing, token transferring, and other computational logic operating on state\nchanges from different chains. To demonstrate the practicality of zkBridge, we\nimplemented a prototype bridge from Cosmos to Ethereum, a particularly\nchallenging direction that involves large proof circuits that existing systems\ncannot efficiently handle. Our evaluation shows that zkBridge achieves\npractical performance: proof generation takes less than 20 seconds, while\nverifying proofs on-chain costs less than 230K gas. For completeness, we also\nimplemented and evaluated the direction from Ethereum to other EVM-compatible\nchains (such as BSC) which involves smaller circuits and incurs much less\noverhead.",

To achieve\ndecentralized federated learning, blockchain-based FL was proposed as a\ndistributed FL architecture. In decentralized FL, the chief is eliminated from\nthe learning process as workers collaborate between each other to train the\nglobal model. Decentralized FL applications need to account for the additional\ndelay incurred by blockchain-based FL deployments. Particularly in this\nsetting, to detect targeted/untargeted poisoning attacks, we investigate the\nend-to-end learning completion latency of a realistic decentralized FL process\nprotected against poisoning attacks. We propose a technique which consists in\ndecoupling the monitoring phase from the detection phase in defenses against\npoisoning attacks in a decentralized federated learning deployment that aim at\nmonitoring the behavior of the workers. We demonstrate that our proposed\nblockchain-based monitoring improved network scalability, robustness and time\nefficiency.

            "summary": "Trading on decentralized exchanges has been one of the primary use cases for\npermissionless blockchains with daily trading volume exceeding billions of\nU.S.~dollars. In the status quo, users broadcast transactions and miners are\nresponsible for composing a block of transactions and picking an execution\nordering -- the order in which transactions execute in the exchange. Due to the\nlack of a regulatory framework, it is common to observe miners exploiting their\nprivileged position by front-running transactions and obtaining risk-fee\nprofits. In this work, we propose to modify the interaction between miners and\nusers and initiate the study of {\\em verifiable sequencing rules}. As in the\nstatus quo, miners can determine the content of a block; however, they commit\nto respecting a sequencing rule that constrains the execution ordering and is\nverifiable (there is a polynomial time algorithm that can verify if the\nexecution ordering satisfies such constraints). Thus in the event a miner\ndeviates from the sequencing rule, anyone can generate a proof of\nnon-compliance. We ask if there are sequencing rules that limit price\nmanipulation from miners in a two-token liquidity pool exchange. Our first\nresult is an impossibility theorem: for any sequencing rule, there is an\ninstance of user transactions where the miner can obtain non-zero risk-free\nprofits. In light of this impossibility result, our main result is a verifiable\nsequencing rule that provides execution price guarantees for users. In\nparticular, for any user transaction A, it ensures that either (1) the\nexecution price of A is at least as good as if A was the only transaction in\nthe block, or (2) the execution price of A is worse than this ``standalone''\nprice and the miner does not gain (or lose) when including A in the block.",

As a\nresult, they may be used to signify the possession of any specific object,\nwhether it be digital or physical. NFTs are digital tokens that may be used to\nindicate ownership of one of a-kind goods. For example, I can buy a shoe or T\nshirt from any store, and then if the store provides me the same 3D model of\nthat T-Shirt or shoe of the exact same design and color, it would be more\nconnected with my feelings. They enable us to tokenize items such as artwork,\nvaluables, and even real estate. NFTs can only be owned by one person at a\ntime, and they are protected by the Ethereum blockchain no one can alter the\nownership record or create a new NFT. The word non-fungible can be used to\ndescribe items like your furniture, a song file, or your computer. It is\nimpossible to substitute these goods with anything else because they each have\ntheir own distinct characteristics.

Over the recent years, several technologies for\nblockchains, off-chaining strategies, as well as decentralised and respectively\nself-sovereign identity systems have shot up so fast that standardisation of\nthe protocols is lagging behind, severely hampering the interoperability of\ndifferent approaches. Moreover, most of the currently available solutions for\ndistributed ledgers focus on either home users or enterprise use case\nscenarios, failing to provide integrative solutions addressing the needs of\nboth.\n  Herein we introduce the OpenDSU platform that allows to interoperate generic\nblockchain technologies, organised - and possibly cascaded in a hierarchical\nfashion - in domains. To achieve this flexibility, we seamlessly integrated a\nset of well conceived OpenDSU components to orchestrate off-chain data with\ngranularly resolved and cryptographically secure access levels that are nested\nwith sovereign identities across the different domains.\n  Employing our platform to PharmaLedger, an inter-European network for the\nstandardisation of data handling in the pharmaceutical industry and in\nhealthcare, we demonstrate that OpenDSU can cope with generic demands of\nheterogeneous use cases in both, performance and handling substantially\ndifferent business policies. Importantly, whereas available solutions commonly\nrequire a pre-defined and fixed set of components, no such vendor lock-in\nrestrictions on the blockchain technology or identity system exist in OpenDSU,\nmaking systems built on it flexibly adaptable to new standards evolving in the\nfuture.",

The main objective of this work is to introduce\nthe design of a decentralized rental system, which leverages smart contracts\nand the Ethereum public blockchain. The work started from an exhaustive\ninvestigation on the Ethereum platform, emphasizing the aspect of cryptography\nand all the technology behind this platform. In order to test the proposed\nscheme in a realistic use, the implementation of a web application for the\nrental of vehicles has been carried out. The application covers the entire\nvehicle rental process offered in traditional web applications, adding more\nautonomy and ease of use to users. Following Ethereum application development\nguidelines, all business logic is located in the smart contracts implemented in\nthe Ethereum network, where these contracts control the entire vehicle rental\nsystem of customers. While this is a work in progress, the results obtained in\nthe first proof of concept have been very promising.",

MEC pushes compute-intensive\nassignments to the edge of the network and brings resources as close to the\nendpoints as possible, addressing the shortcomings of mobile devices with\nregard to storage space, resource optimisation, computational performance and\nefficiency. Compared to cloud computing, as the distributed and closer\ninfrastructure, the convergence of MEC with other emerging technologies,\nincluding the Metaverse, 6G wireless communications, artificial intelligence\n(AI), and blockchain, also solves the problems of network resource allocation,\nmore network load as well as latency requirements. Accordingly, this paper\ninvestigates the computational paradigms used to meet the stringent\nrequirements of modern applications. The application scenarios of MEC in mobile\naugmented reality (MAR) are provided. Furthermore, this survey presents the\nmotivation of MEC-based Metaverse and introduces the applications of MEC to the\nMetaverse.

A recent work has\nproven the impossibility of collusion-proof mechanisms that achieve both\nnon-zero miner revenue and Dominating-Strategy-Incentive-Compatible (DSIC) for\nusers. However, a positive miner revenue is important in practice to motivate\nminers. To address this challenge, we consider a Bayesian game setting and\nrelax the DSIC requirement for users to Bayesian-Nash-Incentive-Compatibility\n(BNIC). In particular, we propose an auxiliary mechanism method that makes\nconnections between BNIC and DSIC mechanisms. With the auxiliary mechanism\nmethod, we design a transaction fee mechanism (TFM) based on the multinomial\nlogit (MNL) choice model, and prove that the TFM has both BNIC and\ncollusion-proof properties with an asymptotic constant-factor approximation of\noptimal miner revenue for i.i.d. bounded valuations. Our result breaks the\nzero-revenue barrier while preserving truthfulness and collusion-proof\nproperties.",

            "summary": "The energy sustainability of blockchains, whose consensus protocol rests on\nthe Proof-of-Work, nourishes a heated debate. The underlying issue lies in a\nhighly energy-consuming process, defined as mining, required to validate\ncrypto-asset transactions. Mining is the process of solving a cryptographic\npuzzle, incentivised by the possibility of gaining a reward. The higher the\nnumber of users performing mining, i.e. miners, the higher the overall\nelectricity consumption of a blockchain. For that reason, mining constitutes a\nnegative environmental externality. Here, we study whether miners' interests\ncan meet the collective need to curb energy consumption. To this end, we\nintroduce the Crypto-Asset Game, namely a model based on the framework of\nEvolutionary Game Theory devised for studying the dynamics of a population\nwhose agents can play as crypto-asset users or as miners. The energy\nconsumption of mining impacts the payoff of both strategies, representing a\ndirect cost for miners and an environmental factor for crypto-asset users. The\nproposed model, studied via numerical simulations, shows that, in some\nconditions, the agent population can reach a strategy profile that optimises\nglobal energy consumption, i.e. composed of a low density of miners. To\nconclude, can a Proof-of-Work-based blockchain become energetically\nsustainable? Our results suggest that blockchain protocol parameters could have\na relevant role in the global energy consumption of this technology.",

            "summary": "In the white book of Bitcion, Satoshi Nakamoto described a bitcoin system\nthat can realize point-to-point online payment without a third-party\norganization. After supporting this magical application scenario and subverting\nthe traditional centralized system, the blockchain technology has attracted\nworldwide attention, triggered a research upsurge of blockchain consensus\nalgorithm, and produced a large number of innovative applications. Although\nvarious consensus algorithms continue to evolve with the iteration of\nblockchain products and applications, Proof of Work (POW) and Proof of Skake\n(POS) algorithms are still the core of consensus algorithms. This paper\ndiscusses two algorithms of POW and POS in blockchain consensus mechanism, and\nanalyzes the advantages and the existing problems of the two consensus\nmechanisms. Since consensus mechanism is the main focus of blockchain\ntechnology and has many influencing factors, this paper discusses the current\nproblems and some improved ideas, and selects some typical algorithms for a\nmore systematic introduction. In addition, some important issues related to\nsafety and performance are also discussed. This paper provides the researchers\na great reference on blockchain consensus mechanism.",

            "summary": "Lately, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), i.e., uniquely discernible assets on a\nblockchain, have skyrocketed in popularity by addressing a broad audience.\nHowever, the typical NFT auctioning procedures are conducted in various, ad hoc\nways, while mostly ignoring the context that the blockchain provides. One of\nthe main targets of this work is to shed light on the vastly unexplored design\nspace of NFT Auction Mechanisms, especially in those characteristics that\nfundamentally differ from traditional and more contemporaneous forms of\nauctions. We focus on the case that bidders have a valuation for the auctioned\nNFT, i.e., what we term the single-item NFT auction case. In this setting, we\nformally define an NFT Auction Mechanism, give the properties that we would\nideally like a perfect mechanism to satisfy (broadly known as incentive\ncompatibility and collusion resistance) and prove that it is impossible to have\nsuch a perfect mechanism. Even though we cannot have an all-powerful protocol\nlike that, we move on to consider relaxed notions of those properties that we\nmay desire the protocol to satisfy, as a trade-off between implementability and\neconomic guarantees. Specifically, we define the notion of an\nequilibrium-truthful auction, where neither the seller nor the bidders can\nimprove their utility by acting non-truthfully, so long as the counter-party\nacts truthfully. We also define asymptotically second-price auctions, in which\nthe seller does not lose asymptotically any revenue in comparison to the\ntheoretically-optimal (static) second-price sealed-bid auction, in the case\nthat the bidders' valuations are drawn independently from some distribution. We\nshowcase why these two are very desirable properties for an auction mechanism\nto enjoy, and construct the first known NFT Auction Mechanism which provably\npossesses such formal guarantees.",

            "summary": "Payment channel is a class of techniques designed to solve the scalability\nproblem of blockchain. By establishing channels off the blockchain to form\npayment channel networks (PCNs), users can make instant payments without\ninteracting with the blockchain, avoiding the problems of long transaction\nconsensus delays and high transaction fees. Recently, the optimization of PCNs\nhas mainly focused on improving the network throughput via multi-path routing.\nHowever, the transaction's atomicity comes at a non-trivial cost for\ntransaction completion latency that affects user experience in\ndeadline-sensitive applications of PCNs. In this paper, we propose a new and\nsystematic framework DPCN to consider the deadlines of transactions for payment\nchannel networks while improving the success ratio of transactions. DPCN is\nenabled via a synergy of three components: (1) deadline-based dynamic\ntransaction split mechanism that splits the transaction according to current\nnetwork status and the transaction's deadline; (2) deadline-aware transaction\nscheduling that prioritizes near-deadline transactions; (3) deadline-aware\ntransaction congestion avoidance algorithm, which uses a path window to balance\ntransactions with different deadlines. Our extensive experiments show that\ncompared with existing methods, DPCN can well meet the needs of transactions\nwith different deadlines and ensure a higher success ratio for transactions in\nthe payment channel networks.",

The unpredictability of extreme fires, floods, drought, cyclones,\nand others endangers sustainable production and life on land (SDG goal 15),\nwhich translates into food insecurity and poorer populations. Fortunately,\nmodern technologies such as Artificial Intelligent (AI), the Internet of Things\n(IoT), blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR)\nare promising to reduce the risk and impact of extreme weather in our\nsocieties. However, research directions on how these technologies could help\nreduce the impact of extreme weather are unclear. This makes it challenging to\nemploring digital technologies within the spheres of extreme weather. In this\npaper, we employed the Delphi Best Worst method and Machine learning approaches\nto identify and assess the push factors of technology. The BWM evaluation\nrevealed that predictive nature was AI's most important criterion and role,\nwhile the mass-market potential was the less important criterion. Based on this\noutcome, we tested the predictive ability of machine elarning on a publilcly\navailable dataset to affrm the predictive rols of AI. We presented the\nmanagerial and methodological implications of the study, which are crucial for\nresearch and practice. The methodology utilized in this study could aid\ndecision-makers in devising strategies and interventions to safeguard\nsustainable production.

In an exciting line of recent work, many researchers have proposed\nvarious scalable blockchain protocols that demonstrate the potential to solve\nthese challenges. However, many of these protocols come with the assumptions of\nhonest majority and symmetric network access which may not accurately reflect\nthe real world where the participants may be self-interested or rational.\nSecondly, these works show that their protocol works in an ideal environment\nwhere each party has equal access to the network whereas different parties have\nvarying latencies and network speeds. These assumptions may render the\nprotocols susceptible to security threats in the real world, as highlighted by\nthe literature focused on exploring game-theoretic attacks on these protocols.\n  We propose a scalable blockchain protocol, Interlude, which comes with the\ntypical security guarantees while focusing on game-theoretic soundness and\nnetwork fairness. The novelty of Interlude is that it has a relatively simple\ndesign consisting of a sequence of parallel blocks containing disjoint\ntransaction sets that can be mined quickly followed by a series block that is\nslow to mine and gives the honest parties in the network time to synchronize.\nThus, between the chaos of parallel blocks, our blockchain protocol masquerades\nan interlude moment of harmony in series blocks that synchronize the network.",

However, it is challenging to convince clients for\nquality participation in FL due to the absence of: (i) full information on the\nclient's data quality and properties; (ii) the value of client's data\ncontributions; and (iii) the trusted mechanism for monetary incentive offers.\nThis often leads to poor efficiency in training and communication. While\nseveral works focus on strategic incentive designs and client selection to\novercome this problem, there is a major knowledge gap in terms of an overall\ndesign tailored to the foreseen digital economy, including Web 3.0, while\nsimultaneously meeting the learning objectives. To address this gap, we propose\na contribution-based tokenized incentive scheme, namely \\texttt{FedToken},\nbacked by blockchain technology that ensures fair allocation of tokens amongst\nthe clients that corresponds to the valuation of their data during model\ntraining. Leveraging the engineered Shapley-based scheme, we first approximate\nthe contribution of local models during model aggregation, then strategically\nschedule clients lowering the communication rounds for convergence and anchor\nways to allocate \\emph{affordable} tokens under a constrained monetary budget.\nExtensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.",

Peer-to-peer\nblockchain-based decentralization with a smart contract-based execution model\nand verifiable off-chain computations leveraging zero-knowledge proofs promise\nto provide the basis for next-generation, non-disclosing credential management\nsolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel credential on-chaining system that\nensures blockchain-based transparency while preserving pseudonymity.

Our zkSNARKs-based\nreference implementation and evaluation show that, compared to related\napproaches based on, e.g., CL-signatures, our approach provides significant\nperformance advantages and more flexible proof mechanisms, underpinning our\nvision of increasingly decentralized, transparent, and trustworthy service\nsystems.",

            "summary": "Maintaining data consistency among multiple parties requires nodes to\nrepeatedly send data to all other nodes. For example, the nodes of a blockchain\nnetwork have to disseminate the blocks they create across the whole network.\nThe scientific literature typically takes the ideal perspective that such data\ndistribution is performed by broadcasting to all nodes directly, while in\npractice data is distributed by repeated multicast. Since correctness and\nsecurity of consistency maintenance protocols usually have been established for\nthe ideal setting only, it is vital to show that these properties carry over to\nreal-world implementations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove that the ideal\nand the real behavior are equivalent.\n  In the work described in this paper, we take an important step towards such a\nproof by proving a simpler variant of this equivalence statement. The\nsimplification is that we consider only a concrete pair of network topologies,\nwhich nevertheless illustrates important phenomena encountered with arbitrary\ntopologies. For describing systems that distribute data, we use a\ndomain-specific language of processes that corresponds to a class of Petri nets\nand is embedded in a general-purpose process calculus. This way, we can outline\nour proof using an intuitive graphical notation and leverage the rich theory of\nprocess calculi in the actual proof, which is machine-checked using the\nIsabelle proof assistant.",

            "summary": "Sharding has shown great potential to scale out blockchains. It divides nodes\ninto smaller groups which allow for partial transaction processing, relaying\nand storage. Hence, instead of running one blockchain, we will run multiple\nblockchains in parallel, and call each one a shard. Sharding can be applied to\naddress shortcomings due to compulsory duplication of three resources in\nblockchains, i.e., computation, communication and storage. The most pressing\nissue in blockchains today is throughput. Hence, usually the main focus is to\nshard computation which leads to concurrent transaction processing. In this\nreport, we propose new queueing-theoretic models to derive the maximum\nthroughput of sharded blockchains. We consider two cases, a fully sharded\nblockchain and a computation sharding. In the former nodes are exclusive to\neach shard in terms of their responsibilities, i.e., block production, relaying\nand storage. In the latter though, only block production is exclusive and nodes\nrelay and store every piece of information. We model each with a queueing\nnetwork that exploits signals to account for block production as well as\nmulti-destination cross-shard transactions. We make sure quasi-reversibility\nfor every queue in our models is satisfied so that they fall into the category\nof product-form queueing networks. We then obtain a closed-form solution for\nthe maximum stable throughput of these systems with respect to block size,\nblock rate, number of destinations in transactions and the number of shards.\nComparing the results obtained from the two introduced sharding systems, we\nconclude that the extent of sharding in different domains plays a significant\nrole in scalability.",

            "summary": "Forking breaches the security and performance of blockchain as it is\nsymptomatic of distributed consensus, spurring wide interest in analyzing and\nresolving it. The state-of-the-art works can be categorized into two kinds:\nexperiment-based and model-based. However, the former falls short in\nexclusiveness since the derived observations are scenario-specific. Hence, it\nis problematic to abstractly reveal the crystal-clear forking laws. Besides,\nthe models established in the latter are spatiality-free, which totally\noverlook the fact that forking is essentially an undesirable result under a\ngiven topology. Moreover, few of the ongoing studies have yielded to the active\ndefense mechanisms but only recognized forking passively, which impedes forking\nprevention and cannot deter it at the source. In this paper, we fill the gap by\ncarrying out the active defense analysis of blockchain forking from the\nspatial-temporal dimension. Our work is featured by the following two traits:\n1) dual dimensions. We consider the spatiality of blockchain overlay network\nbesides temporal characteristics, based on which, a spatial-temporal model for\ninformation propagation in blockchain is proposed; 2) active defense. We hint\nthat shrinking the long-range link factor, which indicates the remote\nconnection ability of a link, can cut down forking completely fundamentally. To\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to inspect forking from the\nspatial-temporal perspective, so as to present countermeasures proactively.\nSolid theoretical derivations and extensive simulations are conducted to\njustify the validity and effectiveness of our analysis.",

            "summary": "Over the last ten years, the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) has grown\nexponentially in all scientific fields, including particle physics. The\nindustry has also developed new powerful tools that, imported into academia,\ncould revolutionise research. One recent industry development that has not yet\ncome to the attention of the particle physics community is Collaborative\nLearning (CL), a framework that allows training the same ML model with\ndifferent datasets. This work explores the potential of CL, testing the library\nColearn with neutrino physics simulation. Colearn, developed by the British\nCambridge-based firm Fetch.AI, enables decentralised machine learning tasks.\nBeing a blockchain-mediated CL system, it allows multiple stakeholders to build\na shared ML model without needing to rely on a central authority. A generic\nLiquid Argon Time-Projection Chamber (LArTPC) has been simulated and images\nproduced by fictitious neutrino interactions have been used to produce several\ndatasets. These datasets, called learners, participated successfully in\ntraining a Deep Learning (DL) Keras model using blockchain technologies in a\ndecentralised way. This test explores the feasibility of training a single ML\nmodel using different simulation datasets coming from different research\ngroups. In this work, we also discuss a framework that instead makes different\nML models compete against each other on the same dataset. The final goal is\nthen to train the most performant ML model across the entire scientific\ncommunity for a given experiment, either using all of the datasets available or\nselecting the model which performs best among every model developed in the\ncommunity.",

However, it is still found vulnerable to\nconsensus manipulation attacks. These stealth attacks are often difficult to\ndetect as they use kernel-level access to mask their actions. In this paper, we\nfirstly build a trusted and secured peer-to-peer network mechanism for physical\nDC microgrids' validation of transactions over Distributed Ledger. Secondly, we\nleverage from a physics-informed approach for detecting malware-infected nodes\nand then recovering from stealth attacks using a self-healing recovery scheme\naugmented into the microgrid Blockchain network. This scheme allows compromised\nnodes to adapt to a reconstructed trustworthy signal in a multi-hop manner\nusing corresponding measurements from the reliable nodes in the network.\nAdditionally, recognizing the possible threat of denial-of-service attacks and\nrandom time delays (where information sharing via communication channels is\nblocked), we also integrate a model-free predictive controller with the\nproposed system that can locally reconstruct an expected version of the\nattacked/delayed signals. This supplements the capabilities of Blockchain,\nenabling it to detect and mitigate consensus manipulation attempts, and network\nlatencies.",

            "summary": "Federated learning is one of the most appealing alternatives to the standard\ncentralized learning paradigm, allowing a heterogeneous set of devices to train\na machine learning model without sharing their raw data. However, it requires a\ncentral server to coordinate the learning process, thus introducing potential\nscalability and security issues. In the literature, server-less federated\nlearning approaches like gossip federated learning and blockchain-enabled\nfederated learning have been proposed to mitigate these issues. In this work,\nwe propose a complete overview of these three techniques proposing a comparison\naccording to an integral set of performance indicators, including model\naccuracy, time complexity, communication overhead, convergence time, and energy\nconsumption. An extensive simulation campaign permits to draw a quantitative\nanalysis considering both feedforward and convolutional neural network models.\nResults show that gossip federated learning and standard federated solution are\nable to reach a similar level of accuracy, and their energy consumption is\ninfluenced by the machine learning model adopted, the software library, and the\nhardware used. Differently, blockchain-enabled federated learning represents a\nviable solution for implementing decentralized learning with a higher level of\nsecurity, at the cost of an extra energy usage and data sharing. Finally, we\nidentify open issues on the two decentralized federated learning\nimplementations and provide insights on potential extensions and possible\nresearch directions in this new research field.",

In this survey, we first summarize the\ncommon types and typical cases of smart contract vulnerabilities from three\nlevels, i.e., Solidity code layer, EVM execution layer, and Block dependency\nlayer. Further, we review the research progress of smart contract vulnerability\ndetection and classify existing counterparts into five categories, i.e., formal\nverification, symbolic execution, fuzzing detection, intermediate\nrepresentation, and deep learning. Empirically, we take 300 real-world smart\ncontracts deployed on Ethereum as the test samples and compare the\nrepresentative methods in terms of accuracy, F1-Score, and average detection\ntime.

However, interactive multimedia applications (e.g., ultra high\ndefinition video conferencing, 3D and multiview video streaming, crowd-sourced\nvideo streaming, cloud gaming, virtual and augmented reality) are becoming more\nambitious with high volume and low latency video streams putting strict demands\non the already congested networks. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging\nparadigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network\ni.e., at the base station level. To meet the latency requirements and avoid the\nend-to-end communication with remote cloud data centers, MEC allows to store\nand process video content (e.g., caching, transcoding, pre-processing) at the\nbase stations. Both video on demand and live video streaming can utilize MEC to\nimprove existing services and develop novel use cases, such as video analytics,\nand targeted advertisements. MEC is expected to reshape the future of video\nstreaming by providing ultra-reliable and low latency streaming (e.g., in\naugmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles), pervasive\ncomputing (e.g., in real-time video analytics), and blockchain-enabled\narchitecture for secure live streaming. This paper presents a comprehensive\nsurvey of recent developments in MEC-enabled video streaming bringing\nunprecedented improvement to enable novel use cases. A detailed review of the\nstate-of-the-art is presented covering novel caching schemes, optimal\ncomputation offloading, cooperative caching and offloading and the use of\nartificial intelligence (i.e., machine learning, deep learning, and\nreinforcement learning) in MEC-assisted video streaming services.",

As the training of ML models\nrequires a massive amount of good quality data, it is necessary to eliminate\nconcerns about data privacy and ensure high-quality data. To solve this\nproblem, we cast our eyes on the integration of CML and smart contracts. Based\non blockchain, smart contracts enable automatic execution of data preserving\nand validation, as well as the continuity of CML model training. In our\nsimulation experiments, we define incentive mechanisms on the smart contract,\ninvestigate the important factors such as the number of features in the dataset\n(num_words), the size of the training data, the cost for the data holders to\nsubmit data, etc., and conclude how these factors impact the performance\nmetrics of the model: the accuracy of the trained model, the gap between the\naccuracies of the model before and after simulation, and the time to use up the\nbalance of bad agent. For instance, the increase of the value of num_words\nleads to higher model accuracy and eliminates the negative influence of\nmalicious agents in a shorter time from our observation of the experiment\nresults. Statistical analyses show that with the help of smart contracts, the\ninfluence of invalid data is efficiently diminished and model robustness is\nmaintained.

In this case, we say the\neffective lifespan of the channel has ended.\n  In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to predict the expected\neffective lifespan of a channel based on the network's topology. We investigate\nthe impact of channel unbalancing on the payment network and individual\nchannels. We also discuss the effect of certain characteristics of payment\nchannels on their lifespan. Our case study on a snapshot of the Lightning\nNetwork shows how the effective lifespan is distributed, and how it is\ncorrelated with other network characteristics. Our results show that central\nunbalanced channels have a drastic effect on the network performance.",

            "summary": "Food delivery systems are gaining popularity recently due to the expansion of\ninternet connectivity and for the increasing availability of devices. The\ngrowing popularity of such systems has raised concerns regarding (i)\nInformation security, (ii) Business to business (B2B) deep discounting race,\nand (iii) Strict policy enforcement. Sensitive personal data and financial\ninformation of the users must be safeguarded. Additionally, in pursuit of\ngaining profit, the restaurants tend to offer deep discounts resulting in a\nhigher volume of orders than usual. Therefore, the restaurants and the delivery\npersons fail to maintain the delivery time and often impair the food quality.\nIn this paper, we have proposed a blockchain and smart contract-based food\ndelivery system to address these issues. The main goal is to remove commission\nschemes and decrease service delays caused by a high volume of orders. The\nprotocols have been deployed and tested on the Ethereum test network. The\nsimulation manifests a successful implementation of our desired system; with\nthe payment being controlled by our system. The actors (restaurant,\ndelivery-person or consumer) are bound to be compliant with the policies or\npenalized otherwise.",

            "summary": "Airdrop is a crucial concept in tokenomics. Startups of decentralized\napplications (DApps) reward early supporters by airdropping newly issued tokens\nup to a certain amount as a free giveaway. This naturally induces greedy\nhackers, called Sybils, to create multiple accounts for more shares. Most\nairdrops have prerequisites for qualification, in which utilizing these DApps\nis unsurprisingly the principal. One particular characteristic of DApps is to\nimplement users' interactions with them in the form of token transfer\ntransactions or smart contract calling transactions on public blockchains. We\nargue that these individual transactions could reveal underlying signatures of\ntheir sending accounts. Specifically, accounts controlled by the same Sybil may\nexhibit some common behaviors. A careful analysis of Sybil's behaviors shows\nthat accounts controlled by the same Sybil may produce similar DApp activities\nand regular token transfer patterns. We model the transactions as graphs by\nrepresenting accounts as vertices and transactions as edges. When multiple\naccounts receive tokens from the same Sybil to conduct interactions with DApps,\nwe inspect the graphs for these activities and patterns to detect suspicious\naccounts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a recent\nairdrop by presenting the suspicious accounts controlled by Sybils. All the\ndetected accounts exhibit similar interaction activities and regular transfer\npatterns.",

Rapid supply of\nCovid-19 vaccines is essential for successful global immunization, but its\neffectiveness depends on a transparent supply chain that can be monitored. In\nthis research, we have proposed an approach based on blockchain technology,\nwhich is used to ensure seamless distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine with\ntransparency, data integrity, and full traceability of the supply chain to\nreduce risk, ensure safety, and immutability. A vaccine supply chain needs to\nupdate the status of the vaccine at every stage, and any problem in the supply\nand distribution path can lead to irreparable damage. Currently, the research\nconducted on the use of blockchain in supply chains is still in the early\nstages. In this paper, the use of blockchain technology to monitor the vaccine\nsupply and distribution system will be investigated. A model close to reality\nof today's vaccine supply chains in developing countries is considered and then\na new intelligent system for vaccine monitoring in the vaccine supply chain is\ndesigned based on the considered model. Also, smart contracts based on a\nblockchain network is designed to check consumer vaccination records as well as\nvaccine circulation from beginning to end. The implementation and design of the\nvaccine supply chain is done using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain\nnetwork. Additionally, the system has been tested on both local networks, the\nHardHat suite and Rinkbey's test network. The system has also been developed to\nwork seamlessly when it is using an integrated IoT chip that can automatically\nupdate a batch's location, temperature, and other physical conditions\nperiodically.",

In this paper, we first describe a simple\nMarkov model for the DAG-based blockchain with IOTA Tangle by means of two\nlayers of tips and internal tips' impatient connection behavior. Then we set up\na continuous-time Markov process to analyze the DAG-based blockchain system and\nshow that this Markov process is a level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death (QBD)\nprocess. Based on this, we prove that the QBD process must be irreducible and\npositive recurrent. Furthermore, once the stationary probability vector of the\nQBD process is given, we provide performance analysis of the DAG-based\nblockchain system. Next, we propose a new effective method for computing the\naverage confirmation time of any arriving internal tip at this system by means\nof the first passage times and the PH distributions. Finally, we use numerical\nexamples to check the validity of our theoretical results and indicate how some\nkey system parameters influence the performance measures of this system.\nTherefore, we hope that the methodology and results developed in this paper can\nbe applicable to deal with more general DAG-based blockchain systems such that\na series of promising research can be developed potentially.",

Clients from low-income countries\nare particularly affected as most data centers from major cloud providers are\nlocated in economically advanced nations. Centralized conferencing applications\nalso suffer from occasional outages and are embattled by serious privacy\nviolation allegations. In recent years, decentralized video conferencing\napplications built over p2p networks and incentivized through blockchain are\nbecoming popular. A key characteristic of these networks is their openness:\nanyone can host a media server on the network and gain reward for providing\nservice. Strong economic incentives combined with lower entry barrier to join\nthe network, makes increasing server coverage to even remote regions of the\nworld. These reasons, however, also lead to a security problem: a server may\nobfuscate its true location in order to gain an unfair business advantage. In\nthis paper, we consider the problem of multicast tree construction for video\nconferencing sessions in open p2p conferencing applications. We propose DecVi,\na decentralized multicast tree construction protocol that adaptively discovers\nefficient tree structures based on an exploration-exploitation framework. DecVi\nis motivated by the combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem and uses a\nsuccinct learning model to compute effective actions. Despite operating in a\nmulti-agent setting with each server having only limited knowledge of the\nglobal network and without cooperation among servers, experimentally we show\nDecVi achieves similar quality-of-experience compared to a centralized globally\noptimal algorithm while achieving higher reliability and flexibility.",

            "summary": "Internet of Vehicles(IoV) is increasingly used as a medium to propagate\ncritical information via establishing connections between entities such as\nvehicles and infrastructures. During message transmission, privacy-preserving\nauthentication is considered as the first line of defence against attackers and\nmalicious information. To achieve a more secure and stable communication\nenvironment, ever-increasing numbers of blockchain-based authentication schemes\nare proposed. At first glance, existing approaches provide robust architectures\nand achieve transparent authentication. However, in these schemes, verifiers\nmust connect to the blockchain network in advance and accomplish the\nauthentication with smart contracts, which prolongs the latency. To remedy this\nlimit, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based authentication\nprotocol(PBAG), where Root Authority(RA) generates a unique evaluation proof\ncorresponding to the issued certificate for each authorized vehicle. Meanwhile,\nRA broadcasts a public global commitment based on all valid certificates.\nInstead of querying certificates stored in the blockchain, the vehicle will be\nefficiently proved to be an authorized user by utilizing the global commitment\nthrough bilinear pairing. Moreover, our scheme can prevent vehicles equipped\nwith invalid certificates from accomplishing the authentication, thus avoiding\nthe time-consuming for checking Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Finally, our\nscheme provides privacy properties such as anonymity and unlinkability. It\nallows anonymous authentication based on evaluation proofs and achieves\ntraceability of identity in the event of a dispute. The simulation demonstrates\nthat the average time of verification is 0.36ms under the batch-enabled\nmechanism, outperforming existing schemes by at least 63.7%.",

            "summary": "Systems for relative localization in multi-robot systems based on\nultra-wideband (UWB) ranging have recently emerged as robust solutions for\nGNSS-denied environments. Scalability remains one of the key challenges,\nparticularly in ad-hoc deployments. Recent solutions include dynamic allocation\nof active and passive localization modes for different robots or nodes in the\nsystem. With larger-scale systems becoming more distributed, key research\nquestions arise in the areas of security and trustability of such localization\nsystems. This paper studies the potential integration of collaborative-decision\nmaking processes with distributed ledger technologies. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the design and implementation of a methodology for running an UWB\nrole allocation algorithm within smart contracts in a blockchain. In previous\nworks, we have separately studied the integration of ROS2 with the Hyperledger\nFabric blockchain, and introduced a new algorithm for scalable UWB-based\nlocalization. In this paper, we extend these works by (i) running experiments\nwith larger number of mobile robots switching between different spatial\nconfigurations and (ii) integrating the dynamic UWB role allocation algorithm\ninto Fabric smart contracts for distributed decision-making in a system of\nmultiple mobile robots. This enables us to deliver the same functionality\nwithin a secure and trustable process, with enhanced identity and data access\nmanagement. Our results show the effectiveness of the UWB role allocation for\ncontinuously varying spatial formations of six autonomous mobile robots, while\ndemonstrating a low impact on latency and computational resources of adding the\nblockchain layer that does not affect the localization process.",

Each blockchain network, which we refer\nto as a domain, has its own consensus, ordering, and block-creation mechanisms,\nwhich gives rise to different optimal strategies to extract MEV. The strategic\nbehaviour of rational players, known as searchers, lead to MEV games that have\ndifferent impacts and externalities in each domain. Several ordering\nmechanisms, which determine the inclusion and position of transactions in a\nblock, have been considered to construct alternative games to organise MEV\nextraction, and minimize negative externalities; examples include sealed bid\nauctions, first input first output, and private priority gas auctions. However,\nto date, no sufficiently formal and abstract definition of MEV games have been\nmade. In this paper, we take a step toward the formalization of MEV games and\ncompare different ordering mechanisms and their externalities. In particular,\nwe attempt to formalize games that arise from common knowledge MEV\nopportunities, such as arbitrage and sandwich attacks. In defining these games,\nwe utilise a theoretical framework that provides groundwork for several\nimportant roles and concepts, such as the searcher, sequencer, domain, and\nbundle. We also introduce the price of MEV as the price of anarchy of MEV\ngames, a measure that provides formal comparison between different ordering\nmechanisms.",

Existing phishing scam detection methods mostly rely only on the\nanalysis of original transaction networks, which is difficult to dig deeply\ninto the transaction patterns hidden in the network structure of transaction\ninteraction. In this paper, we propose a \\underline{T}ransaction\n\\underline{S}ub\\underline{G}raph \\underline{N}etwork (TSGN) based phishing\naccounts identification framework for Ethereum. We first extract transaction\nsubgraphs for target accounts and then expand these subgraphs into\ncorresponding TSGNs based on the different mapping mechanisms. In order to make\nour model incorporate more important information about real transactions, we\nencode the transaction attributes into the modeling process of TSGNs, yielding\ntwo variants of TSGN, i.e., Directed-TSGN and Temporal-TSGN, which can be\napplied to the different attributed networks. Especially, by introducing TSGN\ninto multi-edge transaction networks, the Multiple-TSGN model proposed is able\nto preserve the temporal transaction flow information and capture the\nsignificant topological pattern of phishing scams, while reducing the time\ncomplexity of modeling large-scale networks. Extensive experimental results\nshow that TSGN models can provide more potential information to improve the\nperformance of phishing detection by incorporating graph representation\nlearning.",

When\nthe consensus phase is eliminated from a blockchain, transactions could be\ncanonized quickly using a well-defined universal rule without consuming hashing\npower. Thus, the transactions per second(TPS) metric of such the consensusless\nblockchain can be largely boosted. Although consensus blockchain is promising,\nseveral technical challenges are also crucial. For example, double-spending\nattacks and frequent forking events must be prevented, the credit of block's\nminting must be carefully defined, and etc. To address those technical\nchallenges, we propose several solutions for our consensusless blockchain (CB),\nincluding a naive monotonic scoring mechanism to calculate the ranking of each\nblock in the chain, and a two-stage witness mechanism to add new blocks.

The rapid evolution of the\ncurrent threat landscape has seen many organisations share CTI to strengthen\ntheir security posture for mutual benefit. However, in many cases, CTI data\ncontains attributes (e.g., software versions) that have the potential to leak\nsensitive information or cause reputational damage to the sharing organisation.\nWhile current approaches allow restricting CTI sharing to trusted\norganisations, they lack solutions where the shared data can be verified and\ndisseminated `differentially' (i.e., selective information sharing) with\npolicies and metrics flexibly defined by an organisation. In this paper, we\npropose a blockchain-based CTI sharing framework that allows organisations to\nshare sensitive CTI data in a trusted, verifiable and differential manner. We\ndiscuss the limitations associated with existing approaches and highlight the\nadvantages of the proposed CTI sharing framework.

To manage this emerging economy in a\nmore organised way, and fight the so common NFT plagiarism, we propose\nCopyrightLY, a decentralized application for authorship and copyright\nmanagement. It provides means to claim content authorship, including supporting\nevidence. Content and metadata are stored in decentralized storage and\nregistered on the blockchain. A token is used to curate these claims, and\npotential complaints, by staking it on them. Staking is incentivized by the\nfact that the token is minted using a bonding curve. The tokenomics include the\nresolution of complaints and enabling the monetization of curated claims.\nMonetization is achieved through licensing NFTs with metadata enhanced by\nsemantic technologies. Semantic data makes explicit the reuse conditions\ntransferred with the token while keeping the connection to the underlying\ncopyright claims to improve the trustability of the NFTs. Moreover, the\nsemantic metadata is flexible enough to enable licensing not just in the real\nworld. Licenses can refer to reuses in specific locations in a metaverse, thus\nfacilitating the emergence of creative economies in them.",

We view\nexperiments today in web3 identity as additive and complementary, and argue\nthat often cited differences are of degree and more in form, less in substance.\nBy way of illustration, we compare decentralized naming services and blockchain\nbased identity certificates such as soulbound tokens (SBTs) to decentralized\nidentifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs). Both paradigms, to the\nextent they can be meaningfully differentiated, share similar potential as well\nas challenges. Specifically, we refer to fears about non consensual\nverification (scarlet letters) and show DID method iterations are not immune by\nissuing an innocuous public scarlet letter to a DIDs associated public address\nfor anyone to see. Moreover, we argue that because SBTs are unspecified, one\ncould characterize SBTs as an iteration, or extension, of VCs that additionally\naspire to achieve composability with web3 smart contracts for correct execution\nof code, privacy, coercion resistance, and censorship resistance. We offer\nresearch paths for how VCs can also achieve these properties. We do not comment\non cost, scalability, transferability, or common knowledge as they have been\npreviously reviewed.",

However, comparative evaluations of design choices require\nmacro-benchmarks for uniform and comprehensive performance evaluations of\nblockchains at the system level rather than performance metrics of isolated\ncomponents. To address this research gap, we implement Gromit, a generic\nframework for analyzing blockchain systems. Gromit treats each system under\ntest as a transaction fabric where clients issue transactions to validators. We\nuse Gromit to conduct the largest blockchain study to date, involving seven\nrepresentative systems with varying consensus models. We determine the peak\nperformance of these systems with a synthetic workload in terms of transaction\nthroughput and scalability and show that transaction throughput does not scale\nwith the number of validators.

This can be done by proving that the ideal and the\nreal behavior are equivalent.\n  In the work described in this paper, we take an important step towards such a\nproof by proving a simpler variant of the above equivalence statement. The\nsimplification is that we consider only a concrete pair of network topologies,\nwhich nevertheless illustrates important phenomena encountered with arbitrary\ntopologies.

            "summary": "Recently, distributed ledger technologies like blockchain have been\nproliferating and have attracted interest from the academic community,\ngovernment, and industry. A wide range of blockchain solutions has been\nintroduced, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger technologies in the\nliterature. However, tools for evaluating these solutions and their\napplications are still lacking, limiting the exploration of their potentiality\nand associated challenges/limitations. That is, experimenting with real\nblockchain networks usually requires a solid budget; and thus, sophisticated\nblockchain simulators can facilitate designing and evaluating solutions before\nthe actual implementation stage. The quality of such simulators depends on\nseveral factors such as usability, reliability, provided capabilities, and\nsupported features. This paper aims to provide a systemic mapping review of\nblockchain simulators focusing on these quality factors. This paper also sheds\nlight on the configuration parameters (inputs) and produced metrics (outputs)\nsupported by each simulator. Furthermore, it investigates which metrics\nsupported by each simulator are scientifically validated/evaluated. Moreover,\ncode quality comparison is carried out to assess the source code of the covered\nsimulators. The results reveal that no simulator fully covers the wide\noperational range of features and capabilities of existing blockchain\ntechnologies. However, several promising efforts exist in the domain of\nblockchain simulation with interesting and useful features. Finally, we discuss\nthe subject of blockchain simulation and provide our insight into the matter.",

            "summary": "Proof of work (PoW), as the representative consensus protocol for blockchain,\nconsumes enormous amounts of computation and energy to determine bookkeeping\nrights among miners but does not achieve any practical purposes. To address the\ndrawback of PoW, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus mechanism named\nplatform-free proof of federated learning (PF-PoFL), which leverages the\ncomputing power originally wasted in solving hard but meaningless PoW puzzles\nto conduct practical federated learning (FL) tasks. Nevertheless, potential\nsecurity threats and efficiency concerns may occur due to the untrusted\nenvironment and miners' self-interested features. In this paper, by devising a\nnovel block structure, new transaction types, and credit-based incentives,\nPF-PoFL allows efficient artificial intelligence (AI) task outsourcing,\nfederated mining, model evaluation, and reward distribution in a fully\ndecentralized manner, while resisting spoofing and Sybil attacks. Besides,\nPF-PoFL equips with a user-level differential privacy mechanism for miners to\nprevent implicit privacy leakage in training FL models. Furthermore, by\nconsidering dynamic miner characteristics (e.g., training samples, non-IID\ndegree, and network delay) under diverse FL tasks, a federation formation\ngame-based mechanism is presented to distributively form the optimized disjoint\nminer partition structure with Nash-stable convergence. Extensive simulations\nvalidate the efficiency and effectiveness of PF-PoFL.",

Bootstrapping ensures safety and liveness\nduring the transient stage by protecting against a majority mining attack,\nallowing a PoW chain to grow the participation base and corresponding mining\nhash power. Liveness is especially important since a loss of liveness will lead\nto loss of honest mining rewards, decreasing honest participation, hence\ncreating an undesired spiral; indeed existing bootstrapping mechanisms offer\nespecially weak liveness guarantees.\n  In this paper, we propose Advocate, a new bootstrapping methodology, which\nachieves two main results: (a) optimal liveness and low latency under a\nsuper-majority adversary for the Nakamoto longest chain protocol and (b)\nimmediate black-box generalization to a variety of parallel-chain based scaling\narchitectures, including OHIE and Prism.

            "summary": "The dominance of a few big companies in the storage market arising various\nconcerns including single point of failure, privacy violation, and oligopoly.\nTo eliminate the dependency on such a centralized storage architecture, several\nDecentralized Storage Network (DSN) schemes such as Filecoin, Sia, and Storj\nhave been introduced. DSNs leverage blockchain technology to create a storage\nplatform such that the micro storage providers can also participate in the\nstorage market. To verify the accurate data storage by the storage providers\nduring a storage contract, DSNs apply a Proof of Storage (PoS) scheme to\ncontinuously inspect the storage service. However, continuous verification of\nthe storage provider imposes an extra cost to the network and therefore\nend-users. Moreover, DSN's PoS verification is vulnerable to a service denying\nattack in which the storage provider submits valid PoS to the network while\ndenying the service to the client.\n  Considering the benefits and existing challenges of DSNs, this paper\nintroduces a novel incentive-compatible DSN scheme. In this scheme, the PoS is\nconducted only if the client submits a challenge request. We model the storage\nservice as a repeated dynamic game and set the players' payoffs such that the\nstorage provider's dominant strategy is to honestly follow the storage\ncontract. Our proposed mechanism leverages the smart-contract and oracle\nnetwork to govern the storage agreement between the client and storage provider\nefficiently. Furthermore, our scheme is independent of a specific blockchain\nplatform but can be plugged into any blockchain platform with smart-contract\nexecution capability. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our scheme\nusing solidity language and chainlink oracle network. The performance analysis\ndemonstrates the applicability of our scheme.",

Latency on the\nblockchain, however, has prevented decentralized exchanges (DEXes) from\nutilizing the order book mechanism and instead gave rise to the development of\nmarket designs that are better suited to a blockchain. Although the first\nwidely popularized DEX, Uniswap V2, stood out through its astonishing\nsimplicity, a recent design overhaul introduced with Uniswap V3 has introduced\nincreasing levels of complexity aiming to increase capital efficiency.\n  In this work, we empirically study the ability of Unsiwap V3 to handle\nunexpected price shocks. Our analysis finds that the prices on Uniswap V3 were\ninaccurate during the recent abrupt price drops of two stablecoins: UST and\nUSDT. We identify the lack of agility required of Unsiwap V3 liquidity\nproviders as the root cause of these worrying price inaccuracies. Additionally,\nwe outline that there are too few incentives for liquidity providers to enter\nliquidity pools, given the elevated volatility in such market conditions.",

            "summary": "The large public interest in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) will soon lead to\ncongested skies overhead cities, analogously to what happened with other\ntransportation means, including commercial aviation. In the latter case, the\ncombination of large distances and demanded number flights is such that a\nsystem with centralized control, with most of the decisions made by human\noperators, is safe. However, for AAM, it is expected a much higher demand,\nbecause it will be used for people's daily commutes. Thus, higher automation\nlevels will become a requirement for coordinating this traffic, which might not\nbe effectively managed by humans. The establishment of fixed air routes can\nabate complexity, however at the cost of limiting capacity and decreasing\nefficiency. Another alternative is the use of a powerful central system based\non Artificial Intelligence (AI), which would allow flexible trajectories and\nhigher efficiency. However, such system would require concentrated investment,\ncould contain Single-Points-of-Failure (SPoFs), would be a highly sought target\nof malicious attacks, and would be subject to periods of unavailability.\n  This work proposes a new technology that solves the problem of managing the\nhigh complexity of the AAM traffic with a secure distributed approach, without\nthe need for a proprietary centralized automation system. This technology\nenables distributed airspace allocation management and conflict resolution by\nmeans of trusted shared data structures and associated smart contracts running\non a blockchain ecosystem. This way, it greatly reduces the risk of system\noutages due to SPoFs, by allowing peer-to-peer conflict resolution, and being\nmore resilient to failures in the ground communication infrastructure.\nFurthermore, it provides priority-based balancing mechanisms that help to\nregulate fairness among participants in the utilization of the airspace.",
