            "summary": "This paper reviews and highlights how coding schemes have been used to solve\nvarious problems in blockchain systems. Specifically, these problems relate to\nscaling blockchains in terms of their data storage, computation and\ncommunication cost, as well as security. To this end, this paper considers the\nuse of coded blocks or shards that allows participants to store only a fraction\nof the total blockchain, protect against malicious nodes or erasures due to\nnodes leaving a blockchain system, ensure data availability in order to promote\ntransparency, and scale the security of sharded blockchains. Further, it helps\nreduce communication cost when disseminating blocks, which is critical to\nbootstrapping new nodes and helps speed up consensus of blocks. For each\ncategory of solutions, we highlight problems and issues that motivated their\ndesigns and use of coding. Moreover, we provide a qualitative analysis of their\nstorage, communication and computation cost.",

            "summary": "Travel has been challenging recently since different nations have implemented\nvaried immigration and travel policies. For the time being, immigration\nofficials want proof of each person's immunity to the virus. A vaccine passport\nserves as evidence that a person has tested negative for or is immune to a\nparticular virus. In terms of COVID-19, those who hold a vaccine passport will\nbe permitted entry into other nations as long as they can provide proof that\nthey have COVID-19 antibodies from prior infections or from full COVID-19\nimmunizations. To reduce time and effort spent managing data, the vaccination\npassport system has been digitalized. The process of contact tracing may be\nfacilitated by digitization. The \"Blockchain technology\" system, which is\ncurrently in use, has demonstrated its security and privacy in systems for data\nexchange among bitcoin users. The Digital Vaccination Passport scheme can use\nBlockchain technology. The end result would be a decentralized, traceable,\ntransparent, reliable, auditable, secure, and trustworthy solution based on the\nEthereum block-chain that would allow tracking of vaccines given and the\nhistory of diseases.",

            "summary": "The number of internet-connected devices has been exponentially growing with\nthe massive volume of heterogeneous data generated from various devices,\nresulting in a highly intertwined cyber-physical system. Currently, the Edge\nIntelligence System (EIS) concept that leverages the merits of edge computing\nand Artificial Intelligence (AI) is utilized to provide smart cloud services\nwith powerful computational processing and reduce decision-making delays. Thus,\nEIS offers a possible solution to realizing future Intelligent Transportation\nSystems (ITS), especially in a vehicular network framework. However, since the\ncentral aggregator server supervises the entire system orchestration, the\nexisting EIS framework faces several challenges and is still potentially\nsusceptible to numerous malicious attacks. Hence, to solve the issues mentioned\nearlier, this paper presents the notion of secure edge intelligence, merging\nthe benefits of Federated Learning (FL), blockchain, and Local Differential\nPrivacy (LDP). The blockchain-assisted FL approach efficiently improves traffic\nprediction accuracy and enhances user privacy and security by recording\ntransactions in immutable distributed ledger networks and providing a\ndecentralized reward mechanism system. Furthermore, LDP is empowered to\nstrengthen the confidentiality of data sharing transactions, especially in\nprotecting users' private data from various attacks. The proposed framework has\nbeen implemented in two scenarios, i.e., blockchain-based FL to efficiently\ndevelop the decentralized traffic management for vehicular networks and\nLDP-based FL to produce randomized privacy protection using the IBM Library for\ndifferential privacy.",

While EVM compatibility allows\nexisting Ethereum users and developers to migrate more easily over to the\nalternative layer-1, EVM incompatibility might allow the firms to build more\nloyal and ``sticky'' user base, and in turn a more robust ecosystem. As such,\nthe choice to be EVM-compatible is not merely a technological decision, but\nalso an important strategic decision. In this paper, we develop a game\ntheoretic model to study this competitive dynamic, and find that at\nequilibrium, new entrants/developers tend to adopt the dominant blockchain. To\navoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains have to either (1) directly\nsubsidize the new entrant firms or (2) offer better features, which in practice\ncan take form in lower transaction costs, faster finality, or larger network\neffects. We find that it is easier for EVM-compatible blockchains to attract\nusers through direct subsidy, while it is more efficient for EVM-incompatible\nblockchains to attract users through offering better features/products.",

            "summary": "Public blockchains implement a fee mechanism to allocate scarce computational\nresources across competing transactions. Most existing fee market designs\nutilize a joint, fungible unit of account (e.g., gas in Ethereum) to price\notherwise non-fungible resources such as bandwidth, computation, and storage,\nby hardcoding their relative prices. Fixing the relative price of each resource\nin this way inhibits granular price discovery, limiting scalability and opening\nup the possibility of denial-of-service attacks. As a result, many prominent\nnetworks such as Ethereum and Solana have proposed multi-dimensional fee\nmarkets. In this paper, we provide a principled way to design fee markets that\nefficiently price multiple non-fungible resources. Starting from a loss\nfunction specified by the network designer, we show how to compute dynamic\nprices that align the network's incentives (to minimize the loss) with those of\nthe users and miners (to maximize their welfare), even as demand for these\nresources changes. Our pricing mechanism follows from a natural decomposition\nof the network designer's problem into two parts that are related to each other\nvia the resource prices. These results can be used to efficiently set fees in\norder to improve network performance.",

That is particularly true for the Ethereum blockchain, which, so far,\nhas been the ecosystem with the highest adoption rate. Quite a few solutions,\nespecially on the Ethereum side of things, have been attempted in the last few\nyears. Most of them adopt the approach to offload transactions from the\nblockchain mainnet, a.k.a. Level 1 (L1), to a separate network. Such systems\nare collectively known as Level 2 (L2) systems. While mitigating the\nscalability issue, the adoption of L2 introduces additional drawbacks: users\nhave to trust that the L2 system has correctly performed transactions or,\nconversely, high computational power is required to prove transactions\ncorrectness. In addition, significant technical knowledge is needed to set up\nand manage such an L2 system.

            "summary": "Since the traffic conditions change over time, machine learning models that\npredict traffic flows must be updated continuously and efficiently in smart\npublic transportation. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine\nlearning scheme that allows buses to receive model updates without waiting for\nmodel training on the cloud. However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning or DDoS\nattacks since buses travel in public. Some work introduces blockchain to\nimprove reliability, but the additional latency from the consensus process\nreduces the efficiency of FL. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) is a scheme\nthat reduces the latency of aggregation to improve efficiency, but the learning\nperformance is unstable due to unreasonably weighted local models. To address\nthe above challenges, this paper offers a blockchain-based asynchronous\nfederated learning scheme with a dynamic scaling factor (DBAFL). Specifically,\nthe novel committee-based consensus algorithm for blockchain improves\nreliability at the lowest possible cost of time. Meanwhile, the devised dynamic\nscaling factor allows AFL to assign reasonable weights to stale local models.\nExtensive experiments conducted on heterogeneous devices validate outperformed\nlearning performance, efficiency, and reliability of DBAFL.",

In the past year, there have been more than ten severe attacks\nagainst cross-chain bridges, causing billions of loss.

Based on those patterns, we design Xscope, an\nautomatic tool to find security violations in cross-chain bridges and detect\nreal-world attacks.

Existing authorisation methods\nfor the IoT network are based on traditional access control models, which have\nseveral drawbacks, including architecture centralisation, policy tampering,\naccess rights validation, malicious third-party policy assignment and control,\nand network-related overheads. The increasing trend of integrating Blockchain\ntechnology with IoT networks demonstrates its importance and potential to\naddress the shortcomings of traditional IoT network authorisation mechanisms.\nThis paper proposes a decentralised, secure, dynamic, and flexible\nauthorisation scheme for IoT networks based on attribute-based access control\n(ABAC) fine-grained policies stored on a distributed immutable ledger. We\ndesign a Blockchain-based ABAC policy management framework divided into\nAttribute Management Authority (AMA) and Policy Management Authority (PMA)\nframeworks that use smart contract features to initialise, store, and manage\nattributes and policies on the Blockchain. To achieve flexibility and\ndynamicity in the authorisation process, we capture and utilise the\nenvironmental-related attributes in conjunction with the subject and object\nattributes of the ABAC model to define the policies. Furthermore, we designed\nthe Blockchain-based Access Management Framework (AMF) to manage user requests\nto access IoT devices while maintaining the privacy and auditability of user\nrequests and assigned policies. We implemented a prototype of our proposed\nscheme and executed it on the local Ethereum Blockchain. Finally, we\ndemonstrated the applicability and flexibility of our proposed scheme for an\nIoT-based smart home scenario, taking into account deployment, execution and\nfinancial costs.",

            "summary": "The safety-critical scenarios of artificial intelligence (AI), such as\nautonomous driving, Internet of Things, smart healthcare, etc., have raised\ncritical requirements of trustworthy AI to guarantee the privacy and security\nwith reliable decisions. As a nascent branch for trustworthy AI, federated\nlearning (FL) has been regarded as a promising privacy preserving framework for\ntraining a global AI model over collaborative devices. However, security\nchallenges still exist in the FL framework, e.g., Byzantine attacks from\nmalicious devices, and model tampering attacks from malicious server, which\nwill degrade or destroy the accuracy of trained global AI model. In this paper,\nwe shall propose a decentralized blockchain based FL (B-FL) architecture by\nusing a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and\ndeploying practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high\neffectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent\nmodel tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at\nthe network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus\nprotocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network\noptimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for\nthe minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of\nprogressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network\noptimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep\nreinforcement learning based algorithm to provide high system performance with\nlow computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that B-FL can\nresist malicious attacks from edge devices and servers, and the training\nlatency of B-FL can be significantly reduced by deep reinforcement learning\nbased algorithm compared with baseline algorithms.",

            "summary": "Recently, blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) has attracted intensive\nresearch attention due to that the training process is auditable and the\narchitecture is serverless avoiding the single point failure of the parameter\nserver in vanilla federated learning (VFL). Nevertheless, BFL tremendously\nescalates the communication traffic volume because all local model updates\n(i.e., changes of model parameters) obtained by BFL clients will be transmitted\nto all miners for verification and to all clients for aggregation. In contrast,\nthe parameter server and clients in VFL only retain aggregated model updates.\nConsequently, the huge communication traffic in BFL will inevitably impair the\ntraining efficiency and hinder the deployment of BFL in reality. To improve the\npracticality of BFL, we are among the first to propose a fast blockchain-based\ncommunication-efficient federated learning framework by compressing\ncommunications in BFL, called BCFL. Meanwhile, we derive the convergence rate\nof BCFL with non-convex loss. To maximize the final model accuracy, we further\nformulate the problem to minimize the training loss of the convergence rate\nsubject to a limited training time with respect to the compression rate and the\nblock generation rate, which is a bi-convex optimization problem and can be\nefficiently solved. To the end, to demonstrate the efficiency of BCFL, we carry\nout extensive experiments with standard CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets. Our\nexperimental results not only verify the correctness of our analysis, but also\nmanifest that BCFL can remarkably reduce the communication traffic by 95-98% or\nshorten the training time by 90-95% compared with BFL.",

The current IoT platforms lack techniques for transparent and\ntamper-proof ordering of events due to their device-centric logging mechanism.\nIn this paper, we develop a framework that facilitates tamper-proof\ntransparency and event order in an IoT platform by proposing a Blockchain\nprotocol and adopting the vector clock system, both tailored for the\nresource-constrained heterogeneous IoT devices, respectively. To cope with the\nunsuited storage (e.g., ledger) and computing power (e.g., proof of work\npuzzle) requirements of the Blockchain in the commercial off-the-shelf IoT\ndevices, we propose a partial consistent cut protocol and engineer a modular\narithmetic-based lightweight proof of work puzzle, respectively. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first Blockchain designed for resource-constrained\nheterogeneous IoT platforms. Our event ordering protocol based on the vector\nclock system is also novel for the IoT platforms. We implement our framework\nusing an IoT gateway and 30 IoT devices. We experiment with 10 concurrent\ntrigger-action-based event chains while each chain involves 20 devices, and\neach device participates in 5 different chains. The results show that our\nframework may order these events in 2.5 seconds while consuming only 140 mJ of\nenergy per device. The results hence demonstrate the proposed platform as a\npractical choice for many IoT applications such as smart home, traffic\nmonitoring, and crime investigation.",

Bitcoin has successfully suppressed double-spending by\naccepting the longest PoW chain. Nevertheless, PoW encountered several major\nsecurity issues surrounding mining competition. One of them is a Block\nWithHolding (BWH) attack that can exploit a widespread and cooperative\nenvironment called a mining pool. This attack takes advantage of untrustworthy\nrelationships between mining pools and participating agents. Moreover,\ndetecting or responding to attacks is challenging due to the nature of mining\npools. In this paper, however, we suggest that BWH attacks also have a\ncomparable trust problem. Because a BWH attacker cannot have complete control\nover BWH agents, they can betray the belonging mining pool and seek further\nbenefits by trading with victims. We prove that this betrayal is not only valid\nin all attack parameters but also provides double benefits; finally, it is the\nbest strategy for BWH agents. Furthermore, our study implies that BWH attacks\nmay encounter self-destruction of their own revenue, contrary to their\nintention.",

To address this\nissue, this paper proposes a practical blockchain-based mobile edge computing\n(MEC) platform for resource sharing and optimal utilization to complete the\nrequested offloading tasks, given the heterogeneity of servers' available\nresources and that of users' task requests. To be specific, we first elaborate\nthe design of our proposed system and then dive into the task allocation\nmechanism to assign offloading tasks to proper servers. To solve the multiple\ntask allocation (MTA) problem in polynomial time, we devise a learning-based\nalgorithm. Since the objective function and constraints of MTA are\nsignificantly affected by the servers uploading the tasks, we reformulate it as\na reinforcement learning problem and calculate the rewards for each state and\naction considering the influences of servers. Finally, numerous experiments are\nconducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed\nsystem and algorithms.",

DeFi\ncomposability denotes the concatenation of DeFi services in which each DeFi\nservice locks assets as collateral and gives another asset as liquidity of\nlocked assets to providers. Providers use the tokens given for other\nconcatenated DeFi services, such as lending, decentralized exchanges (DEXs),\nand derivatives. The DeFi ecosystem uses ERC-20 tokens which can represent the\nvalue of an asset. ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are not widely adopted in\nDeFi, since they represent rights to an asset and are not considered\nappropriate for valuation. In this paper, we propose a new concept, perpetual\ncontract NFT, which exploits perpetual future contracts in the cryptocurrency\nderivatives market. Unlike futures contracts in a traditional derivatives\nmarket, in the cryptocurrency derivatives market, most futures contracts are\nperpetual. In addition, the value of futures contract is backed by collateral.\nTherefore, if we mint the rights to perpetual contracts as NFT, we can use the\nperpetual contract NFT as collateral for DeFi composability. To validate our\nproposal and its profitability, we experiment with the position NFT of Uniswap\nv3. Through validation, we show that our concept works in real-world scenarios.",

            "summary": "Layer 2 systems have received increasing attention due to their potential to\nscale the throughput of L1 blockchains. To avoid the cost of putting data on\nchain, these systems increasingly turn to off-chain data availability solutions\nsuch as data availability committees (DACs). However, placing trust on DACs\nconflicts with the goal of obtaining an L2 architecture whose security relies\nsolely on the L1 chain. To eliminate such trust assumptions, we propose a DAC\nprotocol that provides financial incentives to deter the DAC nodes from\nadversarial behavior such as withholding data upon request. We then analyze the\ninteraction of rational DAC nodes and clients as a dynamic game, with a\nByzantine adversary that can corrupt and bribe the participants. We also define\na notion of optimality for the DAC protocols, inspired by fairness and economic\nfeasibility. Our main result shows that our protocol is optimal and guarantees\nsecurity with the highest possible probability under reasonable assumptions on\nthe adversary.",

To\nprotect end users from being harmed and hide transactions from the mempool,\nprivate transactions, a special type of transactions that are sent directly to\nminers, were invented. Private transactions have a high probability of being\npacked to the front positions of a block and being added to the blockchain by\nthe target miner, without going through the public mempool, thus reducing the\nrisk of being attacked by malicious entities.\n  Despite the good intention of inventing private transactions, due to their\nstealthy nature, private transactions have also been used by attackers to\nlaunch attacks, which has a negative impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. However,\nexisting works only touch upon private transactions as by-products when\nstudying MEV, while a systematic study on private transactions is still\nmissing. To fill this gap and paint a complete picture of private transactions,\nwe take the first step towards investigating the private transactions on\nEthereum. In particular, we collect large-scale private transaction datasets\nand perform analysis on their characteristics, transaction costs and miner\nprofits, as well as security impacts. This work provides deep insights on\ndifferent aspects of private transactions.",

Indeed, current networks connect a massive number of objects over\nthe Internet and in this complex scenario, to ensure security, privacy,\nconfidentiality, and programmability, the utilization of BC and SDN have been\nsuccessfully proposed. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey\nregarding these two recent research trends and review the related\nstate-of-the-art literature. We first describe the main features of each\ntechnology and discuss their most common and used variants. Furthermore, we\nenvision the integration of such technologies to jointly take advantage of\nthese latter efficiently. Indeed, we consider their group-wise utilization --\nnamed BC-SDN -- based on the need for stronger security and privacy.\nAdditionally, we cover the application fields of these technologies both\nindividually and combined. Finally, we discuss the open issues of reviewed\nresearch and describe potential directions for future avenues regarding the\nintegration of BC and SDN.\n  To summarize, the contribution of the present survey spans from an overview\nof the literature background on BC and SDN to the discussion of the benefits\nand limitations of BC-SDN integration in different fields, which also raises\nopen challenges and possible future avenues examined herein. To the best of our\nknowledge, compared to existing surveys, this is the first work that analyzes\nthe aforementioned aspects in light of a broad BC-SDN integration, with a\nspecific focus on security and privacy issues in actual utilization scenarios.",

            "summary": "Blockchain systems are designed, built and operated in the presence of\nfailures. There are two dominant failure models, namely crash fault and\nByzantine fault. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols offer stronger\nsecurity guarantees, and thus are widely used in blockchain systems. However,\ntheir security guarantees come at a dear cost to their performance and\nscalability. Several works have improved BFT protocols, and Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE) has been shown to be an effective solution. However, existing\nsuch works typically assume that each participating node is equipped with TEE.\nFor blockchain systems wherein participants typically have different hardware\nconfigurations, i.e., some nodes feature TEE while others do not, existing\nTEE-based BFT protocols are not applicable.\n  This work studies the setting wherein not all participating nodes feature\nTEE, under which we propose a new fault model called mixed fault. We explore a\nnew approach to designing efficient distributed fault-tolerant protocols under\nthe mixed fault model. In general, mixed fault tolerance (MFT) protocols assume\na network of $n$ nodes, among which up to $f = \\frac{n-2}{3}$ can be subject to\nmixed faults. We identify two key principles for designing efficient MFT\nprotocols, namely, (i) prioritizing non-equivocating nodes in leading the\nprotocol, and (ii) advocating the use of public-key cryptographic primitives\nthat allow authenticated messages to be aggregated. We showcase these design\nprinciples by prescribing an MFT protocol, namely MRaft.\n  We implemented a prototype of MRaft using Intel SGX, integrated it into the\nCCF blockchain framework, conducted experiments, and showed that MFT protocols\ncan obtain the same security guarantees as their BFT counterparts while still\nproviding better performance (both transaction throughput and latency) and\nscalability.",

            "summary": "The Lightning Network (LN) has enjoyed rapid growth over recent years, and\nhas become the most popular scaling solution for the Bitcoin blockchain. The\nsecurity of the LN hinges on the ability of the nodes to close a channel by\nsettling their balances, which requires confirming a transaction on the Bitcoin\nblockchain within a pre-agreed time period. This inherent timing restriction\nthat the LN must satisfy, make it susceptible to attacks that seek to increase\nthe congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain, thus preventing correct protocol\nexecution. We study the susceptibility of the LN to \\emph{mass exit} attacks,\nin the presence of a small coalition of adversarial nodes. This is a scenario\nwhere an adversary forces a large set of honest protocol participants to\ninteract with the blockchain. We focus on two types of attacks: (i) The first\nis a \\emph{zombie} attack, where a set of $k$ nodes become unresponsive with\nthe goal to lock the funds of many channels for a period of time longer than\nwhat the LN protocol dictates. (ii) The second is a \\emph{mass double-spend}\nattack, where a set of $k$ nodes attempt to steal funds by submitting many\nclosing transactions that settle channels using expired protocol states; this\ncauses many honest nodes to have to quickly respond by submitting invalidating\ntransactions. We show via simulations that, under historically-plausible\ncongestion conditions, with mild statistical assumptions on channel balances,\nboth of the attacks can be performed by a very small coalition. To perform our\nsimulations, we formulate the problem of finding a worst-case coalition of $k$\nadversarial nodes as a graph cut problem. Our experimental findings are\nsupported by a theoretical justification based on the scale-free topology of\nthe LN.",

Citizens need to physically present and cast their\nvote in ballot-paper-based voting systems. Most of the citizens fail to fulfill\nthis constraint and have stayed away from their fundamental duty.\nElectronic-voting systems are often considered one efficient alternative in\nsuch situations. Blockchain Technology is an emerging technology that can\nprovide a real solution as it is characterized by immutable, transparent,\nanonymous, and decentralized properties. This paper presents a security\nrequirement analysis for e-voting systems and evaluates blockchain technology\nagainst these requirements.",

            "summary": "Many cryptocurrency platforms are vulnerable to Maximal Extractable Value\n(MEV) attacks, where a malicious consensus leader can inject transactions or\nchange the order of user transactions to maximize its profit. A promising line\nof research in MEV mitigation is to enhance the Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)\nconsensus core of blockchains by new functionalities, like hiding transaction\ncontents, such that malicious parties cannot analyze and exploit them until\nthey are ordered. An orthogonal line of research demonstrates excellent\nperformance for BFT protocols designed around Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG).\nThey provide high throughput by keeping high network utilization, decoupling\ntransactions' dissemination from their metadata ordering, and encoding\nconsensus logic efficiently over a DAG representing a causal ordering of\ndisseminated messages. This paper explains how to combine these two advances.\nIt introduces a DAG-based protocol called Fino, that integrates MEV-resistance\nfeatures into DAG-based BFT without delaying the steady spreading of\ntransactions by the DAG transport and with zero message overhead. The scheme\noperates without complex secret share verifiability or recoverability, and\navoids costly threshold encryption.",

            "summary": "Blockchains are meant to be persistent: posted transactions are immutable and\ncannot be changed. When a theft takes place, there are limited options for\nreversing the disputed transaction, and this has led to significant losses in\nthe blockchain ecosystem.\n  In this paper we propose reversible versions of ERC-20 and ERC-721, the most\nwidely used token standards. With these new standards, a transaction is\neligible for reversal for a short period of time after it has been posted on\nchain. After the dispute period has elapsed, the transaction can no longer be\nreversed. Within the short dispute period, a sender can request to reverse a\ntransaction by convincing a decentralized set of judges to first freeze the\ndisputed assets, and then later convincing them to reverse the transaction.\n  Supporting reversibility in the context of ERC-20 and ERC-721 raises many\ninteresting technical challenges. This paper explores these challenges and\nproposes a design for our ERC-20R and ERC-721R standards, the reversible\nversions of ERC-20 and ERC-721. We also provide a prototype implementation. Our\ngoal is to initiate a deeper conversation about reversibility in the hope of\nreducing some of the losses in the blockchain ecosystem.",

            "summary": "Fair exchange protocols let two mutually distrustful parties exchange digital\ndata in a way that neither party can cheat. They have various applications such\nas the exchange of digital items, or the exchange of digital coins and digital\nservices between a buyer/client and seller/server.\n  In this work, we formally define and propose a generic blockchain-based\nconstruction called \"Recurring Contingent Service Payment\" (RC-S-P). It (i)\nlets a fair exchange of digital coins and verifiable service reoccur securely\nbetween clients and a server while ensuring that the server is paid if and only\nif it delivers a valid service, and (ii) ensures the parties' privacy is\npreserved. RC-S-P supports arbitrary verifiable services, such as \"Proofs of\nRetrievability\" (PoR) or verifiable computation and imposes low on-chain\noverheads. Our formal treatment and construction, for the first time, consider\nthe setting where either client or server is malicious.\n  We also present a concrete efficient instantiation of RC- S-P when the\nverifiable service is PoR. We implemented the concrete instantiation and\nanalysed its cost. When it deals with a 4-GB outsourced file, a verifier can\ncheck a proof in only 90 milliseconds, and a dispute between a prover and\nverifier is resolved in 0.1 milliseconds.\n  At CCS 2017, two blockchain-based protocols were proposed to support the fair\nexchange of digital coins and a certain verifiable service; namely, PoR. In\nthis work, we show that these protocols (i) are susceptible to a free-riding\nattack which enables a client to receive the service without paying the server,\nand (ii) are not suitable for cases where parties' privacy matters, e.g., when\nthe server's proof status or buyer's file size must remain private from the\npublic. RC- S-P simultaneously mitigates the above attack and preserves the\nparties' privacy.",

Three main findings emerged: 1) Even among those\nself-identifying as highly knowledgeable, most considerably underestimated\nBitcoin's electricity consumption. 2) Participants with a more accurate\nunderstanding of Bitcoin's energy demand were more inclined to support\nsustainability measures. 3) Most of this supportive cohort viewed private\nentities as the primary stakeholders for implementing such measures.

            "summary": "Due to the open-source nature of the blockchain ecosystem, it is common for\nnew blockchains to fork or partially reuse the code of classic blockchains. For\nexample, the popular Dogecoin, Litecoin, Binance BSC, and Polygon are all\nvariants of Bitcoin/Ethereum. These \"forked\" blockchains thus could encounter\nsimilar vulnerabilities that are propagated from Bitcoin/Ethereum during\nforking or subsequently commit fetching. In this paper, we conduct a systematic\nstudy of detecting and investigating the propagated vulnerabilities in forked\nblockchain projects. To facilitate this study, we propose BlockScope, a novel\ntool that can effectively and efficiently detect multiple types of cloned\nvulnerabilities given an input of existing Bitcoin/Ethereum security patches.\nSpecifically, BlockScope adopts similarity-based code match and designs a new\nway of calculating code similarity to cover all the syntax-wide variant (i.e.,\nType-1, Type-2, and Type-3) clones. Moreover, BlockScope automatically extracts\nand leverages the contexts of patch code to narrow down the search scope and\nlocate only potentially relevant code for comparison. Our evaluation shows that\nBlockScope achieves good precision and high recall both at 91.8% (1.8 times\nhigher recall than that in ReDeBug). BlockScope allows us to discover 101\npreviously unknown vulnerabilities in 13 out of the 16 forked projects of\nBitcoin and Ethereum, including 16 from Dogecoin, 6 from Litecoin, 1 from\nBinance, and 4 from Optimism. We have reported all the vulnerabilities to their\ndevelopers; 40 of them have been patched or accepted, 66 were acknowledged or\nunder pending, and only 4 were rejected. We further investigate the propagation\nand patching processes of discovered vulnerabilities, and reveal three types of\nvulnerability propagation from source to forked projects, as well as the long\ndelay (over 200 days) for releasing patches in Bitcoin forks.",

This includes\nfunctionality for e.g. identity management, access control, request handling,\nverification of authenticity and integrity, discovery, or routing. Blade\nimplements all this functionality in a Blade server instance, which can be\ndeployed on a lightweight device, such as a NAS, Raspberry Pi, or router at\nhome. This allows users without expert knowledge to run a Blade instance with\nalready existing hardware with little overhead. Blade supports polyglot Blade\nmodules that implement extended functionality, such as interfaces, frontends,\nand business logic of decentralized applications, e.g. a decentralized instant\nmessaging service or an online social network. Based on the Oracle GraalVM,\nBlade modules can be implemented in a variety of programming languages and\nutilize the functionality provided by the Blade server instance.

Bibliometric analysis helped\nto identify publishing and citation patterns, authorship and collaboration\nstructure, funding patterns of the published research, open access and\naltmetric impact, gender distribution and SDG connections etc. The\ntext-integrated path analysis helped in identifying the thematic structure and\nmajor concept evolution trajectories. The results of the analysis indicate that\nthe FGCS journal is a high-quality research journal that has grown over time in\nterms of publications, citations and rankings. It publishes articles in\nspecified thematic areas, with cloud, grid, IoT, Blockchain etc. found as the\nmajor themes addressed. Knowledge extension from cloud computing to\nmulti-domain networks is witnessed and a divergence towards service function\nchains, distributed machine learning and edge computing systems is visible. The\narticle thus presents very informative and useful insight about research\npublication trends in FGCS.",

The Quality\nof Service requirements can be quite different in terms of latency, bandwidth,\nreliability, and availability. 5G technology allows the fragmentation of the\nnetwork into small pieces, known as network slices. This network slicing is\ndone by specific tools and the configuration must be protected from attacks\nthat may be performed by malicious users. Thus in this paper, a solution to\nprotect and prevent these failures from happening is addressed. For this\nsolution to be carried out, a study was conducted on the Blockchain technology,\nas well as the use of Oracles in order to implement an integrity verification\nsystem, a system capable of assuring 5G network slices configuration integrity\nthrough a complete architecture involving Blockchain, Smart Contracts and\nOracles.",

Here, we develop and publicly release a general\npipeline to investigate the scholarly history of the term, analysing 425,144\nacademic publications that refer to (de)centralization. We find that the\nfraction of papers on the topic has been exponentially increasing since the\n1950s. In 2021, 1 author in 154 mentioned (de)centralization in the title or\nabstract of an article. Using both semantic information and citation patterns,\nwe cluster papers in fields and characterize the knowledge flows between them.\nOur analysis reveals that the topic has independently emerged in the different\nfields, with small cross-disciplinary contamination. Moreover, we show how\nBlockchain has become the most influential field about 10 years ago, while\nGovernance dominated before the 1990s. In summary, our findings provide a\nquantitative assessment of the evolution of a key yet elusive concept, which\nhas undergone cycles of rise and fall within different fields. Our pipeline\noffers a powerful tool to analyze the evolution of any scholarly term in the\nacademic literature, providing insights into the interplay between collective\nand independent discoveries in science.",

Lured by these impressive features,\ninvestors immediately appreciated the Polkadot project, which is now firmly\nranked among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by capitalization (around 20 Billions\nUSD). However, Polkadot has not received the same level of attention from\nacademia that other proposals in the crypto domain have received so far, like\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Algorand, to cite a few. Polkadot architecture is\ndescribed and discussed only in the grey literature, and very little is known\nabout its internals.\n  In this paper, we provide the first systematic study on the Polkadot\nenvironment, detailing its protocols, governance, and economic model. Then, we\nidentify several limitations -- supported by an empirical analysis of its\nledger -- that could severely affect the scalability and overall security of\nthe network.

Furthermore,\nMarvel DC utilizes a reputation management protocol to ensure that, for any\nminority of computers not performing calculations correctly, these computers\nare identified and selected for computations with diminishing probability. We\nthen outline Privacy Marvel DC, a privacy-enhanced version of Marvel DC which\ndecouples results from the computers which computed them, making the protocol\nsuitable for computations such as Federated Learning, where results can reveal\nsensitive information about that computer that computed them. We provide an\nimplementation of Marvel DC and analyses of both protocols, demonstrating that\nthey are not only the first protocols to provide the aforementioned formal\nguarantees, but are also practical, competitive with prior attempts in the\nfield, and ready to deploy.",

In this paper, we extend the mining attack's strategy space to\npartial block sharing, and propose a new and feasible Partial Selfish Mining\n(PSM) attack. We show that by releasing partial block data publicly and\nattracting rational miners to work on attacker's private branch, attackers and\nthese attracted miners can gain an unfair share of mining rewards. We then\npropose Advanced PSM (A-PSM) attack that can further improve attackers' profits\nto be no less than the selfish mining. Both theoretical and experimental\nresults show that PSM attackers can be more profitable than selfish miners\nunder a certain range of mining power and network conditions.

When the utility functions are linear or convex, we derive\nclose-form solutions and show that the bang-bang strategy is optimal (i.e.,\nalways buy or sell at full capacity). Furthermore, we bring out the explicit\nconnection between the rate of return in trading/holding stakes and the\nparticipant's risk-adjusted valuation of the stakes. In particular, we show\nwhen a participant is risk-neutral or risk-seeking, corresponding to the\nrisk-adjusted valuation being a martingale or a sub-martingale, the optimal\nstrategy must be to either buy all the time, sell all the time, or first buy\nthen sell, and with both buying and selling executed at full capacity.

AGAPECert utilizes a novel\nmix of trusted execution environments, blockchain technologies, and a real-time\ngraph-based API standard to provide automated, oblivious, and auditable\ncertification. Our technique allows a privacy-conscious data owner to run\npre-approved Oblivious Smart Contract code in their own environment on their\nown private data to produce Private Automated Certifications. These\ncertifications are verifiable, purely functional transformations of the\navailable data, enabling a third party to trust that the private data must have\nthe necessary properties to produce the resulting certification. Recently, a\nmultitude of solutions for certification and traceability in supply chains have\nbeen proposed. These often suffer from significant privacy issues because they\ntend to take a\" shared, replicated database\" approach: every node in the\nnetwork has access to a copy of all relevant data and contract code to\nguarantee the integrity and reach consensus, even in the presence of malicious\nnodes. In these contexts of certifications that require global coordination,\nAGAPECert can include a blockchain to guarantee ordering of events, while\nkeeping a core privacy model where private data is not shared outside of the\ndata owner's own platform. AGAPECert contributes an open-source certification\nframework that can be adopted in any regulated environment to keep sensitive\ndata private while enabling a trusted automated workflow.",

Moreover, human agreements involve a\ncombination of collaborative and selfish behavior and often induce circularity,\ncomplicating the evaluation of exchange requests. We introduce MuAC, a policy\nlanguage that allows users to state in isolation under which conditions they\nare open to grant their resources and what they require in return. In MuAC,\nexchange requests are evaluated automatically with the guarantee that the only\nexchanges that will take place are those that mutually satisfy users'\nconditions. Moreover, MuAC can be used as an enforcement mechanism to prevent\nusers from cheating. As a proof of concept, we implement a blockchain smart\ncontract that allows users to exchange their non-fungible tokens.",

Many protocols, including\nFilecoin, Arweave, and Sia, have been proposed to provide scalable\ndecentralized file storage for blockchain applications. However, the\nreliability is not well promised by existing protocols. Inspired by the idea of\ninsurance, we innovatively propose a decentralized file storage protocol in\nblockchain, named as FileInsurer, to achieve both scalability and reliability.\nWhile ensuring scalability by distributed storage, FileInsurer guarantees\nreliability by enhancing robustness and fully compensating for the file loss.\nSpecifically, under mild conditions, we prove that no more than 0.1\\% value of\nall files should be compensated even if half of the storage collapses.\nTherefore, only a relatively small deposit needs to be pledged by storage\nproviders to cover the potential file loss. Because of lower burdens of\ndeposit, storage providers have more incentives to participate in the storage\nnetwork. FileInsurer can run in the top layer of the InterPlanetary File System\n(IPFS), and thus it can be directly applied in Web 3.0, Non-Fungible Tokens,\nand Metaverse.",

            "summary": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) enhance the scalability of blockchains by\nallowing parties to conduct transactions off-chain, i.e, without broadcasting\nevery transaction to all blockchain participants. To conduct transactions, a\nsender and a receiver can either establish a direct payment channel with a\nfunding blockchain transaction or leverage existing channels in a multi-hop\npayment. The security of PCNs usually relies on the synchrony of the underlying\nblockchain, i.e., evidence of misbehavior needs to be published on the\nblockchain within a time limit. Alternative payment channel proposals that do\nnot require blockchain synchrony rely on quorum certificates and use a\ncommittee to register the transactions of a channel. However, these proposals\ndo not support multi-hop payments, a limitation we aim to overcome. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that it is in fact impossible to design a multi-hop\npayment protocol with both network asynchrony and faulty channels, i.e.,\nchannels that may not correctly follow the protocol. We then detail two\ncommittee-based multi-hop payment protocols that respectively assume\nsynchronous communications and possibly faulty channels, or asynchronous\ncommunication and correct channels. The first protocol relies on possibly\nfaulty committees instead of the blockchain to resolve channel disputes, and\nenforces privacy properties within a synchronous network. The second one relies\non committees that contain at most f faulty members out of 3f+1 and\nsuccessively delegate to each other the role of eventually completing a\nmulti-hop payment. We show that both protocols satisfy the security\nrequirements of a multi-hop payment and compare their communication complexity\nand latency.",

Blockchain technology has\nbeen widely proposed to manage vaccination records and their verification in\nmany politically-bound regions. However, the high contagiousness of COVID-19\ncalls for a global vaccination campaign. Therefore, a blockchain for\nvaccination management must scale up to support such a campaign and be\nadaptable to the requirements of different countries. While there have been\nmany proposals of blockchain frameworks that balance the access and\nimmutability of vaccination records, their scalability, a critical feature, has\nnot yet been addressed.\n  In this paper, we propose a scalable and cooperative Global Immunization\nInformation Blockchain-based System (GEOS) that leverages the global\ninteroperability of immunization information systems. We model GEOS and\ndescribe its requirements, features, and operation. We analyze the\ncommunications and the delays incurred by the national and international\nconsensus processes and blockchain interoperability in GEOS. Such\ncommunications are pivotal in enabling global-scale interoperability and access\nto electronic vaccination records for verification. We show that GEOS ably\nkeeps up with the global vaccination rates of COVID-19 as an example of its\nscalability.",

We formulate these trade-offs as a conjecture on the\nirreconcilability of three desirable properties of the reputation system in\nthis context. Such a system can not be simultaneously generalizable, trustless,\nand Sybil resistant. To handle the limitations of this trilemma, we propose\nMeritRank: Sybil tolerant feedback aggregation mechanism for reputation.\nInstead of preventing Sybil attacks, our approach successfully bounds the\nbenefits of these attacks. Using a dataset of participants' interactions in\nMakerDAO, we run experiments to demonstrate Sybil tolerance of MeritRank. Decay\nparameters of reputation in MeritRank: transitivity decay and connectivity\ndecay, allow for a fine-tuning of desirable levels of reputation utility and\nSybil tolerance in different use contexts.",

            "summary": "Multi-party business processes are based on the cooperation of different\nactors in a distributed setting. Blockchains can provide support for the\nautomation of such processes, even in conditions of partial trust among the\nparticipants. On-chain data are stored in all replicas of the ledger and\ntherefore accessible to all nodes that are in the network. Although this\nfosters traceability, integrity, and persistence, it undermines the adoption of\npublic blockchains for process automation since it conflicts with typical\nconfidentiality requirements in enterprise settings. In this paper, we propose\na novel approach and software architecture that allow for fine-grained access\ncontrol over process data on the level of parts of messages. In our approach,\nencrypted data are stored in a distributed space linked to the blockchain\nsystem backing the process execution; data owners specify access policies to\ncontrol which users can read which parts of the information. To achieve the\ndesired properties, we utilise Attribute-Based Encryption for the storage of\ndata, and smart contracts for access control, integrity, and linking to process\ndata. We implemented the approach in a proof-of-concept and conduct a case\nstudy in supply-chain management. From the experiments, we find our\narchitecture to be robust while still keeping execution costs reasonably low.",

Proof-of-Stake chains are\nenergy-efficient, have fast finality but face several security issues:\nsusceptibility to non-slashable long-range safety attacks, low liveness\nresilience and difficulty to bootstrap from low token valuation. We show that\nthese security issues are inherent in any PoS chain without an external trusted\nsource, and propose a new protocol, Babylon, where an off-the-shelf PoS\nprotocol checkpoints onto Bitcoin to resolve these issues. An impossibility\nresult justifies the optimality of Babylon. A use case of Babylon is to reduce\nthe stake withdrawal delay: our experimental results show that this delay can\nbe reduced from weeks in existing PoS chains to less than 5 hours using\nBabylon, at a transaction cost of less than 10K USD per annum for posting the\ncheckpoints onto Bitcoin.",

Leveraging the crypto\ndonations to a Ukrainian fundraising plea that accepts Ether (i.e., the\ncurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) and Bitcoin (i.e., the currency of the\nBitcoin blockchain) over a seven-day period, we analyze the impact of crypto\nrewards that lasted for more than 24 hours. Crypto rewards are newly minted\ntokens that are usually valueless initially and grow in value if the\ncorresponding cause is well received. Separately, we find that crypto rewards\nhave a positive impact on the donation count but a negative impact on the\naverage donation size for donations from both blockchains. Comparatively, we\nfurther find that the crypto rewards lead to an 812.48% stronger donation count\nincrease for Ethereum than Bitcoin, given that the crypto rewards are more\nlikely to be issued on the Ethereum blockchain, which has higher\nprogrammability to support smart contracts. We also find a 30.1% stronger\ndecrease in average donation amount from Ethereum for small donations ($\\leq\n\\$250$); the rewards pose similar impacts on the average donation size for the\ntwo blockchains for large donations ($>\\$250$). Our study is the first work to\nlook into crypto rewards as incentives for fundraising.

Due to unique design concepts and outstanding performance, blockchain\nhas become a popular research topic in industry and academia in recent years.\nEvery participant is anonymous in a permissionless blockchain represented by\ncryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin. In this situation, some special\nincentive mechanisms are applied to permissionless blockchain, such as mined\nnative cryptocurrency to solve the trust issues of permissionless blockchain.\nIn many use cases, permissionless blockchain has bottlenecks in transaction\nthroughput performance, which restricts further application in the real world.\nA permissioned blockchain can reach a consensus among a group of entities that\ndo not establish an entire trust relationship. Unlike permissionless\nblockchains, the participants must be identified in permissioned blockchains.\nBy relying on the traditional crash fault-tolerant consensus protocols,\npermissioned blockchains can achieve high transaction throughput and low\nlatency without sacrificing security. However, how to balance the security and\nconsensus efficiency is still the issue that needs to be solved urgently in\npermissioned blockchains. As the core module of blockchain technology, the\nconsensus algorithm plays a vital role in the performance of the blockchain\nsystem.

From the point of view of users, blockchains provide the illusion of\ncentralized computers that perform trustable verifiable computations, where all\ncomputations are deterministic and the results cannot be manipulated or undone.\nSmart-contracts are written in a special-purpose programming language with\ndeterministic semantics. Each transaction begins with an invocation from an\nexternal user to a smart contract. Contracts have local storage and can call\nother contracts, and more importantly, they store, send and receive\ncryptocurrency. It is very important to guarantee that contracts are correct\nbefore deployment since their code cannot be modified afterward deployment.\nHowever, the resulting ecosystem makes it very difficult to reason about\nprogram correctness, since contracts can be executed by malicious users or\nmalicious contracts can be designed to exploit other contracts that call them.\nMany attacks and bugs are caused by unexpected interactions between multiple\ncontracts, the attacked contract and unknown code that performs the exploit.\nMoreover, there is a very aggressive competition between different blockchains\nto expand their user base. Ideas are implemented fast and blockchains compete\nto offer and adopt new features quickly. In this paper, we propose a formal\nextensible playground that allows reasoning about multi-contract interactions\nto ultimately prove properties before features are incorporated into the real\nblockchain. We implemented a model of computation that models the execution\nplatform, abstracts the internal code of each individual contract and focuses\non contract interactions. Moreover, we show how many features, existing or\nproposed, can be used to reason about multi-contract interactions.",

To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a healthcare information security storage solution based on\nHyperledger Fabric and the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) framework. The\nscheme first utilizes attribute-based access control, which allows dynamic and\nfine-grained access to medical information, and then stores the medical\ninformation in the blockchain, which can be secured and tamper-proof by\nformulating corresponding smart contracts. In addition, this solution also\nincorporates IPFS technology to relieve the storage pressure of the blockchain.\nExperiments show that the proposed scheme combining access control of\nattributes and blockchain technology in this paper can not only ensure the\nsecure storage and integrity of medical information but also has a high\nthroughput when accessing medical information.",

            "summary": "Decentralized Applications (DApps) have seen widespread use in the recent\npast driving the world towards a new decentralized version of the web known as\nWeb3.0. DApp-supported blockchains like Ethereum have largely been responsible\nfor this drive supporting the largest eco-system of DApps. Although the low\nperformance provided by Ethereum has been a major impediment to realizing a\ndecentralized web, several high-performance blockchains have been introduced\nrecently to bridge this gap. Most of these blockchains rely on consensus\noptimizations. Only a few enhance other parts of the blockchain protocol that\ninvolves transaction management: the validation of transactions, broadcast of\ntransactions, encapsulation and dissemination of blocks with transactions,\nre-validation and execution of transactions in blocks, storage of blocks, and\nconfirmation of transaction commits to senders upon request.\n  In this paper, we enhance transaction management by introducing a novel\ntransaction validation reduction, hashing optimization to fasten the\ntransaction execution, a per sub-block processing to optimize the block\nstorage, and a caching optimization for fast retrieval of committed\ntransactions. We empirically show the performance improvements gained by our\nenhanced transaction management in the Smart Red Belly Blockchain (SRBB) VM we\ndevelop. Finally, we integrate our SRBB VM to an already optimized consensus\nfrom a known blockchain to develop the Smart Red Belly Blockchain. Our results\nshow that SRBB achieves a peak throughput of 4000 TPS and an average throughput\nof 2000 TPS on 200 nodes spread across 5 continents. \\solution outperforms 6\nother blockchains when running the exchange DApp featuring a real workload\ntrace taken from NASDAQ.",

In addition to the\nblockchain, full nodes also store a blockchain-summary, called the\n\\emph{state}, which is used to efficiently verify transactions. With the size\nof popular blockchains and their states growing rapidly, full nodes require\nmassive storage resources in order to keep up with the scaling. This leads to a\ntug-of-war between scaling and decentralization since fewer entities can afford\nexpensive resources. We present \\emph{hybrid nodes} for proof-of-work (PoW)\ncryptocurrencies which can validate transactions, validate blocks, validate\nstates, mine, select the main chain, bootstrap new hybrid nodes, and verify\npayment proofs. With the use of a protocol called \\emph{trimming}, hybrid nodes\nonly retain polylogarithmic number of blocks in the chain length in order to\nrepresent the proof-of-work of the blockchain. Hybrid nodes are also optimized\nfor the storage of the state with the use of \\emph{stateless blockchain}\nprotocols. The lowered storage requirements should enable more entities to join\nas hybrid nodes and improve the decentralization of the system. We define novel\ntheoretical security models for hybrid nodes and show that they are provably\nsecure. We also show that the storage requirement of hybrid nodes is\nnear-optimal with respect to our security definitions.",

            "summary": "Despite their development for over a decade, a key problem blockchains are\nstill facing is scalability in terms of throughput, typically limited to a few\ntransactions per second. A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the\npropagation latency of blocks through the underlying peer-to-peer network,\nwhich is typically constructed by means of random connectivity. Disseminating\nblocks fast improves not only the transaction throughput, but also the security\nof the system as it reduces the probability of forks. In this paper we present\nCougaR: a simple yet efficient, eclipse-resistant, decentralized protocol that\nsubstantially reduces the block dissemination time in blockchain networks.\nCougaR's key advantages stem from its link selection policy, which combines a\nnetwork latency criterion with randomness to offer fast and reliable block\ndissemination to the entire network. Moreover, CougaR is eclipse-resistant by\ndesign, as nodes are protected from having all their links directly or\nindirectly imposed on them by others, which is the typical vulnerability\nexploited to deploy eclipse attacks. We rigorously evaluate CougaR by an\nextensive set of experiments, both against a wide spectrum of parameter\nsettings, and in comparison to the current state of the art.",

However, ML models\ncreated this way are still vulnerable to evasion, poisoning, and exploratory\nattacks using adversarial examples. This paper investigates the impact of\nvarious possible adversarial examples on the BFF-IDS. We proposed integrating a\nstatistical detector to detect and extract unknown adversarial samples. By\nincluding the unknown detected samples into the dataset of the detector, we\naugment the BFF-IDS with an additional model to detect original known attacks\nand the new adversarial inputs. The statistical adversarial detector\nconfidently detected adversarial examples at the sample size of 50 and 100\ninput samples. Furthermore, the augmented BFF-IDS (BFF-IDS(AUG)) successfully\nmitigates the adversarial examples with more than 96% accuracy. With this\napproach, the model will continue to be augmented in a sandbox whenever an\nadversarial sample is detected and subsequently adopt the BFF-IDS(AUG) as the\nactive security model. Consequently, the proposed integration of the\nstatistical adversarial detector and the subsequent augmentation of the BFF-IDS\nwith detected adversarial samples provides a sustainable security framework\nagainst adversarial examples and other unknown attacks.",

Image unavailability and\ndelayed critical result communication stemmed from lack of system integration\nbetween teleradiology practice and healthcare institutions are among the most\nsubstantial factors causing prolonged turnaround time. In this paper, we\npropose a blockchain-based medical image sharing and automated critical-results\nnotification platform to address the current limitation. We believe the\nproposed platform will enhance efficiency in workflow by eliminating the need\nfor intermediaries and will benefit patients by eliminating the need for\nstoring medical images in hard copies. While considerable progress was\nachieved, further research on governance and HIPAA compliance is required to\noptimize the adoption of the new application. Towards an idea to a working\nparadigm, we will implement the prototype during the next phase of our study.",

            "summary": "Ride-hailing and ride-sharing applications have recently gained popularity as\na convenient alternative to traditional modes of travel. Current research into\nautonomous vehicles is accelerating rapidly and will soon become a critical\ncomponent of a ride-hailing platforms architecture. Implementing an autonomous\nvehicle ride-hailing platform proves a difficult challenge due to the\ncentralized nature of traditional ride-hailing architectures. In a traditional\nride-hailing environment the drivers operate their own personal vehicles so it\nfollows that a fleet of autonomous vehicles would be required for a centralized\nride-hailing platform to succeed. Decentralization of the ride-hailing platform\nwould remove a roadblock along the way to an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing\nplatform by allowing owners of autonomous vehicles to add their vehicles to a\ncommunity-driven fleet when not in use. Blockchain technology is an attractive\nchoice for this decentralized architecture due to its immutability and fault\ntolerance. This thesis proposes a framework for developing a decentralized\nride-hailing architecture that is verifiably secure. This framework is\nimplemented on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. The evaluation of\nthe implementation is done by applying known security models, utilizing a\nstatic analysis tool, and performing a performance analysis under heavy network\nload.",

As of today, there is no efficient way of protecting\nthis governance against an oligarchy. This paper aims to offer a new dimension\nto the security of blockchains by defining the Swift Proportional Governance\nproblem. This problem is to rapidly elect governance users that proportionally\nrepresent voters without the risk of dictatorship. We then design and implement\nan open permissioned blockchain called SocChain (Social Choice Blockchain) that\nmitigates bribery by building upon results in social choice theory. We deploy\nSocChain and evaluate our new multi-winner election DApp running on top of it.\nOur results indicate that using our DApp, 150 voters can elect a proportionally\nrepresentative committee of 150 members within 5 minutes. Hence we show that\nSocChain can elect as many representatives as members in various global\norganizations.",

            "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) can be conveniently deployed while empowering\nvarious applications, where the IoT nodes can form clusters to finish certain\nmissions collectively. In this paper, we propose to employ unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) to assist the clustered IoT data collection with\nblockchain-based security provisioning. In particular, the UAVs generate\ncandidate blocks based on the collected data, which are then audited through a\nlightweight proof-of-stake consensus mechanism within the UAV-based blockchain\nnetwork. To motivate efficient blockchain while reducing the operational cost,\na stake pool is constructed at the active UAV while encouraging stake\ninvestment from other UAVs with profit sharing. The problem is formulated to\nmaximize the overall profit through the blockchain system in unit time by\njointly investigating the IoT transmission, incentives through investment and\nprofit sharing, and UAV deployment strategies. Then, the problem is solved in a\ndistributed manner while being decoupled into two layers. The inner layer\nincorporates IoT transmission and incentive design, which are tackled with\nlarge-system approximation and one-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg game\nanalysis, respectively. The outer layer for UAV deployment is undertaken with a\nmulti-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach. Results show the\nconvergence of the proposed learning process and the UAV deployment, and also\ndemonstrated is the performance superiority of our proposal as compared with\nthe baselines.",

Smart contracts are programs\nwritten in specialized programming languages running on a blockchain and govern\nhow tokens and cryptocurrency are sent and received. Smart contracts can invoke\nother contracts during the execution of transactions initiated by external\nusers.\n  Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be modified and their pitfalls can\ncause malfunctions and losses, for example by attacks from malicious users.\nRuntime verification is a very appealing technique to improve the reliability\nof smart contracts. One approach consists of specifying undesired executions\n(never claims) and detecting violations of the specification on the fly. This\ncan be done by extending smart contracts with additional instructions\ncorresponding to monitor specified properties, resulting in an onchain\nmonitoring approach.\n  In this paper, we study transaction monitoring that consists of detecting\nviolations of complete transaction executions and not of individual operations\nwithin transactions. Our main contributions are to show that transaction\nmonitoring is not possible in most blockchains and propose different execution\nmechanisms that would enable transaction monitoring.",

They encode contractual agreements on the\nbasis of source code, which else need to be contractualized in natural\nlanguage. While the mediation of contractual agreements via smart contracts is\nseamless in theory, it requires that the conditions of an interaction are\naccurately made available in the blockchain. Time is a prominent such\ncondition. In the paper at hand, we empirically measure the consistency of a\nsmart contract to yield equal results on the basis of the time of an\ninteraction and its potentially inaccurate representation in the blockchain. We\npropose a novel metric called execution accuracy to measure this consistency.\nWe specifically measure the execution accuracy of a time interval-constrained\nsmart contract that executes distinct logic within and without some constraint\ninterval. We run experiments for the local Ganache and Quorum and the public\nG\\\"orli and Rinkeby Ethereum blockchains. Our experiments confirm our intuition\nthat execution accuracy decreases near interval bounds. The novelty of our\nproposed metric resides in its capacity to quantify this decrease and make\ndistinct blockchains comparable with respect to their capacity to accurately\nstipulate time contraints.",

            "summary": "This work aims to provide a more secure access control in Hyperledger Fabric\nblockchain by combining multiple ID's, attributes, and policies with the\ncomponents that regulate access control. The access control system currently\nused by Hyperledger Fabric is first completely analyzed. Next, a new\nimplementation is proposed that builds upon the existing solution but provides\nusers and developers with easier ways to make access control decisions based on\ncombinations of multiple ID's, attributes, and policies. Our proposed\nimplementation encapsulates the Fabric CA client to facilitate attribute\naddition and simplify the process of registering and enrolling a newly created\ncertificate (corresponding to a new user). This research, concludes that it is\npossible to combine multiple ID's, attributes, and policies with the help of\nHyperledger Fabric's smart contract technology. Furthermore, it could be seen\nthat the performance impact for real-world applications is negligible compared\nto the insecure case of always providing access to a resource without\nperforming access control.",

They expose a simple\nkey-value interface. Building a practical database from transparency logs, on\nthe other hand, remains a challenge.\n  In this paper, we explore the design space of verifiable ledger databases\nalong three dimensions: abstraction, threat model, and performance. We survey\nexisting systems and identify their two limitations, namely, the lack of\ntransaction support and the inferior efficiency. We then present GlassDB, a\ndistributed database that addresses these limitations under a practical threat\nmodel. GlassDB inherits the verifiability of transparency logs, but supports\ntransactions and offers high performance. It extends a ledger-like key-value\nstore with a data structure for efficient proofs, and adds a concurrency\ncontrol mechanism for transactions. GlassDB batches independent operations from\nconcurrent transactions when updating the core data structures. In addition, we\ndesign a new benchmark for evaluating verifiable ledger databases, by extending\nYCSB and TPC-C benchmarks. Using this benchmark, we compare GlassDB against\nfour baselines: reimplemented versions of three verifiable databases, and a\nverifiable map backed by a transparency log. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat GlassDB is an efficient, transactional, and verifiable ledger database.",

A correct representation of data is essential for companies'\ncore business processes and is demanded by investors and customers. Traditional\ndata audits are performed through third-party auditing services; however, these\nservices are expensive and can be untrustworthy in some cases. Blockchain and\nsmart contracts provide a decentralized mechanism to achieve secure and\ntrustworthy data integrity verification; however, existing solutions present\nchallenges in terms of scalability, privacy protection, and compliance with\ndata regulations. In this paper, we propose the AUtomated and Decentralized\nInTegrity vErification Model (AUDITEM) to assist business stakeholders in\nverifying data integrity in a trustworthy and automated manner. To address the\nchallenges in existing integrity verification processes, our model uses\ncarefully designed smart contracts and a distributed file system to store\nintegrity verification attributes and uses blockchain to enhance the\nauthenticity of data certificates. A sub-module called Data Integrity\nVerification Tool (DIVT) is also developed to support easy-to-use interfaces\nand customizable verification operations. This paper presents a detailed\nimplementation and designs experiments to verify the proposed model. The\nexperimental and analytical results demonstrate that our model is feasible and\nefficient to meet various business requirements for data integrity\nverification.",

The blockchain\nand distributed ledger technologies represent a promising solution to address\nthese issues, but rise other questions, for example regarding their practical\nfeasibility. In fact, IoT devices have limited resources and, consequently, may\nnot be able to easily perform all the operations required to participate in a\nblockchain. In this paper we propose a minimal architecture to allow IoT\ndevices performing data certification and notarization on the Ethereum\nblockchain. We develop a hardware-software platform through which a lightweight\ndevice (e.g., an IoT sensor), holding a secret key and the associated public\naddress, produces signed transactions, which are then submitted to the\nblockchain network. This guarantees data integrity and authenticity and, on the\nother hand, minimizes the computational burden on the lightweight device. To\nshow the practicality of the proposed approach, we report and discuss the\nresults of benchmarks performed on ARM Cortex-M4 hardware architectures,\nsending transactions over the Ropsten testnet.

This form of decentralization does\nnot scale well because the same data are stored on each network node, and\nbecause all nodes must validate each transaction prior to their confirmation.\nOne solution approach decomposes the nodes of a blockchain network into subsets\ncalled \"shards\", each shard processing and storing disjoint sets of\ntransactions in parallel. To fully benefit from the parallelism of sharded\nblockchains, the processing load of shards must be evenly distributed. However,\nthe problem of computing balanced workloads is theoretically hard and further\ncomplicated in practice as transaction processing times are unknown prior to be\nassigned to shards. In this paper we introduce a dynamic workload-balancing\nalgorithm where the allocation strategy of transactions to shards is\nperiodically adapted based on the recent workload history of shards. Our\nalgorithm is an adaptation to sharded blockchains of a consensus-based\nload-balancing algorithm. It is a fully distributed algorithm inline with\nnetwork based applications such as blockchains.

We then apply it to other blockchains as\nwell, examining Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Dash, Zcash and Bitcoin Cash. In\naddition to the results, we also explain the techniques we have used to perform\nthis exhaustive search for all the addresses that have ever appeared in these\nblockchains.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technologies are one possible avenue for increasing the resilience\nof the Smart Grid, by decentralizing the monitoring and control of system-level\nobjectives such as voltage stability protection. They furthermore offer\nbenefits in data immutability and traceability, as blockchains are\ncryptographically secured. However, the performance of blockchain-based systems\nin real-time grid monitoring and control has never been empirically tested.\nThis study proposes implementing a decentralized voltage stability algorithm\nusing blockchain-based smart contracts, as a testbed for evaluating the\nperformance of blockchains in real-time control. We furthermore investigate\nsharding mechanisms as a means of improving the system's scalability with fixed\ncomputing resources. We implement our models as a proof-of-concept prototype\nsystem using Hyperledger Fabric as our blockchain platform, the Matpower\nlibrary in MATLAB as our power system simulator, and Hyperledger Caliper as our\nperformance evaluation tool. We found that sharding does indeed lead to a\nsubstantial improvement in system scalability for this domain, measured by both\ntransaction success rates and transaction latency.",

We scraped data from Twitter and Dune Analytics using python\nlibraries, Twitter crawler, and sentiment analysis tools. Our five\nvisualizations implied that 1.6 times more male punks were created in the\ninitial design process than the female ones.

            "summary": "Vanilla Federated learning (FL) relies on the centralized global aggregation\nmechanism and assumes that all clients are honest. This makes it a challenge\nfor FL to alleviate the single point of failure and dishonest clients. These\nimpending challenges in the design philosophy of FL call for blockchain-based\nfederated learning (BFL) due to the benefits of coupling FL and blockchain\n(e.g., democracy, incentive, and immutability). However, one problem in vanilla\nBFL is that its capabilities do not follow adopters' needs in a dynamic\nfashion. Besides, vanilla BFL relies on unverifiable clients' self-reported\ncontributions like data size because checking clients' raw data is not allowed\nin FL for privacy concerns. We design and evaluate a novel BFL framework, and\nresolve the identified challenges in vanilla BFL with greater flexibility and\nincentive mechanism called FAIR-BFL. In contrast to existing works, FAIR-BFL\noffers unprecedented flexibility via the modular design, allowing adopters to\nadjust its capabilities following business demands in a dynamic fashion. Our\ndesign accounts for BFL's ability to quantify each client's contribution to the\nglobal learning process. Such quantification provides a rational metric for\ndistributing the rewards among federated clients and helps discover malicious\nparticipants that may poison the global model.",

However, most of the current training\nprocedures rely on the centralized data-collection strategy and a single\ncomputational server. However, such a centralized scheme may lead to many\nissues. Customer data stored in a centralized database may be tampered with so\nthe provenance and authenticity of data cannot be justified. Once the\naforementioned security concerns occur, the credibility of the trained AI\nmodels would be questionable and even unfavorable outcomes might be produced at\nthe test stage. Lately, blockchain and AI, the two core technologies in\nIndustry 4.0 and Web 3.0, have been explored to facilitate the decentralized AI\ntraining strategy. To serve on this very purpose, we propose a new system\narchitecture called APPFLChain, namely an integrated architecture of a\nHyperledger Fabric-based blockchain and a federated-learning paradigm. Our\nproposed new system allows different parties to jointly train AI models and\ntheir customers or stakeholders are connected by a consortium blockchain-based\nnetwork. Our new system can maintain a high degree of security and privacy as\nusers do not need to share sensitive personal information to the server. For\nnumerical evaluation, we simulate a real-world scenario to illustrate the whole\noperational process of APPFLChain. Simulation results show that taking\nadvantage of the characteristics of consortium blockchain and federated\nlearning, APPFLChain can demonstrate favorable properties including\nuntamperability, traceability, privacy protection, and reliable\ndecision-making.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be\novercome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability\nissue is mostly caused by the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the\ntotal order of the chain of blocks (and of the operations within each block).\nHowever, total order is often overkilling, since important advanced\napplications of smart-contracts do not require a total order of all the\noperations. Hence, if a more relaxed partial order (instead of a total order)\nis allowed under certain safety conditions, a much higher scalability can be\nachieved. In this paper, we propose a distributed concurrent data type, called\nSetchain, that allows implementing this partial order and increases\nsignificantly blockchain scalability. A Setchain implements a grow-only set\nobject whose elements are not totally ordered, unlike conventional blockchain\noperations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization\nbarrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest\nelements added. With the Setchain, operations in the same epoch are not\nordered, while operations in different epochs are. We present different\nByzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and\nreport on an empirical evaluation of a direct implementation. Our results show\nthat Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers to\nimplement grow-only sets with epoch synchronization. Since the Setchain\nbarriers can be synchronized with block consolidation, Setchain objects can be\nused as a sidechain to implement many smart contract solutions with much faster\noperations than on basic blockchains.",

            "summary": "DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is based on a distributed ledger called\nblockchain technology. Using blockchain, DeFi may customize the execution of\npredetermined operations between parties. The DeFi system use blockchain\ntechnology to execute user transactions, such as lending and exchanging. The\ntotal value locked in DeFi decreased from \\$200 billion in April 2022 to \\$80\nbillion in July 2022, indicating that security in this area remained\nproblematic. In this paper, we address the deficiency in DeFi security studies.\nTo our best knowledge, our paper is the first to make a systematic analysis of\nDeFi security. First, we summarize the DeFi-related vulnerabilities in each\nblockchain layer. Additionally, application-level vulnerabilities are also\nanalyzed. Then we classify and analyze real-world DeFi attacks based on the\nprinciples that correlate to the vulnerabilities. In addition, we collect\noptimization strategies from the data, network, consensus, smart contract, and\napplication layers. And then, we describe the weaknesses and technical\napproaches they address. On the basis of this comprehensive analysis, we\nsummarize several challenges and possible future directions in DeFi to offer\nideas for further research.",

            "summary": "In a single secret leader election protocol (SSLE), one of the system\nparticipants is chosen and, unless it decides to reveal itself, no other\nparticipant can identify it. SSLE has a great potential in protecting\nblockchain consensus protocols against denial of service (DoS) attacks.\nHowever, all existing solutions either make strong synchrony assumptions or\nhave expiring registration, meaning that they require elected processes to\nre-register themselves before they can be re-elected again. This, in turn,\nprohibits the use of these SSLE protocols to elect leaders in\npartially-synchronous consensus protocols as there may be long periods of\nnetwork instability when no new blocks are decided and, thus, no new\nregistrations (or re-registrations) are possible. In this paper, we propose\nHomomorphic Sortition -- the first asynchronous SSLE protocol with non-expiring\nregistration, making it the first solution compatible with\npartially-synchronous leader-based consensus protocols.\n  Homomorphic Sortition relies on Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption\n(ThFHE) and is tailored to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, with several\nimportant optimizations with respect to prior proposals. In particular, unlike\nmost existing SSLE protocols, it works with arbitrary stake distributions and\ndoes not require a user with multiple coins to be registered multiple times.\nOur protocol is highly parallelizable and can be run completely off-chain after\nsetup.\n  Some blockchains require a sequence of rounds to have non-repeating leaders.\nWe define a generalization of SSLE, called Secret Leader Permutation (SLP) in\nwhich the application can choose how many non-repeating leaders should be\noutput in a sequence of rounds and we show how Homomorphic Sortition also\nsolves this problem.",

Unlike normal\nloans, flash loans allow borrowers to borrow a large amount of assets without\nupfront collaterals deposits. Malicious adversaries can use flash loans to\ngather large amount of assets to launch costly exploitations targeting DeFi\nprotocols. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for automated synthesis\nof adversarial contracts that exploit DeFi protocols using flash loans. To\nbypass the complexity of a DeFi protocol, we propose a new technique to\napproximate the DeFi protocol functional behaviors using numerical methods\n(polynomial linear regression and nearest-neighbor interpolation). We then\nconstruct an optimization query using the approximated functions of the DeFi\nprotocol to find an adversarial attack constituted of a sequence of functions\ninvocations with optimal parameters that gives the maximum profit. To improve\nthe accuracy of the approximation, we propose a new counterexamples-driven\napproximation refinement technique. We implement our framework in a tool called\nFlashSyn. We evaluate FlashSyn on 12 DeFi protocols that were victims to flash\nloan attacks and DeFi protocols from Damn Vulnerable DeFi challenges. FlashSyn\nautomatically synthesizes an adversarial attack for each one of them.",

In a purposely agnostic, and\nmeticulous \"lea-ving no stone unturned\" approach, this study presents new hard\nfacts, which evidently slipped through Satoshi Nakamoto's elaborate privacy\nshield, and derives meaningful pointers that are primarily inferred from\nBitcoin's whitepaper, its blockchain parameters, and data that were widely up\nto his discretion. This ample stack of established and novel evidence is\nsystematically categorized, analyzed, and then connected to its related,\nreal-world ambient, like relevant locations and happenings in the past, and at\nthe time. Evidence compounds towards a substantial role of the Benelux\ncryptography ecosystem, with strong transatlantic links, in the creation of\nBitcoin. A consistent biography, a psychogram, and gripping story of an\ningenious, multi-talented, autodidactic, reticent, and capricious polymath\ntranspire, which are absolutely unique from a history of science and technology\nperspective. A cohort of previously fielded and best matches emerging from the\ninvestigations are probed against an unprecedently restrictive, multi-stage\nexclusion filter, which can, with maximum certainty, rule out most \"Satoshi\nNakamoto\" candidates, while some of them remain to be confirmed. With this\narticle, you will be able to decide who is not, or highly unlikely to be\nSatoshi Nakamoto, be equipped with an ample stack of systematically categorized\nevidence and efficient methodologies to find suitable candidates, and can\npossibly unveil the real identity of the creator of Bitcoin - if you want.",

Insider\nthreats can launch attacks from any domain to compromise ML assets (models and\ndatasets). Therefore, practitioners require information about how and by whom\nML assets were developed to assess their quality attributes such as security,\nsafety, and fairness. Unfortunately, it is challenging for ML teams to access\nand reconstruct such historical information of ML assets (ML provenance)\nbecause it is generally fragmented across distributed ML teams and threatened\nby the same adversaries that attack ML assets. This paper proposes ProML, a\ndecentralised platform that leverages blockchain and smart contracts to empower\ndistributed ML teams to jointly manage a single source of truth about\ncirculated ML assets' provenance without relying on a third party, which is\nvulnerable to insider threats and presents a single point of failure. We\npropose a novel architectural approach called Artefact-as-a-State-Machine to\nleverage blockchain transactions and smart contracts for managing ML provenance\ninformation and introduce a user-driven provenance capturing mechanism to\nintegrate existing scripts and tools to ProML without compromising\nparticipants' control over their assets and toolchains.

Classical Byzantine agreements\nunavoidably face two major problems. One is $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, which\nmeans that the system to tolerate $f$ malicious players requires at least\n$3f+1$ players. The other is the security loopholes from its classical\ncryptography methods. Here, we propose a Byzantine agreement framework with\nunconditional security to break this bound with nearly $1/2$ fault tolerance\ndue to multiparty correlation provided by quantum digital signatures.\n\\textcolor{black}{It is intriguing that quantum entanglement is not necessary\nto break the $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, and we show that weaker correlation,\nsuch as asymmetric relationship of quantum digital signature, can also work.}\nOur work strictly obeys two Byzantine conditions and can be extended to any\nnumber of players without requirements for multiparticle entanglement. We\nexperimentally demonstrate three-party and five-party consensus for a digital\nledger. Our work indicates the quantum advantage in terms of consensus problems\nand suggests an important avenue for quantum blockchain and quantum consensus\nnetworks.",

Distributed\ncurrencies suffer from extreme volatility, and this can lead to catastrophic\nimplications during future economic crisis. Understanding the dynamics of this\nnew type of currencies is vital for empowering supervisory bodies from current\nreactive and manual incident responders to more proactive and well-informed\nplanners. Bitcoin, the first and dominant distributed cryptocurrency, is still\nnotoriously vague, especially for a financial instrument with market value\nexceeding 1 trillion. Modeling of bitcoin overlay network poses a number of\nimportant theoretical and methodological challenges. Current measuring\napproaches, for example, fail to identify the real network size of bitcoin\nminers. This drastically undermines the ability to predict forks, the suitable\nmining difficulty and most importantly the resilience of the network supporting\nbitcoin. In this work, we developed Evolutionary Random Graph, a theoretical\nmodel that describes the network of bitcoin miners. The correctness of this\nmodel has been validated using simulated and measure real bitcoin data. We then\npredicted forking, optimal mining difficulty, network size and consequently the\nnetwork's inability to stand a drastic drop in bitcoin price using the current\nmining configuration.",

To fill\nthis gap, we propose a novel cooperative task offloading and blockchain mining\n(TOBM) scheme for a blockchain-based MEC system, where each edge device not\nonly handles computation tasks but also deals with block mining for improving\nsystem utility. To address the latency issues caused by the blockchain\noperation in MEC, we develop a new Proof-of-Reputation consensus mechanism\nbased on a lightweight block verification strategy. To accommodate the highly\ndynamic environment and high-dimensional system state space, we apply a novel\ndistributed deep reinforcement learning-based approach by using a multi-agent\ndeep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the proposed TOBM scheme in terms of enhanced\nsystem reward, improved offloading utility with lower blockchain mining\nlatency, and better system utility, compared to the existing cooperative and\nnon-cooperative schemes. The paper concludes with key technical challenges and\npossible directions for future blockchain-based MEC research.",

            "summary": "Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for the development of\nblockchain-powered applications. These applications are known as Dapps. When\nengineering Dapps, developers need to translate requests captured in the\nfront-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions.\nDevelopers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the\nhigher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed.\nTherefore developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction\nfees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have\nbeen developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., Dapp developers) with an\nestimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas\nprice. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several\npopular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, their accuracy has not\nbeen empirically investigated so far. In this paper, we quantify the\ntransaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between\nprocessing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of\nstate-of-the-practice estimation services. We find that transactions are\nprocessed in a median of 57s and that 90% of the transactions are processed\nwithin 8m. The higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times\nwith diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in\nprocessing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. In terms of\naccuracy of processing time estimation services, we note that they are\nequivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, Etherscan's\nGas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for very cheap and cheap\ntransaction. EthGasStation's Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate\nestimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions.",

            "summary": "The Ethereum platform allows developers to implement and deploy applications\ncalled Dapps onto the blockchain for public use through the use of smart\ncontracts. To execute code within a smart contract, a paid transaction must be\nissued towards one of the functions that are exposed in the interface of a\ncontract. However, such a transaction is only processed once one of the miners\nin the peer-to-peer network selects it, adds it to a block, and appends that\nblock to the blockchain This creates a delay between transaction submission and\ncode execution. It is crucial for Dapp developers to be able to precisely\nestimate when transactions will be processed, since this allows them to define\nand provide a certain Quality of Service (QoS) level (e.g., 95% of the\ntransactions processed within 1 minute). However, the impact that different\nfactors have on these times have not yet been studied. Processing time\nestimation services are used by Dapp developers to achieve predefined QoS. Yet,\nthese services offer minimal insights into what factors impact processing\ntimes. Considering the vast amount of data that surrounds the Ethereum\nblockchain, changes in processing times are hard for Dapp developers to\npredict, making it difficult to maintain said QoS. In our study, we build\nrandom forest models to understand the factors that are associated with\ntransaction processing times. We engineer several features that capture\nblockchain internal factors, as well as gas pricing behaviors of transaction\nissuers. By interpreting our models, we conclude that features surrounding gas\npricing behaviors are very strongly associated with transaction processing\ntimes. Based on our empirical results, we provide Dapp developers with concrete\ninsights that can help them provide and maintain high levels of QoS.",

Specifically, we have identified all\npotential architectural design types and evaluated each of them by employing\nthe scenario-based architecture evaluation method. The evaluation shows that\nexisting applications are neither secure nor adoptable as claimed. Meanwhile,\nwe also discuss opportunities and challenges surrounding the Web3 space and\nanswer several prevailing questions from communities.

Moreover,\nwe find that 1% of addresses create an anomalous number of tokens (between 20%\nand 25%). We present an exit scam fraud and quantify its prevalence on both\nblockchains. We find that token spammers use short lifetime tokens as\ndisposable tokens to perpetrate these frauds serially. Finally, we present a\nnew kind of trader bot involved in these activities, and we detect their\npresence and quantify their activity in the exit scam operations.",

However, many\nfraudsters utilize smart contracts to create fraudulent Ponzi schemes for\nprofiting on Ethereum, which seriously affects financial security. Most\nexisting Ponzi scheme detection techniques suffer from two major restricted\nproblems: the lack of motivation for temporal early warning and failure to fuse\nmulti-source information finally cause the lagging and unsatisfactory\nperformance of Ethereum Ponzi scheme detection. In this paper, we propose a\ndual-channel early warning framework for Ethereum Ponzi schemes, named\nPonzi-Warning, which performs feature extraction and fusion on both code and\ntransaction levels. Moreover, we represent a temporal evolution augmentation\nstrategy for generating transaction graph sequences, which can effectively\nincrease the data scale and introduce temporal information. Comprehensive\nexperiments on our Ponzi scheme datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\ntimeliness of our framework for detecting the Ponzi contract accounts.",

However, there still exist bottlenecks when\nintegrating metaverses into IIoT, such as the privacy leakage of sensitive data\nwith commercial secrets, IIoT sensing data freshness, and incentives for\nsharing these data. In this paper, we design a user-defined privacy-preserving\nframework with decentralized federated learning for the industrial metaverses.\nTo further improve privacy protection of industrial metaverse, a cross-chain\nempowered federated learning framework is further utilized to perform\ndecentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving data training on both physical\nand virtual spaces through a hierarchical blockchain architecture with a main\nchain and multiple subchains.

However, in these systems, third parties are still involved in\nselling surplus energy. This results in increased cost of energy and there are\nmany operational and security barriers in such systems. These issues can be\nsolved by the decentralized distributed system of microgrids where a consumer\ncan locally sell their surplus energy to another consumer. To deploy such a\nsystem, one must consider security barriers for the transaction of energy. This\npaper proposes a solution to these problems by devising a scheme as a\nmarketplace where users interact with each other to buy and sell energy at\nbetter rates and get energy-generating resources on lease so that users do not\nhave to worry about capital investment. Agreement between owner of resources\nand consumer is recorded on blockchain based smart contracts. In this paper, a\nsurvey is performed for existing well known, decentralized energy solutions.\nThis paper also proposes an extra layer of security to leverage a shielded\nexecution environment so that information of energy generated, utilized, and\nshared cannot be changed by consumers and third parties even if the system is\ncompromised.",

The UAVs communicate with terrestrial\nnetworks by connecting to fixed or mobile ground control stations (GCS). The\nability of drones to connect to online applications and offer services to\nInternet users has led to the proliferation of the Internet of Drones (IoD).\nHowever, IoD applications are highly vulnerable to many types of cyberattacks.\nHence, mechanisms must be deployed to secure the IoD operations and data.\nRecently, the blockchain has been proposed as a solution to detect and prevent\nmalicious attacks on the UAV network (UAVN). Due to the UAV's limited\nresources, it becomes a challenge to integrate the blockchain into the IoD. In\nthis paper, we propose a model that enables a drone to store the important data\nthat it requires during its flight within a lightweight blockchain system. In\naddition, we propose a new blockchain consensus mechanism in which several\nminers produce their blocks in parallel, which decreases the time needed to add\ntransactions securely to the blockchain and meets the requirements of\ndelay-sensitive applications.

To conduct a\nnode-level synchronization analysis, we take advantage of the large deviation\ntheory and game theory to study the pull-based propagation from a microscopic\nperspective. We examine the blockchain synchronization in a bidirectional\nmanner via investigating the impact of full nodes as responders and that of\npartial nodes as requesters.

In such systems, blockchain is\nmainly used to store the trust score or trust-related information of\ninteractions among the various entities. However, present trust management\narchitectures using blockchain lack verifiable interactions among the entities\non which the trust score is calculated. In this paper, we propose a\nblockchain-based trust management framework that allows independent trust\nproviders to implement different trust metrics on a common set of trust\nevidence and provide individual trust value. We employ geo-location as proof of\ninteraction. Some of the existing proposals rely upon geo-location data, but\nthey do not support trust calculation by multiple trust providers. Instead,\nthey can only support a centralised system. Our proposed architecture does not\ndepend upon a single centralised third-party entity to ensure trusted\ninteractions. Our architecture is supported by provable interactions that can\neasily be verified using blockchain. Therefore, it allows a high degree of\nconfidence in trust management by ensuring the actual interactions between the\nentities. We provide a detailed design and development of the architecture\nusing real-world use case examples. The proof of prototype was implemented on\nthe Ethereum blockchain platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nemployment of independent trust providers adequately provides a high degree of\ntrust scores and that the proposed architecture can be used in a real-world\nenvironment.",

            "summary": "Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a new distributed method for identity\nmanagement, commonly used to address the problem that users are lack of control\nover their identities. However, the excessive pursuit of self-sovereignty in\nthe most existing SSI schemes hinders sanctions against attackers. To deal with\nthe malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms,\nbut they sacrifice users' privacy. What's more, the digital identities (static\nstrings or updatable chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a\nthird-party executable program (mobile app, smart contract, etc.) to achieve\nidentity reading, storing and proving, users' self-sovereignty are weakened. To\nsolve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to\nstrike a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the\ndependence on the third-party program. In our scheme, one and only\nindividual-specific executable code is generated as a digital avatar-i for each\nhuman to interact with others in cyberspace without a third-party program, in\nwhich the embedding of biometrics enhances uniqueness and user control over\ntheir identity. In addition, a joint accountability mechanism, which is based\non the shamir (t, n) threshold algorithm and a consortium blockchain, is\ndesigned to restrict the power of each regulatory authority and protect users'\nprivacy. Finally, we analyze the security, SSI properties and conduct detailed\nexperiments in term of the cost of computation, storage and blockchain gas. The\nanalysis results indicate that our scheme resists the known attacks and\nfulfills all the six SSI properties. Compared with the state-of-the-art\nschemes, the extensive experiment results show that the cost is larger in\nserver storage, blockchain storage and blockchain gas, but is still low enough\nfor practical situations.",

            "summary": "Blockchain has recently attracted the attention of the industry due, in part,\nto its ability to automate asset transfers. It requires distributed\nparticipants to reach a consensus on a block despite the presence of malicious\n(a.k.a. Byzantine) participants. Malicious participants exploit regularly\nweaknesses of these blockchain consensus algorithms, with sometimes devastating\nconsequences. In fact, these weaknesses are quite common and are well\nillustrated by the flaws in the hand-written proofs of existing blockchain\nconsensus protocols [63]. Paradoxically, until now, no blockchain consensus has\nbeen holistically verified using model checking.\n  In this paper, we remedy this paradox by model checking for the first time a\nblockchain consensus used in industry. We propose a holistic approach to verify\nthe consensus algorithm of the Red Belly Blockchain [20], for any number $n$ of\nprocesses and any number $f<n/3$ of Byzantine processes. We decompose directly\nthe algorithm pseudocode in two parts -- an inner broadcast algorithm and an\nouter decision algorithm -- each modelled as a threshold automaton [36], and we\nformalize their expected properties in linear-time temporal logic. We then\nautomatically check the inner broadcasting algorithm, under a carefully\nidentified fairness assumption. For the verification of the outer algorithm, we\nsimplify the model of the inner algorithm by relying on its checked properties.\nDoing so, we formally verify not only the safety properties of the Red Belly\nBlockchain consensus but also its liveness in about 70 seconds.",

Based\nupon stored visual information of a home location, the navigation back to this\nlocation can be accomplished from any other location in which this location is\nvisible by comparing home to the current image. However, a key challenge of\nvisual homing is that the target home location must be within the robot's field\nof view (FOV) to start homing. Therefore, this work addresses such a challenge\nby integrating blockchain technology into the visual homing navigation system.\nBased on the decentralized feature of blockchain, the proposed solution enables\nvisual homing robots to share their visual homing information and synchronously\naccess the stored data (visual homing information) in the decentralized ledger\nto establish the navigation path. The navigation path represents a per-robot\nsequence of views stored in the ledger. If the home location is not in the FOV,\nthe proposed solution permits a robot to find another robot that can see the\nhome location and travel towards that desired location.

            "summary": "The Hypersyn protocol is a new type of permissionless and peer-to-peer\npayment network that is based on the concept of mutual credit and mutual\narbitrage. Unlike blockchain-based systems, Hypersyn does not rely on any\nconsensus algorithm. It does not require a distributed ledger to store the\nhistory of events nor a set of validators. Hypersyn does not have a\nsystem-imposed hard-cap on the number of transactions per second that it can\nperform, and can therefore easily scale up or down depending on network usage.\nUnlike in other payment systems, money in Hypersyn does not get transferred\nfrom person $A$ to person $B$ in the conventional sense. Instead of\ntransferring a token between each other, peers in Hypersyn change their\nexchange value of their credit (i.e. their purchasing power) within the\nnetwork. Just as in centrally-issued fiat systems, money in Hypersyn is treated\nas freely tradable debt, which inherently requires trust. But unlike\ncentrally-issued fiat systems, money issuance in Hypersyn is not controlled by\nan authority, but is instead created on the spot as mutual credit. In\nblockchain-based systems and even in centrally-issued fiat systems, money is\ntreated as a scarce commodity. In the Hypersyn protocol on the other hand,\nmoney supply within the system is elastic in nature. Because of these\nfundamental differences in assumptions, the Hypersyn protocol does not aim to\ncompete with, or substitute blockchain-based systems. Instead, Hypersyn should\nbe viewed as a tool that aims to offer a qualitative change in the way we\nexchange. It has the potential to increase the autonomy and self-organization\nthat people can have, by enabling people to become both the creditors and\ndebtors of their own \"money\" through mutual credit.",

Such proofs of computational integrity are publicly\nverifiable by any other participants in and out the protocol such as other\nsubnets or audit companies. The interface between the TCE and subnets leverages\nthe ICE-FROST protocol, an innovative threshold signature scheme, whose static\npublic key allows for uniquely identifying subnets after they register in the\nprotocol. The Topos protocol is designed to provide $\\textit{uniform security}$\nto the ecosystem and to handle any type of subnets (e.g., permissioned,\npermissionless) in order to fit any business use cases and pave the way for\nglobal adoption and a new standard for the Internet base layer.",

            "summary": "In shaping the Internet of Money, the application of blockchain and\ndistributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to the financial sector triggered\nregulatory concerns. Notably, while the user anonymity enabled in this field\nmay safeguard privacy and data protection, the lack of identifiability hinders\naccountability and challenges the fight against money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism and proliferation (AML/CFT). As law enforcement agencies\nand the private sector apply forensics to track crypto transfers across\necosystems that are socio-technical in nature, this paper focuses on the\ngrowing relevance of these techniques in a domain where their deployment\nimpacts the traits and evolution of the sphere. In particular, this work offers\ncontextualized insights into the application of methods of machine learning and\ntransaction graph analysis. Namely, it analyzes a real-world dataset of Bitcoin\ntransactions represented as a directed graph network through various\ntechniques. The modeling of blockchain transactions as a complex network\nsuggests that the use of graph-based data analysis methods can help classify\ntransactions and identify illicit ones. Indeed, this work shows that the neural\nnetwork types known as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention\nNetworks (GAT) are a promising AML/CFT solution. Notably, in this scenario GCN\noutperform other classic approaches and GAT are applied for the first time to\ndetect anomalies in Bitcoin. Ultimately, the paper upholds the value of\npublic-private synergies to devise forensic strategies conscious of the spirit\nof explainability and data openness.",

From a security\nperspective, network anomalies/attackers pose high security risk in IIoT. In\nthis paper, we have addressed this problem, where a coordinator IoT device is\nelected to compute the trust of IoT devices to prevent the malicious devices to\nbe part of network. Further, the transparency of the data is ensured by\nintegrating a blockchain-based data model. The performance of the proposed\nframework is validated extensively and rigorously via MATLAB against various\nsecurity metrics such as attack strength, message alteration, and probability\nof false authentication. The simulation results suggest that the proposed\nsolution increases IIoT network security by efficiently detecting malicious\nattacks in the network.",

The changing needs of the civilization currently demands a\npractical yet secure electronic voting system, but any flaw related to the\napplied voting technology can lead to tampering of the results with the\nmalicious outcomes. Currently, blockchain technology due to its transparent\nstructure forms an emerging area of investigation for the development of voting\nsystems with a far greater security. However, various apprehensions are yet to\nbe conclusively resolved before using blockchain in high stakes elections.\nOther than this, the blockchain based voting systems are vulnerable to possible\nattacks by upcoming noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computer. To\ncircumvent, most of these limitations, in this work, we propose an anonymous\nvoting scheme based on quantum assisted blockchain by enhancing the advantages\noffered by blockchain with the quantum resources such as quantum random number\ngenerators and quantum key distribution. The purposed scheme is shown to\nsatisfy the requirements of a good voting scheme. Further, the voting scheme is\nauditable and can be implemented using the currently available technology.",

            "summary": "With the development of mobile edge computing (MEC) and blockchain-based\nfederated learning (BCFL), a number of studies suggest deploying BCFL on edge\nservers. In this case, resource-limited edge servers need to serve both mobile\ndevices for their offloading tasks and the BCFL system for model training and\nblockchain consensus in a cost-efficient manner without sacrificing the service\nquality to any side. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a resource\nallocation scheme for edge servers, aiming to provide the optimal services with\nthe minimum cost. Specifically, we first analyze the energy consumed by the MEC\nand BCFL tasks, and then use the completion time of each task as the service\nquality constraint. Then, we model the resource allocation challenge into a\nmultivariate, multi-constraint, and convex optimization problem. To solve the\nproblem in a progressive manner, we design two algorithms based on the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in both the homogeneous and\nheterogeneous situations with equal and on-demand resource distribution\nstrategies, respectively. The validity of our proposed algorithms is proved via\nrigorous theoretical analysis. Through extensive experiments, the convergence\nand efficiency of our proposed resource allocation schemes are evaluated. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the resource\nallocation dilemma of edge servers for BCFL in MEC.",

We\nidentify large, medium and small investors under various rewarding schemes, and\nshow that the limiting behaviors of these investors are different -- for large\ninvestors their shares are stable, while for medium to small investors their\nshares may be volatile or even shrink to zero. For instance, with a geometric\nreward there is chaotic centralization, where all the shares will eventually\nconcentrate on one investor in a random manner. This leads to the phase\ntransition phenomenon, and the thresholds for stability are characterized. In\nresponse to the increasing activities in blockchain networks, we also propose\nand analyze a dynamical population model for the PoS protocol, which allows the\nnumber of investors to grow over the time.

We find 1.4 million proxy\ncontracts which 8,225 of them are unique upgradeable proxy contracts. We also\nmeasure how they implement access control over their upgradeability: about 50%\nare controlled by a single Externally Owned Address (EOA), and about 14% are\ncontrolled by multi-signature wallets in which a limited number of persons can\nchange the whole logic of the contract.",

Our findings indicate that DLT may facilitate the\nautomation of key compliance processes through the implementation of a\n\"pull-model\", in which regulators can access compliance data in near real-time\nto stage aggregate exposures at the supranational level. Generalizing our\npreliminary results, we present four propositions on the implications of DLT in\ncompliance. The findings contribute new practical insights on the topic of\ncompliance to the growing IS discourse on DLT.",

            "summary": "Healthcare data is sensitive and requires great protection. Encrypted\nelectronic health records (EHRs) contain personal and sensitive data such as\nnames and addresses. Having access to patient data benefits all of them. This\npaper proposes a blockchain-based distributed healthcare application platform\nfor Bangladeshi public and private healthcare providers. Using data\nimmutability and smart contracts, the suggested application framework allows\nusers to create safe digital agreements for commerce or collaboration. Thus,\nall enterprises may securely collaborate using the same blockchain network,\ngaining data openness and read/write capacity. The proposed application\nconsists of various application interfaces for various system users. For data\nintegrity, privacy, permission and service availability, the proposed solution\nleverages Hyperledger fabric and Blockchain as a Service. Everyone will also\nhave their own profile in the portal. A unique identity for each person and the\ninstallation of digital information centres across the country have greatly\neased the process. It will collect systematic health data from each person\nwhich will be beneficial for research institutes and health-related\norganisations. A national data warehouse in Bangladesh is feasible for this\napplication and It is also possible to keep a clean health sector by analysing\ndata stored in this warehouse and conducting various purification algorithms\nusing technologies like Data Science. Given that Bangladesh has both public and\nprivate health care, a straightforward digital strategy for all organisations\nis essential.",

In this work, a software\nconnector has been designed and developed to connect an Ethereum-like\nblockchain with the enterprises' information systems to allow companies to\nshare information with their partners with different levels of visibility and\nto check data authenticity, integrity and invariability over time through the\nblockchain, thus building trust. In order to explore the potential of deploying\nthe blockchain in a supply chain, a simulation model has been developed to\nrecreate the supply chain operations and integrated with the blockchain through\nthe same software connector to carry out a scenario statistical analysis.\nApplication results shows how blockchain technology is a convenient instrument\nto overcome collaboration and trust issues in a supply chain, to increase the\nsupply chain overall performance, to minimize the negative consequences of\ninformation asymmetry over the echelons of a supply chain but also to\ndiscourage companies from any misconduct (e.g. counterfeiting data or low data\naccuracy).",

AI's\nextraordinary potential is being held back by challenges such as a lack of\nmedical datasets for training AI models, adversarial attacks, and a lack of\ntrust due to its black box working style. We explored how blockchain technology\ncan improve the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-based healthcare. This\npaper has conducted a Systematic Literature Review to explore the\nstate-of-the-art research studies conducted in healthcare applications\ndeveloped with different AI techniques and Blockchain Technology. This\nsystematic literature review proceeds with three different paths as natural\nlanguage processing-based healthcare systems, computer vision-based healthcare\nsystems and acoustic AI-based healthcare systems. We found that 1) Defence\ntechniques for adversarial attacks on AI are available for specific kind of\nattacks and even adversarial training is AI based technique which in further\nprone to different attacks. 2) Blockchain can address security and privacy\nissues in healthcare fraternity. 3) Medical data verification and user\nprovenance can be enabled with Blockchain. 4) Blockchain can protect\ndistributed learning on heterogeneous medical data. 5) The issues like single\npoint of failure, non-transparency in healthcare systems can be resolved with\nBlockchain. Nevertheless, it has been identified that research is at the\ninitial stage. As a result, we have synthesized a conceptual framework using\nBlockchain Technology for AI-based healthcare applications that considers the\nneeds of each NLP, Computer Vision, and Acoustic AI application.

On the other hand, recent advancements in the\ndevelopment of new cryptographic primitives brought a huge interest in\nconstructing a plethora of DRB protocols differing in design and underlying\nprimitives.\n  To the best of our knowledge, no systematic and comprehensive work\nsystematizes and analyzes the existing DRB protocols. Therefore, we present a\nSystematization of Knowledge (SoK) intending to structure the multi-faced body\nof research on DRB protocols. In this SoK, we delineate the DRB protocols along\nthe following axes: their underlying primitive, properties, and security. This\nSoK tries to fill that gap by providing basic standard definitions and\nrequirements for DRB protocols, such as Unpredictability, Bias-resistance,\nAvailability (or Liveness), and Public Verifiability. We classify DRB protocols\naccording to the nature of interactivity among protocol participants. We also\nhighlight the most significant features of DRB protocols such as scalability,\ncomplexity, and performance along with a brief discussion on its improvement.\nWe present future research directions along with a few interesting research\nproblems.",

In this\nwork, we consider applications of blockchain technologies in telecom\nregulations. In particular, we address growing concerns around Unsolicited\nCommercial Communication (UCC aka. spam) sent through text messages (SMS) and\nphone calls in India. Despite several regulatory measures taken to curb the\nmenace of spam it continues to be a nuisance to subscribers while posing\nchallenges to telecom operators and regulators alike.\n  In this paper, we present a consortium blockchain based architecture to\naddress the problem of UCC in India. Our solution improves subscriber\nexperiences, improves the efficiency of regulatory processes while also\npositively impacting all stakeholders in the telecom ecosystem. Unlike previous\napproaches to the problem of UCC, which are all ex-post, our approach to\nadherence to the regulations is ex-ante. The proposal described in this paper\nis a primary contributor to the revision of regulations concerning UCC and spam\nby the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The new regulations\npublished in July 2018 were first of a kind in the world and amended the 2010\nTelecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation (TCCCPR),\nthrough mandating the use of a blockchain/distributed ledgers in addressing the\nUCC problem.

Nevertheless, PCNs suffer\nthemselves from a throughput limitation due to the capital constraints of their\nchannels. A similar dependence on high capital is also found in inter-bank\npayment settlements, where the so-called netting technique is used to mitigate\nliquidity demands.\n  In this work, we alleviate this limitation by introducing the notion of\ntransaction aggregation: instead of executing transactions sequentially through\na PCN, we enable senders to aggregate multiple transactions and execute them\nsimultaneously to benefit from several amounts that may \"cancel out\". Two\ndirect advantages of our proposal is the decrease in intermediary fees paid by\nsenders as well as the obfuscation of the transaction data from the\nintermediaries.\n  We formulate the transaction aggregation as a computational problem, a\ngeneralization of the Bank Clearing Problem. We present a generic framework for\nthe transaction aggregation execution, and thereafter we propose Wiser as an\nimplementation of this framework in a specific hub-based setting. To overcome\nthe NP-hardness of the transaction aggregation problem, in Wiser we propose a\nfixed-parameter linear algorithm for a special case of transaction aggregation\nas well as the Bank Clearing Problem. Wiser can also be seen as a modern\nvariant of the Hawala money transfer system, as well as a decentralized\nimplementation of the overseas remittance service of Wise.",

The proposed scheme not only achieves\nfine-grained and scalable second-life component management, but also enables\non-chain trading, subsidies, and green-bond issuance.

In this paper, we apply decentralized tools such as\nblockchain and consensus algorithms to design a support system that supports\nthe decentralized operation of federated learning in an alliance environment,\ninvolving the exploration of incentives, security, fairness and other issues.\nFinally, we experimentally verify the performance of our system, the effect of\nfederated learning, and the availability of privacy protection.",

Traditional FL heavily relies on a\ntrusted centralized server. It is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, the sharing\nof raw model updates puts the private training data under the risk of being\nreconstructed, and it suffers from an efficiency problem due to heavy\ncommunication cost. Although decentralized FL eliminates the central\ndependence, it may worsen the other problems due to insufficient constraints on\nthe behavior of participants and distributed consensus on the global model\nupdate. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based fully decentralized\npeer-to-peer (P2P) framework for FL, called BlockDFL for short. It leverages\nblockchain to force participants to behave well. It integrates gradient\ncompression and our designed voting mechanism to coordinate decentralized FL\namong peer participants without mutual trust, while preventing data from being\nreconstructed from transmitted model updates. Extensive experiments conducted\non two real-world datasets exhibit that BlockDFL obtains competitive accuracy\ncompared to centralized FL and can defend poisoning attacks while achieving\nefficiency and scalability. Especially when the proportion of malicious\nparticipants is as high as 40%, BlockDFL can still preserve the accuracy of FL,\noutperforming existing fully decentralized FL frameworks based on blockchain.",

By falsifying the priority parameters (both\n\\textit{difficulty} and \\textit{delay time}), a malicious out-of-turn sealer\ncan always successfully occupy the leader position and produce advantageous\nblocks that may contain profitable transactions. As a typical instance, we\napply our attack to a mature Clique-engined project, HPB (\\$3,058,901, as of\nApril 2022). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nfeasibility. Then, we further recommend fixes that make identity checks\neffective. Our investigation and suggestion have been submitted to its official\nteam and got their approval. We believe this work can act as, at least, a\nwarning case for Clique variants to avoid repeating these design mistakes.",

Such issues stem from the fact that, given the temporary ledger\nversions in the blockchain, FL devices may use different models for training,\nand that, given the asynchronicity of the FL operation, stale local updates\n(computed using outdated models) may be generated. In this paper, we shed light\non the implications of the FLchain setting and study the effect that both the\nAoI and ledger inconsistencies have on the FL performance.

            "summary": "Many of the key enabling technologies of the fifth-generation (5G), such as\nnetwork slicing, spectrum sharing, and federated learning, rely on a\ncentralized authority. This may lead to pitfalls in terms of security or single\npoint of failure. Distributed ledger technology, specifically blockchain, is\ncurrently employed by different applications related to the Internet of Things\n(IoT) and 5G to address the drawbacks of centralized systems. For this reason,\nmobile blockchain networks (MBNs) have recently attracted a great deal of\nattention. To add a transaction to the blockchain in MBNs, mobile or IoT users\nmust perform various tasks like encryption, decryption, and mining. These tasks\nrequire energy and processing power, which impose limitations on mobile and IoT\nusers' performance because they are usually battery powered and have a low\nprocessing power. One possible solution is to perform the tasks virtually on\ncommodity servers provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) or cloud computing.\nTo do so, all tasks needed to add a transaction to the blockchain can be\ntreated as virtual blockchain functions that can be executed on commodity\nservers. We introduce a blockchain virtualization framework called blockchain\nfunction virtualization (BFV), through which all blockchain functions can be\nperformed virtually by MEC or cloud computing. Furthermore, we describe\napplications of the BFV framework and resource allocation challenges brought by\nthe BFV framework in mobile networks. In addition, to illustrate the advantages\nof BFV, we define an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the energy\nconsumption cost and maximize miners' rewards. Finally, simulation results show\nthe performance of the proposed framework in terms of total energy consumption,\ntransaction confirmation rate, and miners' average profit.",

However, it is unavoidable to consume massive computing\npower for solving time-lock puzzles and it is difficult for encryptors to\npredict the amount of time to solve a puzzle by decryptors. In this study, an\nefficient dual-purpose proof-of-work consensus allows users to release a\ntime-locked content, which is encrypted by an asymmetric key encryption scheme\non a blockchain, without trust in any third-party agents. The release time is\npredictable as the block time in a proof-of-work blockchain is adaptively\ncontrolled. The mining work is reproposed so that once a new block was mined on\nthe blockchain network, time-lock puzzles were also solved immediately. No\nadditional work is required to reveal the time-locked contents and the\nencryption is secured by monetary incentive mechanisms since it would be very\ncostly to arrange an attack attempt, which must overtake the total hash rate of\nthe whole blockchain network.",

The small cell-based\nnetwork architecture and device-to-device (D2D) communication are already being\nconsidered part of 5G networks and beyond. In such environments, network coding\n(NC) can be employed to achieve both higher throughput and energy efficiency.\nHowever, NC-enabled systems need to address security challenges specific to NC,\nsuch as pollution attacks.

The performance\nanalysis of the protocol during handover scenarios indicates its suitability\nfor ensuring high level of security against pollution attacks in dense small\ncell environments with multiple adversaries being present.

Front-running causes devastating losses to honest\nparticipants and continues to endanger the fairness of the ecosystem. We\npresent Flash Freezing Flash Boys (F3B), a blockchain architecture that\naddresses front-running attacks by using threshold cryptography. In F3B, a user\ngenerates a symmetric key to encrypt their transaction, and once the underlying\nconsensus layer has finalized the transaction, a decentralized\nsecret-management committee reveals this key. F3B mitigates front-running\nattacks because, before the consensus group finalizes it, an adversary can no\nlonger read the content of a transaction, thus preventing the adversary from\nbenefiting from advanced knowledge of pending transactions. Unlike other\nmitigation systems, F3B properly ensures that all unfinalized transactions,\neven with significant delays, remain private by adopting per-transaction\nprotection. Furthermore, F3B addresses front-running at the execution layer;\nthus, our solution is agnostic to the underlying consensus algorithm and\ncompatible with existing smart contracts. We evaluated F3B on Ethereum with a\nmodified execution layer and found only a negligible (0.026%) increase in\ntransaction latency, specifically due to running threshold decryption with a\n128-member secret-management committee after a transaction is finalized; this\nindicates that F3B is both practical and low-cost.",

            "summary": "As blockchain technology and cryptocurrency become increasingly mainstream,\never-increasing energy costs required to maintain the computational power\nrunning these decentralized platforms create a market for more energy-efficient\nhardware. Photonic cryptographic hash functions, which use photonic integrated\ncircuits to accelerate computation, promise energy efficiency for verifying\ntransactions and mining in a cryptonetwork. Like many analog computing\napproaches, however, current proposals for photonic cryptographic hash\nfunctions that promise similar security guarantees as Bitcoin are susceptible\nto systematic error, so multiple devices may not reach a consensus on\ncomputation despite high numerical precision (associated with low photodetector\nnoise). In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that a\nmore general family of robust discrete analog cryptographic hash functions,\nwhich we introduce as LightHash, leverages integer matrix-vector operations on\nphotonic mesh networks of interferometers. The difficulty of LightHash can be\nadjusted to be sufficiently tolerant to systematic error (calibration error,\nloss error, coupling error, and phase error) and preserve inherent security\nguarantees present in the Bitcoin protocol. Finally, going beyond our\nproof-of-concept, we define a ``photonic advantage'' criterion and justify how\nrecent developments in CMOS optoelectronics (including analog-digital\nconversion) provably achieve such advantage for robust and digitally-verifiable\nphotonic computing and ultimately generate a new market for decentralized\nphotonic technology.",

Parties can trust\nthe integrity and correctness of transactions and the verifiable execution of\nbinary code on the blockchain (smart contracts) inside the system. Including\ninformation from outside of the blockchain remains challenging. A challenge is\ndata privacy. In a public system, shared data becomes public and, coming from a\nsingle source, often lacks credibility. A private system gives the parties\ncontrol over their data and sources but trades in positive aspects as\ntransparency. Often, not the data itself is the most critical information but\nthe result of a computation performed on it.\n  An example is research data certification. To keep data private but still\nprove data provenance, researchers can store a hash value of that data on the\nblockchain. This hash value is either calculated locally on private data\nwithout the chance for validation or is calculated on the blockchain, meaning\nthat data must be published and stored on the blockchain -- a problem of the\noverall data amount stored on and distributed with the ledger. A system we\ncalled moving smart contracts bypasses this problem: Data remain local, but\ntrusted nodes can access them and execute trusted smart contract code stored on\nthe blockchain. This method avoids the system-wide distribution of research\ndata and makes it accessible and verifiable with trusted software.",

In all\nBlockchain repository categories, the contribution interactions on commits are\nthe most common interaction type. We found that more organizations contributing\nto the Blockchain repos than individual users. The median numbers of internal\nand external users in tools are higher than the application repos. We observed\na higher degree of collaboration (e.g., for maintenance efforts) among users in\nBlockchain tools than those in the application repos.

Today, contracts and clients\nare written as separate programs -- in different programming languages --\ncommunicating via send and receive operations. This makes distributed program\nflow awkward to express and reason about, increasing the potential for\nmismatches in the client-contract interface, which can be exploited by\nmalicious clients, potentially leading to huge financial losses. In this paper,\nwe present Prisma, a language for tierless decentralized applications, where\nthe contract and its clients are defined in one unit and pairs of send and\nreceive actions that \"belong together\" are encapsulated into a single\ndirect-style operation, which is executed differently by sending and receiving\nparties. This enables expressing distributed program flow via standard control\nflow and renders mismatching communication impossible. We prove formally that\nour compiler preserves program behavior in presence of an attacker controlling\nthe client code. We systematically compare Prisma with mainstream and advanced\nprogramming models for dApps and provide empirical evidence for its\nexpressiveness and performance.",

In this\npaper, we propose CDEdit, a highly applicable redactable blockchain with\ncontrollable editing privilege and diversified editing types. The proposed\nscheme increases the cost of invalid or malicious requests by paying the\ndeposit on each edit request. At the same time, the editing privilege is\nsubdivided into request, modification, and verification privileges, and the\nmodification privilege token is distributed efficiently to prevent the abuse of\nthe modification privilege and collusion attacks. We use chameleon hashes with\nephemeral trapdoor (CHET) and ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption\n(CP-ABE) to implement two editing types of transaction-level and block-level,\nand present a practical instantiation and security analysis.

In this work, we initiate the\nstudy of strategic latency reduction in blockchain P2P networks.

Finally, we show that our results are\nnot due to the poor design of existing P2P networks.

            "summary": "Trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as \\intelsgx facilitate the secure\nexecution of an application on untrusted machines. Sadly, such environments\nsuffer from serious limitations and performance overheads in terms of writing\nback data to the main memory, their interaction with the OS, and the ability to\nissue I/O instructions. There is thus a plethora of work that focuses on\nimproving the performance of such environments -- this necessitates the need\nfor a standard, widely accepted benchmark suite (something similar to SPEC and\nPARSEC). To the best of our knowledge, such a suite does not exist.\n  Our suite, SGXGauge, contains a diverse set of workloads such as blockchain\ncodes, secure machine learning algorithms, lightweight web servers, secure\nkey-value stores, etc. We thoroughly characterizes the behavior of the\nbenchmark suite on a native platform and on a platform that uses a library\nOS-based shimming layer (GrapheneSGX). We observe that the most important\nmetrics of interest are performance counters related to paging, memory, and TLB\naccesses. There is an abrupt change in performance when the memory footprint\nstarts to exceed the size of the EPC size in Intel SGX, and the library OS does\nnot add a significant overhead (~ +- 10%).",

However, due to the high training cost, a\nsingle model owner may not be able to deploy HFL. To address this issue, we\ndevelop a smart contract based trust crowdfunding mechanism for HFL, which\nenables multiple model owners to obtain a crowdfunding model with high social\nutility for multiple crowdfunding participants. To ensure the authenticity of\nthe crowdfunding mechanism, we implemented the Vickey-Clark-Croves (VCG)\nmechanism to encourage all crowdfunding participants and clients to provide\nrealistic bids and offers. At the same time, in order to ensure guaranteed\ntrustworthiness of crowdfunding and automatic distribution of funds, we develop\nand implement a smart contract to record the crowdfunding process and training\nresults in the blockchain. We prove that the proposed scheme satisfies the\nbudget balance and participant constraint. Finally, we implement a prototype of\nthis smart contract on an Ethereoum private chain and evaluate the proposed VCG\nmechanism.

Consequently, secure aggregation protocols for FL have been\ndeveloped to conceal the local models from the server. However, we show that,\nby manipulating the client selection process, the server can circumvent the\nsecure aggregation to learn the local models of a victim client, indicating\nthat secure aggregation alone is inadequate for privacy protection. To tackle\nthis issue, we leverage blockchain technology to propose a verifiable client\nselection protocol. Owing to the immutability and transparency of blockchain,\nour proposed protocol enforces a random selection of clients, making the server\nunable to control the selection process at its discretion. We present security\nproofs showing that our protocol is secure against this attack. Additionally,\nwe conduct several experiments on an Ethereum-like blockchain to demonstrate\nthe feasibility and practicality of our solution.",

            "summary": "Motivated by a practical scenario in blockchains in which a client, who\npossesses a transaction, wishes to privately verify that the transaction\nactually belongs to a block, we investigate the problem of private retrieval of\nMerkle proofs (i.e. proofs of inclusion/membership) in a Merkle tree. In this\nsetting, one or more servers store the nodes of a binary tree (a Merkle tree),\nwhile a client wants to retrieve the set of nodes along a root-to-leaf path\n(i.e. a Merkle proof, after appropriate node swapping operations), without\nletting the servers know which path is being retrieved. We propose a method\nthat partitions the Merkle tree to enable parallel private retrieval of the\nMerkle proofs. The partitioning step is based on a novel tree coloring called\nancestral coloring in which nodes with ancestor-descendant relationship must\nhave distinct colors. To minimize the retrieval time, the coloring must be\nbalanced, i.e. the sizes of the color classes must differ by at most one. We\ndevelop a fast algorithm to find a balanced ancestral coloring in almost linear\ntime in the number of tree nodes, which can handle trees with billions of nodes\nin minutes. Unlike existing approaches, ours allows an efficient indexing with\npolylog time and space complexity. Our partitioning method can be applied on\ntop of any private information retrieval scheme, leading to the minimum storage\noverhead and fastest running time compared to existing works.",

            "summary": "Cryptoeconomic incentives in the form of blockchain-based tokens are seen as\nan enabler of the sharing economy that could shift society towards greater\nsustainability. Nevertheless, knowledge of the impact of these tokens on human\nsharing behavior is still limited and this poses a challenge to the design of\neffective cryptoeconomic incentives. This study applies the theory of\nself-determination to investigate the impact of such tokens on human behavior\nin an information-sharing scenario. By utilizing an experimental methodology in\nthe form of a randomized control trial with a 2x2 factorial design involving\n132 participants, the effects of two token incentives on human\ninformation-sharing behavior are analyzed. Individuals obtain these tokens in\nexchange for their shared information. Based on the collected tokens,\nindividuals receive a monetary payment and build reputation. Besides\ninvestigating the effect of these incentives on the quantity of shared\ninformation, the study includes quality characteristics of the information,\nsuch as accuracy and contextualization. The focus on quantity while excluding\nquality has been identified as a limitation in previous work. In addition to\nconfirming previously known effects such as a crowding-out of intrinsic\nmotivation by incentives, which also exists for blockchain-based tokens, the\nfindings of this paper point to a hitherto unreported interaction effect\nbetween multiple tokens when applied simultaneously. The findings are\ncritically discussed and put into the context of recent work and ethical\nconsiderations. The theory-based-empirical study is of interest to those\ninvestigating the effect of cryptoeconomic tokens or digital currencies on\nhuman behavior and supports the community in the design of effective\npersonalized incentives for sharing economies.",

A\nconsortium blockchain-based system will be typically built across multiple\norganizations. In such blockchain-based systems, system operations across\nmultiple organizations in a decentralized manner are essential to maintain the\nvalue of introducing consortium blockchains. Decentralized system operations\nhave recently been becoming realistic with the evolution of consortium\nblockchains. For instance, the release of Hyperledger Fabric v2.x, in which\nindividual operational tasks for a blockchain network, such as command\nexecution of configuration change of channels (Fabric's sub-networks) and\nupgrade of chaincodes (Fabric's smart contracts), can be partially executed in\na decentralized manner. However, the operations workflows also include the\npreceding procedure of pre-sharing, coordinating, and pre-agreeing the\noperational information (e.g., configuration parameters) among organizations,\nafter which operation executions can be conducted, and this preceding procedure\nrelies on costly manual tasks. To realize efficient decentralized operations\nworkflows for consortium blockchain-based systems in general, we propose a\ndecentralized inter-organizational operations method that we call Operations\nSmart Contract (OpsSC), which defines an operations workflow as a smart\ncontract. Furthermore, we design and implement OpsSC for blockchain network\noperations with Hyperledger Fabric v2.x. This paper presents OpsSC for\noperating channels and chaincodes, which are essential for managing the\nblockchain networks, through clarifying detailed workflows of those operations.\nThe implementation of OpsSC has been open-sourced and registered as one of\nHyperledger Labs projects.",

            "summary": "Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) protocols have recently been extensively used\nby decentralized data management systems with non-trustworthy infrastructures,\ne.g., permissioned blockchains. BFT protocols cover a broad spectrum of design\ndimensions from infrastructure settings such as the communication topology, to\nmore technical features such as commitment strategy and even fundamental social\nchoice properties like order-fairness. The proliferation of different BFT\nprotocols has rendered it difficult to navigate the BFT landscape, let alone\ndetermine the protocol that best meets application needs. This paper presents\nBedrock, a unified platform for BFT protocols design, analysis, implementation,\nand experiments. Bedrock proposes a design space consisting of a set of design\nchoices capturing the trade-offs between different design space dimensions and\nproviding fundamentally new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of BFT\nprotocols. Bedrock enables users to analyze and experiment with BFT protocols\nwithin the space of plausible choices, evolve current protocols to design new\nones, and even uncover previously unknown protocols. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate the capability of Bedrock to uniformly evaluate BFT protocols in\nnew ways that were not possible before due to the diverse assumptions made by\nthese protocols.

            "summary": "Blockchain introduces decentralized trust in peer-to-peer networks, advancing\nsecurity and democratizing systems. Yet, a unified definition for\ndecentralization remains elusive. Our Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) seeks\nto bridge this gap, emphasizing quantification and methodological coherence.\nWe've formulated a taxonomy defining blockchain decentralization across five\nfacets: consensus, network, governance, wealth, and transaction. Despite the\nprevalent focus on consensus decentralization, our novel index, based on\nShannon entropy, provides comprehensive insights. Moreover, we delve into\nalternative metrics like the Gini and Nakamoto Coefficients and the\nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), supplemented by an open-source Python tool on\nGitHub. In terms of methodology, blockchain research has often bypassed\nstringent scientific methods. By employing descriptive, predictive, and causal\nmethods, our study showcases the potential of structured research in\nblockchain. Descriptively, we observe a trend of converging decentralization\nlevels over time. Examining DeFi platforms reveals exchange and lending\napplications as more decentralized than their payment and derivatives\ncounterparts. Predictively, there's a notable correlation between Ether's\nreturns and transaction decentralization in Ether-backed stablecoins. Causally,\nEthereum's transition to the EIP-1559 transaction fee model has a profound\nimpact on DeFi transaction decentralization. To conclude, our work outlines\ndirections for blockchain research, emphasizing the delicate balance among\ndecentralization facets, fostering long-term decentralization, and the ties\nbetween decentralization, security, privacy, and efficiency. We end by\nspotlighting challenges in grasping blockchain decentralization intricacies.",

            "summary": "The state-of-the-art HotStuff operates an efficient pipeline in which a\nstable leader drives decisions with linear communication and two round-trips of\nmessage. However, the unifying proposing-voting pattern is not sufficient to\nimprove the bandwidth and concurrency performance of the modern system. In\naddition, the delay corresponding to two rounds of message to produce a\ncertified proposal in that scheme is a significant performance bottleneck.\nThus, this study developed a new consensus protocol, Multi-pipeline HotStuff,\nfor permissioned blockchain. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the\nfirst protocol that combines multiple HotStuff instances to propose batches in\norder without a concurrent proposal, such that proposals are made\noptimistically when a correct replica realizes that the current proposal is\nvalid and will be certified by quorum votes in the near future. Because\nsimultaneous proposing and voting are allowed by the proposed protocol without\ntransaction duplication, it produced more proposals in every two rounds of\nmessages. In addition, it further boosted the throughput at a comparable\nlatency with that of HotStuff. The evaluation experiment conducted confirmed\nthat the throughput of Multi-pipeline HotStuff outperformed that of the\nstate-of-the-art protocols by approximately 60\\% without significantly\nincreasing end-to-end latency under varying system sizes. Moreover, the\nproposed optimization also performed better when it suffers a bad network\ncondition.",

Unfortunately, while a number of\nproposals address the energy consumption of existing Proof-of-Work deployments,\nlittle attention has been given so far to remedy the storage overhead incurred\nby those blockchains. In fact, it seems widely acceptable that full nodes\nsupporting the blockchains have to volunteer hundreds of GBs of their storage,\nto store and verify all transactions exchanged in the system.\n  In this paper, we explore the solution space to effectively reduce the\nstorage footprint of Proof-of-Work based blockchains. To do so, we analyze, by\nmeans of thorough empirical measurements, how existing full blockchain nodes\nutilize data from the shared ledger to validate incoming transactions/blocks.\nBased on this analysis, we show that it is possible for full nodes to locally\nreduce their storage footprint to approximately 15 GB, without any modification\nto the underlying protocol. We also discuss other client-side strategies to\nfurther reduce the storage footprint while incurring negligible computational\noverhead on the nodes.",

In many recent\nnovel blockchain consensuses, the deep learning training procedure becomes the\ntask for miners to prove their workload, thus the computation power of miners\nwill not purely be spent on the hash puzzle. In this way, the hardware and\nenergy will support the blockchain service and deep learning training\nsimultaneously. While the incentive of miners is to earn tokens, individual\nminers are motivated to join mining pools to become more competitive. In this\npaper, we are the first to demonstrate a mining pool solution for novel\nconsensuses based on deep learning.\n  The mining pool manager partitions the full searching space into subspaces\nand all miners are scheduled to collaborate on the Neural Architecture Search\n(NAS) tasks in the assigned subspace. Experiments demonstrate that the\nperformance of this type of mining pool is more competitive than an individual\nminer. Due to the uncertainty of miners' behaviors, the mining pool manager\nchecks the standard deviation of the performance of high reward miners and\nprepares backup miners to ensure the completion of the tasks of high reward\nminers.",

The DAG\nstructure and the underlying Reality-based UTXO Ledger allow parallel\nvalidation of transactions without the need for total ordering. Moreover, it\nenables the removal of the intermediary of miners and validators, allowing a\npure two-step process that follows the \\emph{propose-vote} paradigm at the node\nlevel and not at the validator level.\n  We propose a framework to analyse liveness and safety under different\ncommunication and adversary models.

            "summary": "High-throughput blockchains require efficient transaction broadcast\nmechanisms that can deliver transactions to most network nodes with low\nbandwidth overhead and latency. Existing schemes coordinate transmissions\nacross peers to avoid sending redundant data, but they either incur a high\nlatency or are not robust against adversarial network nodes. We present\nStrokkur, a new transaction broadcasting mechanism that provides both low\nbandwidth overhead and low latency. The core idea behind Strokkur is to avoid\nexplicit coordination through randomized transaction coding. Rather than\nforward individual transactions. Strokkur nodes send out codewords -- XOR sums\nof multiple transactions selected at random. Since almost every codeword is\nuseful for the receiver to decode new transactions, Strokkur nodes do not\nrequire coordination, for example, to determine which transactions the receiver\nis missing. Strokkur's coding strategy builds on LT codes, a popular class of\nrateless erasure codes, and extends them to support multiple uncoordinated\nsenders with partially-overlapping continual streams of transaction data.\nStrokkur introduces mechanisms to cope with adversarial senders that may send\ncorrupt codewords, and a simple rate control algorithm that enables each node\nto independently determine an appropriate sending rate of codewords for each\npeer. Our implementation of Strokkur in Golang supports 647k transactions per\nsecond using only one CPU core. Our evaluation across a 19-node Internet\ndeployment and large-scale simulation show that Strokkur consumes 2--7.6x less\nbandwidth than the existing scheme in Bitcoin, and 9x lower latency that Shrec\nwhen only 4% of nodes are adversarial.",

            "summary": "Recently, there has been a remarkable amount of research being done in both,\nthe fields of Blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain technology\nsynergises well with IoT, solving key problems such as privacy, concerns with\ninteroperability and security. However, the consensus mechanisms that allows\ntrustless parties to maintain an agreement, the same algorithms that underpins\ncryptocurrency mining, are usually extremely computationally expensive, making\nimplementation on low-power IoT devices difficult. More importantly, mining\nrequires downloading and synchronizing hundred of gigabytes worth of blocks\nwhich is far beyond the capabilities of most IoT devices. In this paper, we\npresent an efficient, portable and platform-agnostic cryptocurrency mining\nalgorithm using the Stratum protocol to avoid downloading the entire\nblockchain. We implement the algorithm in four different platforms- PC, ESP32,\nan emulator and an old PlayStation Portable (PSP) to demonstrate that it is\nindeed possible for any device to mine cryptocurrencies with no assumptions\nexcept the ability to connect to the internet. To make sure of ease of\nportability on any platform and for reproducibility of the reported results we\nmake the implementation publicly available with detailed instructions at:\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/cryptominer.",

However, there are\nsome limitations when storing large files or documents on the blockchain. In\norder to meet the requirements of storing relatively large data, a\ndecentralized storage medium is produced. IPFS is a distributed file system\nwhich is content-addressable. It works very similar to the blockchain network.\nThere are some attempts which take advantage of the blockchain concept and IPFS\nto design new approaches. Unfortunately, there are some inefficiencies in\nsharing data using the combination of IPFS and blockchain. In this paper, we\nproposed a secure file sharing system that brings a distributed access control\nand group key management by the adoption of the IPFS proxy. The IPFS proxy\nwhich plays an important role in the design is adopted to take responsibility\nfor the control policies. The combination of the IPFS server and the blockchain\nnetwork with the adoption of the IPFS proxy make a secure file sharing system\nwhich the members on the system can create new groups or join different groups\nby their own choice. Although there is no access control mechanism in IPFS\nserver and blockchain network, the secure file sharing system manages the\naccess control policies.

            "summary": "Classical and contemporary distributed consensus protocols, may they be for\nbinary agreement, state machine replication, or blockchain consensus, require\nall protocol participants in a peer-to-peer system to agree on exactly the same\ninformation as part of the consensus payload. Although this model of consensus\nis extensively studied, and is useful for most consensus based decentralized\napplications, it falls short of defining correct distributed systems which\nmandate participant credential based privileged visibility into the consensus\npayload, through the consensus protocol itself. We introduce a new paradigm for\ndistributed consensus, called functional blockchain consensus. Functional\nblockchain consensus allows each blockchain protocol participant to agree on\nsome distinct sub-information of the list of transactions, as a function of the\ncredentials of the participant in the blockchain system, instead of agreeing on\nthe entire list of transactions. We motivate two adversary models, one with a\nstandard crash-fault adversary and another with a novel rational-fault\nadversary, to compromise functional blockchain consensus. We then present two\nversions of a blockchain protocol called SightSteeple, that achieves functional\nblockchain consensus in the said fault models. SightSteeple relies on a novel\ncombination of standard blockchain consensus and functional encryption, among\nother primitives, to achieve its goals of correctness. Finally, we discuss\npractical uses of functional blockchain consensus based asymmetric distributed\nledgers, and motivate off-shoot constructions that can result from this new\nconsensus paradigm.",

            "summary": "Smart cities deploy large numbers of sensors and collect a tremendous amount\nof data from them. For example, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs), which\nconsist of physical meters that collect usage data about public utilities such\nas power and water, are an important building block in a smart city. In a\ntypical sensor network, the measurement devices are connected through a\ncomputer network, which exposes them to cyber attacks. Furthermore, the data is\ncentrally managed at the operator's servers, making it vulnerable to insider\nthreats.\n  Our goal is to protect the integrity of data collected by large-scale sensor\nnetworks and the firmware in measurement devices from cyber attacks and insider\nthreats. To this end, we first develop a comprehensive threat model for attacks\nagainst data and firmware integrity, which can target any of the stakeholders\nin the operation of the sensor network. Next, we use our threat model to\nanalyze existing defense mechanisms, including signature checks, remote\nfirmware attestation, anomaly detection, and blockchain-based secure logs.\nHowever, the large size of the Trusted Computing Base and a lack of scalability\nlimit the applicability of these existing mechanisms. We propose the\nFeather-Light Blockchain Infrastructure (FLBI) framework to address these\nlimitations. Our framework leverages a two-layer architecture and cryptographic\nthreshold signature chains to support large networks of low-capacity devices\nsuch as meters and data aggregators. We have fully implemented the FLBI's\nend-to-end functionality on the Hyperledger Fabric and private Ethereum\nblockchain platforms. Our experiments show that the FLBI is able to support\nmillions of end devices.",

In PRETRUST, the guarantee\nprocess replaces the verification of a transaction on-chain to realize the\noptimization of efficiency. And the model of a trusted execution environment is\nutilized in the interactions between PRETRUST and public systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nblockchain-based travel rule compliance system that supports\nfully-decentralized data exchange. The proposed system uses a permissioned\nblockchain, and thereby eliminates the possibility of leakage of personal\ninformation to third parties or even to travel rule service providers, and\nensures that travel rule data can be managed securely.",

            "summary": "In recent years, phishing scams have become the most serious type of crime\ninvolved in Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain platform. The existing\nphishing scams detection technology on Ethereum mostly uses traditional machine\nlearning or network representation learning to mine the key information from\nthe transaction network to identify phishing addresses. However, these methods\nadopt the last transaction record or even completely ignore these records, and\nonly manual-designed features are taken for the node representation. In this\npaper, we propose a Temporal Transaction Aggregation Graph Network (TTAGN) to\nenhance phishing scams detection performance on Ethereum. Specifically, in the\ntemporal edges representation module, we model the temporal relationship of\nhistorical transaction records between nodes to construct the edge\nrepresentation of the Ethereum transaction network. Moreover, the edge\nrepresentations around the node are aggregated to fuse topological interactive\nrelationships into its representation, also named as trading features, in the\nedge2node module. We further combine trading features with common statistical\nand structural features obtained by graph neural networks to identify phishing\naddresses. Evaluated on real-world Ethereum phishing scams datasets, our TTAGN\n(92.8% AUC, and 81.6% F1score) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and\nthe effectiveness of temporal edges representation and edge2node module is also\ndemonstrated.",

In this work, we propose a\ngeneric Cross-Cryptocurrency Relationship Mining module, named C2RM, which can\neffectively capture the synchronous and asynchronous impact factors between\nBitcoin and related Altcoins. Specifically, we utilize the Dynamic Time Warping\nalgorithm to extract the lead-lag relationship, yielding Lead-lag Variance\nKernel, which will be used for aggregating the information of Altcoins to form\nrelational impact factors. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that\nour C2RM can help existing price prediction methods achieve significant\nperformance improvement, suggesting the effectiveness of Cross-Cryptocurrency\ninteractions on benefitting Bitcoin price prediction.",

In this work, we adopt a fresh outlook\nfor decentralized search in P2P networks that is inspired by advancements in\ndense information retrieval and graph signal processing.

We then use the diffused representations to guide search\nqueries towards relevant content. Our preliminary approach is successful in\nlocating relevant documents in nearby nodes but the accuracy declines sharply\nwith the number of stored documents, highlighting the need for more\nsophisticated techniques.",

To help fill this\nresearch gap, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study consisting of a\nsemi-structured interview and a code review task with 29 smart contract\ndevelopers with diverse backgrounds, including 10 early stage (less than one\nyear of experience) and 19 experienced (2-5 years of experience) smart contract\ndevelopers.\n  Our findings show a wide range of smart contract security perceptions and\npractices including various tools and resources they used. Our early-stage\ndeveloper participants had a much lower success rate (15%) of identifying\nsecurity vulnerabilities in the code review task than their experienced\ncounterparts (55%). Our hierarchical task analysis of their code reviews\nimplies that just by accessing standard documentation, reference\nimplementations and security tools is not sufficient. Many developers checked\nthose materials or used a security tool but still failed to identify the\nsecurity issues. In addition, several participants pointed out shortcomings of\ncurrent smart contract security tooling such as its usability.

We first categorize the activity of lending\nplatforms within a standard regulatory framework. We then employ a novel\ngrouping and classification algorithm to calculate the percentage of fund flows\ninto DeFi lending platforms that can be attributed to debt created elsewhere in\nthe system (\"debt-financed collateral\"). Based on our results, we conclude that\nthe wide-spread use of stablecoins as debt-financed collateral increases\nfinancial stability risks in the DeFi ecosystem.",

This has led to users being forced to weaken their privacy,\ne.g. by using centralised exchanges, to move assets from one chain to another.\nWe present ZCLAIM, a framework for trustless cross-chain asset migration based\non the Zcash privacy-protecting protocol. ZCLAIM integrates with an\nimplementation of the Sapling version of Zcash on a smart-contract capable\nissuing chain in order to attain private cross-chain transfers.

However, such\nsolutions are mostly offered via off-chain, often paid relayer services and do\nnot fully address the security issues present in the meta-transaction path.

In this\npaper, we use Federated Learning (FL) to build a threat hunting framework\ncalled Block Hunter to automatically hunt for attacks in blockchain-based IIoT\nnetworks. Block Hunter utilizes a cluster-based architecture for anomaly\ndetection combined with several machine learning models in a federated\nenvironment.

In this paper, we mainly\nfocus on Ponzi scheme detection and propose HFAug, a generic Heterogeneous\nFeature Augmentation module that can capture the heterogeneous information\nassociated with account behavior patterns and can be combined with existing\nPonzi detection methods. HFAug learns the metapath-based behavior\ncharacteristics in an auxiliary heterogeneous interaction graph, and aggregates\nthe heterogeneous features to corresponding account nodes in the homogeneous\none where the Ponzi detection methods are performed.

            "summary": "The fundamental tradeoff between transaction per second (TPS) and security in\nblockchain systems persists despite numerous prior attempts to boost TPS. To\nincrease TPS without compromising security, we propose a bodyless block\npropagation (BBP) scheme for which the block body is not validated and\ntransmitted during the block propagation process. Rather, the nodes in the\nblockchain network anticipate the transactions and their ordering in the next\nupcoming block so that these transactions can be pre-executed and pre-validated\nbefore the birth of the block. It is critical, however, all nodes have a\nconsensus on the transaction content of the next block.\n  This paper puts forth a transaction selection, ordering, and synchronization\nalgorithm to drive the nodes to reach such a consensus. Yet, the coinbase\naddress of the miner of the next block cannot be anticipated, and therefore\ntransactions that depend on the coinbase address cannot be pre-executed and\npre-validated. This paper further puts forth an algorithm to deal with such\nunresolvable transactions for an overall consistent and TPS-efficient scheme.\nWith our scheme, most transactions do not need to be validated and transmitted\nduring block propagation, ridding the dependence of propagation time on the\nnumber of transactions in the block, and making the system fully TPS scalable.\nExperimental results show that our protocol can reduce propagation time by 4x\nwith respect to the current Ethereum blockchain, and its TPS performance is\nlimited by the node hardware performance rather than block propagation.",

            "summary": "The problem of Byzantine consensus has been key to designing secure\ndistributed systems. However, it is particularly difficult, mainly due to the\npresence of Byzantine processes that act arbitrarily and the unknown message\ndelays in general networks.\n  Although it is well known that both safety and liveness are at risk as soon\nas $n/3$ Byzantine processes fail, very few works attempted to characterize\nprecisely the faults that produce safety violations from the faults that\nproduce termination violations.\n  In this paper, we present a new lower bound on the solvability of the\nconsensus problem by distinguishing deceitful faults violating safety and\nbenign faults violating termination from the more general Byzantine faults, in\nwhat we call the Byzantine-deceitful-benign fault model. We show that one\ncannot solve consensus if $n\\leq 3t+d+2q$ with $t$ Byzantine processes, $d$\ndeceitful processes, and $q$ benign processes.\n  In addition, we show that this bound is tight by presenting the Basilic class\nof consensus protocols that solve consensus when $n > 3t+d+2q$. These protocols\ndiffer in the number of processes from which they wait to receive messages\nbefore progressing. Each of these protocols is thus better suited for some\napplications depending on the predominance of benign or deceitful faults.\n  Finally, we study the fault tolerance of the Basilic class of consensus\nprotocols in the context of blockchains that need to solve the weaker problem\nof eventual consensus. We demonstrate that Basilic solves this problem with\nonly $n > 2t+d+q$, hence demonstrating how it can strengthen blockchain\nsecurity.",

In this\npaper, we consider phishing detection as a graph classification task and\npropose an end-to-end Phishing Detection Graph Neural Network framework\n(PDGNN). Specifically, we first construct a lightweight Ethereum transaction\nnetwork and extract transaction subgraphs of collected phishing accounts. Then\nwe propose an end-to-end detection model based on Chebyshev-GCN to precisely\ndistinguish between normal and phishing accounts. Extensive experiments on five\nEthereum datasets demonstrate that our PDGNN significantly outperforms general\nphishing detection methods and scales well in large transaction networks.",

Nonetheless, Blockchain-based\nsystems still suffer from low transaction rates and high transaction processing\nlatencies, which hinder blockchains' scalability. An entire class of solutions,\ncalled Layer-1 scalability solutions, have attempted to incrementally improve\nsuch limitations by adding/modifying fundamental blockchain attributes.\nRecently, a completely different class of works, called Layer-2 protocols, have\nemerged to tackle the blockchain scalability issues using unconventional\napproaches. Layer-2 protocols improve transaction processing rates, periods,\nand fees by minimizing the use of underlying slow and costly blockchains. In\nfact, the main chain acts just as an instrument for trust establishment and\ndispute resolution among Layer-2 participants, where only a few transactions\nare dispatched to the main chain. Thus, Layer-2 blockchain protocols have the\npotential to transform the domain. However, rapid and discrete developments\nhave resulted in diverse branches of Layer-2 protocols. In this work, we\nsystematically create a broad taxonomy of such protocols and implementations.\nWe discuss each Layer-2 protocol class in detail and also elucidate their\nrespective approaches, salient features, requirements, etc. Moreover, we\noutline the issues related to these protocols along with a comparative\ndiscussion. Our thorough study will help further systematize the knowledge\ndispersed in the domain and help the readers to better understand the field of\nLayer-2 protocols.",

For storing the\npre-trained models over blockchain, current approaches primarily embed a model\nusing its structural properties that are neither scalable for cross-chain\nexchange nor suitable for cross-chain verification. This paper proposes an\narchitectural framework for cross-chain verifiable model training using\nfederated learning, called Proof of Federated Training (PoFT), the first of its\nkind that enables a federated training procedure span across the clients over\nmultiple blockchain networks. Instead of structural embedding, PoFT uses model\nparameters to embed the model over a blockchain and then applies a verifiable\nmodel exchange between two blockchain networks for cross-network model\ntraining. We implement and test PoFT over a large-scale setup using Amazon EC2\ninstances and observe that cross-chain training can significantly boosts up the\nmodel efficacy. In contrast, PoFT incurs marginal overhead for inter-chain\nmodel exchanges.",

Each ADI also possesses a hierarchical\nset of keys with different priority levels that allow users to manage their\nsecurity over time and create complex signature authorization schemes that\nexpand the utility of multi-signature transactions.

We make a case study of Hyperledger Indy -- an open-source\ntechnology bespoke for decentralized identity -- and conduct two empirical\nexperiments to measure the latency of more than 45,000 transactions in the\nnaturalistic environment of Amazon Web Services. We conclude that issues of\nTrust Registry scalability have multiple facets.

We offer Matrix\nSyncer, the ultimate middleware that bridges the data access gap between\nblockchains and end-user applications. Matrix Syncer is designed to facilitate\nthe consolidation of on-chain information into a distributed data warehouse\nwhile also enabling customized on-chain state transformation for a scalable\nstorage, access, and retrieval. It offers a unified layer for both on- and\noff-chain state, as well as a fast and flexible atomic query. Matrix Syncer is\neasily incorporated into any infrastructure to aggregate data from various\nblockchains concurrently, such as Ethereum and Flow. The system has been\ndeployed to support several metaverse projects with a total value of more than\n$15 million USD.",

The utilisation of Machine Learning (ML) capabilities in\nthe defence against IoT cyber attacks has many potential benefits. However, the\ncurrently proposed frameworks do not consider data privacy, secure\narchitectures, and/or scalable deployments of IoT ecosystems. In this paper, we\npropose a hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework to enable\nsecure and privacy-preserved collaborative IoT intrusion detection. We\nhighlight and demonstrate the importance of sharing cyber threat intelligence\namong inter-organisational IoT networks to improve the model's detection\ncapabilities. The proposed ML-based intrusion detection framework follows a\nhierarchical federated learning architecture to ensure the privacy of the\nlearning process and organisational data. The transactions (model updates) and\nprocesses will run on a secure immutable ledger, and the conformance of\nexecuted tasks will be verified by the smart contract. We have tested our\nsolution and demonstrated its feasibility by implementing it and evaluating the\nintrusion detection performance using a key IoT data set. The outcome is a\nsecurely designed ML-based intrusion detection system capable of detecting a\nwide range of malicious activities while preserving data privacy.",

The key factor\ndetermining the performance of such resilient data management systems is the\nconsensus protocol used by the system to replicate client transactions among\nall participants. Unfortunately, existing high-throughput consensus protocols\nare costly and impose significant latencies on transaction processing, which\nrules out their usage in responsive high-performance data management systems.\n  In this work, we improve on this situation by introducing the\nProof-of-Execution consensus protocol (PoE), a consensus protocol designed for\nhigh-performance low-latency resilient data management. PoE introduces\nspeculative execution, which minimizes latencies by starting execution before\nconsensus is reached, and PoE introduces proof-of-executions to guarantee\nsuccessful execution to clients. Furthermore, PoE introduces a single-round\ncheck-commit protocol to reduce the overall communication costs of consensus.\nHence, we believe that PoE is a promising step towards flexible general-purpose\nlow-latency resilient data management systems.",

The Internet of Things\nprovides the fabric to connect these stakeholders who share their data, refined\ninformation, and provided services with each other. However, these cloud-based\nsystems struggle to meet the real-time requirements for smart traffic due to\nlong distances across networks. Here, edge computing systems bring the data and\nservices into the close proximity of fast-moving vehicles, reducing information\ndelivery latencies and improving privacy as sensitive data is processed\nlocally. To solve the issues of trust and latency in data sharing between these\nstakeholders, we propose a decentralized framework that enables smart contracts\nbetween traffic data producers and consumers based on blockchain. Autonomous\nvehicles connect to a local edge server, share their data, or use services\nbased on agreements, for which the cooperating edge servers across the system\nprovide a platform. We set up proof-of-concept experiments with Hyperledger\nFabric and virtual cars to analyze the system throughput with secure unicast\nand multicast data transmissions.

A key\nfactor affecting mining rewards, is the latency of broadcasting blocks over the\nnetwork. In this paper, we consider the problem of topology design for\noptimizing mining rewards in a wide-area blockchain network that uses a\nProof-of-Work protocol for consensus. Contrary to general wisdom that a faster\nnetwork is always better for miners, we show a counter intuitive result where a\nslower network is actually beneficial to some miners. This is because competing\nminers must choose neighbors that not only decrease their own latency to\nothers, but also ensure that the latency between other miners do not decrease\nbecause of itself.

            "summary": "Blockchain is becoming a new generation of information infrastructures.\nHowever, the current blockchain solutions rely on a continuous connectivity\nnetwork to query and modify the state of the blockchain. The emerging satellite\ntechnology seems to be a good catalyst to forward offline transactions to the\nblockchain. However, this approach suffers expensive costs, difficult\ninteroperability, and limited computation problems. Therefore, we propose\nBcMON, the first blockchain middleware for offline networks. BcMON incorporates\nthree innovative designs: 1) it reduces the costs of offline transactions\naccessing the blockchain through Short Message Service (SMS), 2) it validates\nthe authenticity of offline cross-chain transactions by two-phase consensus, 3)\nit supports offline clients to perform complex queries and computations on the\nblockchains. The prototype of BcMON has been implemented to evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed middleware, which can show its stability,\nefficiency, and scalability.",

However, gaps in security and\nscalability hinder the development of real-world applications. In this study,\nwe propose ScaleSFL, which is a scalable blockchain-based sharding solution for\nfederated learning. ScaleSFL supports interoperability by separating the\noff-chain federated learning component in order to verify model updates instead\nof controlling the entire federated learning flow. We implemented ScaleSFL as a\nproof-of-concept prototype system using Hyperledger Fabric to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the solution. We present a performance evaluation of results\ncollected through Hyperledger Caliper benchmarking tools conducted on model\ncreation. Our evaluation results show that sharding can improve validation\nperformance linearly while remaining efficient and secure.",

With limited bandwidth, the communication complexity for nodes to\nprocess a block scales with the growing network size and hence becomes the\nlimiting factor of blockchain's performance.\n  In this paper, we suggest a re-design of existing blockchain systems, which\naddresses the issue of the communication burden. First, by employing techniques\nfrom Coded Computation, our scheme guarantees correct verification of\ntransactions while reducing the bit complexity dramatically such that it grows\nlogarithmically with the number of nodes. Second, with the adoption of\ntechniques from Information Dispersal and State Machine Replication, the system\nis resilient to Byzantine faults and achieves linear message complexity. Third,\nwe propose a novel 2-dimensional sharding strategy, which inherently supports\ncross-shard transactions, alleviating the need for complicated communication\nprotocols between shards, while keeping the computation and storage benefits of\nsharding.",

Further, two kinds of active attacks, i.e., jamming and\nimpersonation, are considered on the IoT blockchain network due to the presence\nof multiple {\\it active} malicious nodes in the close vicinity. When the IoT\nnetwork is under the jamming attack, we utilize the stochastic geometry tool to\nderive the closed-form expressions for the coverage probabilities for both\nuplink and downlink IoT transmissions. On the other hand, when the IoT network\nis under the impersonation attack, we propose a novel method that enables a\nreceive IoT node to exploit the pathloss of a transmit IoT node as its\nfingerprint to implement a binary hypothesis test for transmit node\nidentification. To this end, we also provide the closed-form expressions for\nthe probabilities of false alarm, missed detection and miss-classification.\nFinally, we present detailed simulation results that indicate the following: i)\nthe coverage probability improves as the jammers' locations move away from the\nIoT network, ii) the three error probabilities decrease as a function of the\nlink quality.",

This means that ordinary participants can simultaneously\nbecome traders, miners, retailers, and customers, thus breaking down barriers,\nreducing the information gap between participants in the community, and\ncontributing to the futuristic metaverse with an open, progressive, and equal\nideology. The impact of this information transformation empowered by blockchain\nextends to our understanding of methodology, legal governance in cyberspace,\nand financial and technological development. This study asks: what are the\nimplications of the blockchain-driven information revolution for society and\nsocial sciences? In order to answer this main question, the paper focuses on\nfour key perspectives: methodological, legal, financial, and technical. Through\nthe analysis of these four perspectives, the paper provides a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the impact of blockchain on society, the social sciences, and\ntechnology, making a contribution to current scholarship. It finds that\nblockchain is not only an innovative cognition method, but also a community\nrepresentative, serving as a source of trust, a governance watchdog, an\nenforcer of cyber laws, and an incubator for future technologies. Despite some\nchallenges in integrating blockchain with existing social structures, this\npaper concludes that blockchain has the potential to play a significant role in\nshaping the future.",

Robustness is realized by removing\nthe direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using\ntimed-state machines. Results show that ElectAnon is scalable amongst existing\nworks as it reduces the gas consumption up to 89% compared to previous works.\nThe proposed protocol includes a candidate proposal system and swappable\ntallying libraries.

Despite the widespread availability of (IoT) devices and their\nInternet connectivity, they have a low level of information security integrity.\nA number of security methods were proposed and evaluated in our research, and\ncomparisons were made in terms of energy and time in the encryption and\ndecryption processes. A ratification procedure is also performed on the devices\nin the main manager, which is regarded as a full firewall for IoT devices. The\nsuggested algorithm's success has been shown utilizing low-cost Adriano Uno and\nRaspberry Pi devices. Arduous Uno has been used to demonstrate the encryption\nprocess in low-energy devices using a variety of algorithms, including Enhanced\nAlgorithm for Data Integrity and Authentication (EDAI) and raspberry, which\nserves as a safety manager in low-energy device molecules. A variety of\nenhanced algorithms used in conjunction with Blockchain software have also\nassured the security and integrity of the information.

While this vision is far from realized, these cryptocurrencies are\nstill touted to be much more decentralized than traditional centralized\nsystems. While it is well understood that cryptocurrencies are centralized, it\nis still unclear what the underlying causes are. This work aims to address this\ngap and examines some of the forces behind mining centralization.\n  The internals of cryptocurrency mining is very opaque and difficult to study\nsince it traditionally requires forming relationships with miners, who are\ntypically reticent to share internal information about their competitive\nadvantages. This work takes a different approach by combining large-scale\nstatistical techniques with publicly available blockchain data in order to\nanswer previously intractable questions. The crux of our analysis technique is\nbased on the simple observation that some miners can utilize their hashpower\nmore efficiently due to their position in the network. By teasing out that\neffect, we de-bias the mining power distribution to get a more accurate\nestimate. Using that de-biased mining power distribution, we can answer\nquestions about the network position of miners in each cryptocurrency network.\nFinally, during the course of this study, we observed some unusual mining\nbehaviors which we highlight.",

Lazy blockchains can end up containing invalid\ntransactions such as double spends, but these can easily be filtered out by\nfull nodes that can check if there have been previous conflicting transactions.\nHowever, creating light (SPV) clients that do not see the whole transaction\nhistory on top of these chains becomes a challenge: A record of a transaction\non the chain does not necessarily entail transaction confirmation. In this\npaper, we devise a protocol that enables the creation of efficient light\nclients for lazy blockchains. The number of interaction rounds and the\ncommunication complexity of our protocol are only logarithmic in the blockchain\nexecution time. Our construction is based on a bisection game that traverses\nthe Merkle tree containing the ledger of all -- valid or invalid --\ntransactions. We prove that our proof system is succinct, complete and sound,\nand we illustrate how it can be applied to both the UTXO as well as the account\nbased models.

Therefore, it is essential to understand the nature\nof vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts to prevent them in the future.\nExisting classifications exist, but are limited in several ways. Objective: We\naim to characterize vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts written in\nSolidity, and unify existing classifications schemes. Method: We extracted 2143\nvulnerabilities from public coding platforms and popular vulnerability\ndatabases and categorized them using a card sorting approach. We targeted the\nEthereum blockchain in this paper, as it is the first and most popular\nblockchain to support the deployment of smart contracts, and Solidity as the\nmost widely used language to implement smart contracts. We devised a\nclassification scheme of smart contract vulnerabilities according to their\nerror source and impact. Afterwards, we mapped existing classification schemes\nto our classification. Results: The resulting classification consists of 11\ncategories describing the error source of a vulnerability and 13 categories\ndescribing potential impacts. Our findings show that the language specific\ncoding and the structural data flow categories are the dominant categories, but\nthat the frequency of occurrence differs substantially between the data\nsources.

            "summary": "This thesis presents techniques to investigate transactions in uncharted\ncryptocurrencies and services. Cryptocurrencies are used to securely send\npayments online. Payments via the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, use\npseudonymous addresses that have limited privacy and anonymity guarantees.\nResearch has shown that this pseudonymity can be broken, allowing users to be\ntracked using clustering and tagging heuristics. Such tracking allows crimes to\nbe investigated. If a user has coins stolen, investigators can track addresses\nto identify the destination of the coins. This, combined with an explosion in\nthe popularity of blockchain, has led to a vast increase in new coins and\nservices. These offer new features ranging from coins focused on increased\nanonymity to scams shrouded as smart contracts. In this study, we investigated\nthe extent to which transaction privacy has improved and whether users can\nstill be tracked in these new ecosystems. We began by analysing the\nprivacy-focused coin Zcash, a Bitcoin-forked cryptocurrency, that is considered\nto have strong anonymity properties due to its background in cryptographic\nresearch. We revealed that the user anonymity set can be considerably reduced\nusing heuristics based on usage patterns. Next, we analysed cross-chain\ntransactions collected from the exchange ShapeShift, revealing that users can\nbe tracked as they move across different ledgers. Finally, we present a\nmeasurement study on the smart-contract pyramid scheme Forsage, a scam that\ncycled $267 million USD (of Ethereum) within its first year, showing that at\nleast 88% of the participants in the scheme suffered a loss. The significance\nof this study is the revelation that users can be tracked in newer\ncryptocurrencies and services by using our new heuristics, which informs those\nconducting investigations and developing these technologies.",

After receiving task data, the BS allocates\ncomputational resources provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to help\nsensors perform tasks. Existing blockchain-based computation offloading schemes\nusually focus on network performance improvements, such as energy consumption\nminimization or latency minimization, and neglect the Gas fee for computation\noffloading, resulting in the dissatisfaction of high Gas providers. Also, the\nsecrecy rate during the data uploading process can not be measured by a steady\nvalue because of the time-varying characteristics of IRS-based wireless\nchannels, thereby computational resources allocation with a secrecy rate\nmeasured before data uploading is inappropriate. In this paper, we design a\nGas-oriented computation offloading scheme that guarantees a low degree of\ndissatisfaction of sensors, while reducing energy consumption. Also, we deduce\nthe ergodic secrecy rate of IRS-assisted PLS transmission that can represent\nthe global secrecy performance to allocate computational resources. The\nsimulations show that the proposed scheme has lower energy consumption compared\nto existing schemes, and ensures that the node paying higher Gas gets stronger\ncomputational resources.",

The key facilitator of Stateless\nEthereum is through the introduction of 'witnesses' into the ecosystem. The\nchanges and potential consequences that these additional data packets pose on\nthe network need to be identified and analysed to ensure that the Ethereum\necosystem can continue operating securely and efficiently. In this paper we\npropose a Bayesian Network model, a probabilistic graphical modelling approach,\nto capture the key factors and their interactions in Ethereum mainnet, the\npublic Ethereum blockchain, focussing on the changes being introduced by\nStateless Ethereum to estimate the health of the resulting Ethereum ecosystem.\nWe use a mixture of empirical data and expert knowledge, where data are\nunavailable, to quantify the model. Based on the data and expert knowledge\navailable to use at the time of modelling, the Ethereum ecosystem is expected\nto remain healthy following the introduction of Stateless Ethereum.",

We can list growing damages of data hacks, global outages and even\nthe use of data to manipulate their owners. Unfortunately, there is no\ndecentralized web where users can interact peer-to-peer in a secure way.\nBlockchains incentivize participants to individually validate every transaction\nand impose their block to the network. As a result, the validation of smart\ncontract requests is computationally intensive while the agreement on a unique\nstate does not make full use of the network. In this paper, we propose\nCollachain, a new byzantine fault tolerant blockchain compatible with the\nlargest ecosystem of DApps that leverages collaboration. First, the\npariticipants executing smart contracts collaborate to validate the\ntransactions, hence halving the number of validations required by modern\nblockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Libra). Second, the participants in the consensus\ncollaborate to combine their block proposal into a superblock, hence improving\nthroughput as the system grows to hundreds of nodes. In addition, Collachain\noffers the possibility to its users to interact securely with each other\nwithout downloading the blockchain, hence allowing interactions via mobile\ndevices. Collachain is effective at outperforming the Concord and Quorum\nblockchains and its throughput peaks at 4500 TPS under a Twitter DApp\n(Decentralized Application) workload. Finally, we demonstrate Collachain's\nscalability by deploying it on 200 nodes located in 10 countries over 5\ncontinents.",

Specifically, we first\ndesign and implement a blockchain network in our laboratory. This blockchain\nnetwork will serve two purposes, i.e., to generate the real traffic data\n(including both normal data and attack data) for our learning models and\nimplement real-time experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed\nintrusion detection framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndataset that is synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattacks in a blockchain\nnetwork. We then propose a novel collaborative learning model that allows\nefficient deployment in the blockchain network to detect attacks. The main idea\nof the proposed learning model is to enable blockchain nodes to actively\ncollect data, share the knowledge learned from its data, and then exchange the\nknowledge with other blockchain nodes in the network. In this way, we can not\nonly leverage the knowledge from all the nodes in the network but also do not\nneed to gather all raw data for training at a centralized node like\nconventional centralized learning solutions. Such a framework can also avoid\nthe risk of exposing local data's privacy as well as the excessive network\noverhead/congestion. Both intensive simulations and real-time experiments\nclearly show that our proposed collaborative learning-based intrusion detection\nframework can achieve an accuracy of up to 97.7% in detecting attacks.",

Existing permissionless blockchain-based protocols offer\nunparalleled benefits like decentralization, anonymity, and transparency.\nHowever, these protocols suffer in performance which hinders their widespread\nadoption. In particular, high time-to-finality and low transaction rates keep\nthem from replacing centralized payment systems such as the Visa network.\nPermissioned blockchain protocols offer attractive performance guarantees, but\nthey are not considered suitable for deploying decentralized cryptocurrencies\ndue to their centralized nature. Researchers have developed several\nmulti-layered blockchain protocols that combine both permissioned and\npermissionless blockchain protocols to achieve high performance along with\ndecentralization. The key idea with existing layered blockchain protocols in\nliterature is to divide blockchain operations into two layers and use different\ntypes of blockchain protocols to manage each layer. However, many such works\ncome with the assumptions of honest majority which may not accurately reflect\nthe real world where the participants may be self-interested or rational. These\nassumptions may render the protocols susceptible to security threats in the\nreal world, as highlighted by the literature focused on exploring\ngame-theoretic attacks on these protocols. We generalize the \"layered\" approach\ntaken by existing protocols in the literature and present a framework to\nanalyze the system in the BAR Model and provide a generalized game-theoretic\nanalysis of such protocols. Using our analysis, we identify the critical system\nparameters required for a distributed ledger's secure operation in a more\nrealistic setting.",

Whilst a blockchain network's deployment and evaluation are driven by\nits architecture, practitioners still need to learn and carry out many\nrepetitive and error-prone activities to transform architecture into an\noperational blockchain network and evaluate it. Greater efficiency could be\ngained if practitioners focus solely on the architecture design, a valuable and\nhard-to-automate activity, and leave the implementation steps to an automation\nframework. This paper proposes an automation framework called NVAL (Network\nDeployment and Evaluation Framework), which can deploy and evaluate blockchain\nnetworks based on their architecture specifications. The key idea of NVAL is\nreusing and combining the existing automation scripts and utilities of various\nblockchain types to deploy and evaluate incoming blockchain network\narchitectures. We propose a novel meta-model to capture blockchain network\narchitectures as computer-readable artefacts and employ a state-space search\napproach to plan and conduct their deployment and evaluation. An evaluative\ncase study shows that NVAL successfully combines seven deployment and\nevaluation procedures to deploy 65 networks with 12 different architectures and\ngenerate 295 evaluation datasets whilst incurring a negligible processing time\noverhead.",

            "summary": "Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) in Lightning Network is susceptible to a\ngriefing attack. An attacker can block several channels and stall payments by\nmounting this attack. A state-of-the-art countermeasure, Hashed Timelock\nContract with Griefing-Penalty (HTLC-GP) is found to work under the classical\nassumption of participants being either honest or malicious but fails for\nrational participants. To address the gap, we introduce a game-theoretic model\nfor analyzing griefing attacks in HTLC. We use this model to analyze griefing\nattacks in HTLC-GP and conjecture that it is impossible to design an efficient\nprotocol that will penalize a malicious participant with the current Bitcoin\nscripting system. We study the impact of the penalty on the cost of mounting\nthe attack and observe that HTLC-GP is weakly effective in disincentivizing the\nattacker in certain conditions. To further increase the cost of attack, we\nintroduce the concept of \\emph{guaranteed minimum compensation}, denoted as\n$\\zeta$, and modify HTLC-GP into $\\textrm{HTLC-GP}^{\\zeta}$. By experimenting\non several instances of Lightning Network, we observe that the total coins\nlocked in the network drops to $28\\%$ for $\\textrm{HTLC-GP}^{\\zeta}$, unlike in\nHTLC-GP where total coins locked does not drop below $40\\%$. These results\njustify that $\\textrm{HTLC-GP}^{\\zeta}$ is better than HTLC-GP to counter\ngriefing attacks.",

In the quest\nfor a decentralized, scalable blockchain fabric, i.e., to offer the scalability\nof permissioned blockchain in a permissionless setting, we present L4L to\nencourage decentralization over the permissioned Libra network without\ncompromising its sustainability. L4L employs delay towers, -- puzzle towers\nthat leverage verifiable delay functions -- for establishing identity in a\npermissionless setting. Delay towers cannot be parallelized due to their\nsequential execution, making them an eco-friendly alternative. We also discuss\nmethodologies to replace validators participating in consensus to promote\ncompliant behavior.

            "summary": "In this paper, we study a new latency optimization problem for\nblockchain-based federated learning (BFL) in multi-server edge computing. In\nthis system model, distributed mobile devices (MDs) communicate with a set of\nedge servers (ESs) to handle both machine learning (ML) model training and\nblock mining simultaneously. To assist the ML model training for\nresource-constrained MDs, we develop an offloading strategy that enables MDs to\ntransmit their data to one of the associated ESs. We then propose a new\ndecentralized ML model aggregation solution at the edge layer based on a\nconsensus mechanism to build a global ML model via peer-to-peer (P2P)-based\nblockchain communications. Blockchain builds trust among MDs and ESs to\nfacilitate reliable ML model sharing and cooperative consensus formation, and\nenables rapid elimination of manipulated models caused by poisoning attacks. We\nformulate latency-aware BFL as an optimization aiming to minimize the system\nlatency via joint consideration of the data offloading decisions, MDs' transmit\npower, channel bandwidth allocation for MDs' data offloading, MDs'\ncomputational allocation, and hash power allocation. Given the mixed action\nspace of discrete offloading and continuous allocation variables, we propose a\nnovel deep reinforcement learning scheme with a parameterized advantage actor\ncritic algorithm. We theoretically characterize the convergence properties of\nBFL in terms of the aggregation delay, mini-batch size, and number of P2P\ncommunication rounds. Our numerical evaluation demonstrates the superiority of\nour proposed scheme over baselines in terms of model training efficiency,\nconvergence rate, system latency, and robustness against model poisoning\nattacks.",

However,\nthe anonymization of blockchain hinders market regulation, resulting in\nincreasing illegal activities such as money laundering, gambling and phishing\nfraud on blockchain financial platforms. Thus, financial security has become a\ntop priority in the blockchain ecosystem, calling for effective market\nregulation. In this paper, we consider identifying Ethereum accounts from a\ngraph classification perspective, and propose an end-to-end graph neural\nnetwork framework named Ethident, to characterize the behavior patterns of\naccounts and further achieve account de-anonymization. Specifically, we first\nconstruct an Account Interaction Graph (AIG) using raw Ethereum data. Then we\ndesign a hierarchical graph attention encoder named HGATE as the backbone of\nour framework, which can effectively characterize the node-level account\nfeatures and subgraph-level behavior patterns. For alleviating account label\nscarcity, we further introduce contrastive self-supervision mechanism as\nregularization to jointly train our framework. Comprehensive experiments on\nEthereum datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance\nin account identification, yielding 1.13% ~ 4.93% relative improvement over\nprevious state-of-the-art. Furthermore, detailed analyses illustrate the\neffectiveness of Ethident in identifying and understanding the behavior of\nknown participants in Ethereum (e.g. exchanges, miners, etc.), as well as that\nof the lawbreakers (e.g. phishing scammers, hackers, etc.), which may aid in\nrisk assessment and market regulation.",

            "summary": "Blockchain was always associated with Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and digital\nasset trading. However, its benefits are far beyond that. It supports\ntechnologies like the Internet-of-Things (IoT) to pave the way for futuristic\nsmart environments, like smart homes, smart transportation, smart energy\ntrading, smart industries, smart supply chains, and more. To enable these\nenvironments, IoT devices, machines, appliances, and vehicles, need to\nintercommunicate without the need for centralized trusted parties. Blockchain\nreplaces these trusted parties in such trustless environments. It provides\nsecurity enforcement, privacy assurance, authentication, and other key features\nto IoT ecosystems. Besides IoT-Blockchain integration, other technologies add\nmore benefits that attract the research community. Software-Defined Networking\n(SDN), Fog, Edge, and Cloud Computing technologies, for example, play a key\nrole in enabling realistic IoT applications. Moreover, the integration of\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) provides smart, dynamic, and autonomous\ndecision-making capabilities for IoT devices in smart environments. To push the\nresearch further in this domain, we provide in this paper a comprehensive\nsurvey that includes state-of-the-art technological integration, challenges,\nand solutions for smart environments, and the role of these technologies as the\nbuilding blocks of such smart environments. We also demonstrate how the level\nof integration between these technologies has increased over the years, which\nbrings us closer to the futuristic view of smart environments. We further\ndiscuss the current need to provide general-purpose Blockchain platforms that\ncan adapt to unique design requirements of different applications and\nsolutions. Finally, we provide a simplified architecture of futuristic smart\nenvironments that integrate these technologies, showing the advantage of such\nintegration.",

            "summary": "E-governance is a process that aims to enhance a government's ability to\nsimplify all the processes that may involve government, citizens, businesses,\nand so on. The rapid evolution of digital technologies has often created the\nnecessity for the establishment of an e-Governance model. There is often a need\nfor an inclusive e-governance model with integrated multiactor governance\nservices and where a single market approach can be adopted. e-Governance often\naims to minimise bureaucratic processes, while at the same time including a\ndigital-by-default approach to public services. This aims at administrative\nefficiency and the reduction of bureaucratic processes. It can also improve\ngovernment capabilities, and enhances trust and security, which brings\nconfidence in governmental transactions. However, solid implementations of a\ndistributed data sharing model within an e-governance architecture is far from\na reality; hence, citizens of European countries often go through the tedious\nprocess of having their confidential information verified. This paper focuses\non the sinGLe sign-on e-GovernAnce Paradigm based on a distributed\nfile-exchange network for security, transparency, cost-effectiveness and trust\n(GLASS) model, which aims to ensure that a citizen can control their\nrelationship with governmental agencies. The paper thus proposes an approach\nthat integrates a permissioned blockchain with the InterPlanetary File System\n(IPFS). This method demonstrates how we may encrypt and store verifiable\ncredentials of the GLASS ecosystem, such as academic awards, ID documents and\nso on, within IPFS in a secure manner and thus only allow trusted users to read\na blockchain record, and obtain the encryption key. This allows for the\ndecryption of a given verifiable credential that stored on IPFS. This paper\noutlines the creation of a demonstrator that proves the principles of the GLASS\napproach.",

            "summary": "The blockchain-based smart contract lacks privacy since the contract state\nand instruction code are exposed to the public. Combining smart-contract\nexecution with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provides an efficient\nsolution, called TEE-assisted smart contracts, for protecting the\nconfidentiality of contract states. However, the combination approaches are\nvaried, and a systematic study is absent. Newly released systems may fail to\ndraw upon the experience learned from existing protocols, such as repeating\nknown design mistakes or applying TEE technology in insecure ways. In this\npaper, we first investigate and categorize the existing systems into two types:\nthe layer-one solution and layer-two solution. Then, we establish an analysis\nframework to capture their common lights, covering the desired properties (for\ncontract services), threat models, and security considerations (for underlying\nsystems). Based on our taxonomy, we identify their ideal functionalities and\nuncover the fundamental flaws and reasons for the challenges in each\nspecification design. We believe that this work would provide a guide for the\ndevelopment of TEE-assisted smart contracts, as well as a framework to evaluate\nfuture TEE-assisted confidential contract systems.",

            "summary": "Metaverse depicts a vista of constructing a virtual environment parallel to\nthe real world so people can communicate with others and objects through\ndigital entities. In the real world, communication relies on identities and\naddresses that are recognized by authorities, no matter the link is established\nvia post, email, mobile phone, or landline. Metaverse, however, is different\nfrom the real world, which requires a single identity belongs to the\nindividual. This identity can be an encrypted virtual address in the metaverse\nbut no one can trace or verify it. In order to achieve such addresses to hide\nindividuals in the metaverse, re-mapping the virtual address to the\nindividual's identity and a specific spectrum to support the address-based\ncommunication for the metaverse are needed. Therefore, metaverse native or\nmeta-native communications based on blockchain could be a promising solution to\ndirectly connect entities with their native encrypted addresses that gets rid\nof the existing network services based on IP, cellular, HTTP, etc. This paper\nproposes a vision of blockchain, encrypted address and address-based access\nmodel for all users, devices, services, etc. to contribute to the metaverse.\nFurthermore, the allocation architecture of a designated spectrum for the\nmetaverse is proposed to remove the barrier to access to the\nmetaverse/blockchain in response to the initiatives of metaverse and\ndecentralized Internet.",

Many programming abstractions (e.g.,\nconcurrent objects, transactional memory, etc.) simplify matters, but still\ninvolve intricate engineering. We argue that some difficulty of multicore\nprogramming can be meliorated through a declarative programming style in which\nprogrammers directly express the independence of fragments of sequential\nprograms.\n  In our proposed paradigm, programmers write programs in a familiar,\nsequential manner, with the added ability to explicitly express the conditions\nunder which code fragments sequentially commute. Putting such commutativity\nconditions into source code offers a new entry point for a compiler to exploit\nthe known connection between commutativity and parallelism. We give a semantics\nfor the programmer's sequential perspective and, under a correctness condition,\nfind that a compiler-transformed parallel execution is equivalent to the\nsequential semantics. Serializability/linearizability are not the right fit for\nthis condition, so we introduce scoped serializability and show how it can be\nenforced with lock synthesis techniques.\n  We next describe a technique for automatically verifying and synthesizing\ncommute conditions via a new reduction from our commute blocks to logical\nspecifications, upon which symbolic commutativity reasoning can be performed.\nWe implemented our work in a new language called Veracity, implemented in\nMulticore OCaml. We show that commutativity conditions can be automatically\ngenerated across a variety of new benchmark programs, confirm the expectation\nthat concurrency speedups can be seen as the computation increases, and apply\nour work to a small in-memory filesystem and an adaptation of a crowdfund\nblockchain smart contract.",

However, in an environment with non-negligible\ntransaction cost, e.g., public blockchains, high or unexpected transaction cost\nmight be an obstacle for wide-spread adoption of fair exchange protocols in\nbusiness applications. For example, as of 2021-12-17, the initialization of the\nFairSwap protocol on the Ethereum blockchain requires the selling party to pay\na fee of approx. 349.20 USD per exchange. We address this issue by defining\ncost fairness, which can be used to assess two-party exchange protocols\nincluding implied transaction cost. We show that in an environment with\nnon-negligible transaction cost where one party has to initialize the exchange\nprotocol and the other party can leave the exchange at any time cost fairness\ncannot be achieved.",

In order to address these issues,\none can use a collection of tools ranging from auditing to formal methods. We\nuse formal verification and provide the first formalisation of a DeFi contract\nin a foundational proof assistant capturing contract interactions. We focus on\nDexter2, a decentralized, non-custodial exchange for the Tezos network similar\nto Uniswap on Ethereum. The Dexter implementation consists of several smart\ncontracts. This poses unique challenges for formalisation due to the complex\ncontract interactions. Our formalisation includes proofs of functional\ncorrectness with respect to an informal specification for the contracts\ninvolved in Dexter's implementation. Moreover, our formalisation is the first\nto feature proofs of safety properties of the interacting smart contracts of a\ndecentralized exchange. We have extracted our contract from Coq into CameLIGO\ncode, so it can be deployed on the Tezos blockchain. Uniswap and Dexter are\nparadigmatic for a collection of similar contracts. Our methodology thus allows\nus to implement and verify DeFi applications featuring similar interaction\npatterns.",

Due to the inconvenience of the deployment of large-scale\nblockchains, blockchain simulators are used to facilitate blockchain design and\nimplementation. We evaluate state-of-the-art simulators applied to both Bitcoin\nand Ethereum and find that they suffer from low performance and scalability\nwhich are significant limitations. To build a more general and faster\nblockchain simulator, we extend an existing blockchain simulator, i.e.\nBlockSim. We add a network module integrated with a network topology generation\nalgorithm and a block propagation algorithm to generate a realistic blockchain\nnetwork and simulate the block propagation efficiently. We design a binary\ntransaction pool structure and migrate BlockSim from Python to C++ so that\nbitwise operations can be used to accelerate the simulation and reduce memory\nusage. Moreover, we modularize the simulator based on five primary blockchain\nprocesses. Significant blockchain elements including consensus protocols (PoW\nand PoS), information propagation algorithms (Gossip) and finalization rules\n(Longest rule and GHOST rule) are implemented in individual modules and can be\ncombined flexibly to simulate different types of blockchains. Experiments\ndemonstrate that the new simulator reduces the simulation time by an order of\nmagnitude and improves scalability, enabling us to simulate more than ten\nthousand nodes, roughly the size of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

            "summary": "Tangle is a distributed ledger technology that stores data as a directed\nacyclic graph (DAG). Unlike blockchain, Tangle does not require dedicated\nminers for its operation; this makes Tangle suitable for Internet of Things\n(IoT) applications. Distributed ledgers have a built-in transaction rate\ncontrol mechanism to prevent congestion and spamming; this is typically\nachieved by increasing or decreasing the proof of work (PoW) difficulty level\nbased on the number of users. Unfortunately, this simplistic mechanism gives an\nunfair advantage to users with high computing power. This paper proposes a\nprincipal-agent problem (PAP) framework from microeconomics to control the\ntransaction rate in Tangle. With users as agents and the transaction rate\ncontroller as the principal, we design a truth-telling mechanism to assign PoW\ndifficulty levels to agents as a function of their computing power. The\nsolution of the PAP is achieved by compensating a higher PoW difficulty level\nwith a larger weight/reputation for the transaction. The mechanism has two\nbenefits, (1) the security of Tangle is increased as agents are incentivized to\nperform difficult PoW, and (2) the rate of new transactions is moderated in\nTangle. The solution of PAP is obtained by solving a mixed-integer optimization\nproblem. We show that the optimal solution of the PAP increases with the\ncomputing power of agents. The structural results reduce the search space of\nthe mixed-integer program and enable efficient computation of the optimal\nmechanism. Finally, via numerical examples, we illustrate the transaction rate\ncontrol mechanism and study its impact on the dynamics of Tangle.",

These parallel chains achieve consensus among one\nanother on a limited set of core operations, while allowing each on-chain\napplication to manage its own data independently of others.\n  This architecture addresses the scalability issues of traditional linear\nblockchains, but requires novel consensus mechanisms. A central feature of the\nPhilos consensus mechanism is its trust algorithm, which assigns each network\nnode a numerical trust value (or score) indicating the quality of recent past\nperformance.\n  This trust value is then used to determine a node's voting weight at the\nhigher levels of consensus. In this paper, we formally define the Philos trust\nalgorithm, and provide several illustrations of its operation, both\ntheoretically and empirically. We also ask whether a misbehaving node can\nstrategically exploit the algorithm for its personal gain, and show that this\ntype of exploitation can be universally prevented simply by enforcing a mild\nlimit on the number of participants in each of the parallel chains.",

Blockchain technologies have emerged as a potential\nsolution to address identity management and secure data aggregation and\ncontrol. However, the vast majority of works to date utilize Ethereum and smart\ncontracts that are not scalable or well suited for industrial applications.\nThis paper presents what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nintegration of ROS 2 with the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. With a framework\nthat leverages Fabric smart contracts and ROS 2 through a Go application, we\ndelve into the potential of using blockchain for controlling robots, and\ngathering and processing their data. We demonstrate the applicability of the\nproposed framework to an inventory management use-case where different robots\nare used to detect objects of interest in a given area. Designed to meet the\nrequirements of distributed robotic systems, we show that the performance of\nthe robots is not impacted significantly by the blockchain layer. At the same\ntime, we provide examples for developing other applications that integrate\nFabric smart contracts with ROS 2. Our results pave the way for further\nadoption of blockchain technologies in autonomous robotic systems for building\ntrustable data sharing.",

In this paper, we present the first economically autonomous\nrobot -- a robot able to produce marketable goods while having full control\nover the use of its generated income. Gaka-chu (\"painter\" in Japanese) is a\n6-axis robot arm that creates paintings of Japanese characters from an\nautoselected keyword. By using a blockchain-based smart contract, Gaka-chu can\nautonomously list a painting it made for sale in an online auction. In this\ntransaction, the robot interacts with the human bidders as a peer not as a\ntool. Using the blockchain-based smart contract, Gaka-chu can then use its\nincome from selling paintings to replenish its resources by autonomously\nordering materials from an online art shop. We built the Gaka-chu prototype\nwith an Ethereum-based smart contract and ran a 6-month long experiment, during\nwhich the robot created and sold four paintings, simultaneously using its\nincome to purchase supplies and repay initial investors. In this work, we\npresent the results of the experiments conducted and discuss the implications\nof economically autonomous robots.",

To clarify who is\nliable for the product, the fabricator should keep the fabrication history in\nan immutable and sustainably accessible manner. In this paper, we propose a new\nscheme, \"Fabchain,\" that can record the fabrication history in such a manner.\nBy utilizing a scheme that employs a blockchain as an audit-able communication\nchannel, Fabchain manages print jobs for the fabricator's 3D printer over the\nblockchain, while maintaining a history of a print job. We implemented Fabchain\non Ethereum and evaluated the performance for recording a print job. Our\nresults demonstrate that Fabchain can complete communication of a print job\nsequence in less than 1 minute on the Ethereum test network. We conclude that\nFabchain can manage a print job in a reasonable duration for 3D printing, while\nsatisfying the requirements for immutability and sustainability.",

It\nfocuses on the security property of access control for SCRIPT programs that\ngovern the distribution of Bitcoins. It advocates that weakest preconditions in\nthe context of Hoare triples are the appropriate notion for verifying access\ncontrol. It aims at obtaining human-readable descriptions of weakest\npreconditions in order to close the validation gap between user requirements\nand formal specification of smart contracts.\n  As examples for the proposed approach, the paper focuses on two standard\nSCRIPT programs that govern the distribution of Bitcoins, Pay to Public Key\nHash (P2PKH) and Pay to Multisig (P2MS). The paper introduces an operational\nsemantics of the SCRIPT commands used in P2PKH and P2MS, which is formalised in\nthe Agda proof assistant and reasoned about using Hoare triples. Two\nmethodologies for obtaining human-readable descriptions of weakest\npreconditions are discussed:\n  (1) a step-by-step approach, which works backwards instruction by instruction\nthrough a script, sometimes grouping several instructions together;\n  (2) symbolic execution of the code and translation into a nested case\ndistinction, which allows to read off weakest preconditions as the disjunction\nof conjunctions of conditions along accepting paths.\n  A syntax for equational reasoning with Hoare Triples is defined in order to\nformalise those approaches in Agda.\n  Keywords and phrases: Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Bitcoin; Agda;\nVerification; Hoare logic; Bitcoin script; P2PKH; P2MS; Access control; Weakest\nprecondition; Predicate transformer semantics; Provable correctness; Symbolic\nexecution; Smart contracts",

            "summary": "Invoice factoring is an invoice financing process where business\norganizations sell their invoices to banks or financial institutions at a\ndiscount to gain faster access to the invoice amount. In global trade, ocean\nand land carriers exercise invoice factoring to gain quick access to the money\nthey get paid for the shipment of consignments by shippers. Shippers typically\nclear the invoice payment within 60-90 days of goods getting delivered. In\norder to get early access to capital, carriers initiate invoice factoring after\nthe completion of goods delivery to the shipper. In this work, we provide an\napproach to enable accelerated carrier invoice factoring even before the\ndelivery of goods. Carrier invoice value for a given shipment depends on the\nactual values of shipment tracking events. We predict the carrier invoice value\nat different freight transport milestone events as the goods transportation\nprogresses from supplier to shipper using smart contracts on a blockchain\nnetwork that is operated by the global trade logistics participants. The\nprediction at a given stage is based on past shipment tracking events and\npredicted future shipment tracking events. Accurate prediction of invoice value\nfor ongoing shipment enables the carrier organization to initiate invoice\nfactoring on the trade finance network before the completion of goods delivery\nto the shipper. Further, based on the past accuracy of prediction models, the\nfinancial institutions may choose to release the invoice amount in installments\nat different freight transportation milestone events.",

After\nreceiving task data, the SBS allocates computational resources to help sensors\nperform the task. The existing computation offloading schemes usually focus on\nnetwork performance improvement, such as energy consumption minimization, and\nneglect the Gas fee paid by sensors, resulting in the discontent of high Gas\npayers. Here, we design a Gas-oriented computation offloading scheme that\nguarantees the degree of satisfaction of sensors, while aiming to reduce energy\nconsumption. Also, we deduce the ergodic secrecy rate of IRS-assisted PLS\ntransmission that can represent the global secrecy performance to allocate\ncomputational resources. The simulations show that the proposed scheme ensures\nthat the node paying higher Gas gets stronger computational resources, and just\nraises $4\\%$ energy consumption in comparison with energy consumption\nminimization schemes.",

In this review,\nwe describe the studies on the current privacy policies of fitness app\nproviders, heuristically evaluate the methods for consent management by fitness\nproviders, summarize the gaps identified in our review of these studies, and\ndiscuss potential solutions for filling the gaps identified. We have identified\nfour main problems related to preserving the privacy of users of fitness apps:\nlack of system transparency, lack of privacy policy legibility, concerns\nregarding one-time consent, and issues of noncompliance regarding consent\nmanagement.

            "summary": "Ethereum Smart Contracts based on Blockchain Technology (BT) enables monetary\ntransactions among peers on a blockchain network independent of a central\nauthorizing agency. Ethereum Smart Contracts are programs that are deployed as\ndecentralized applications, having the building blocks of the blockchain\nconsensus protocol. This enables consumers to make agreements in a transparent\nand conflict-free environment. However, there exist some security\nvulnerabilities within these smart contracts that are a potential threat to the\napplications and their consumers and have shown in the past to cause huge\nfinancial losses. This paper presents a framework and empirical analysis that\nuse code clone detection techniques for identifying vulnerabilities and their\nvariations in smart contracts. Our empirical analysis is conducted using the\nNicad code clone detection tool on a dataset of approximately 50k Ethereum\nsmart contracts. We evaluated VOLCANO on two datasets, one with confirmed\nvulnerabilities and another with approximately 50k random smart contracts\ncollected from the Etherscan. Our approach shows an improvement in the\ndetection of vulnerabilities in terms of coverage and efficiency when compared\nto two of the publicly available static analyzers to detect vulnerabilities in\nsmart contracts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that\nuses a clone detection technique to identify vulnerabilities and their\nevolution in Ethereum smart contracts.",

Citizens are locked into big-tech for personal\ndata storage and their for-profit digital identity. Protection of data has\nproven to be essential, especially due to increased home Internet traffic\nduring the COVID pandemic. Citizens do not possess their own travel documents.\nThe European Commission aims to transition this governmental property towards\nself-sovereign identity, introducing many new opportunities. Citizens are\nlocked into banks with non-portable IBAN accounts and unsustainable legacy\nbanking infrastructures. Migration to all-digital low-fraud infrastructures and\nhealthier competitive ecosystems is essential. The overall challenge is to\nreturn the power to citizens and users again. The transition to a more\ndecentralized Internet is the first crucial step in the realization of\nuser-centricity. This thesis presents the first exploratory study that\nintegrates governmental-issued travel documents into a (decentralized) societal\ninfrastructure. These self-sovereign identities form the authentic base to a\nprivate and secure transfer of money and data, and can effectively provide\ntrust in authenticity that is currently missing in online conversations.

Existing solutions are either impractical as they do not\nsupport many complex real-world contracts or leave the burden to developers for\nfixing bugs. In this paper, we propose the first practical smart contract\ncompiler, called HCC, which automatically inserts security hardening checks at\nthe source-code level. HCC develops a code property graph (CPG) to model\ncontrol-flows and data-flows of a given smart contract. Due to the CPG\nnotation, HCC can be applied to various smart contract platforms and\nprogramming languages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on\nEthereum's Solidity smart contracts and show that it efficiently mitigates\nreentrancy and integer bugs. We also show how to integrate HCC within other\nblockchain platforms such as Hyperledger Fabric. Our evaluation on 10k\nreal-world contracts demonstrates that HCC is highly practical and effective.",

In the model, we used Hyperledger Fabric as\na blockchain platform for storing the access control policies and provided\nseveral functions for effective role management. In addition, we presented an\naccess control scheme for cloud storage data by combining the proposed model\nand the verification mechanism for the user's ownership of a role and analyzed\nthe security properties of the scheme.

            "summary": "In the last few years, electric utility companies have increasingly invested\ninto transactive energy systems. This trend was primarily caused by the\nintegration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and internet-of-things (IoT)\ndevices into their existing distribution networks. Influenced by the general\ninterest in blockchain technologies, many industry specialists are considering\nnew, more efficient peer-to-peer market structures for DERs. Since\nblockchain-based energy exchanges can automate transactions between their\nmembers and provide increased levels of security thanks to smart contracts,\nthese new initiatives may eventually revolutionize how customers interact with\nutility companies. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between cost and\ntraceability in the form of on-chain and off-chain solutions. We also propose\nZipZap, a first step towards a blockchain-based local smart grid system. ZipZap\nis an ERC-1155 compliant solution with four different prototypes: Heavyweight,\nFeatherweight, Lightweight and Weightless. The first three prototypes were\ndeveloped in Solidity and deployed using Ethereum. Heavyweight is fully\non-chain, whereas Featherweight and Lightweight showcase various levels of\nhybridization. Weightless, in turn, was deployed using Quorum, a gas-free\nalternative to Ethereum. Our evaluation uses realistic parameters and measures\nthe impact of different types of metadata storage scopes, with some Ethereum\nprototypes showcasing gas cost reductions of more than 97% in comparison to our\nfully on-chain baseline.",

We propose a new paradigm for designing BFT protocols\ncalled DQBFT that addresses three major performance and scalability challenges\nthat plague past protocols: (i) high communication costs to reach\ngeo-distributed agreement, (ii) uneven resource utilization hampering\nperformance, and (iii) performance degradation under varying node and network\nconditions and high-contention workloads. Specifically, DQBFT divides consensus\ninto two parts: 1) durable command replication without a global order, and 2)\nconsistent global ordering of commands across all replicas. DQBFT achieves this\nby decentralizing the heavy task of replicating commands while centralizing the\nordering process.\n  Under the new paradigm, we develop a new protocol, Destiny that uses a\ncombination of three techniques to achieve high performance and scalability:\nusing a trusted subsystem to decrease consensus's quorum size, using threshold\nsignatures to attain linear communication costs, reducing client communication.\nOur evaluations on 300-replica geo-distributed deployment reveal that DQBFT\nprotocols achieve significant performance gains over prior art: $\\approx$3x\nbetter throughput and $\\approx$50\\% better latency.",

This atomic swap problem has been well-studied, with the Hash Time\nLocked Contract (HTLC) emerging as a canonical solution. HTLC ensures atomicity\nof exchange, albeit with caveats for node failure and timeliness of claims. But\na bigger limitation of HTLC is that it only applies to a model consisting of\ntwo adversarial parties having sole ownership of a single asset in each ledger.\nRealistic extensions of the model in which assets may be jointly owned by\nmultiple parties, all of whose consents are required for exchanges, or where\nmultiple assets must be exchanged for one, are susceptible to collusion attacks\nand hence cannot be handled by HTLC. In this paper, we generalize the model of\nasset exchanges across DLT networks and present a taxonomy of use cases,\ndescribe the threat model, and propose MPHTLC, an augmented HTLC protocol for\natomic multi-owner-and-asset exchanges. We analyze the correctness, safety, and\napplication scope of MPHTLC. As proof-of-concept, we show how MPHTLC primitives\ncan be implemented in networks built on Hyperledger Fabric and Corda, and how\nMPHTLC can be implemented in the Hyperledger Labs Weaver framework by\naugmenting its existing HTLC protocol.",

            "summary": "Wearable fitness devices are widely used to track an individual's health and\nphysical activities to improve the quality of health services. These devices\nsense a considerable amount of sensitive data processed by a centralized third\nparty. While many researchers have thoroughly evaluated privacy issues\nsurrounding wearable fitness trackers, no study has addressed privacy issues in\ntrackers by giving control of the data to the user. Blockchain is an emerging\ntechnology with outstanding advantages in resolving consent management privacy\nconcerns. As there are no fully transparent, legally compliant solutions for\nsharing personal fitness data, this study introduces an architecture for a\nhuman-centric, legally compliant, decentralized and dynamic consent system\nbased on blockchain and smart contracts. Algorithms and sequence diagrams of\nthe proposed system's activities show consent-related data flow among various\nagents, which are used later to prove the system's trustworthiness by\nformalizing the security requirements. The security properties of the proposed\nsystem were evaluated using the formal security modeling framework SeMF, which\ndemonstrates the feasibility of the solution at an abstract level based on\nformal language theory. As a result, we have empirically proven that blockchain\ntechnology is suitable for mitigating the privacy issues of fitness providers\nby recording individuals' consent using blockchain and smart contracts.",

            "summary": "Easy access to data is one of the main avenues to accelerate scientific\nresearch. As a key element of scientific innovations, data sharing allows the\nreproduction of results, helps prevent data fabrication, falsification, and\nmisuse. Although the research benefits from data reuse are widely acknowledged,\nthe data collections existing today are still kept in silos. Indeed, monitoring\nwhat happens to data once they have been handed to a third party is currently\nnot feasible within the current data-sharing practices. We propose a\nblockchain-based system to trace data collections, and potentially create a\nmore trustworthy data sharing process. In this paper, we present the LUCE\n(License accoUntability and CompliancE) architecture as a decentralized\nblockchain-based platform supporting data sharing and reuse. LUCE is designed\nto provide full transparency on what happens to the data after they are shared\nwith third parties. The contributions of this work are: the definition of a\ngeneric model and an implementation for decentralized data sharing\naccountability and compliance and to incorporates dynamic consent and legal\ncompliance mechanisms. We test the scalability of the platform in a real-time\nenvironment where a growing number of users access and reuse different\ndatasets. Compared to existing data-sharing solutions, LUCE provides\ntransparency over data sharing practices, enables data reuse and supports\nregulatory requirements. The experimentation shows that the platform can be\nscaled for a large number of users.",

            "summary": "Blockchain is an essentially distributed database recording all transactions\nor digital events among participating parties. Each transaction in the records\nis approved and verified by consensus of the participants in the system that\nrequires solving a hard mathematical puzzle, which is known as proof-of-work.\nTo make the approved records immutable, the mathematical puzzle is not trivial\nto solve and therefore consumes substantial computing resources. However, it is\nenergy-wasteful to have many computational nodes installed in the blockchain\ncompeting to approve the records by just solving a meaningless puzzle. Here, we\npose proof-of-work as a reinforcement-learning problem by modeling the\nblockchain growing as a Markov decision process, in which a learning agent\nmakes an optimal decision over the environment's state, whereas a new block is\nadded and verified. Specifically, we design the block verification and\nconsensus mechanism as a deep reinforcement-learning iteration process. As a\nresult, our method utilizes the determination of state transition and the\nrandomness of action selection of a Markov decision process, as well as the\ncomputational complexity of a deep neural network, collectively to make the\nblocks not easy to recompute and to preserve the order of transactions, while\nthe blockchain nodes are exploited to train the same deep neural network with\ndifferent data samples (state-action pairs) in parallel, allowing the model to\nexperience multiple episodes across computing nodes but at one time.

While the majority of crypto-assets do not\nhave intrinsic yields in and of themselves, similar to cash holdings of fiat\ncurrency, revolutionary innovation based on smart contracts, which enable\ndecentralised finance, does generate return. Examples include lending or\nproviding liquidity to an automated market maker on a decentralised exchange,\nas well as performing block formation in a proof of stake blockchain. On\ncentralised exchanges, perpetual and finite duration futures can trade at a\npremium or discount to the spot market for extended periods with one side of\nthe transaction earning a yield. Disparities in yield exist between products\nand venues as a result of market segmentation and risk profile differences.\nCryptofinance was initially shunned by legacy finance and developed\nindependently. This led to curious and imaginative adaptions, reminiscent of\nDarwin's finches, including stable coins for dollar transfers, perpetuals for\nleverage, and a new class of exchanges for trading and investment.",

            "summary": "As the confidentiality and scalability of smart contracts have become a\ncrucial demand of blockchains, off-chain contract execution frameworks have\nbeen promising. Some have recently expanded off-chain contracts to Multi-Party\nComputation (MPC), which seek to transition the on-chain states by off-chain\nMPC. The most general problem among these solutions is MPT, since its off-chain\nMPC takes on- and off-chain inputs, delivers on- and off-chain outputs, and can\nbe publicly verified by the blockchain, thus capable of covering more\nscenarios. However, existing Multi-Party Transaction (MPT) solutions lack at\nleast one of data availability, financial fairness, delivery fairness, and\ndelivery atomicity. These properties are crucially valued by communities, e.g.,\nthe Ethereum community, or users. Even worse, these solutions require high-cost\ninteractions between the blockchain and off-chain systems.\n  This paper proposes a novel MPT-enabled off-chain contract execution\nframework, DECLOAK. DECLOAK is the first to achieve data availability of MPT,\nand our method can apply to other fields that seek to persist user data\non-chain. Moreover, DECLOAK solves all mentioned shortcomings with even lower\ngas costs and weaker assumptions. Specifically, DECLOAK tolerates all but one\nByzantine party and TEE executors. Evaluating on 10 MPTs, DECLOAK reduces the\ngas cost of the SOTA, Cloak, by 65.6%. Consequently, we are the first to not\nonly achieve such level secure MPT in practical assumption, but also\ndemonstrate that evaluating MPT in the comparable gas cost to normal Ethereum\ntransaction is possible. And the cost superiority of DECLOAK increases as the\nnumber of MPT parties grows.",

By\nextracting the spot and futures daily prices as well as the maturity, trading\nvolume and open interest data for the three assets from 18th December 2017 to\n30th November 2021, we find a positive and significant role for trading volume\nand a possible negative influence of open interest, when significant, in\nshaping the volatility in all three assets, supporting earlier findings in the\ncontext of oil futures. Additionally, we find maturity has a relatively\npositive significance for bitcoin and oil futures price volatility.\nFurthermore, our analysis demonstrates that maturity affects the basis of\nbitcoin and gold positively -- confirming the general theory that the basis\nconverges to zero as maturity nears for bitcoin and gold -- while oil is\naffected in both directions.",

            "summary": "In recent years blockchain technology has received tremendous attention.\nBlockchain users are known by a changeable Public Key (PK) that introduces a\nlevel of anonymity, however, studies have shown that anonymized transactions\ncan be linked to deanonymize the users. Most of the existing studies on user\nde-anonymization focus on monetary applications, however, blockchain has\nreceived extensive attention in non-monetary applications like IoT. In this\npaper we study the impact of de-anonymization on IoT-based blockchain. We\npopulate a blockchain with data of smart home devices and then apply machine\nlearning algorithms in an attempt to classify transactions to a particular\ndevice that in turn risks the privacy of the users. Two types of attack models\nare defined: (i) informed attacks: where attackers know the type of devices\ninstalled in a smart home, and (ii) blind attacks: where attackers do not have\nthis information. We show that machine learning algorithms can successfully\nclassify the transactions with 90% accuracy. To enhance the anonymity of the\nusers, we introduce multiple obfuscation methods which include combining\nmultiple packets into a transaction, merging ledgers of multiple devices, and\ndelaying transactions. The implementation results show that these obfuscation\nmethods significantly reduce the attack success rates to 20% to 30% and thus\nenhance user privacy.",

To fill\nthis gap, we are the first to conduct a systematic investigation on the EOSIO\ntoken ecosystem by conducting a comprehensive graph analysis on the entire\non-chain EOSIO data (nearly 135 million blocks). We construct token creator\ngraphs, token-contract creator graphs, token holder graphs, and token transfer\ngraphs to characterize token creators, holders, and transfer activities.\nThrough graph analysis, we have obtained many insightful findings and observed\nsome abnormal trading patterns.

This paper's code contains Jupyter notebooks,\none of which outputs a timeseries graph of any cryptocurrency price once a CSV\nfile of the historical data is inputted into the program. Another Jupyter\nnotebook trains an LSTM, or a long short-term memory model, to predict a\ncryptocurrency's closing price. The LSTM is fed the close price, which is the\nprice that the currency has at the end of the day, so it can learn from those\nvalues. The notebook creates two sets: a training set and a test set to assess\nthe accuracy of the results.\n  The data is then normalized using manual min-max scaling so that the model\ndoes not experience any bias; this also enhances the performance of the model.\nThen, the model is trained using three layers -- an LSTM, dropout, and dense\nlayer-minimizing the loss through 50 epochs of training; from this training, a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) is produced and fitted to the training set.\nAdditionally, a graph of the loss over each epoch is produced, with the loss\nminimizing over time. Finally, the notebook plots a line graph of the actual\ncurrency price in red and the predicted price in blue. The process is then\nrepeated for several more cryptocurrencies to compare prediction models. The\nparameters for the LSTM, such as number of epochs and batch size, are tweaked\nto try and minimize the root mean square error.",

In current Bitcoin, block reward is halved every\nfour years, and transaction fees are expected to become the majority of miner\nrevenues around 2140. When transaction fee dominates mining rewards, strategic\ndeviations such as Selfish Mining, Undercutting, and Mining Gap could threaten\nthe integrity and security of the Blockchain. This paper proposes a set of\nDynamic Transaction Storage (DTS) strategies for maintaining a sustainable\nBlockchain under the transaction-fee regime. We demonstrate that block\nincentive volatility can be reduced through systematic simulation by applying\nDTS strategies and avoiding strategic deviations. With DTS, public Blockchains\nsuch as Bitcoin become sustainable when the mining reward is solely based on\nthe transaction fee.",

            "summary": "Contact tracing has been proven an effective approach to control the virus\nspread in pandemics like COVID-19 pandemic. As an emerging powerful\ndecentralized technique, blockchain has been explored to ensure data privacy\nand security in contact tracing processes. However, existing works are mostly\nhigh-level designs with no sufficient demonstration and treat blockchain as\nseparate storage system assisting third-party central servers, ignoring the\nimportance and capability of consensus mechanism and incentive mechanism. In\nthis paper, we propose a light-weight and fully third-party free\nBlockchain-Driven Contact Tracing framework (BDCT) to bridge the gap. In the\nBDCT framework, RSA encryption based transaction verification method (RSA-TVM)\nis proposed to ensure contact tracing correctness, which can achieve more than\n96\\% contact cases recording accuracy even each person has 60\\% probability of\nfailing to verify the contact information. Reputation Corrected Delegated Proof\nof Stake (RC-DPoS) consensus mechanism is proposed together with the incentive\nmechanism, which can ensure timeliness of reporting contact cases and keep\nblockchain decentralized. A novel contact tracing simulation environment is\ncreated, which considers three different contact scenarios based on population\ndensity. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and\nattack resistance of RSA-TVM and RC-DPoS in the proposed BDCT.",

Likewise, when using in-person services like going\nto a concert, after paying for this service the user usually gets a ticket\nwhich proves that he/she has the right to use that service. In both scenarios,\nthe main concerns are the centralization of the systems, and that they do not\nensure customers' privacy. The involved Service Providers are Trusted Third\nParties, authorities that offer services and handle private data about users.\nIn this paper, we design and implement FORT, a decentralized system that allows\ncustomers to prove their right to use specific services (either online or\nin-person) without revealing sensitive information. To achieve decentralization\nwe propose a solution where all the data is handled by a Blockchain. We\ndescribe and uniquely identify users' rights using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs),\nand possession of these rights is demonstrated by using Zero-Knowledge Proofs,\ncryptographic primitives that allow us to guarantee customers' privacy.\nFurthermore, we provide benchmarks of FORT which show that our protocol is\nefficient enough to be used in devices with low computing resources, like\nsmartphones or smartwatches, which are the kind of devices commonly used in our\nuse case scenario.",

However, there has been few research focusing on the\nallocation of resources for clients in BCFL. In the BCFL framework where the FL\nclients and the blockchain miners are the same devices, clients broadcast the\ntrained model updates to the blockchain network and then perform mining to\ngenerate new blocks. Since each client has a limited amount of computing\nresources, the problem of allocating computing resources into training and\nmining needs to be carefully addressed. In this paper, we design an incentive\nmechanism to assign each client appropriate rewards for training and mining,\nand then the client will determine the amount of computing power to allocate\nfor each subtask based on these rewards using the two-stage Stackelberg game.\nAfter analyzing the utilities of the model owner (MO) (i.e., the BCFL task\npublisher) and clients, we transform the game model into two optimization\nproblems, which are sequentially solved to derive the optimal strategies for\nboth the MO and clients. Further, considering the fact that local training\nrelated information of each client may not be known by others, we extend the\ngame model with analytical solutions to the incomplete information scenario.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate the validity of our proposed\nschemes.",

            "summary": "The selfish mining attack, arguably the most famous game-theoretic attack in\nblockchain, indicates that the Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible.\nMost subsequent works mainly focus on strengthening the selfish mining\nstrategy, thus enabling a single strategic agent more likely to deviate. In\nsharp contrast, little attention has been paid to the resistant behavior\nagainst the selfish mining attack, let alone further equilibrium analysis for\nminers and mining pools in the blockchain as a multi-agent system.\n  In this paper, first, we propose a strategy called insightful mining to\ncounteract selfish mining. By infiltrating an undercover miner into the selfish\npool, the insightful pool could acquire the number of its hidden blocks. We\nprove that, with this extra insight, the utility of the insightful pool could\nbe strictly greater than the selfish pool's when they have the same mining\npower. Then we investigate the mining game where all pools can either choose to\nbe honest or take the insightful mining strategy. We characterize the Nash\nequilibrium of this mining game, and derive three corollaries: (a) each mining\ngame has a pure Nash equilibrium; (b) honest mining is a Nash equilibrium if\nthe largest mining pool has a fraction of mining power no more than 1/3; (c)\nthere are at most two insightful pools under equilibrium no matter how the\nmining power is distributed.",

            "summary": "Security analyses for consensus protocols in blockchain research have\nprimarily focused on the synchronous model, where point-to-point communication\ndelays are upper bounded by a known finite constant. These models are\nunrealistic in noisy settings, where messages may be lost (i.e. incur infinite\ndelay). In this work, we study the impact of message losses on the security of\nthe proof-of-work longest-chain protocol. We introduce a new communication\nmodel to capture the impact of message loss called the $0-\\infty$ model, and\nderive a region of tolerable adversarial power under which the consensus\nprotocol is secure. The guarantees are derived as a simple bound for the\nprobability that a transaction violates desired security properties.\nSpecifically, we show that this violation probability decays almost\nexponentially in the security parameter. Our approach involves constructing\ncombinatorial objects from blocktrees, and identifying random variables\nassociated with them that are amenable to analysis. This approach improves\nexisting bounds and extends the known regime for tolerable adversarial\nthreshold in settings where messages may be lost.",

Managing healthcare supply\nchain processes effectively is very crucial for the healthcare system. Despite\nvarious innovations in the method of treatment methodologies, the healthcare\nsupply chain management system is not up to the mark and lacks efficiency. The\ntraditional healthcare supply chain system is time-consuming and lacks the work\nsynergy among the various stakeholders of the supply chain. Thus, In this\npaper, we propose a framework based on blockchain smart contracts and\ndecentralized storage to connect all the supply chain stakeholders. Smart\ncontracts in the framework enforce and depict various interactions and\ntransactions among the stakeholders, thus helping to automate these processes,\npromote transparency, improve efficiency, and minimize service time.

Honest full nodes, which can download and store the full\nblockchain, are aware that some data are not available but they have no formal\nway to prove it to light nodes, i.e., nodes that have limited resources and are\nnot able to access the whole blockchain data. A common solution to counter\nthese attacks exploits linear error correcting codes to encode the block\ncontent. A recent protocol, called SPAR, employs coded Merkle trees and\nlow-density parity-check codes to counter DAAs. In this paper, we show that the\nprotocol is less secure than claimed, owing to a redefinition of the\nadversarial success probability.

We propose novel zk-SNARK protocols for private auctions and\ndecentralized card games on the blockchain, providing code for the proposed\napplications. We conclude by touching on promising zk-SNARK innovations, such\nas zk-STARKs.",

            "summary": "Money transfer is an abstraction that realizes the core of cryptocurrencies.\nIt has been shown that, contrary to common belief, money transfer in the\npresence of Byzantine faults can be implemented in asynchronous networks and\ndoes not require consensus. Nonetheless, existing implementations of money\ntransfer still require a quadratic message complexity per payment, making\nattempts to scale hard. In common blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum,\nthis cost is mitigated by payment channels implemented as a second layer on top\nof the blockchain allowing to make many off-chain payments between two users\nwho share a channel. Such channels only require on-chain transactions for\nchannel opening and closing, while the intermediate payments are done off-chain\nwith constant message complexity. But payment channels in-use today require\nsynchrony, therefore they are inadequate for asynchronous money transfer\nsystems.\n  In this paper, we provide a series of possibility and impossibility results\nfor payment channels in asynchronous money transfer systems. We first prove a\nquadratic lower bound on the message complexity of on-chain transfers. Then, we\nexplore two types of payment channels, unidirectional and bidirectional. We\ndefine them as shared memory abstractions and prove that in certain cases they\ncan be implemented as a second layer on top of an asynchronous money transfer\nsystem whereas in other cases it is impossible.",

Byzantine SMR protocols often guarantee\nsafety under all circumstances and liveness only under synchrony. However,\nguaranteeing liveness even under this assumption is nontrivial. So far we have\nlacked systematic ways of incorporating liveness mechanisms into Byzantine SMR\nprotocols, which often led to subtle bugs. To close this gap, we introduce a\nmodular framework to facilitate the design of provably live and efficient\nByzantine SMR protocols. Our framework relies on a view abstraction generated\nby a special SMR synchronizer primitive to drive the agreement on command\nordering. We present a simple formal specification of an SMR synchronizer and\nits bounded-space implementation under partial synchrony. We also apply our\nspecification to prove liveness and analyze the latency of three Byzantine SMR\nprotocols via a uniform methodology. In particular, one of these results yields\nwhat we believe is the first rigorous liveness proof for the algorithmic core\nof the seminal PBFT protocol.",

For reliable forecasting, this\npaper proposes a multimodal AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble approach that employs all\nmodalities which derive price fluctuation such as social media sentiments,\nsearch volumes, blockchain information, and trading data. To better support\ninvestment decision making, the approach forecasts also the fluctuation\ndistribution.

The new\nvertex at time $t$ is connected to vertices chosen from the graph\n$G_{(t-\\xi_t)_+}$ according to a construction function $f$ and the graph is\nupdated by taking union with the graph $G_{t-1}$. This process corresponds to\nadding new blocks in a blockchain, where the delays arise due to network\ncommunication. The main question of interest is the end structure of the\nasynchronous limit of the graph sequence as time increases to infinity.\n  We consider the following construction functions of interest, a) Nakamoto\nconstruction $f_{\\mathrm{Nak}}$, in which a vertex is uniformly selected from\nthose furthest from the root, resulting in a tree, and b) mixture of\nconstruction functions $(f_k)_{1\\le k\\le \\infty}$, where in $f_k$ a random set\nof $k$ leaves (all if there are less than $k$ in total) is chosen without\nreplacement. The main idea behind the analysis is decoupling the time-delay\nprocess from the DAG process and constructing an appropriate regenerative\nstructure in the time-delay process giving rise to Markovian behavior for a\nfunctional of the DAG process. We establish that the asynchronous limits for\n$f_\\mathrm{Nak}, (f_k)_{k \\ge 2}$, and any non-trivial mixture $f$ are\none-ended, while the asynchronous limit for $f_1$ has infinitely many ends,\nalmost surely. We also study fundamental growth properties of the longest path\nfor the sequence of graphs for $f_\\mathrm{Nak}$. In addition, we prove a phase\ntransition on the (time and sample-path dependent) probability of choosing\n$f_1$ such that the asynchronous limit either has one or infinitely many ends.\nFinally, we show that the construction $f_\\infty$ is an appropriate limit of\nthe $(f_k)_k$.",

However, they are vulnerable to False Data Injection\n(FDI) attacks in which an attacker manipulates meter data to disrupt the grid\noperations. Existing works on FDI are based on a simple threat model in which a\nsingle grid operator has access to all the data, and only some meters can be\ncompromised.\n  Our goal is to secure smart grids against FDI under a realistic threat model.\nTo this end, we present a threat model in which there are multiple operators,\neach with a partial view of the grid, and each can be fully compromised. An\neffective defense against FDI in this setting is to share data between the\noperators. However, the main challenge here is to incentivize data sharing. We\naddress this by proposing an incentive mechanism that rewards operators for\nuploading data, but penalizes them if the data is missing or anomalous. We\nderive formal conditions under which our incentive mechanism is provably secure\nagainst operators who withhold or distort measurement data for profit. We then\nimplement the data sharing solution on a private blockchain, introducing\nseveral optimizations that overcome the inherent performance limitations of the\nblockchain.

The blockchain\nis functional as far as no data stored on it has been changed, deleted, or\nlocked. Once the IT department detects the attack from the hacker, it will\nimmediately re-set the blockchain, rendering all previous efforts of the hacker\nin vain. The hacker will not stop until the blockchain is dysfunctional. For\narbitrary distributions of the hacking times and detecting times, we derive the\nlimiting functional probability, instantaneous functional probability, and mean\nfunctional time of the blockchain. We also show that all these quantities are\nincreasing functions of the number of nodes, substantiating the intuition that\nthe more nodes a blockchain has, the harder it is for a hacker to succeed in a\ncyber attack.",

The\nnew attack vector includes unsecured and vulnerable IoT devices connected to\nthe internet, denial of service vulnerabilities like southbound channel\nsaturation in the SDN architecture. Given the high-volume and pervasive nature\nof these attacks, it is beneficial for stakeholders to collaborate in detecting\nand mitigating the denial of service attacks in a timely manner. The blockchain\ntechnology is considered to improve the security aspects owing to the\ndecentralized design, secured distributed storage and privacy. A thorough\nexploration and classification of blockchain techniques used for DDoS attack\nmitigation is not explored in the prior art. This paper reviews and categorizes\nthe existed state-of-the-art DDoS mitigation solutions based on blockchain\ntechnology. The DDoS mitigation techniques are classified based on the solution\ndeployment location i.e. network based, near attacker location, near victim\nlocation and hybrid solutions in the network architecture with emphasis on the\nIoT and SDN architectures. Additionally, based on our study, the research\nchallenges and future directions to implement the blockchain based DDoS\nmitigation solutions are discussed. We believe that this paper could serve as a\nstarting point and reference resource for future researchers working on denial\nof service attacks detection and mitigation using blockchain technology.",

Blockchain technologies\npromise a new Web revolution (Web 3.0) through the decentralization of online\nservices. However, one of the key limitations for this revolution to happen at\na planetary scale is the poor performance of today's blockchains. We propose in\nthis paper ALDER, a solution for unlocking the performance of off-the-shelf\nleader-based blockchains by multiplexing their consensus protocol. Our solution\nleverages the existence of multiple potential leaders to alleviate the\nbottleneck that exists at different levels of consensus protocols. To\nillustrate the benefits it brings to Blockchain performance, we apply ALDER to\nthree representative blockchains, namely Algorand (Proof-of-Stake), RapidChain\n(Sharding-based) and Bitcoin (Proof-of-Work). Our evaluation, involving up to\n10,000 nodes deployed on 100 physical machines, shows that using ALDER can\nprovide up to a 300% improvement in both throughput and latency reduction.",

This dramatic surge has led to industry\nobservers questioning the authenticity of on-chain volumes, given the absence\nof identity requirements and the ease with which agents can control multiple\naddresses. We examine potentially illicit trading patterns in the NFT markets\nfrom January 2018 to mid-November 2021, gathering data from the 52 largest\ncollections by volume. Our findings indicate that within our sample 3.93% of\naddresses, processing a total of 2.04% of sale transactions, trigger suspicions\nof market abuse. Flagged transactions contaminate nearly all collections and\nmay have inflated the authentic trading volumes by as much as 149,5m for the\nperiod. Most flagged transaction patterns alternate between a few addresses,\nindicating a predisposition for manual trading. We submit that the results\npresented here may serve as a viable lower bound estimate for NFT wash trading\non Ethereum. Even so, we argue that wash trading may be less common than what\nindustry observers have previously estimated.

However,\nblockchains usually face criticisms, particularly on environmental concerns as\ntheir ``proof-of-work'' based mining process usually consumes a considerable\namount of energy which hardly makes any useful contributions to the real world.\nTherefore, the concept of ``proof-of-useful-work'' (PoUW) is proposed to\nconnect blockchain with practical application domain problems so the\ncomputation power consumed in the mining process can be spent on useful\nactivities, such as solving optimization problems or training machine learning\nmodels. This paper introduces HDCoin, a blockchain-based framework for an\nemerging machine learning scheme: the brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing\n(HDC). We formulate the model development of HDC as a problem that can be used\nin blockchain mining. Specifically, we define the PoUW under the HDC scenario\nand develop the entire mining process of HDCoin. During mining, miners are\ncompeting to obtain the highest test accuracy on a given dataset. The winner\nalso has its model recorded in the blockchain and are available for the public\nas a trustworthy HDC model.

Malicious parties can also introduce backdoors into the joint model\nby poisoning the training data or model gradients. To address these issues, we\npresent BEAS, the first blockchain-based framework for N-party FL that provides\nstrict privacy guarantees of training data using gradient pruning (showing\nimproved differential privacy compared to existing noise and clipping based\ntechniques). Anomaly detection protocols are used to minimize the risk of\ndata-poisoning attacks, along with gradient pruning that is further used to\nlimit the efficacy of model-poisoning attacks. We also define a novel protocol\nto prevent premature convergence in heterogeneous learning environments. We\nperform extensive experiments on multiple datasets with promising results: BEAS\nsuccessfully prevents privacy leakage from dataset reconstruction attacks, and\nminimizes the efficacy of poisoning attacks. Moreover, it achieves an accuracy\nsimilar to centralized frameworks, and its communication and computation\noverheads scale linearly with the number of participants.",

            "summary": "Access to essential medication is a primary right of every individual in all\ndeveloped, developing and underdeveloped countries. This can be fulfilled by\npharmaceutical supply chains (PSC) in place which will eliminate the boundaries\nbetween different organizations and will equip them to work collectively to\nmake medicines reach even the remote corners of the globe. Due to multiple\nentities, which are geographically widespread, being involved and very complex\ngoods and economic flows, PSC is very difficult to audit and resolve any issues\ninvolved. This has given rise to many issues, including increased threats of\ncounterfeiting, inaccurate information propagation throughout the network\nbecause of data fragmentation, lack of customer confidence and delays in\ndistribution of medication to the place in need. Hence, there is a strong need\nfor robust PSC which is transparent to all parties involved and in which the\nwhole journey of medicine from manufacturer to consumer can be tracked and\ntraced easily. This will not only build safety for the consumers, but will also\nhelp manufacturers to build confidence among consumers and increase sales. In\nthis article, a novel Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based transparent\nsupply chain architecture is proposed and a proof-of-concept is implemented.\nEfficiency and scalability of the proposed architecture is evaluated and\ncompared with existing solutions.",

These applications have diverse performance\nrequirements (e.g., user-defined quality of experience metrics, latency, and\nreliability) that are challenging to be fulfilled by existing wireless systems.\nTo meet the diverse requirements of the emerging applications, the concept of a\ndigital twin has been recently proposed. A digital twin uses a virtual\nrepresentation along with security-related technologies (e.g., blockchain),\ncommunication technologies (e.g., 6G), computing technologies (e.g., edge\ncomputing), and machine learning, so as to enable the smart applications. In\nthis tutorial, we present a comprehensive overview on digital twins for\nwireless systems. First, we present an overview of fundamental concepts (i.e.,\ndesign aspects, high-level architecture, and frameworks) of digital twin of\nwireless systems. Second, a comprehensive taxonomy is devised for both\ndifferent aspects. These aspects are twins for wireless and wireless for twins.\nFor the twins for wireless aspect, we consider parameters, such as twin objects\ndesign, prototyping, deployment trends, physical devices design, interface\ndesign, incentive mechanism, twins isolation, and decoupling. On the other\nhand, for wireless for twins, parameters such as, twin objects access aspects,\nsecurity and privacy, and air interface design are considered.

This is not just a theoretical problem, as recent works have\nexploited unsafe peer connection policies and weak network synchronization to\nmount partitioning attacks on Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency blockchains are safety\ncritical systems, so we need principled algorithms to maintain their networks.\n  Our key insight is that we can leverage the blockchain itself to share\ninformation among the peers, and thus simplify the network maintenance process.\nGiven that the peers have restricted computational resources, and at most a\nconstant fraction of them are Byzantine, we provide communication-efficient\nprotocols to maintain a hypercubic network for blockchains, where peers can\njoin and leave over time. Interestingly, we discover that our design can\n\\emph{recover} from substantial adversarial failures. Moreover, these\nproperties hold despite significant churn.\n  A key contribution is a secure mechanism for joining the network that uses\nthe blockchain to help new peers to contact existing peers. Furthermore, by\nexamining how peers join the network, i.e., the \"bootstrapping service,\" we\ngive a lower bound showing that (within log factors) our network tolerates the\nmaximum churn rate possible.

IoT edge-sensors and their associated data play a\npredominant role in today's industry ecosystem. Breaching data or forging\nsource devices after injecting advanced persistent threats (APT) damages the\nindustry owners' money and loss of operators' lives. The existing challenges\ninclude APT injection attacks targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data\ntransportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, incompliant data\nstoring mechanisms, etc. Edge-servers often suffer because of their lightweight\ncomputation capacity to stamp out unauthorized data or instructions, which in\nessence, makes them exposed to attackers. When attackers target edge servers\nwhile transporting data using traditional PKI-rendered trusts, consortium\nblockchain (CBC) offers proven techniques to transfer and maintain those\nsensitive data securely. With the recent improvement of edge machine learning,\nedge devices can filter malicious data at their end which largely motivates us\nto institute a Blockchain and AI aligned APT detection system. The unique\ncontributions of the paper include efficient APT detection at the edge and\ntransparent recording of the detection history in an immutable blockchain\nledger. In line with that, the certificateless data transfer mechanism boost\ntrust among collaborators and ensure an economical and sustainable mechanism\nafter eliminating existing certificate authority. Finally, the edge-compliant\nstorage technique facilitates efficient predictive maintenance.

            "summary": "The meteoric rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been accompanied by a\nplethora of frequent and often financially devastating attacks on its protocols\nThere have been over 70 exploits of DeFi protocols, with the total of lost\nfunds amounting to approximately 1.5bn USD. In this paper, we introduce a new\napproach to minimizing the frequency and severity of such attacks: dissimilar\nredundancy for smart contracts. In a nutshell, the idea is to implement a\nprogram logic more than once, ideally using different programming languages.\nThen, for each implementation, the results should match before allowing the\nstate of the blockchain to change. This is inspired by and has clear parallels\nto the field of avionics, where on account of the safety-critical environment,\nflight control systems typically feature multiple redundant implementations. We\nargue that the high financial stakes in DeFi protocols merit a conceptually\nsimilar approach, and we provide a novel algorithm for implementing dissimilar\nredundancy for smart contracts.",

            "summary": "Resource-based consensus is the backbone of permissionless distributed ledger\nsystems. The security of such protocols relies fundamentally on the level of\nresources actively engaged in the system. The variety of different resources\n(and related proof protocols, some times referred to as PoX in the literature)\nraises the fundamental question whether it is possible to utilize many of them\nin tandem and build multi-resource consensus protocols. The challenge in\ncombining different resources is to achieve fungibility between them, in the\nsense that security would hold as long as the cumulative adversarial power\nacross all resources is bounded.\n  In this work, we put forth Minotaur, a multi-resource blockchain consensus\nprotocol that combines proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS), and we\nprove it optimally fungible. At the core of our design, Minotaur operates in\nepochs while continuously sampling the active computational power to provide a\nfair exchange between the two resources, work and stake. Further, we\ndemonstrate the ability of Minotaur to handle a higher degree of work\nfluctuation as compared to the Bitcoin blockchain; we also generalize Minotaur\nto any number of resources.\n  We demonstrate the simplicity of Minotaur via implementing a full stack\nclient in Rust (available open source). We use the client to test the\nrobustness of Minotaur to variable mining power and combined work/stake attacks\nand demonstrate concrete empirical evidence towards the suitability of Minotaur\nto serve as the consensus layer of a real-world blockchain.",

Here, we model a trustable\nand reliable management system based on blockchain for vaccine distribution by\nextending the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model. The model\nincludes prevention measures such as mask-wearing, social distance, vaccination\nrate, and vaccination efficiency. It also considers negative social behavior,\nsuch as violations of social distance and attempts of using illegitimate\nvaccination proofs. By evaluating the model, we show that the proposed system\ncan reduce up to 2.5 million cases and half a million deaths in the most\ndemanding scenarios.",

One of the main difficulties comes from not only how to\nrepresent such a general tree with multiple block branches (or sub-chains)\nrelated to the multiple mining pools, but also how to analyze a\nmulti-dimensional stochastic system due to the mining competition among the\nmultiple mining pools. In this paper, we first set up a mathematical\nrepresentation for the tree with multiple block branches. Then we provide a\nblock classification of Ethereum: Regular blocks (in the main chain), orphan\nblocks, uncle blocks, stale blocks, and nephew blocks, and give some key\nprobabilities of generating the different types of blocks by applying the law\nof large numbers. Based on this, we further discuss the growth rate of\nblockchain, and the reward allocation among the multiple mining pools through\napplying the renewal reward theorem. Finally, we use some simulation\nexperiments to verify our theoretical results, and show that the approximate\ncomputation approaches developed, such as the key probabilities, the long-term\ngrowth rate of blockchain, and the long-term reward allocation (rate) among the\nmultiple mining pools, can have a faster convergence. Therefore, we provide a\npowerful tool for observing and understanding the influence of the selfish\nmining attacks on the performance of Ethereum with multiple mining pools. We\nbelieve that the methodology and results developed in this paper will shed\nlight on the study of Ethereum with multiple mining pools, such that a series\nof promising research can be inspired potentially.",

            "summary": "Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers are one of the most widely-used blockchain\nprivacy solutions, operating on top of smart contract-enabled blockchains. We\nfind that ZKP mixers are tightly intertwined with the growing number of\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks and Blockchain Extractable Value (BEV)\nextractions. Through coin flow tracing, we discover that 205 blockchain\nattackers and 2,595 BEV extractors leverage mixers as their source of funds,\nwhile depositing a total attack revenue of 412.87M USD. Moreover, the US OFAC\nsanctions against the largest ZKP mixer, Tornado.Cash, have reduced the mixer's\ndaily deposits by more than 80%.\n  Further, ZKP mixers advertise their level of privacy through a so-called\nanonymity set size, which similarly to k-anonymity allows a user to hide among\na set of k other users. Through empirical measurements, we, however, find that\nthese anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate. For the most popular mixers\non Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), we show how to reduce the\nanonymity set size on average by 27.34% and 46.02% respectively. Our empirical\nevidence is also the first to suggest a differing privacy-predilection of users\non ETH and BSC.\n  State-of-the-art ZKP mixers are moreover interwoven with the DeFi ecosystem\nby offering anonymity mining (AM) incentives, i.e., users receive monetary\nrewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the claims of related work, we\nfind that AM does not necessarily improve the quality of a mixer's anonymity\nset. Our findings indicate that AM attracts privacy-ignorant users, who then do\nnot contribute to improving the privacy of other mixer users.",

            "summary": "Many prominent smart-contract applications such as payment channels,\nauctions, and voting systems often involve a mechanism in which some party must\nrespond to a challenge or appeal some action within a fixed time limit. This\npattern of challenge-response mechanisms poses great risks if during periods of\nhigh transaction volume, the network becomes congested. In this case fee market\ncompetition can prevent the inclusion of the response in blocks, causing great\nharm. As a result, responders are allowed long periods to submit their response\nand overpay in fees. To overcome these problems and improve challenge-response\nprotocols, we suggest a secure mechanism that detects congestion in blocks and\nadjusts the deadline of the response accordingly. The responder is thus\nguaranteed a deadline extension should congestion arise. We lay theoretical\nfoundations for congestion signals in blockchains and then proceed to analyze\nand discuss possible attacks on the mechanism and evaluate its robustness. Our\nresults show that in Ethereum, using short response deadlines as low as 3\nhours, the protocol has >99% defense rate from attacks even by miners with up\nto 33% of the computational power. Using shorter deadlines such as one hour is\nalso possible with a similar defense rate for attackers with up to 27% of the\npower.",

            "summary": "Cross-Blockchain communication has gained traction due to the increasing\nfragmentation of blockchain networks and scalability solutions such as\nside-chaining and sharding. With SmartSync, we propose a novel concept for\ncross-blockchain smart contract interactions that creates client contracts on\narbitrary blockchain networks supporting the same execution environment. Client\ncontracts mirror the logic and state of the original instance and enable\nseamless on-chain function executions providing recent states. Synchronized\ncontracts supply instant read-only function calls to other applications hosted\non the target blockchain. Hereby, current limitations in cross-chain\ncommunication are alleviated and new forms of contract interactions are\nenabled. State updates are transmitted in a verifiable manner using Merkle\nproofs and do not require trusted intermediaries. To permit lightweight\nsynchronizations, we introduce transition confirmations that facilitate the\napplication of verifiable state transitions without re-executing transactions\nof the source blockchain. We prove the concept's soundness by providing a\nprototypical implementation that enables smart contract forks, state\nsynchronizations, and on-chain validation on EVM-compatible blockchains. Our\nevaluation demonstrates SmartSync's applicability for presented use cases\nproviding access to recent states to third-party contracts on the target\nblockchain. Execution costs scale sub-linearly with the number of value updates\nand depend on the depth and index of corresponding Merkle proofs.",

This is achieved by applying the source blockchain's\nconsensus validation protocol on the target blockchain. Existing chain relays\nallow for the validation of blocks created using the Proof of Work (PoW)\nprotocol. Since PoW entails high energy consumption, limited throughput, and no\nguaranteed finality, Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols are increasingly\npopular for addressing these shortcomings. We propose Verilay, the first chain\nrelay scheme that enables validating PoS protocols that produce finalized\nblocks, for example, Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, and Polkadot. The concept does not\nrequire changes to the source blockchain protocols or validator operations.\nSignatures of block proposers are validated by a dedicated relay smart contract\non the target blockchain. In contrast to basic PoW chain relays, Verilay\nrequires only a subset of block headers to be submitted in order to maintain\nfull verifiability. This yields enhanced scalability. We provide a prototypical\nimplementation that facilitates the validation of Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain\nheaders within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

FL has distributed the implementation of ML. Another\nvariant of FL which is well suited for the Internet of Things (IoT) is known as\nCollaborated Federated Learning (CFL), which does not require an edge device to\nhave a direct link to the model aggregator. Instead, the devices can connect to\nthe central model aggregator via other devices using them as relays. Although,\nFL and CFL protect the privacy of edge devices but raises security challenges\nfor a centralized server that performs model aggregation. The centralized\nserver is prone to malfunction, backdoor attacks, model corruption, adversarial\nattacks and external attacks. Moreover, edge device to centralized server data\nexchange is not required in FL and CFL, but model parameters are sent from the\nmodel aggregator (global model) to edge devices (local model), which is still\nprone to cyber-attacks. These security and privacy concerns can be potentially\naddressed by Blockchain technology. The blockchain is a decentralized and\nconsensus-based chain where devices can share consensus ledgers with increased\nreliability and security, thus significantly reducing the cyberattacks on an\nexchange of information. In this work, we will investigate the efficacy of\nblockchain-based decentralized exchange of model parameters and relevant\ninformation among edge devices and from a centralized server to edge devices.\nMoreover, we will be conducting the feasibility analysis for blockchain-based\nCFL models for different application scenarios like the internet of vehicles,\nand the internet of things.

Furthermore,\ndisposing of a clearer view of the protocol, some general features and\nconsiderations can be derived (e.g., nodes behaviour in largely participated\nnetworks).

            "summary": "Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain in the world, supported by the immense\nhash power of its Proof-of-Work miners, but consumes huge amount of energy.\nProof-of-Stake chains are energy-efficient, have fast finality and\naccountability, but face several fundamental security issues: susceptibility to\nnon-slashable long-range safety attacks, non-slashable transaction censorship\nand stalling attacks and difficulty to bootstrap new PoS chains from low token\nvaluation. We propose Babylon, a blockchain platform which combines the best of\nboth worlds by reusing the immense Bitcoin hash power to enhance the security\nof PoS chains. Babylon provides a data-available timestamping service, securing\nPoS chains by allowing them to timestamp data-available block checkpoints,\nfraud proofs and censored transactions on Babylon. Babylon miners merge mine\nwith Bitcoin and thus the platform has zero additional energy cost. The\nsecurity of a Babylon-enhanced PoS protocol is formalized by a cryptoeconomic\nsecurity theorem which shows slashable safety and liveness guarantees.",

            "summary": "The complexity of cyberattacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) calls for a\nmechanism that can evaluate critical infrastructures' operational behaviour and\nsecurity without affecting the operation of live systems. In this regard,\nDigital Twins (DTs) provide actionable insights through monitoring, simulating,\npredicting, and optimizing the state of CPSs. Through the use cases, including\nsystem testing and training, detecting system misconfigurations, and security\ntesting, DTs strengthen the security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle.\nHowever, such benefits of DTs depend on an assumption about data integrity and\nsecurity. Data trustworthiness becomes more critical while integrating multiple\ncomponents among different DTs owned by various stakeholders to provide an\naggregated view of the complex physical system. This article envisions a\nblockchain-based DT framework as Trusted Twins for Securing Cyber-Physical\nSystems (TTS-CPS). With the automotive industry as a CPS use case, we\ndemonstrate the viability of the TTS-CPS framework in a proof of concept. To\nutilize reliable system specification data for building the process knowledge\nof DTs, we ensure the trustworthiness of data-generating sources through\nintegrity checking mechanisms. Additionally, the safety and security rules\nevaluated during simulation are stored and retrieved from the blockchain,\nthereby establishing more understanding and confidence in the decisions made by\nthe underlying systems. Finally, we perform formal verification of the TTS-CPS.",

Motivated\nby this requirement, we conduct an empirical centrality analysis of the popular\nLightning Network, and in particular, the betweenness centrality distribution\nof the routing system. Based on our extensive data set (using several millions\nof channel update messages), we implemented a TimeMachine tool which enables us\nto study the network evolution over time. We find that although the network is\ngenerally fairly decentralized, a small number of nodes can attract a\nsignificant fraction of the transactions, introducing skew. Furthermore, our\nanalysis suggests that over the last two years, the centrality has increased\nsignificantly, e.g., the inequality (measured by the Gini index) has increased\nby more than 10%.",

            "summary": "A long line of research on secure computation has confirmed that anything\nthat can be computed, can be computed securely using a set of non-colluding\nparties. Indeed, this non-collusion assumption makes a number of problems\nsolvable, as well as reduces overheads and bypasses computational hardness\nresults, and it is pervasive across different privacy-enhancing technologies.\nHowever, it remains highly susceptible to covert, undetectable collusion among\ncomputing parties. This work stems from an observation that if the number of\navailable computing parties is much higher than the number of parties required\nto perform a secure computation task, collusion attempts in privacy-preserving\ncomputations could be deterred.\n  We focus on the prominent privacy-preserving computation task of multi-server\n$1$-private information retrieval (PIR) that inherently assumes no pair-wise\ncollusion. For PIR application scenarios, such as those for blockchain light\nclients, where the available servers can be plentiful, a single server's\ndeviating action is not tremendously beneficial to itself. We can make\ndeviations undesired via small amounts of rewards and penalties, thus\nsignificantly raising the bar for collusion resistance. We design and implement\na collusion mitigation mechanism on a public bulletin board with payment\nexecution functions, considering only rational and malicious parties with no\nhonest non-colluding servers.

While these codes have demonstrated\nimproved performance across a variety of metrics such as DA detection\nprobability, they are difficult to apply to blockchains with large blocks due\nto generally intractable code guarantees for large codelengths (LDPC), large\ndecoding complexity (2D-RS), or large coding fraud proof sizes (2D-RS).

This is attested by the fact that both of the two\nmajor cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have undergone hard forks that\nresulted in the creation of alternative systems, creating confusion and\nopportunities for fraudulent activities. These events, and numerous others,\nunderscore the importance of Blockchain governance, namely the set of processes\nthat blockchain platforms utilize in order to perform decision-making and\nconverge to a widely accepted direction for the system to evolve. While a rich\ntopic of study in other areas, governance of blockchain platforms is lacking a\nwell established set of methods and practices that are adopted industry wide.\nThis makes the topic of blockchain governance a fertile domain for a thorough\nsystematization that we undertake in this work.\n  We start by distilling a comprehensive array of properties for sound\ngovernance systems drawn from academic sources as well as grey literature of\nelection systems and blockchain white papers. These are divided into seven\ncategories, confidentiality, verifiability, accountability, sustainability,\nPareto efficiency, suffrage and liveness that capture the whole spectrum of\ndesiderata of governance systems. We proceed to classify ten well-documented\nblockchain systems. While all properties are satisfied, even partially, by at\nleast one system, no system that satisfies most of them. Our work lays out a\nfoundation for assessing blockchain governance processes.

            "summary": "Recently, many Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)-based blockchains have been\nwidely used in decentralized applications, such as EOSIO, Tron, and Binance\nSmart Chain. Compared with traditional PoW-based blockchain systems, these\nsystems achieve a higher transaction throughput and are well adapted to\nlarge-scale scenes in daily applications. Decentralization is a key element in\nblockchain networks. However, little is known about the evolution of\ndecentralization in DPoS-based blockchain networks. In this paper, we conduct a\nsystematic analysis on the decentralization of DPoS with data from up to\n135,000,000 blocks in EOSIO, the first successful DPoS-based blockchain system.\nWe characterize the decentralization evolution of the two phases in DPoS,\nnamely block producer election and block production. Moreover, we study the\nvoters with similar voting behaviors and propose methods to discover abnormal\nmutual voting behaviors in EOSIO. The analytical results show that our methods\ncan effectively capture the decentralization evolution and abnormal voting\nphenomena in the system, which also have reference significance for other\nDPoS-based blockchains.",

They have scope in reinventing old\nbusinesses, and they are even developing new opportunities for various brands\nand franchisors. UAVs are used in the supply chain, maintaining surveillance\nand serving as mobile hotspots. Although UAVs have potential applications, they\nbring several societal concerns and challenges that need addressing in public\nsafety, privacy, and cyber security. UAVs are prone to various cyber-attacks\nand vulnerabilities; they can also be hacked and misused by malicious entities\nresulting in cyber-crime. The adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities,\nleading to data loss, property, and destruction of life. One can partially\ndetect the attacks like false information dissemination, jamming, gray hole,\nblackhole, and GPS spoofing by monitoring the UAV behavior, but it may not\nresolve privacy issues. This paper presents secure communication between UAVs\nusing blockchain technology. Our approach involves building smart contracts and\nmaking a secure and reliable UAV adhoc network. This network will be resilient\nto various network attacks and is secure against malicious intrusions.",

This\nbase-level disruptive technology can boost the security and privacy-related\nefficiency of various domains. As Bangladesh is currently aiming for\nsustainable development, blockchain technology adoption by local researchers is\ngrowing robustly. However, in Bangladesh, the blockchain Technology Acceptance\nModel (TAM) is not yet well structured which is also limiting the perspective\nof local developers and researchers. Therefore, sectors like governance,\nhealthcare, security, privacy, farming, information authentication,\ncryptocurrencies, internet architecture, data, and so on are unable to utilize\nthe full potential of this technology. In this research, the authors conduct an\nin-depth review of such types of blockchain technology-related research\narticles that have been published recently and are also solely focused on\nBangladesh. From 5 publishers (IEEE Xplore, ACM, ScienceDirect, Taylor &\nFrancis, and SpringerLink) this study analyses 70 articles published during the\nyear 2016-2020. The study results find the top 13 sectors where Bangladeshi\nresearchers are currently focusing on. Those studies identify that the rigid\npolicy by the government, scarcity of expert researchers, and lack of resources\nare the main reasons why Bangladesh is still struggling to accommodate\nblockchain extensively. In addition, published papers are mostly based on\ntheoretical concepts without an appropriate implementation. Finally, this study\nwill be a great resource to the developers, entrepreneurs, and technology\nenthusiasts to determine the strategic plan for adopting blockchain technology\nin Bangladesh or even in any other developing country.",

            "summary": "Security incidents such as scams and hacks, have become a major threat to the\nhealth of the blockchain ecosystem, causing billions of dollars in losses each\nyear for blockchain users. To reveal the real-world entities behind the\npseudonymous blockchain account and recover the stolen funds from the massive\ntransaction data, much effort has been devoted to tracing the flow of illicit\nfunds in blockchains recently. However, most current tracing approaches based\non heuristics and taint analysis have limitations in terms of universality,\neffectiveness, and efficiency. This paper models the blockchain transaction\nrecords as a blockchain transaction graph and tackles blockchain transaction\ntracing as a graph searching task. We propose TRacer, a scalable transaction\ntracing tool for account-based blockchains. To infer the relevance between\naccounts during graph searching, we develop a novel personalized PageRank\nmethod in TRacer based on the directed, weighted, temporal, and\nmulti-relationship blockchain transaction graphs. To the best of our knowledge,\nTRacer is the first intelligent transaction tracing tool in account-based\nblockchains that can handle complex transaction actions in decentralized\nfinance (DeFi). Experimental results and theoretical analysis prove that TRacer\ncan complete the transaction tracing task effectively at a low cost. All codes\nof TRacer are available at GitHub.",

Zef further introduces opaque coins represented as off-chain\ncertificates that are bound to user accounts. In order to hide the face values\nof coins when a payment operation consumes or creates them, Zef uses random\ncommitments and NIZK proofs. Created coins are made unlinkable using the blind\nand randomizable threshold anonymous credentials of Coconut. To control storage\ncosts associated with coin replay prevention, Zef accounts are designed so that\ndata can be safely removed once an account is deactivated. Besides the\nspecifications and a detailed analysis of the protocol, we are making available\nan open-source implementation of Zef in Rust. Our extensive benchmarks on AWS\nconfirm textbook linear scalability and demonstrate a confirmation time under\none second at nominal capacity.

We conduct a\nrigorous and comprehensive empirical study to examine its causal effect on\nblockchain transaction fee dynamics, transaction waiting times, and consensus\nsecurity. Our results show that EIP-1559 improves the user experience by\nmitigating intrablock differences in the gas price paid and reducing users'\nwaiting times. However, EIP-1559 has only a small effect on gas fee levels and\nconsensus security. In addition, we find that when Ether's price is more\nvolatile, the waiting time is significantly higher. We also verify that a\nlarger block size increases the presence of siblings. These findings suggest\nnew directions for improving TFMs.",

            "summary": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging promising privacy-preserving machine\nlearning paradigm and has raised more and more attention from researchers and\ndevelopers. FL keeps users' private data on devices and exchanges the gradients\nof local models to cooperatively train a shared Deep Learning (DL) model on\ncentral custodians. However, the security and fault tolerance of FL have been\nincreasingly discussed, because its central custodian mechanism or star-shaped\narchitecture can be vulnerable to malicious attacks or software failures. To\naddress these problems, Swarm Learning (SL) introduces a permissioned\nblockchain to securely onboard members and dynamically elect the leader, which\nallows performing DL in an extremely decentralized manner. Compared with\ntremendous attention to SL, there are few empirical studies on SL or\nblockchain-based decentralized FL, which provide comprehensive knowledge of\nbest practices and precautions of deploying SL in real-world scenarios.\nTherefore, we conduct the first comprehensive study of SL to date, to fill the\nknowledge gap between SL deployment and developers, as far as we are concerned.\nIn this paper, we conduct various experiments on 3 public datasets of 5\nresearch questions, present interesting findings, quantitatively analyze the\nreasons behind these findings, and provide developers and researchers with\npractical suggestions.

            "summary": "Industry 4.0 in health care has evolved drastically over the past century. In\nfact, it is evolving every day, with new tools and strategies being developed\nby physicians and researchers alike. Health care and technology have been\nintertwined together with the advancement of cloud computing and big data. This\nstudy aims to analyze the impact of industry 4.0 in health care systems. To do\nso, a systematic literature review was carried out considering peer-reviewed\narticles extracted from the two popular databases: Scopus and Web of Science\n(WoS). PRISMA statement 2015 was used to include and exclude that data. At\nfirst, a bibliometric analysis was carried out using 346 articles considering\nthe following factors: publication by year, journal, authors, countries,\ninstitutions, authors' keywords, and citations. Finally, qualitative analysis\nwas carried out based on selected 32 articles considering the following\nfactors: a conceptual framework, schedule problems, security, COVID-19, digital\nsupply chain, and blockchain technology. Study finding suggests that during the\nonset of COVID-19, health care and industry 4.0 has been merged and evolved\njointly, considering various crisis such as data security, resource allocation,\nand data transparency. Industry 4.0 enables many technologies such as the\ninternet of things (IoT), blockchain, big data, cloud computing, machine\nlearning, deep learning, information, and communication technologies (ICT) to\ntrack patients' records and helps reduce social transmission COVID-19 and so\non. The study findings will give future researchers and practitioners some\ninsights regarding the integration of health care and Industry 4.0.",

            "summary": "Compiler correctness is an old problem, but with the emergence of smart\ncontracts on blockchains that problem presents itself in a new light. Smart\ncontracts are self-contained pieces of software that control assets, which are\noften of high financial value, in an adversarial environment and, once\ncommitted to the blockchain, they cannot be changed anymore. Smart contracts\nare typically developed in a high-level contract language and compiled to\nlow-level virtual machine code before being committed to the blockchain. For a\nsmart contract user to trust a given piece of low-level code on the blockchain,\nthey must convince themselves that (a) they are in possession of the matching\nsource code and (b) that the compiler faithfully translated the source code's\nsemantics.\n  Classic approaches to compiler correctness tackle the second point. We argue\nthat translation certification also addresses the first. We describe the proof\narchitecture of a novel translation certification framework, implemented in\nCoq, for a functional smart contract language. We demonstrate that we can model\nthe compilation pipeline as a sequence of translation relations that facilitate\na modular proof approach and are robust in the face of an evolving compiler\nimplementation.",

With any large-scale\ntechnological integration comes the challenge of providing security. Blockchain\ntechnology has been a popular choice of many studies for making the vehicular\nnetwork more secure. Its characteristics meet some of the essential security\nrequirements such as decentralization, transparency, tamper-proof nature, and\npublic audit. This study catalogues some of the notable efforts in this\ndirection over the last few years. We analyze around 75 blockchain-based\nsecurity schemes for vehicular networks from an application, security, and\nblockchain perspective. The application perspective focuses on various\napplications which use secure blockchain-based vehicular networks such as\ntransportation, parking, data sharing/ trading, and resource sharing. The\nsecurity perspective focuses on security requirements and attacks. The\nblockchain perspective focuses on blockchain platforms, blockchain types, and\nconsensus mechanisms used in blockchain implementation. We also compile the\npopular simulation tools used for simulating blockchain and for simulating\nvehicular networks. Additionally, to give the readers a broader perspective of\nthe research area, we discuss the role of various state-of-the-art emerging\ntechnologies in blockchain-based vehicular networks.

A recent projection shows that the\nworld is lagging behind accomplishing the \"Zero Hunger\" goal, in spite of some\nadvancements. Socio-economic and well being fallout will affect the food\nsecurity. Vulnerable groups of people will suffer malnutrition. To cater to the\nneeds of the increasing population, the agricultural industry needs to be\nmodernized, become smart, and automated. Traditional agriculture can be remade\nto efficient, sustainable, eco-friendly smart agriculture by adopting existing\ntechnologies. In this survey paper the authors present the applications,\ntechnological trends, available datasets, networking options, and challenges in\nsmart agriculture. How Agro Cyber Physical Systems are built upon the\nInternet-of-Agro-Things is discussed through various application fields.\nAgriculture 4.0 is also discussed as a whole. We focus on the technologies,\nsuch as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) which support\nthe automation, along with the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which\nprovides data integrity and security. After an in-depth study of different\narchitectures, we also present a smart agriculture framework which relies on\nthe location of data processing. We have divided open research problems of\nsmart agriculture as future research work in two groups - from a technological\nperspective and from a networking perspective. AI, ML, the blockchain as a DLT,\nand Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) based hardware security fall under the\ntechnology group, whereas any network related attacks, fake data injection and\nsimilar threats fall under the network research problem group.",

Using patterns is a\ncommon practice for software architects to ensure software quality. Many\npattern collections have been proposed for a large number of application\ndomains.

It is also difficult for software architects to adequately apply\nblockchain patterns in their applications, as it requires deep knowledge of\nblockchain technology. Through a systematic literature review, this paper has\nidentified 120 unique blockchain-related patterns and proposes a pattern\ntaxonomy composed of multiple categories, built from the extracted pattern\ncollection. The purpose of this collection is to map, classify, and describe\nall available patterns across the literature to help readers make adequate\ndecisions regarding blockchain pattern selection.

            "summary": "Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction\nthroughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With\nrecent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly\nlifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this,\ntransaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting\nparallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this\nand to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature\nintroduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract\ntransactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far\nfrom ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms\ncannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain\napplications.\n  In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction execution traces\nin Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major\nfactors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to\nuse partitioned counters and special commutative instructions to break up the\napplication conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we\nevaluated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled\nthis limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus\napproaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency\ncontrol scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC\nscheduling in public blockchain settings.",

Among them, the\ndecentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the most successful applications, which\nis regarded as the future of finance. The great success of DeFi relies on the\nreal-world data which is not directly available on the blockchain. Besides, due\nto the deterministic nature of blockchain,the blockchain cannot directly obtain\nin-deterministic data from the outside world (off-chain). Thus, oracles have\nappeared as a viable solution to feed off-chain data to blockchain\napplications. In this paper, we carryout a comprehensive study on oracles,\nespecially on DeFi oracles. We first briefly introduce the application\nscenarios of DeFi oracles, and then we talk about the past of DeFi oracles by\ncategorizing them into several types based on their design features. After\nthat, we introduce five popular DeFi oracles currently in use(such as Chainlink\nand Band Protocol), with the focus on their system architecture, data\nvalidation process,and their incentive mechanisms. We compare these present\nDeFi oracles from their data trustworthiness,data source trustworthiness and\ntheir overall trust models. Finally, we propose a set of metrics for designing\ntrustworthiness DeFi oracles, and propose a potential trust architecture and a\nfew promising techniques for building trustworthiness oracles.",

            "summary": "Decentralized learning involves training machine learning models over remote\nmobile devices, edge servers, or cloud servers while keeping data localized.\nEven though many studies have shown the feasibility of preserving privacy,\nenhancing training performance or introducing Byzantine resilience, but none of\nthem simultaneously considers all of them. Therefore we face the following\nproblem: \\textit{how can we efficiently coordinate the decentralized learning\nprocess while simultaneously maintaining learning security and data privacy?}\nTo address this issue, in this paper we propose SPDL, a blockchain-secured and\nprivacy-preserving decentralized learning scheme. SPDL integrates blockchain,\nByzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus, BFT Gradients Aggregation Rule (GAR),\nand differential privacy seamlessly into one system, ensuring efficient machine\nlearning while maintaining data privacy, Byzantine fault tolerance,\ntransparency, and traceability. To validate our scheme, we provide rigorous\nanalysis on convergence and regret in the presence of Byzantine nodes. We also\nbuild a SPDL prototype and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that\nSPDL is effective and efficient with strong security and privacy guarantees.",

In this paper, we first\nsummarize five essential issues that all sharding blockchain designers face.\nFor each issue, we discuss its key challenge and propose our suggested\nsolutions. In order to break the performance bottlenecks, we propose a\nreputation mechanism for selecting leaders. The term of reputation in our\ndesign reflects each node's honest computation resources. In addition, we\nintroduce a referee committee and partial sets in each committee, and design a\nrecovery procedure in case the leader is malicious. Under the design, we prove\nthat malicious leaders will not hurt the system and will be evicted.\nFurthermore, we conduct a series of simulations to evaluate our design.

In particular, by utilizing the smart contract mechanism,\nMetaChain can effectively manage and automate complex interactions among the\nMetaverse Service Provider (MSP) and the Metaverse users (MUs). In addition, to\nallow the MSP to efficiently allocate its resources for Metaverse applications\nand MUs' demands, we design a novel sharding scheme to improve the underlying\nblockchain's scalability. Moreover, to leverage MUs' resources as well as to\nattract more MUs to support Metaverse operations, we develop an incentive\nmechanism using the Stackelberg game theory that rewards MUs' contributions to\nthe Metaverse. Through numerical experiments, we clearly show the impacts of\nthe MUs' behaviors and how the incentive mechanism can attract more MUs and\nresources to the Metaverse.",

            "summary": "While increasingly more application-specific blockchains, or ledgers, are\nbeing implemented and deployed, exchanging information between these ledgers\nremains an open problem. Existing cross-ledger protocols (XLPs) exhibit a\nvariety of limitations such as scalability, liveness, efficiency, among others.\nThis paper proposes a new XLP, namely XLPN-22, which introduces a global\ntopology for the consortium of ledgers to achieve better efficiency and\nscalability of cross-ledger data exchanges. In this work, we prove the safety\nand liveness of XLPN-22 and analyze its theoretical complexity. We also\nimplement XLPN-22 on SciChain ledgers and evaluate it on up to 128 nodes, 8\nledgers, and 16,000 transactions. Experimental results show that XLPN-22\noutperforms two baseline protocols, namely VLDB-20 and PODC-18, by 18--50\\% and\n64--84\\%, respectively.",

We introduce a\ndecentralized data governance framework based on blockchain technology and\nproxy re-encryption to let data owners control and track their data through\nprivacy-enhancing and consent management mechanisms. Besides, our framework\nallows the data consumers to understand data lineage through a blockchain-based\nprovenance mechanism.

            "summary": "It is widely expected that future networks of 6G and beyond will deliver on\nthe unachieved goals set by 5G. Technologies such as Internet of Skills and\nIndustry 4.0 will become stable and viable, as a direct consequence of networks\nthat offer sustained and reliable mobile performance levels.\n  The primary challenges for future technologies are not just low-latency and\nhigh-bandwidth. The more critical problem Mobile Service Providers (MSPs) will\nface will be in balancing the inflated demands of network connections and\ncustomers' trust in the network service, that is, being able to interconnect\nbillions of unique devices while adhering to the agreed terms of Service Level\nAgreements (SLAs). To meet these targets, it is self-evident that MSPs cannot\noperate in a solitary environment. They must enable cooperation among\nthemselves in a manner that ensures trust, both between themselves as well as\nwith customers.\n  In this study, we present the BEAT (Blockchain-Enabled Accountable and\nTransparent) Infrastructure Sharing architecture. BEAT exploits the inherent\nproperties of permissioned type of distributed ledger technology (i.e.,\npermissioned distributed ledgers) to deliver on accountability and transparency\nmetrics whenever infrastructure needs to be shared between providers. We also\npropose a lightweight method that enables device-level accountability. BEAT has\nbeen designed to be deployable directly as only minor software upgrades to\nnetwork devices such as routers. Our simulations on a resource-limited device\nshow that BEAT adds only a few seconds of overhead processing time -- with the\nlatest state-of-the-art network devices, we can reasonably anticipate much\nlower overheads.",

In this paper, we focus on\nMimbleWimble, which uses the Dandelion++ protocol for private transaction relay\nand transaction aggregation to provide transaction content privacy. We find\nthat in combination these two features make MimbleWimble susceptible to a new\ntype of denial-of-service attacks. We design, prototype, and evaluate this\nattack on the Beam network using a private test network and a network\nsimulator. We find that by controlling only 10% of the network nodes, the\nadversary can prevent over 45% of all transactions from ending up in the\nblockchain.

            "summary": "The temporal aspect of blockchain transactions enables us to study the\naddress's behavior and detect if it is involved in any illicit activity.\nHowever, due to the concept of change addresses (used to thwart replay\nattacks), temporal aspects are not directly applicable in the Bitcoin\nblockchain. Several pre-processing steps should be performed before such\ntemporal aspects are utilized. We are motivated to study the Bitcoin\ntransaction network and use the temporal features such as burst,\nattractiveness, and inter-event time along with several graph-based properties\nsuch as the degree of node and clustering coefficient to validate the\napplicability of already existing approaches known for other cryptocurrency\nblockchains on the Bitcoin blockchain. We generate the temporal and\nnon-temporal feature set and train the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm over\ndifferent temporal granularities to validate the state-of-the-art methods. We\nstudy the behavior of the addresses over different time granularities of the\ndataset. We identify that after applying change-address clustering, in Bitcoin,\nexisting temporal features can be extracted and ML approaches can be applied. A\ncomparative analysis of results show that the behavior of addresses in Ethereum\nand Bitcoin is similar with respect to in-degree, out-degree and inter-event\ntime. Further, we identify 3 suspects that showed malicious behavior across\ndifferent temporal granularities. These suspects are not marked as malicious in\nBitcoin.",

            "summary": "This paper studies a fundamental problem regarding the security of blockchain\nPoW consensus on how the existence of multiple misbehaving miners influences\nthe profitability of selfish mining. Each selfish miner (or attacker\ninterchangeably) maintains a private chain and makes it public\nopportunistically for acquiring more rewards incommensurate to his Hash power.\nWe first establish a general Markov chain model to characterize the state\ntransition of public and private chains for Basic Selfish Mining (BSM), and\nderive the stationary profitable threshold of Hash power in closed-form. It\nreduces from 25% for a single attacker to below 21.48% for two symmetric\nattackers theoretically, and further reduces to around 10% with eight symmetric\nattackers experimentally. We next explore the profitable threshold when one of\nthe attackers performs strategic mining based on Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP) that only half of the attributes pertinent to a mining\nstate are observable to him. An online algorithm is presented to compute the\nnearly optimal policy efficiently despite the large state space and high\ndimensional belief space. The strategic attacker mines selfishly and more\nagilely than BSM attacker when his Hash power is relatively high, and mines\nhonestly otherwise, thus leading to a much lower profitable threshold. Last, we\nformulate a simple model of absolute mining revenue that yields an interesting\nobservation: selfish mining is never profitable at the first difficulty\nadjustment period, but replying on the reimbursement of stationary selfish\nmining gains in the future periods. The delay till being profitable of an\nattacker increases with the decrease of his Hash power, making blockchain\nminers more cautious on performing selfish mining.",

These algorithms are typically parameterized in the\nnumber of participants, and their correctness requires the existence of bounds\non message delays and on the relative speed of processes after reaching Global\nStabilization Time. These characteristics make partially synchronous algorithms\nparameterized in the number of processes, and parametric in time bounds, which\nrender automated verification of partially synchronous algorithms challenging.\nIn this paper, we present a case study on formal verification of both safety\nand liveness of the Chandra and Toueg failure detector that is based on partial\nsynchrony. To this end, we first introduce and formalize the class of symmetric\npoint-to-point algorithms that contains the failure detector. Second, we show\nthat these symmetric point-to-point algorithms have a cutoff, and the cutoff\nresults hold in three models of computation: synchrony, asynchrony, and partial\nsynchrony. As a result, one can verify them by model checking small instances,\nbut the verification problem stays parametric in time. Next, we specify the\nfailure detector and the partial synchrony assumptions in three frameworks:\nTLA+, IVy, and counter automata. Importantly, we tune our modeling to use the\nstrength of each method: (1) We are using counters to encode message buffers\nwith counter automata, (2) we are using first-order relations to encode message\nbuffers in IVy, and (3) we are using both approaches in TLA+. By running the\ntools for TLA+ and counter automata, we demonstrate safety for fixed time\nbounds. By running IVy, we prove safety for arbitrary time bounds. Moreover, we\nshow how to verify liveness of the failure detector by reducing the\nverification problem to safety verification. Thus, both properties are verified\nby developing inductive invariants with IVy.",

In addition to smart contract technology which defines how data should\nbe registered, gathered and processed, blockchain can be used as an IoT\nintermediary for mobile usage.

In contrast to mostly adopted\nFL approaches, which assume synchronous operation, we advocate an asynchronous\nmethod whereby model aggregation is done as clients submit their local updates.\nThe asynchronous setting fits well with the federated optimization idea in\npractical large-scale settings with heterogeneous clients. Thus, it potentially\nleads to higher efficiency in terms of communication overhead and idle periods.\nTo evaluate the learning completion delay of BC-enabled FL, we provide an\nanalytical model based on batch service queue theory. Furthermore, we provide\nsimulation results to assess the performance of both synchronous and\nasynchronous mechanisms. Important aspects involved in the BC-enabled FL\noptimization, such as the network size, link capacity, or user requirements,\nare put together and analyzed. As our results show, the synchronous setting\nleads to higher prediction accuracy than the asynchronous case. Nevertheless,\nasynchronous federated optimization provides much lower latency in many cases,\nthus becoming an appealing solution for FL when dealing with large datasets,\ntough timing constraints (e.g., near-real-time applications), or highly varying\ntraining data.",

We relate\norder fairness to the standard validity notions for consensus protocols and\nhighlight some limitations with the existing formalization. Based on this, we\nintroduce a new differential order fairness property that fixes these issues.\nWe also present the quick order-fair atomic broadcast protocol that guarantees\npayload message delivery in a differentially fair order and is much more\nefficient than existing order-fair consensus protocols. It works for\nasynchronous and for eventually synchronous networks with optimal resilience,\ntolerating corruptions of up to one third of the processes.

            "summary": "Over the past decade, blockchain technology has attracted a huge attention\nfrom both industry and academia because it can be integrated with a large\nnumber of everyday applications of modern information and communication\ntechnologies (ICT). Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture of blockchain enhances\nthese applications by providing strong security and trust-oriented guarantees,\nsuch as immutability, verifiability, and decentralization. Despite these\nincredible features that blockchain technology brings to these ICT\napplications, recent research has indicated that the strong guarantees are not\nsufficient enough and blockchain networks may still be prone to various\nsecurity, privacy, and reliability issues. In order to overcome these issues,\nit is important to identify the anomalous behaviour within the actionable time\nframe. In this article, we provide an in-depth survey regarding integration of\nanomaly detection models in blockchain technology. For this, we first discuss\nhow anomaly detection can aid in ensuring security of blockchain based\napplications. Then, we demonstrate certain fundamental evaluation metrics and\nkey requirements that can play a critical role while developing anomaly\ndetection models for blockchain. Afterwards, we present a thorough survey of\nvarious anomaly detection models from the perspective of each layer of\nblockchain. Finally, we conclude the article by highlighting certain important\nchallenges alongside discussing how they can serve as future research\ndirections for new researchers in the field.",

            "summary": "A Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is a function that takes a specified\nsequential time to be evaluated, but can be efficiently verified. VDFs are\nuseful in several applications ranging from randomness beacons to sustainable\nblockchains but are really rare in practice. Most of the VDFs are based on\nalgebraic assumptions like time-lock puzzle in unknown group orders [6, 8] and\nisogenies over pairing groups [4]. The number of modulo squaring required for\nverification in the time-lock puzzle based VDFs are proportional to their\nsecurity parameter. This paper proposes a verifiable delay function that\nrequires only 2- modulo squaring for verification. So the sequential effort\nrequired for verification is independent of the security parameter.",

            "summary": "Spectrum access system (SAS) is widely considered the de facto solution to\ncoordinating dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) and protecting incumbent users. The\ncurrent SAS paradigm prescribed by the FCC for the CBRS band and standardized\nby the WInnForum follows a centralized service model in that a spectrum user\nsubscribes to a SAS server for spectrum allocation service. This model,\nhowever, neither tolerates SAS server failures (crash or Byzantine) nor resists\ndishonest SAS administrators, leading to serious concerns on SAS system\nreliability and trustworthiness. This is especially concerning for the evolving\nDSS landscape where an increasing number of SAS service providers and\nheterogeneous user requirements are coming up. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel blockchain-based decentralized SAS architecture called BD-SAS\nthat provides SAS services securely and efficiently, without relying on the\ntrust of each individual SAS server for the overall system trustworthiness. In\nBD-SAS, a global blockchain (G-Chain) is used for spectrum regulatory\ncompliance while smart contract-enabled local blockchains (L-Chains) are\ninstantiated in individual spectrum zones for automating spectrum access\nassignment per user request. We hope our vision of a decentralized SAS, the\nBD-SAS architecture, and discussion on future challenges can open up a new\ndirection towards reliable spectrum management in a decentralized manner.",

The\ndevelopment of a blockchain-based business-critical application must be then\nconducted carefully, requiring a thorough justification of its dependability\nand security. To this end, this paper encourages an engineering perspective\nrooted in well-understood tools and concepts borrowed from the engineering of\nsafety-critical systems. Concretely, we use a justification framework, called\nCAE (Claim, Argument, Evidence), by following an approach based on assurance\ncases, in order to provide convincing arguments that a business-critical\nblockchain-based application is dependable and secure.

            "summary": "As Machine Learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly complex, one of the\ncentral challenges is their deployment at scale, such that companies and\norganizations can create value through Artificial Intelligence (AI). An\nemerging paradigm in ML is a federated approach where the learning model is\ndelivered to a group of heterogeneous agents partially, allowing agents to\ntrain the model locally with their own data. However, the problem of valuation\nof models, as well the questions of incentives for collaborative training and\ntrading of data/models, have received limited treatment in the literature. In\nthis paper, a new ecosystem of ML model trading over a trusted Blockchain-based\nnetwork is proposed. The buyer can acquire the model of interest from the ML\nmarket, and interested sellers spend local computations on their data to\nenhance that model's quality. In doing so, the proportional relation between\nthe local data and the quality of trained models is considered, and the\nvaluations of seller's data in training the models are estimated through the\ndistributed Data Shapley Value (DSV). At the same time, the trustworthiness of\nthe entire trading process is provided by the distributed Ledger Technology\n(DLT). Extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed approach shows a\ncompetitive run-time performance, with a 15\\% drop in the cost of execution,\nand fairness in terms of incentives for the participants.",

            "summary": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a system of financial products and services\nbuilt and delivered through smart contracts on various blockchains. In the past\nyear, DeFi has gained popularity and market capitalization. However, it has\nalso been connected to crime, in particular, various types of securities\nviolations. The lack of Know Your Customer requirements in DeFi poses\nchallenges to governments trying to mitigate potential offending in this space.\nThis study aims to uncover whether this problem is suited to a machine learning\napproach, namely, whether we can identify DeFi projects potentially engaging in\nsecurities violations based on their tokens' smart contract code. We adapt\nprior work on detecting specific types of securities violations across\nEthereum, building classifiers based on features extracted from DeFi projects'\ntokens' smart contract code (specifically, opcode-based features). Our final\nmodel is a random forest model that achieves an 80\\% F-1 score against a\nbaseline of 50\\%. Notably, we further explore the code-based features that are\nmost important to our model's performance in more detail, analyzing tokens'\nSolidity code and conducting cosine similarity analyses. We find that one\nelement of the code our opcode-based features may be capturing is the\nimplementation of the SafeMath library, though this does not account for the\nentirety of our features. Another contribution of our study is a new data set,\ncomprised of (a) a verified ground truth data set for tokens involved in\nsecurities violations and (b) a set of legitimate tokens from a reputable DeFi\naggregator. This paper further discusses the potential use of a model like ours\nby prosecutors in enforcement efforts and connects it to the wider legal\ncontext.",

Numerical analysis is\nconducted to investigate the quantitative relationship between the\nrelative-revenue-optimal mining strategy for malicious miners and two miner\nfeatures in Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. The quantitative analysis\nresults can assist honest miners in detecting whether there is any malicious\nminer in the system and setting the threshold of mining node's hash power in\norder to prevent malicious miners from making profit through selfish and\nstubborn mining.",

            "summary": "As enterprises embrace blockchain technology, many real-world applications\nhave been developed and deployed using permissioned blockchain platforms\n(access to network is controlled and given to only nodes with known\nidentities). Such blockchain platforms heavily depend on cryptography to\nprovide a layer of trust within the network, thus verification of cryptographic\nsignatures often becomes the bottleneck. The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature\nAlgorithm (ECDSA) is the most commonly used cryptographic scheme in\npermissioned blockchains. In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation\nof ECDSA signature verification on an FPGA, in order to improve the performance\nof permissioned blockchains that aim to use FPGA-based hardware accelerators.\n  We propose several optimizations for modular arithmetic (e.g., custom\nmultipliers and fast modular reduction) and point arithmetic (e.g., reduced\nnumber of point double and addition operations, and optimal width NAF\nrepresentation). Based on these optimized modular and point arithmetic modules,\nwe propose an ECDSA verification engine that can be used by any application for\nfast verification of ECDSA signatures. We further optimize our ECDSA\nverification engine for Hyperledger Fabric (one of the most widely used\npermissioned blockchain platforms) by moving carefully selected operations to a\nprecomputation block, thus simplifying the critical path of ECDSA signature\nverification. From our implementation on Xilinx Alveo U250 accelerator board\nwith target frequency of 250MHz, our ECDSA verification engine can perform a\nsingle verification in $760\\mu s$ resulting in a throughput of 1,315\nverifications per second, which is ~2.5x faster than state-of-the-art\nFPGA-based implementations. Our Hyperledger Fabric-specific ECDSA engine can\nperform a single verification in $368\\mu s$ with a throughput of 2,717\nverifications per second.",

One example of such is the Ethereum modular architecture, with\nits beacon chain, its execution chain, its Layer 2s, and soon its shards. These\ncan all be thought as separate blockchains, heavily inter-connected with one\nanother, and together forming an ecosystem. In this work, we call each of these\ninterconnected blockchains \"domains\", and study the manifestation of Maximal\nExtractable Value (MEV, a generalization of \"Miner Extractable Value\") across\nthem. In other words, we investigate whether there exists extractable value\nthat depends on the ordering of transactions in two or more domains jointly. We\nfirst recall the definitions of Extractable and Maximal Extractable Value,\nbefore introducing a definition of Cross-Domain Maximal Extractable Value. We\nfind that Cross-Domain MEV can be used to measure the incentive for transaction\nsequencers in different domains to collude with one another, and study the\nscenarios in which there exists such an incentive. We end the work with a list\nof negative externalities that might arise from cross-domain MEV extraction and\nlay out several open questions.

            "summary": "In recent years Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have been targeted\nincreasingly by sophisticated cyberattacks. Improving ICS security has drawn\nsignificant attention in the literature that emphasises the importance of Cyber\nThreat Intelligence (CTI) sharing in accelerating detection, mitigation, and\nprevention of cyberattacks. However, organisations are reluctant to exchange\nCTI due to fear of exposure, reputational damage, and lack of incentives.\nFurthermore, there has been limited discussion about the factors influencing\nparticipation in sharing CTI about ICS. The existing CTI-sharing platforms rely\non centralised trusted architectures that suffer from a single point of failure\nand risk companies' privacy as the central node maintains CTI details. In this\npaper, we address the needs of organisations involved in the management and\nprotection of ICS and present a novel framework that facilitates secure,\nprivate, and incentivised exchange of CTI related to ICS using blockchain. We\npropose a new blockchain-enabled framework that facilitates the secure\ndissemination of CTI data among multiple stakeholders in ICS. We provide the\nframework design, technical development and evaluate the framework's\nfeasibility in a real-world application environment using practical use-case\nscenarios. Our proposed design shows a more practical and efficient framework\nfor a CTI sharing network for ICS, including the bestowal and acknowledgment of\ndata privacy, trust barriers, and security issues ingrained in this domain.",

However, the existing code search models still have a semantic\ngap between code and query, and perform poorly on specialized queries of smart\ncontracts. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Modal Smart contract Code Search\n(MM-SCS) model. Specifically, we construct a Contract Elements Dependency Graph\n(CEDG) for MM-SCS as an additional modality to capture the data-flow and\ncontrol-flow information of the code. To make the model more focused on the key\ncontextual information, we use a multi-head attention network to generate\nembeddings for code features. In addition, we use a fine-tuned pretrained model\nto ensure the model's effectiveness when the training data is small. We\ncompared MM-SCS with four state-of-the-art models on a dataset with 470K (code,\ndocstring) pairs collected from Github and Etherscan. Experimental results show\nthat MM-SCS achieves an MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) of 0.572, outperforming four\nstate-of-the-art models UNIF, DeepCS, CARLCS-CNN, and TAB-CS by 34.2%, 59.3%,\n36.8%, and 14.1%, respectively.

            "summary": "Popular cryptocurrencies continue to face serious scalability issues due to\ntheir ever-growing blockchains. Thus, modern blockchain designs began to prune\nold blocks and rely on recent snapshots for their bootstrapping processes\ninstead. Unfortunately, established systems are often considered incapable of\nadopting these improvements. In this work, we present CoinPrune, our\nblock-pruning scheme with full Bitcoin compatibility, to revise this popular\nbelief. CoinPrune bootstraps joining nodes via snapshots that are periodically\ncreated from Bitcoin's set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set). Our\nscheme establishes trust in these snapshots by relying on CoinPrune-supporting\nminers to mutually reaffirm a snapshot's correctness on the blockchain. This\nway, snapshots remain trustworthy even if adversaries attempt to tamper with\nthem. Our scheme maintains its retrospective deployability by relying on\npositive feedback only, i.e., blocks containing invalid reaffirmations are not\nrejected, but invalid reaffirmations are outpaced by the benign ones created by\nan honest majority among CoinPrune-supporting miners. Already today, CoinPrune\nreduces the storage requirements for Bitcoin nodes by two orders of magnitude,\nas joining nodes need to fetch and process only 6 GiB instead of 271 GiB of\ndata in our evaluation, reducing the synchronization time of powerful devices\nfrom currently 7 h to 51 min, with even larger potential drops for less\npowerful devices. CoinPrune is further aware of higher-level application data,\ni.e., it conserves otherwise pruned application data and allows nodes to\nobfuscate objectionable and potentially illegal blockchain content from their\nUTXO set and the snapshots they distribute.",

            "summary": "Recently, phishing scams have posed a significant threat to blockchains.\nPhishing detectors direct their efforts in hunting phishing addresses. Most of\nthe detectors extract target addresses' transaction behavior features by random\nwalking or constructing static subgraphs. The random walking\nmethods,unfortunately, usually miss structural information due to limited\nsampling sequence length, while the static subgraph methods tend to ignore\ntemporal features lying in the evolving transaction behaviors. More\nimportantly, their performance undergoes severe degradation when the malicious\nusers intentionally hide phishing behaviors. To address these challenges, we\npropose TEGDetector, a dynamic graph classifier that learns the evolving\nbehavior features from transaction evolution graphs (TEGs). First, we cast the\ntransaction series into multiple time slices, capturing the target address's\ntransaction behaviors in different periods. Then, we provide a fast\nnon-parametric phishing detector to narrow down the search space of suspicious\naddresses. Finally, TEGDetector considers both the spatial and temporal\nevolutions towards a complete characterization of the evolving transaction\nbehaviors. Moreover, TEGDetector utilizes adaptively learnt time coefficient to\npay distinct attention to different periods, which provides several novel\ninsights. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Ethereum transaction dataset\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art detection\nperformance.",

Such projects as Bitcoin and\nEthereum have shifted the paradigm of how to transact value in a decentralized\nmanner, but their various core technologies have their own advantages and\ndisadvantages. This paper aims to describe an alternative to modern\ndecentralized financial networks by introducing the Humanode network. Humanode\nis a network safeguarded by cryptographically secure bio-authorized nodes.\nUsers will be able to deploy nodes by staking their encrypted biometric data.\nThis approach can potentially lead to the creation of a public, permissionless\nfinancial network based on consensus between equal human nodes with\nalgorithm-based emission mechanisms targeting real value growth and\nproportional emission. Humanode combines different technological stacks to\nachieve a decentralized, secure, scalable, efficient, consistent, immutable,\nand sustainable financial network: 1) a bio-authorization module based on\ncryptographically secure neural networks for the private classification of 3D\ntemplates of users' faces 2) a private Liveness detection mechanism for\nidentification of real human beings 3) a Substrate module as a blockchain layer\n4) a cost-based fee system 5) a Vortex decentralized autonomous organization\n(DAO) governing system 6) a monetary policy and algorithm, Fath, where monetary\nsupply reacts to real value growth and emission is proportional. All of these\nimplemented technologies have nuances that are crucial for the integrity of the\nnetwork.

Since blockchain runs as an immutable\ndistributed ledger, it has decentralized mechanisms with persistency,\nanonymity, and auditability, where transactions are jointly performed through\ncryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There\nhave been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from\ndifferent perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and\nsmart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data\nmanagement systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive\nsurvey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of\nblockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed\nAcyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms\ninto three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and\nblockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record\ntransactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the\ninternal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the\nstorage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works\nadvancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical\nchallenges. Furthermore, we lay out the future research directions for the\nblockchain data management systems.",

            "summary": "Spamming attacks are a serious concern for consensus protocols, as witnessed\nby recent outages of a major blockchain, Solana. They cause congestion and\nexcessive message delays in a real network due to its bandwidth constraints. In\ncontrast, longest chain (LC), an important family of consensus protocols, has\npreviously only been proven secure assuming an idealized network model in which\nall messages are delivered within bounded delay. This model-reality mismatch is\nfurther aggravated for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) LC where the adversary can spam the\nnetwork with equivocating blocks. Hence, we extend the network model to capture\nbandwidth constraints, under which nodes now need to choose carefully which\nblocks to spend their limited download budget on. To illustrate this point, we\nshow that 'download along the longest header chain', a natural download rule\nfor Proof-of-Work (PoW) LC, is insecure for PoS LC. We propose a simple rule\n'download towards the freshest block', formalize two common heuristics 'not\ndownloading equivocations' and 'blocklisting', and prove in a unified framework\nthat PoS LC with any one of these download rules is secure in\nbandwidth-constrained networks. In experiments, we validate our claims and\nshowcase the behavior of these download rules under attack. By composing\nmultiple instances of a PoS LC protocol with a suitable download rule in\nparallel, we obtain a PoS consensus protocol that achieves a constant fraction\nof the network's throughput limit even under worst-case adversarial strategies.",

            "summary": "Formalization of mathematics is the process of digitizing mathematical\nknowledge, which allows for formal proof verification as well as efficient\nsemantic searches. Given the large and ever-increasing gap between the set of\nformalized and unformalized mathematical knowledge, there is a clear need to\nencourage more computer scientists and mathematicians to solve and formalize\nmathematical problems together. With blockchain technology, we are able to\ndecentralize this process, provide time-stamped verification of authorship and\nencourage collaboration through implementation of incentive mechanisms via\nsmart contracts. Currently, the formalization of mathematics is done through\nthe use of proof assistants, which can be used to verify programs and protocols\nas well. Furthermore, with the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI),\nparticularly machine learning, we can apply automated AI reasoning tools in\nthese proof assistants and (at least partially) automate the process of\nsynthesizing proofs. In our paper, we demonstrate a blockchain-based system for\ncollaborative formalization of mathematics and programs incorporating both\nhuman labour as well as automated AI tools. We explain how Token-Curated\nRegistries (TCR) and smart contracts are used to ensure appropriate documents\nare recorded and encourage collaboration through implementation of incentive\nmechanisms respectively. Using an illustrative example, we show how formalized\nproofs of different sorting algorithms can be produced collaboratively in our\nproposed blockchain system.",

The server in a federated learning\n(FL) environment can fulfill any linear computation on private inputs of users\nthrough the secure linear aggregation. At present, based on pseudo-random\nnumber generator and one-time padding technique, one can efficiently compute\nthe sum of user inputs in FL, but linear calculations of user inputs are not\nwell supported. Based on decentralized threshold additive homomorphic\nencryption (DTAHE) schemes, this paper provides a secure linear aggregation\nprotocol, which allows the server to multiply the user inputs by any\ncoefficients and to sum them together, so that the server can build a full\nconnected layer or a convolution layer on top of user inputs. The protocol\nadopts the framework of Bonawitz et al. to provide fault tolerance for user\ndropping out, and exploits a blockchain smart contract to encourage the server\nhonest. The paper gives a security model, security proofs and a concrete\nlattice based DTAHE scheme for the protocol. It evaluates the communication and\ncomputation costs of known DTAHE construction methods. The evaluation shows\nthat an elliptic curve based DTAHE is friendly to users and the lattice based\nversion leads to a light computation on the server.",

            "summary": "The metaverse is regarded as a new wave of technological transformation that\nprovides a virtual space for people to interact through digital avatars. To\nachieve immersive user experiences in the metaverse, real-time rendering is the\nkey technology. However, computing-intensive tasks of real-time rendering from\nmetaverse service providers cannot be processed efficiently on a single\nresource-limited mobile device. Alternatively, such mobile devices can offload\nthe metaverse rendering tasks to other mobile devices by adopting the\ncollaborative computing paradigm based on Coded Distributed Computing (CDC).\nTherefore, this paper introduces a hierarchical game-theoretic CDC framework\nfor the metaverse services, especially for the vehicular metaverse. In the\nframework, idle resources from vehicles, acting as CDC workers, are aggregated\nto handle intensive computation tasks in the vehicular metaverse. Specifically,\nin the upper layer, a miner coalition formation game is formulated based on a\nreputation metric to select reliable workers. To guarantee the reliable\nmanagement of reputation values, the reputation values calculated based on the\nsubjective logical model are maintained in a blockchain database. In the lower\nlayer, a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism is considered to attract\nreliable workers selected in the upper layer to participate in rendering tasks.\nThe simulation results illustrate that the proposed framework is resistant to\nmalicious workers. Compared with the best-effort worker selection scheme, the\nproposed scheme can improve the utility of metaverse service provider and the\naverage profit of CDC workers.",

These\nblockchain platforms are not able to interact with each other or with the\noutside world since only little emphasis is placed on the interoperability\nbetween them. Already proposed solutions for blockchain interoperability such\nas naive relay or oracle solutions are usually not broadly applicable since\nthey are either too expensive to operate or very resource-intensive.\n  For that reason, we propose a blockchain interoperability oracle that follows\na voting-based approach based on threshold signatures. The oracle nodes\ngenerate a distributed private key to execute an off-chain aggregation\nmechanism to collectively respond to requests. Compared to state-of-the-art\nrelay schemes, our approach does not incur any ongoing costs and since the\non-chain component only needs to verify a single signature, we can achieve\nremarkable cost savings compared to conventional oracle solutions.",

In this paper we are\nexamining a specific class of AMMs called Constant Function Market Makers whose\ntrading profile, ignoring fees, is determined by their bonding curve. This\nclass of AMM suffers from what is commonly referred to as Impermanent Loss,\nwhich we have previously identified as the Gamma component of the associated\nself-financing trading strategy and which is the risk that LP providers wager\nagainst potential fee earnings.\n  The recent Uniswap v3 release has popularized the concept of leveraged\nliquidity provision - wherein the trading range in which liquidity is provided\nis reduced and achieves a higher degree of capital efficiency through\nelimination of unused collateral. This leverage increases the fees earned, but\nit also increases the risk taken, ie the IL. Fee levels on Uniswap v3 are well\npublicized so, in this paper, we focus on calculating the IL.\n  We found that for the 17 pools we analyzed, covering 43% of TVL and chosen by\nsize, composite tokens and data availability, total fees earned since inception\nuntil the cut-off date was $199.3m. We also found that the total IL suffered by\nLPs during this period was USD 260.1m, meaning that in aggregate those LPs\nwould have been better off by USD 60.8m had they simply HODLd.",

Pooled PoS operation, to be effective\nand not lead to sub-optimal dictatorial or cartel-like configurations, should\nenable the stakeholders to revoke and re-delegate their stake in a way that is\naligned with their incentives. However, given that stake-pool operators are\nexactly those entities who determine what transactions are to be recorded in\nthe ledger, they are quite likely to form a cartel and censor any transaction\nthey want, such as those that attempt to adjust the current stake-pool lineup.\nIn this way, a power grab takes place, where the stake-pool cartel perpetuates\nits control over the PoS system. We first model and observe formally the\nemergence of the above problem in pooled PoS systems, and then we describe an\nanti-censorship mechanism that takes advantage of the underlying cryptographic\nfunctions of the ledger and the nature of peer-to-peer networks to diffuse\ninformation without suppression. We provide a thorough game-theoretic analysis\nof this mechanism discovering various types of Nash equilibria which\ndemonstrate that the ``revolution'', i.e., the strategic decision of pool\nmembers to withdraw support from a censoring cartel as well as the pool\noperators to step down, can be incentivized, under suitable and plausible\nconditions in the utility functions of the involved participants.",

In this paper we investigate the\nconvergence of IOTA consensus algorithms: Fast Probabilistic Consensus and\nCellular Consensus, when run on top of various topologies. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate their resilience to various types of adversaries. Our extensive\nsimulations show that both Cellular Consensus and Fast Probabilistic Consensus\nhave poor convergence rates even under low power adversaries and have poor\nscaling performances except for the case of Watts Strogatz topologies.

That is, in a\nhigh-level template for \"correct-by-construction\" consensus protocols, it is\nshown that a proposition and its negation cannot both be safe in protocol\nstates that have executions to some common state. This is in fact true for any\ninconsistent propositions and the proof requires only intuitionistic reasoning.\nThis opens the door for work on consensus protocols in the internal language of\na topos. As a first pass on such a program, the main contribution of this paper\nis the formulation of estimate safety in abstract correct-by-construction\nprotocols as a forcing statement in the internal logic of a given topos. This\nis illustrated first in the setting of copresheaf toposes. It is also seen\nthere that safety can be viewed as a modal statement. For these\ninterpretations, some extensions and adaptations of results in the literature\non modal operators in toposes are presented. The final reformulation of\nestimate safety is a completely elementary version in the language of an\narbitrary topos where it is seen that estimate safety is equivalent to a\ncertain forcing statement.",

Instead of resorting to a\nrandom oracle model, we implement a quantum randomness service. This service\ngenerates random numbers certified by the loophole-free Bell test and delivers\nthem with postquantum cryptography (PQC) authentication.

In this\narticle, we first introduce the integration of TL and 6G-enbaled IoV and\nprovide TL applications for 6G-enabled IoV. We then design a secure and\nreliable transfer learning framework by using reputation to evaluate the\nreliability of pre-trained models and utilizing the consortium blockchain to\nachieve secure and efficient decentralized reputation management. Moreover, a\ndeep learning-based auction scheme for the TL model market is designed to\nmotivate high-reputation vehicles to participate in model sharing. Finally, the\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is secure and\nreliable with well-design incentives for TL in 6G-enabled IoV.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technologies have been boosting the development of data-driven\ndecentralized services in a wide range of fields. However, with the spirit of\nfull transparency, many public blockchains expose all types of data to the\npublic such as Ethereum. Besides, the on-chain persistence of large data is\nsignificantly expensive technically and economically. These issues lead to the\ndifficulty of sharing fairly large private data while preserving attractive\nproperties of public blockchains. Although direct encryption for on-chain data\npersistence can introduce confidentiality, new challenges such as key sharing,\naccess control, and legal rights proving are still open. Meanwhile, cross-chain\ncollaboration still requires secure and effective protocols, though\ndecentralized storage systems such as IPFS bring the possibility for fairly\nlarge data persistence. In this paper, we propose Sunspot, a decentralized\nframework for privacy-preserving data sharing with access control on\ntransparent public blockchains, to solve these issues. We also show the\npracticality and applicability of Sunspot by MyPub, a decentralized\nprivacy-preserving publishing platform based on Sunspot. Furthermore, we\nevaluate the security, privacy, and performance of Sunspot through theoretical\nanalysis and experiments.",

            "summary": "In blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, users compete in a transaction\nfee auction to get their transactions confirmed in the next block. A line of\nrecent works set forth the desiderata for a \"dream\" transaction fee mechanism\n(TFM), and explored whether such a mechanism existed. A dream TFM should\nsatisfy 1) user incentive compatibility (UIC), i.e., truthful bidding should be\na user's dominant strategy; 2) miner incentive compatibility (MIC), i.e., the\nminer's dominant strategy is to faithfully implement the prescribed mechanism;\nand 3) miner-user side contract proofness (SCP), i.e., no coalition of the\nminer and one or more user(s) can increase their joint utility by deviating\nfrom the honest behavior. The weakest form of SCP is called 1-SCP, where we\nonly aim to provide resilience against the collusion of the miner and a single\nuser. Sadly, despite the various attempts, to the best of knowledge, no\nexisting mechanism can satisfy all three properties in all situations.\n  Since the TFM departs from classical mechanism design in modeling and\nassumptions, to date, our understanding of the design space is relatively\nlittle. In this paper, we further unravel the mathematical structure of\ntransaction fee mechanism design by proving the following results:\n  - Can we have a dream TFM?\n  - Rethinking the incentive compatibility notions.\n  - Do the new design elements make a difference?",

In\naddition, with miners' financial interest playing a significant role in\nchoosing transactions from the backlog, small fee or small fee per byte value\ntransactions will exhibit more delays. To study the issues related to the\nsystem's performance, we developed an $M(t)/M^N/1$ model. The backlog's arrival\nfollows an inhomogeneous Poison process to the system that has infinite buffer\ncapacity, and the service time is distributed exponentially, which removes $N$\ntransactions at time. Besides validating the model with measurement data, we\nhave used the model to study the reward distribution when miners take\ntransaction selection strategies like fee per byte, fee-based, and FIFO. The\nanalysis shows that smaller fee transactions exhibit higher waiting times, even\nwith increasing the block size. Moreover, the miner transaction selection\nstrategy impacts the final gain.",

SPEEDEX runs entirely within a Layer-1 blockchain, and\nthus achieves its scalability without fragmenting market liquidity between\nmultiple blockchains or rollups. It eliminates internal arbitrage\nopportunities, so that a direct trade from asset $\\mathcal{A}$ to asset\n$\\mathcal{B}$ always receives as good a price as trading through some third\nasset such as USD. Finally, it prevents certain front-running attacks that\nwould otherwise increase the effective bid-ask spread for small traders.\nSPEEDEX's key design insight is its use of an Arrow-Debreu exchange market\nstructure that fixes the valuation of assets for all trades in a given block of\ntransactions. We construct an algorithm, which is both asymptotically efficient\nand empirically practical, that computes these valuations while exactly\npreserving a DEX's financial correctness constraints. Not only does this market\nstructure provide fairness across trades, but it also makes trade operations\ncommutative and hence efficiently parallelizable. SPEEDEX is prototyped but not\nyet merged within the Stellar blockchain, one of the largest Layer-1\nblockchains.",

Having the option of locking the energy tokens by a\nthird-party escrow becomes a highly desirable feature. Thus, we define a\nLockable ERC20 token that provides the option for an owner to lock some of its\ntokens using smart contracts. A time-lock and an escrow party account or smart\ncontract can be specified allowing the tokens to be unlocked when certain\nbusiness conditions are met. For validation purposes, we have considered a\npeer-to-peer energy trading scenario in which the Lockable ERC20 token was used\nto digitize the surplus of energy of prosumers. In this case, the energy tokens\ncommitted in blockchain transactions are successfully locked up until the\nactual delivery of energy, the settlement considering the monitored data of\nenergy meters.",

In this paper, we explore a novel approach to support\nenergy storage sharing with privacy protection, based on privacy-preserving\nblockchain and secure multi-party computation. We present an integrated\nsolution to enable privacy-preserving energy storage sharing, such that energy\nstorage service scheduling and cost-sharing can be attained without the\nknowledge of individual users' demands. It also supports auditing and\nverification by the grid operator via blockchain. Furthermore, our\nprivacy-preserving solution can safeguard against a dishonest majority of\nusers, who may collude in cheating, without requiring a trusted third-party. We\nimplemented our solution as a smart contract on real-world Ethereum blockchain\nplatform, and provide empirical evaluation in this paper.",

            "summary": "Blockchain systems need to solve consensus despite the presence of rational\nusers and failures. The notion of $(k,t)$-robustness has shown instrumental to\nlist problems that cannot be solved if $k$ players are rational and $t$ players\nare Byzantine or act arbitrarily. What is less clear is whether one can solve\nsuch problems if the faults are benign.\n  In this paper, we bridge the gap between games that are robust against\nByzantine players and games that are robust against crash players. Our first\nresult is an impossibility result:\n  We show that no $(k,t)$-robust consensus protocol can solve consensus in the\ncrash model if $k+2t\\geq n$ unless there is a particular punishment strategy,\ncalled the $(k,t)$-baiting strategy. This reveals the need to introduce baiting\nas the act of rewarding a colluding node when betraying its coalition, to make\nblockchains more secure.\n  Our second result is an equivalence relation between crash fault tolerant\ngames and Byzantine fault tolerant games, which raises an interesting research\nquestion on the power of baiting to solve consensus. To this end, we show, on\nthe one hand, that a $(k,t)$-robust consensus protocol becomes $(k+t,t)$-robust\nin the crash model. We show, on the other hand, that the existence of a\n$(k,t)$-robust consensus protocol in the crash model that does not make use of\na baiting strategy implies the existence of a $(k-t,t)$-robust consensus\nprotocol in the Byzantine model, with the help of cryptography.",

The exchange of model updates is\nmanaged either by a central entity or in a decentralized way, e.g. by a\nblockchain. However, the strong generalization across all clients makes these\napproaches unsuited for non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID)\ndata.\n  We propose a unified approach to decentralization and personalization in\nfederated learning that is based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of model\nupdates. Instead of training a single global model, clients specialize on their\nlocal data while using the model updates from other clients dependent on the\nsimilarity of their respective data. This specialization implicitly emerges\nfrom the DAG-based communication and selection of model updates. Thus, we\nenable the evolution of specialized models, which focus on a subset of the data\nand therefore cover non-IID data better than federated learning in a\ncentralized or blockchain-based setup.\n  To the best of our knowledge, the proposed solution is the first to unite\npersonalization and poisoning robustness in fully decentralized federated\nlearning. Our evaluation shows that the specialization of models emerges\ndirectly from the DAG-based communication of model updates on three different\ndatasets. Furthermore, we show stable model accuracy and less variance across\nclients when compared to federated averaging.",

Abusing the\nsingle point of failure in the SDN controller component, hackers can shut down\nall network operations. More specifics, a malicious OpenFlow application can\naccess to SDN controller to carry out harmful actions without any limitation\nowing to the lack of the access control mechanism as a standard in the\nNorthbound. The sensitive information about the whole network such as network\ntopology, flow information, and statistics can be gathered and leaked out.

However, the\nadoption of UAV-assisted applications will strongly rely on the provision of\nreliable systems that allow managing UAV operations at high levels of safety\nand security. Recently, the concept of UAV traffic management (UTM) has been\nintroduced to support safe, efficient, and fair access to low-altitude airspace\nfor commercial UAVs. A UTM system identifies multiple cooperating parties with\ndifferent roles and levels of authority to provide real-time services to\nairspace users. However, current UTM systems are centralized and lack a clear\ndefinition of protocols that govern a secure interaction between authorities,\nservice providers, and end-users. The lack of such protocols renders the UTM\nsystem unscalable and prone to various cyber attacks. Another limitation of the\ncurrently proposed UTM architecture is the absence of an efficient mechanism to\nenforce airspace rules and regulations. To address this issue, we propose a\ndecentralized UTM protocol that controls access to airspace while ensuring high\nlevels of integrity, availability, and confidentiality of airspace operations.\nTo achieve this, we exploit key features of the blockchain and smart contract\ntechnologies. In addition, we employ a mobile crowdsensing (MCS) mechanism to\nseamlessly enforce airspace rules and regulations that govern the UAV\noperations. The solution is implemented on top of the Etheruem platform and\nverified using four different smart contract verification tools. We also\nprovided a security and cost analysis of our solution. For reproducibility, we\nmade our implementation publicly available on Github.",

The communications crossing domains between smart cities is\nindispensable to enhance collaborations.

In this paper, we propose a\nlightweight two-layer blockchain mechanism for reliable crossing-domain\ncommunication in smart cities. Our mechanism provides a reliable communication\nmechanism for data sharing and communication between smart cities. We defined a\ntwo-layer blockchain structure for the communications inner and between smart\ncities to achieve reliable communications. We present a new block structure for\nthe lightweight IoT devices. Moreover, we present a reputation-based\nmulti-weight consensus protocol in order to achieve efficient communication\nwhile resistant to the nodes collusion attack for the proposed blockchain\nsystem. We also conduct a secure analysis to demonstrate the security of the\nproposed scheme. Finally, performance evaluation shows that our scheme is\nefficient and practical.",

We therefore\npresent a novel Variational Bayesian Inference approach to incorporate a\ntime-varying parameter auto-regressive model which is scalable for big data.\nOur model is applied to a large blockchain dataset containing prices,\ntransactions of individual actors, analyzing transactional flows and price\nmovements on a very granular level.

This paper presents LayerZero, the first trustless omnichain\ninteroperability protocol, which provides a powerful, low level communication\nprimitive upon which a diverse set of cross-chain applications can be built.\nUsing this new primitive, developers can implement seamless inter-chain\napplications like a cross-chain DEX or multi-chain yield aggregator without\nhaving to rely on a trusted custodian or intermediate transactions. Simply put,\nLayerZero is the first system to trustlessly enable direct transactions across\nall chains. Allowing transactions to flow freely between chains provides\nopportunities for users to consolidate fragmented pockets of liquidity while\nalso making full use of applications on separate chains.

We then perform unique analyses of this\ndataset at three levels, including (i) file-level vulnerable module\ncategorization by identifying and correlating module paths across projects,\n(ii) text-level vulnerability type clustering by natural language processing\nand similarity-based sentence clustering, and (iii) code-level vulnerability\npattern analysis by generating and clustering code change signatures that\ncapture both syntactic and semantic information of patch code fragments. Our\nanalyses reveal three key findings: (i) some blockchain modules are more\nsusceptible than the others; notably, each of the modules related to consensus,\nwallet, and networking has over 200 issues; (ii) about 70% of blockchain\nvulnerabilities are of traditional types, but we also identify four new types\nspecific to blockchains; and (iii) we obtain 21 blockchain-specific\nvulnerability patterns that capture unique blockchain attributes and statuses,\nand demonstrate that they can be used to detect similar vulnerabilities in\nother popular blockchains, such as Dogecoin, Bitcoin SV, and Zcash.",

            "summary": "Most public blockchain protocols, including the popular Bitcoin and Ethereum\nblockchains, do not formally specify the order in which miners should select\ntransactions from the pool of pending (or uncommitted) transactions for\ninclusion in the blockchain. Over the years, informal conventions or \"norms\"\nfor transaction ordering have, however, emerged via the use of shared software\nby miners, e.g., the GetBlockTemplate (GBT) mining protocol in Bitcoin Core.\nToday, a widely held view is that Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions based\non their offered \"transaction fee-per-byte.\" Bitcoin users are, consequently,\nencouraged to increase the fees to accelerate the commitment of their\ntransactions, particularly during periods of congestion. In this paper, we\naudit the Bitcoin blockchain and present statistically significant evidence of\nmining pools deviating from the norms to accelerate the commitment of\ntransactions for which they have (i) a selfish or vested interest, or (ii)\nreceived dark-fee payments via opaque (non-public) side-channels. As\nblockchains are increasingly being used as a record-keeping substrate for a\nvariety of decentralized (financial technology) systems, our findings call for\nan urgent discussion on defining neutrality norms that miners must adhere to\nwhen ordering transactions in the chains. Finally, we make our data sets and\nscripts publicly available.",

Many countries have introduced various\nenergy policy instruments, such as renewable energy certificates (RECs), to\nsupport the growth of RES. RECs are tradable non-tangible assets, which have a\nmonetary value. Tracking and certification of the origin of an energy resource\nregardless of its type (e.g., a conventional power plant or RES) is a critical\noperation. In addition to the certification of origin, trading transactions are\nneeded to be performed using a secure method. Energy industry participants need\nto secure the data and applications related to RECs. Distributed ledger\ntechnology (DLT) is a perfect framework that can support such REC\nfunctionalities. This paper addresses the cybersecurity aspects in REC trading\nusing Blockchain and a distributed ledger technology, considering detailed\ncybersecurity perspectives.",

To increase the capability of an\nIDS, researchers proposed the concept of blockchain-based Collaborative-IDS\n(CIDS), wherein blockchain acts as a decentralised platform allowing\ncollaboration between CIDS nodes to share intrusion related information, such\nas intrusion alarms and detection rules. However, proposals in blockchain-based\nCIDS overlook the importance of continuous evaluation of the trustworthiness of\neach node and generally work based on the assumption that the nodes are always\nhonest. In this paper, we propose a decentralised CIDS that emphasises the\nimportance of building trust between CIDS nodes. In our proposed solution, each\nCIDS node exchanges detection rules to help other nodes detect new types of\nintrusion. Our architecture offloads the trust computation to the blockchain\nand utilises a decentralised storage to host the shared trustworthy detection\nrules, ensuring scalability. Our implementation in a lab-scale testbed shows\nthat the our solution is feasible and performs within the expected benchmarks\nof the Ethereum platform.",

To overcome these issues, several research works have proposed\nblockchain-based data-sharing solutions for their ability to add transparency\nand control to the data-sharing process. Yet, while models for decentralized\ndata sharing exist, how to incentivize these structures to enable data sharing\nat scale remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose incentive\nmechanisms for decentralized data-sharing platforms. We use smart contracts to\nautomate different payment options between data owners and data requesters. We\ndiscuss multiple cost pricing scenarios for data owners to monetize their data.\nMoreover, we simulate the incentive mechanisms on a blockchain-based\ndata-sharing platform. The evaluation of our simulation indicates that a cost\ncompensation model for the data owner can rapidly cover the cost of data\nsharing and balance the overall incentives for all the actors in the platform.",

This notion of\ninteroperability of medical device data is possible through an Application\nProgramming Interface (API), which serves as a versatile endpoint for all\nincoming medical device data, a distributed file system that ensures data\nresilience, and knowledge templates that analyze, identify, and represent\nmedical device data to providers.

Traditionally, such\nscenarios are handled by game-theoretic escrow smart contracts, such as\nBitHalo.

We also show that, unlike the case of auctions, this flaw cannot be\naddressed by a commitment-scheme-based approach. We then provide a much more\ngeneral result: assuming that the two sides are rational actors and the smart\ncontract language is Turing-complete, there is no escrow smart contract that\ncan facilitate this exchange without either relying on third parties or\nenabling at least one side to extort the other.",

            "summary": "In a PoW-based blockchain network, mining pools (the solo miner could be\nregarded as a mining pool containing one miner) compete to successfully mine\nblocks to pursue rewards. Generally, the rewards include the fixed block\nsubsidies and time-varying transaction fees. The transaction fees are offered\nby the senders whose transactions are packaged into blocks and is increasing\nwith the block size. However, the larger size of a block brings the longer\nlatency, resulting in a smaller probability of successfully mining. Therefore,\nfinding the optimal block size to trade off these two factors is a complex and\ncrucial problem for the mining pools. In this paper, we model a repeated mining\ncompetition dynamics in blockchain system as an evolutionary game to study the\ninteractions among mining pools. In this game, each pool has two strategies: to\nfollow the default size $\\bar{B}$, i.e., the upper bound of a block size, or\nnot follow. Because of the bounded rationality, each mining pool pursues its\nevolutionary stable block size (ESS) according to the mining pools' computing\npower and other factors by continuous learning and adjustments during the whole\nmining process. A study framework is built for the general evolutionary game,\nbased on which we then theoretically explore the existence and stability of the\nESSs for a case of two mining pools. Numerical experiments with real Bitcoin\ndata are conducted to show the evolutionary decisions of mining pools and to\ndemonstrate the theoretical findings in this paper.",

            "summary": "We consider the following network model motivated, in particular, by\nblockchains and peer-to-peer live streaming. Data packet flows arrive at the\nnetwork nodes and need to be disseminated to all other nodes. Packets are\nrelayed through the network via links of finite capacity. A packet leaves the\nnetwork when it is disseminated to all nodes. Our focus is on two communication\ndisciplines, which determine the order in which packets are transmitted over\neach link, namely {\\em Random-Useful} (RU) and {\\em Oldest-Useful} (OU). We\nshow that RU has the maximum stability region in a general network. For the OU\nwe demonstrate that, somewhat surprisingly, it does {\\em not} in general have\nthe maximum stability region. We prove that OU does achieve maximum stability\nin the important special case of a symmetric network, given by the full graph\nwith equal capacities on all links and equal arrival rates at all nodes. We\nalso give other stability results, and compare different disciplines'\nperformances in a symmetric system via simulation. Finally, we study the\ncumulative delays experienced by a packet as it propagates through the\nsymmetric system, specifically the delay asymptotic behavior as $N \\to \\infty$.\nWe put forward some conjectures about this behavior, supported by heuristic\narguments and simulation experiments.",

A resolution\nto this challenge has emerged in the shape of blockchain architecture, which\nensures immutability of stored information, whilst remaining in an online\nstate. Blockchain technology achieves this through the serial attachment of\nset-sized parcels of data called blocks. Links (liken to a chain) between these\nblocks are implemented using a cryptographic seal created using mathematical\nfunctions on the data inside the blocks. Practical implementations of\nblockchain vary by different components, concepts, and terminologies.\nResearchers proposed various architectural models using different layers to\nimplement blockchain technologies. In this paper, we investigated those layered\narchitectures for different use cases. We identified essential layers and\ncomponents for a generalised blockchain architecture. We present a novel\nthree-tiered storage model for the purpose of logically defining and\ncategorising blockchain as a storage technology. We envision that this\ngeneralised model will be used as a guide when referencing and building any\nblockchain storage solution.",

A decent number of smart unmanned vehicles or UAS\nwill be sharing the national airspace for various purposes, such as express\ndelivery, surveillance, etc. However, the proliferation of UAS also brings\nchallenges considering the safe integration of them into the current Air\nTraffic Management (ATM) systems. Especially when the current Automatic\nDependent Surveillance Broadcasting (ADS-B) systems do not have message\nauthentication mechanisms, it can not distinguish whether an authorized UAS is\nusing the corresponding airspace. In this paper, we aim to address these\npractical challenges in two folds. We first use blockchain to provide a secure\nauthentication platform for flight plan approval and sharing between the\nexisting ATM facilities. We then use the fountain code to encode the\nauthentication payloads and adapt them into the de facto communication protocol\nof ATM. This maintains backward compatibility and ensures the verification\nsuccess rate under the noisy broadcasting channel. We simulate the realistic\nwireless communication scenarios and theoretically prove that our proposed\nauthentication framework is with low latency and highly compatible with\nexisting ATM communication protocols.",

In theory, the smaller the committee, the\nfaster the blockchain can reach consensus and the more it can scale. What's\nless clear, is whether such protocols ensure that honest committees can be\nconsistently elected, given blockchain users typically have limited information\non who to vote for. We show that the approval voting mechanism underlying most\nCBC protocols is complex and can lead to intractable optimal voting strategies.\nWe empirically characterize some simpler intuitive voting strategies that users\ntend to resort to in practice and prove that these nonetheless converge to\noptimality exponentially quickly in the number of voters.

            "summary": "Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) counting on the mobility of massive workers helps\nthe requestor accomplish various sensing tasks with more flexibility and lower\ncost. However, for the conventional MCS, the large consumption of communication\nresources for raw data transmission and high requirements on data storage and\ncomputing capability hinder potential requestors with limited resources from\nusing MCS. To facilitate the widespread application of MCS, we propose a novel\nMCS learning framework leveraging on blockchain technology and the new concept\nof edge intelligence based on federated learning (FL), which involves four\nmajor entities, including requestors, blockchain, edge servers and mobile\ndevices as workers. Even though there exist several studies on blockchain-based\nMCS and blockchain-based FL, they cannot solve the essential challenges of MCS\nwith respect to accommodating resource-constrained requestors or deal with the\nprivacy concerns brought by the involvement of requestors and workers in the\nlearning process. To fill the gaps, four main procedures, i.e., task\npublication, data sensing and submission, learning to return final results, and\npayment settlement and allocation, are designed to address major challenges\nbrought by both internal and external threats, such as malicious edge servers\nand dishonest requestors. Specifically, a mechanism design based data\nsubmission rule is proposed to guarantee the data privacy of mobile devices\nbeing truthfully preserved at edge servers; consortium blockchain based FL is\nelaborated to secure the distributed learning process; and a\ncooperation-enforcing control strategy is devised to elicit full payment from\nthe requestor.

It was shown to abstract a myriad of problems in\nwhich processes have to agree on a single value.

In such\nchallenging environments, malicious behavior is often modeled as adversarial\nByzantine faults. At OPODIS 2010, Moste}faoui and Raynal, in short, MR,\npresented a Byzantine- and intrusion-tolerant solution to consensus in which\nthe decided value cannot be a value proposed only by Byzantine processes. In\naddition to this validity property, MR has optimal resilience since it can deal\nwith up to t < n/3 Byzantine processes, where n is the number of processes. We\nnote that MR provides this multivalued consensus object (which accepts\nproposals taken from a set with a finite number of values) assuming the\navailability of a single Binary consensus object (which accepts proposals taken\nfrom the set {0,1}).\n  This work, which focuses on multivalued consensus, aims at the design of an\neven more robust solution than MR. Our proposal expands MR's fault-model with\nself-stabilization, a vigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to\ntolerating Byzantine and communication failures, self-stabilizing systems can\nautomatically recover after the occurrence of arbitrary transient-faults. These\nfaults represent any violation of the assumptions according to which the system\nwas designed to operate (provided that the algorithm code remains intact).\n  To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first self-stabilizing solution\nfor intrusion-tolerant multivalued consensus for asynchronous message-passing\nsystems prone to Byzantine failures.",

            "summary": "In the inter-domain network, a route leak occurs when a routing announcement\nis propagated outside of its intended scope, which is a violation of the agreed\nrouting policy. The route leaks can disrupt the internet traffic and cause\nlarge outages. The accurately detection of route leaks requires the share of AS\nbusiness relationship information of ASes. However, the business relationship\ninformation between ASes is confidential due to economic issues. Thus, ASes are\nusually unwilling to revealing this information to the other ASes, especially\ntheir competitors. Recent advancements in federated learning make it possible\nto share data while maintaining privacy. Motivated by this, in this paper we\nstudy the route leak problem by considering the privacy of business\nrelationships between ASes, and propose a method for route leak detection with\nprivacy guarantee by using blockchain-based federated learning framework, in\nwhich ASes can train a global detection model without revealing their business\nrelationships directly. Moreover, the proposed method provides a\nself-validation scheme by labeling AS triples with local routing policies,\nwhich mitigates route leaks' lack of ground truth. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod under a variety of datasets including unbalanced and balanced datasets.\nThe different deployment strategies of the proposed method under different\ntopologies are also examined. The results show that the proposed method has a\nbetter performance in detecting route leaks than a single AS detection\nregardless of whether using balanced or unbalanced datasets. In the analysis of\nthe deployment, the results show that ASes with more peers have more possible\nroute leaks and can contribute more on the detection of route leaks with the\nproposed method.",

We argue that understanding\nthe dynamics of blockchain ecosystems could provide unique insights that cannot\nbe achieved through studying a single static snapshot or a single blockchain\nnetwork alone. Based on billions of transaction records collected from three\nrepresentative and popular blockchain systems (Bitcoin, Ethereum and EOSIO)\nover 10 years, we conduct the first study on the evolution of multiple\nblockchain ecosystems from different perspectives.

This paper proposes a new\nfederated learning scheme, called FedGAN, to generate realistic COVID-19 images\nfor facilitating privacy-enhanced COVID-19 detection with generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) in edge cloud computing. Particularly, we first\npropose a GAN where a discriminator and a generator based on convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) at each edge-based medical institution alternatively are\ntrained to mimic the real COVID-19 data distribution. Then, we propose a new\nfederated learning solution which allows local GANs to collaborate and exchange\nlearned parameters with a cloud server, aiming to enrich the global GAN model\nfor generating realistic COVID-19 images without the need for sharing actual\ndata. To enhance the privacy in federated COVID-19 data analytics, we integrate\na differential privacy solution at each hospital institution. Moreover, we\npropose a new blockchain-based FedGAN framework for secure COVID-19 data\nanalytics, by decentralizing the FL process with a new mining solution for low\nrunning latency.

            "summary": "In distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) with a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\ndata structure, a message-issuing node can decide where to append that message\nand, consequently, how to grow the DAG. This DAG data structure can typically\nbe decomposed into two pools of messages: referenced messages and unreferenced\nmessages (tips). The selection of the parent messages to which a node appends\nthe messages it issues, depends on which messages it considers as tips.\nHowever, the exact time that a message enters the tip pool of a node depends on\nthe delay of that message. In previous works, it was considered that messages\nhave the same or similar delay; however, this generally may not be the case. We\nintroduce the concept of classes of delays, where messages belonging to a\ncertain class have a specific delay, and where these classes coexist in the\nDAG. We provide a general model that predicts the tip pool size for any finite\nnumber of different classes.\n  This categorisation and model is applied to the first iteration of the IOTA\n2.0 protocol (a.k.a. Coordicide), where two distinct classes, namely value and\ndata messages, coexist. We show that the tip pool size depends strongly on the\ndominating class that is present.

Actual adoption of these\nemerging technologies requires incorporating cost-effective, fast, QoS-enabled,\nsecure, and scalable design. With the recent advent of quantum computing, the\nsecurity of current blockchain cryptosystems can be compromised to a greater\nextent. Quantum algorithms like Shor's large integer factorization algorithm\nand Grover's unstructured database search algorithm can provide exponential and\nquadratic speedup, respectively, in contrast to their classical counterpart.\nThis can put threats on both public-key cryptosystems and hash functions, which\nnecessarily demands to migrate from classical cryptography to quantum-secure\ncryptography. Moreover, the computational latency of blockchain platforms\ncauses slow transaction speed, so quantum computing principles might provide\nsignificant speedup and scalability in transaction processing and accelerating\nthe mining process. For such purpose, this article first studies current and\nfuture classical state-of-the-art blockchain scalability and security\nprimitives. The relevant quantum-safe blockchain cryptosystem initiatives which\nhave been taken by Bitcoin, Ethereum, Corda, etc. are stated and compared with\nrespect to key sizes, hash length, execution time, computational overhead, and\nenergy efficiency. Post Quantum Cryptographic algorithms like Code-based,\nLattice-based, Multivariate-based, and other schemes are not well suited for\nclassical blockchain technology due to several disadvantages in practical\nimplementation.

            "summary": "From online education and trading, all aspects of our lives are affected by\ndigital technology. Among them, the storage of music has also entered the\ndigital era. Music productions created by artists have brought great joy to\npeople. However, when artists upload their works, they are most downloaded and\nreprinted by others, and copyright information and the issue associated with\nthe sharing of music arise. This will have a significant negative impact on the\nenthusiasm and motivation of artists. This paper provides an internet database\nplatform for artists, which uses the distributed and tamper-proof technology of\nthe Ethereum blockchain to store music works, and protect the copyright\ninformation of each album or music produced by artists in the music industry.\nDesign and implementation of the system model and data storage are proposed and\ndata storage processes based on the Ethereum smart contract are demonstrated in\ndetail. The system stores music information on the blockchain network, using\nthe smart contract to provide artists with a fast and efficient royalty\npayment. Node.js is applied to carry out the experiments of our system, and we\ntest Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) with available account and private keys for\ncontract development and use block explorer to track music information on the\nblockchain. Our system enables copyright revenue to be attributed to music\ncreators that will help to eliminate the illegal uploading of music on other\nwebsites.",

            "summary": "Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 was recently implemented to\ntransform Ethereum's transaction fee market. EIP-1559 utilizes an algorithmic\nupdate rule with a constant learning rate to estimate a base fee. The base fee\nreflects prevailing network conditions and hence provides a more reliable\noracle for current gas prices.\n  Using on-chain data from the period after its launch, we evaluate the impact\nof EIP-1559 on the user experience and market performance. Our empirical\nfindings suggest that although EIP-1559 achieves its goals on average,\nshort-term behavior is marked by intense, chaotic oscillations in block sizes\n(as predicted by our recent theoretical dynamical system analysis [1]) and slow\nadjustments during periods of demand bursts (e.g., NFT drops). Both phenomena\nlead to unwanted inter-block variability in mining rewards. To address this\nissue, we propose an alternative base fee adjustment rule in which the learning\nrate varies according to an additive increase, multiplicative decrease (AIMD)\nupdate scheme. Our simulations show that the latter robustly outperforms the\nEIP-1559 protocol under various demand scenarios. These results provide\nevidence that variable learning rate mechanisms may constitute a promising\nalternative to the default EIP-1559-based format and contribute to the ongoing\ndiscussion on the design of more efficient transaction fee markets.",

A\ncentral feature of such networks is variable communication bandwidth across\nnodes and across time. We present DispersedLedger, an asynchronous BFT protocol\nthat provides near-optimal throughput in the presence of such variable network\nbandwidth. The core idea of DispersedLedger is to enable nodes to propose,\norder, and agree on blocks of transactions without having to download their\nfull content. By enabling nodes to agree on an ordered log of blocks, with a\nguarantee that each block is available within the network and unmalleable,\nDispersedLedger decouples bandwidth-intensive block downloads at different\nnodes, allowing each to make progress at its own pace. We build a full system\nprototype and evaluate it on real-world and emulated networks. Our results on a\ngeo-distributed wide-area deployment across the Internet shows that\nDispersedLedger achieves 2x better throughput and 74% reduction in latency\ncompared to HoneyBadger, the state-of-the-art asynchronous protocol.",

            "summary": "Since the popularisation of the Internet in the 1990s, the cyberspace has\nkept evolving. We have created various computer-mediated virtual environments\nincluding social networks, video conferencing, virtual 3D worlds (e.g., VR\nChat), augmented reality applications (e.g., Pokemon Go), and Non-Fungible\nToken Games (e.g., Upland). Such virtual environments, albeit non-perpetual and\nunconnected, have bought us various degrees of digital transformation. The term\n`metaverse' has been coined to further facilitate the digital transformation in\nevery aspect of our physical lives. At the core of the metaverse stands the\nvision of an immersive Internet as a gigantic, unified, persistent, and shared\nrealm. While the metaverse may seem futuristic, catalysed by emerging\ntechnologies such as Extended Reality, 5G, and Artificial Intelligence, the\ndigital `big bang' of our cyberspace is not far away. This survey paper\npresents the first effort to offer a comprehensive framework that examines the\nlatest metaverse development under the dimensions of state-of-the-art\ntechnologies and metaverse ecosystems, and illustrates the possibility of the\ndigital `big bang'. First, technologies are the enablers that drive the\ntransition from the current Internet to the metaverse. We thus examine eight\nenabling technologies rigorously - Extended Reality, User Interactivity\n(Human-Computer Interaction), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Computer\nVision, IoT and Robotics, Edge and Cloud computing, and Future Mobile Networks.\nIn terms of applications, the metaverse ecosystem allows human users to live\nand play within a self-sustaining, persistent, and shared realm. Therefore, we\ndiscuss six user-centric factors -- Avatar, Content Creation, Virtual Economy,\nSocial Acceptability, Security and Privacy, and Trust and Accountability.\nFinally, we propose a concrete research agenda for the development of the\nmetaverse.",

In this\nmodel, information of transactions stored in a multi-qubit state are\nsubsequently encoded using the generalized Gram-Schmidt process. The chain is\ngenerated as a result of the reliance of orthogonalized state on the sequence\nof states preceding it. Various forking scenarios and their countermeasures are\nconsidered for the proposed model.

            "summary": "Allocation of resources and their control over multiple organisations is\nchallenging. This is especially true for a large-scale and dynamic system like\nthe Internet of Things (IoT). One of the core issues in such a system is the\nprovision of secure access control. In particular, transfer of access rights\nfrom one entity to another in a secure, flexible and fine-grained manner. In\nthis paper, we present a multi-organisational delegation framework using\nblockchain. Our framework takes advantage of blockchain smart contracts to\ndefine the interactions and resource allocation between the consortium of\norganisations. We show the feasibility of our solution in a real-world scenario\nusing the allocation of transportation credits in a multi-level organisational\nsetting as a use-case. We provide proof of implementation of the proposed\nframework using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. Our results\nindicate that the proposed framework is efficient and can be used for city-wide\ntransport, potentially even scale country-wide with a shared blockchain with\ncomplex access control rules. It also bestows better transparency to the\ndelegation of access rights and control over the employees' transportation\naccess for the organisations.",

            "summary": "Advances in blockchains have influenced the State-Machine-Replication (SMR)\nworld and many state-of-the-art blockchain-SMR solutions are based on two\npillars: Chaining and Leader-rotation. A predetermined round-robin mechanism\nused for Leader-rotation, however, has an undesirable behavior: crashed parties\nbecome designated leaders infinitely often, slowing down overall system\nperformance. In this paper, we provide a new Leader-Aware SMR framework that,\namong other desirable properties, formalizes a Leader-utilization requirement\nthat bounds the number of rounds whose leaders are faulty in crash-only\nexecutions. We introduce Carousel, a novel, reputation-based Leader-rotation\nsolution to achieve Leader-Aware SMR. The challenge in adaptive Leader-rotation\nis that it cannot rely on consensus to determine a leader, since consensus\nitself needs a leader. Carousel uses the available on-chain information to\ndetermine a leader locally and achieves Liveness despite this difficulty. A\nHotStuff implementation fitted with Carousel demonstrates drastic performance\nimprovements: it increases throughput over 2x in faultless settings and\nprovided a 20x throughput increase and 5x latency reduction in the presence of\nfaults.",

In\nsecond-generation blockchains such as Ethereum the ledger is coupled with smart\ncontracts, which enable the automation of transactions associated with\nagreements between the parties of a financial or commercial nature. The\ncoupling of smart contracts and ledgers provides the technological background\nfor very innovative application areas, such as Decentralized Autonomous\nOrganizations (DAOs), Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Decentralized Finance\n(DeFi), which propelled blockchains beyond cryptocurrencies that were the only\nfocus of first generation blockchains such as the Bitcoin. However, the\ncurrently used implementation of smart contracts as arbitrary programming\nconstructs has made them susceptible to dangerous bugs that can be exploited\nmaliciously and has moved their semantics away from that of legal contracts. We\npropose here to recompose the split and recover the reliability of databases by\nformalizing a notion of contract modelled as a finite-state automaton with\nwell-defined computational characteristics derived from an encoding in terms of\nallocations of resources to actors, as an alternative to the approach based on\nprogramming.

Due to the sensitivity of patient information,\npatient privacy seems challenging. Nowadays, patient data is usually stored in\nthe cloud in healthcare programs, making it difficult for users to have enough\ncontrol over their data. The recent increment in announced cases of security\nand surveillance breaches compromising patients' privacy call into question the\nconventional model, in which third-parties gather and control immense amounts\nof patients' Healthcare data. In this work, we try to resolve the issues\nmentioned above by using blockchain technology. We propose a blockchain-based\nprotocol suitable for e-health applications that does not require trust in a\nthird party and provides an efficient privacy-preserving access control\nmechanism. Transactions in our proposed system, unlike Bitcoin, are not\nentirely financial, and we do not use conventional methods for consensus\noperations in blockchain like Proof of Work (PoW). It is not suitable for IoT\napplications because IoT devices have resources-constraints. Usage of\nappropriate consensus method helps us to increase network security and\nefficiency, as well as reducing network cost, i.e., bandwidth and processor\nusage. Finally, we provide security and privacy analysis of our proposed\nprotocol.",

Moreover, we design a data\nsharing scheme which enables data exchanges among healthcare users by\nleveraging blockchain and interplanetary file system. Particularly, a smart\ncontract-based authentication mechanism is integrated with MEC to perform\ndecentralized user access verification at the network edge without requiring\nany central authority.

            "summary": "This paper describes BigBFT, a multi-leader Byzantine fault tolerance\nprotocol that achieves high throughput and scalable consensus in blockchain\nsystems. BigBFT achieves this by (1) enabling every node to be a leader that\ncan propose and order the blocks in parallel, (2) piggybacking votes within\nrounds, (3) pipelining blocks across rounds, and (4) using only two\ncommunication steps to order blocks in the common case.\n  BigBFT has an amortized communication cost of $O(n)$ over $n$ requests. We\nevaluate BigBFT's performance both analytically, using back-of-the-envelope\nload formulas to construct a cost analysis, and also empirically by\nimplementing it in our PaxiBFT framework. Our evaluation compares BigBFT with\nPBFT, Tendermint, Streamlet, and Hotstuff under various workloads using\ndeployments of 4 to 20 nodes. Our results show that BigBFT outperforms PBFT,\nTendermint, Streamlet, and Hotstuff protocols either in terms of latency (by up\nto $70\\%$) or in terms of throughput (by up to $190\\%$).",

We\nenvision a future payment network that may be built on top of DLT networks\nwithout being subject to their limitations on interoperability, scalability,\nand availability faced by DLT payment solutions today. Specifically, we propose\na hub-and-spoke payment route, referred to here as Universal Payment Channels\n(UPC), that can be used to support digital token transfers of funds across\ndifferent networks through payment channels.

In this paper, we trace the\nevolution of two interrelated notions: failure and fault-tolerance. In\nclassical distributed computing, a failure to complete a multi-party protocol\nis typically attributed to hardware malfunctions. A fault-tolerant protocol is\none that responds to such failures by rolling the system back to an earlier\nconsistent state. In the presence of Byzantine failures, a failure may be the\nresult of an attack, and a fault-tolerant protocol is one that ensures that\nattackers will be punished and victims compensated. In modern decentralized\nfinance however, failure to complete a protocol can be considered a legitimate\noption, not a transgression. A fault-tolerant protocol is one that ensures that\nthe party offering the option cannot renege, and the party purchasing the\noption provides fair compensation (in the form of a fee) to the offering party.\nWe sketch the evolution of such protocols, starting with two-phase commit, and\nfinishing with timed hashlocked smart contracts.",

            "summary": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) have been designed and utilized to address\nthe scalability challenge and throughput limitation of blockchains. Routing is\na core problem of PCNs. An ideal PCN routing method needs to achieve 1) high\nscalability that can maintain low per-node memory and communication cost for\nlarge PCNs, 2) high resource utilization of payment channels, and 3) the\nprivacy of users. However, none of the existing PCN systems consider all these\nrequirements. In this work, we propose WebFlow, a distributed routing solution\nfor PCNs, which only requires each user to maintain localized information and\ncan be used for massive-scale networks with high resource utilization. We make\nuse of two distributed data structures: multi-hop Delaunay triangulation (MDT)\noriginally proposed for wireless networks and our innovation called distributed\nVoronoi diagram. We propose new protocols to generate a virtual Euclidean space\nin order to apply MDT to PCNs and use the distributed Voronoi diagram to\nenhance routing privacy. We conduct extensive simulations and prototype\nimplementation to further evaluate WebFlow. The results using real and\nsynthetic PCN topologies and transaction traces show that WebFlow can achieve\nextremely low per-node overhead and a high success rate compared to existing\nmethods.",

In this paper we present ChainBot, an approach for creating\nalgorithmic trading bots with the help of blockchain technology. We show how to\npartition the computation into on- and off-chain components in a way that\nprovides a measure of end-to-end integrity, while preserving the algorithmic\n\"secret sauce\". Our system is enabled with a careful use of algorithm\npartitioning, zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts. We also show that with\nlayer-2 (L2) technologies, trades can be kept private, which means that\nalgorithmic parameters are difficult to recover by a chain observer. Our\napproach offers more transparent access to liquidity and better\ncensorship-resistance compared to traditional off-chain trading approaches. We\ndevelop a sample ChainBot and train it on historical data, resulting in returns\nthat are up to 2.4x the buy-and-hold strategy, which we use as our baseline.\nOur measurements show that across 1000 runs, the end-to-end average execution\ntime for our system is 48.4 seconds. We demonstrate that the frequency of\ntrading does not significantly affect the rate of return and Sharpe ratio,\nwhich indicates that we do not have to trade at every block, thereby\nsignificantly saving in terms of gas fees.

Permissioned\nblockchains typically exhibit low latencies, compared to permissionless\ndeployments -- however at the cost of poor scalability. Various solutions were\nproposed to capture \"the best of both worlds\", targeting low latency and high\nscalability simultaneously, the most prominent technique being blockchain\nsharding. However, most existing sharding proposals exploit features of the\npermissionless model and are therefore restricted to cryptocurrency\napplications.\n  We present MITOSIS, a novel approach to practically improve scalability of\npermissioned blockchains. Our system allows the dynamic creation of\nblockchains, as more participants join the system, to meet practical\nscalability requirements. Crucially, it enables the division of an existing\nblockchain (and its participants) into two -- reminiscent of mitosis, the\nbiological process of cell division. MITOSIS inherits the low latency of\npermissioned blockchains while preserving high throughput via parallel\nprocessing. Newly created chains in our system are fully autonomous, can choose\ntheir own consensus protocol, and yet they can interact with each other to\nshare information and assets -- meeting high levels of interoperability. We\nanalyse the security of MITOSIS and evaluate experimentally the performance of\nour solution when instantiated over Hyperledger Fabric.

The integration of more and more\nembedded systems and IoT devices is pushing smart grids and I4.0 forward at a\nbreakneck speed. To cope up with this, the modification of age-old SCADA\n(Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems in terms of\ndecentralization, near-real-time operation, security, and privacy is necessary.\nIn this context, blockchain technology has the potential of providing not only\nthese essential features of the data acquisition process of future SCADA\nsystems but also many other useful add-ons. On the other side, it is evident\nthat various type of security breach tends to take place more during any\neconomic turmoil. These can cause even more serious devastation to the global\neconomy and human life. Thus, it is necessary to make our industries robust,\nautomated, and resilient with secured and immutable data acquiring systems.\nThis paper deals with the implementation scopes of blockchain in the data\nacquisition part of SCADA systems in the area of the smart grid and I4.0. There\nare several consensus mechanisms to support blockchain integration in the field\nof cryptocurrencies, vehicular networks, healthcare systems, e-commerce, etc.\nBut little attention has been paid to developing efficient and\neasy-to-implement consensus mechanisms in the field of blockchain-enabled SCADA\nsystems. From this perspective, a novel consensus mechanism, which we call\nPoRCH (Proof of Random Count in Hashes), with a customized mining node\nselection scheme has been proposed in this paper. Also, a small-scale prototype\nof a blockchain-enabled data acquisition system has been developed. The\nperformance evaluation of the implemented prototype shows the benefits of\nblockchain technology.",

Which of the\npublishers are publishing more such surveys and what are the lengths of the\npublished surveys? Which kind of survey is getting more citations? Which of the\nauthors is collaborating on such surveys? etc. All these questions motivated us\nto analyze the trends in publishing blockchain surveys. In this paper, we have\nperformed a bibliometric analysis on $801$ surveys or review papers published\nin the field of blockchain in the last approximately five years. We have\nanalyzed the papers with respect to the publication type, publishers and venue,\nreferences, citations, paper length, different categories, year, countries,\nauthors, and their collaborations and found interesting insights. To the best\nof our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind and hope to provide\nbetter understanding of the field.",

            "summary": "Once you have invented digital money, you may need a ledger to track who owns\nwhat -- and an interface to that ledger so that users of your money can\ntransact. On the Tezos blockchain this implies: a smart contract (distributed\nprogram), storing in its state a ledger to map owner addresses to token\nquantities, and standardised entrypoints to transact on accounts.\n  A bank does a similar job -- it maps account numbers to account quantities\nand permits users to transact -- but in return the bank demands trust, it\nincurs expense to maintain a centralised server and staff, it uses a\nproprietary interface ... and it may speculate using your money and/or display\nrent-seeking behaviour. A blockchain ledger is by design decentralised,\ninexpensive, open, and it won't just bet your tokens on risky derivatives\n(unless you ask).\n  The FA1.2 standard is an open standard for ledger-keeping smart contracts on\nthe Tezos blockchain. Several FA1.2 implementations already exist.\n  Or do they? Is the standard sensible and complete? Are the implementations\ncorrect? And what are they implementations \\emph{of}? The FA1.2 standard is\nwritten in English, a specification language favoured by wet human brains but\nnotorious for its incompleteness and ambiguity when rendered into dry and\nunforgiving code.\n  In this paper we report on a formalisation of the FA1.2 standard as a Coq\nspecification, and on a formal verification of three FA1.2-compliant smart\ncontracts with respect to that specification. Errors were found and ambiguities\nwere resolved; but also, there now exists a \\emph{mathematically precise} and\nbattle-tested specification of the FA1.2 ledger standard.\n  We will describe FA1.2 itself, outline the structure of the Coq theories --\nwhich in itself captures some non-trivial and novel design decisions of the\ndevelopment -- and review the detailed verification of the implementations.",

Despite the wide use of the terminologies of tokens\nand tokenisation in the cryptocurrency community, the underlying concept\nsometimes does not square well with the economic notions, or is even contrary\nto them. The UTXO design of Bitcoin exhibits partially characteristics of a\ntoken-based system and partially characteristics of an account-based system. A\ndiscussion on the difficulty to implement the economic notion of tokens in the\ndigital domain, along with an exposition of the design of UTXO, is given in\norder to discuss why UTXO-based systems should be viewed as account-based\naccording to the classical economic notion. Besides, a detailed comparison\nbetween UTXO-based systems and account-based systems is presented. Using the\ndata structure of the system state representation as the defining feature to\ndistinguish digital token-based and account-based systems is therefore\nsuggested. This extended definition of token-based systems covers both physical\nand digital tokens while neatly distinguishing token-based and account-based\nsystems.",

The software is organized as a\nmulti-level simulator that permits to simulate a virtual environment, made of\nmany nodes running the protocol of a specific Distributed Ledger Technology\n(DLT), such as the Bitcoin or the Ethereum blockchains. This virtual\nenvironment is executed on top of a lower-level Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network\noverlay, which can be structured based on different topologies and with a given\nnumber of nodes and edges. Functionalities at different levels of abstraction\nare managed separately, by different software modules and with different time\ngranularity. This allows for accurate simulations, where (and when) it is\nneeded, and enhances the simulation performance. Using LUNES-Blockchain, it is\npossible to simulate different types of attacks on the DLT. In this paper, we\nspecifically focus on the P2P layer, considering the selfish mining, the 51%\nattack and the Sybil attack. For which concerns selfish mining and the 51%\nattack, our aim is to understand how much the hash-rate (i.e. a general measure\nof the processing power in the blockchain network) of the attacker can\ninfluence the outcome of the misbehaviour. On the other hand, in the filtering\ndenial of service (i.e. Sybil Attack), we investigate which dissemination\nprotocol in the underlying P2P network makes the system more resilient to a\nvarying number of nodes that drop the messages. The results confirm the\nviability of the simulation-based techniques for the investigation of security\naspects of DLTs.",

In addition,\nwe perform a case study of OptChain, which is the state-of-the-art transaction\nplacement algorithm for sharded blockchains, and find a shortcoming of it. A\nsimple fix is proposed, and our evaluation results demonstrate that the\nproposed fix effectively helps OptChain overcome the shortcoming and\nsignificantly improve the system performance under a special workload.

In our protocol, only encrypted files are transferred. The cryptographic\nkey is stored in the world state in a secure way and can be accessed only by\nauthorized parties.

            "summary": "Single Secret Leader Elections have recently been proposed as an improved\nleader election mechanism for proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. However, the\nsecurity gain they provide has not been quantified. In this work, we present a\ncomparison of PoS longest-chain protocols that are based on Single Secret\nLeader Elections (SSLE) - that elect exactly one leader per round - versus\nthose based on Probabilistic Leader Elections (PLE) - where one leader is\nelected on expectation. Our analysis shows that when considering the private\nattack - the worst attack on longest-chain protocols - the security gained from\nusing SSLE is substantial: the settlement time is decreased by roughly 25% for\na 33% or 25% adversary. Furthermore, when considering grinding attacks, we find\nthat the security threshold is increased by 10% (from 0.26 in the PLE case to\n0.36 inthe SSLE case) and the settlement time is decreased by roughly 70% for a\n20% adversary in the SSLE case.",

            "summary": "Off-chain protocols constitute one of the most promising approaches to solve\nthe inherent scalability issue of blockchain technologies. The core idea is to\nlet parties transact on-chain only once to establish a channel between them,\nleveraging later on the resulting channel paths to perform arbitrarily many\npeer-to-peer transactions off-chain. While significant progress has been made\nin terms of proof techniques for off-chain protocols, existing approaches do\nnot capture the game-theoretic incentives at the core of their design, which\nled to overlooking significant attack vectors like the Wormhole attack in the\npast. In this work we take a first step towards a principled game-theoretic\nsecurity analysis of off-chain protocols by introducing the first\ngame-theoretic model that is expressive enough to reason about their security.\nWe advocate the use of Extensive Form Games (EFGs) and introduce two instances\nof EFGs to capture security properties of the closing and the routing of the\nLightning Network. Specifically, we model the closing protocol, which relies on\npunishment mechanisms to disincentivize parties to upload old channel states\non-chain. Moreover, we model the routing protocol, thereby formally\ncharacterizing the Wormhole attack, a vulnerability that undermines the\nfee-based incentive mechanism underlying the Lightning Network.",

            "summary": "Decentralized control, low-complexity, flexible and efficient communications\nare the requirements of an architecture that aims to scale blockchains beyond\nthe current state. Such properties are attainable by reducing ledger size and\nproviding parallel operations in the blockchain. Sharding is one of the\napproaches that lower the burden of the nodes and enhance performance. However,\nthe current solutions lack the features for resolving concurrency during\ncross-shard communications. With multiple participants belonging to different\nshards, handling concurrent operations is essential for optimal sharding. This\nissue becomes prominent due to the lack of architectural support and requires\nadditional consensus for cross-shard communications. Inspired by hybrid\nProof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake (PoW/PoS), like Ethereum, hybrid consensus and\n2-hop blockchain, we propose Reinshard, a new blockchain that inherits the\nproperties of hybrid consensus for optimal sharding. Reinshard uses PoW and PoS\nchain-pairs with PoS sub-chains for all the valid chain-pairs where the hybrid\nconsensus is attained through Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). Our architecture\nprovides a secure method of arranging nodes in shards and resolves concurrency\nconflicts using the delay factor of VDF. The applicability of Reinshard is\ndemonstrated through security and experimental evaluations. A practical\nconcurrency problem is considered to show the efficacy of Reinshard in\nproviding optimal sharding.",

            "summary": "The digital transformation of the medical sector requires solutions that are\nconvenient and efficient for all stakeholders while protecting patients'\nsensitive data. One example that has already attracted design-oriented research\nare medical prescriptions. However, current implementations of electronic\nprescription management systems typically create centralized data silos,\nleaving user data vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents and impeding\ninteroperability. Research has also proposed decentralized solutions based on\nblockchain technology, but privacy-related challenges have often been ignored.\nWe conduct design science research to develop and implement a system for the\nexchange of electronic prescriptions that builds on two blockchains and a\ndigital wallet app. Our solution combines the bilateral, verifiable, and\nprivacy-focused exchange of information between doctors, patients, and\npharmacies through verifiable credentials with a token-based, anonymized\ndouble-spending check. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations as well as\na security analysis suggest that this architecture can improve existing\napproaches to electronic prescription management by offering patients control\nover their data by design, a high level of security, sufficient performance and\nscalability, and interoperability with emerging digital identity management\nsolutions for users, businesses, and institutions. We also derive principles on\nhow to design decentralized, privacy-oriented information systems that require\nboth the exchange of sensitive information and double-usage protection.",

Emergency message dissemination is usually carried out by broadcasting.\nHowever, high vehicle density and mobility usually lead to challenges in\nmessage dissemination such as broadcasting storm and low probability of packet\nreception. This paper proposes a federated learning based blockchain-assisted\nmessage dissemination solution. Similar to the incentive-based Proof-of-Work\nconsensus in blockchain, vehicles compete to become a relay node (miner) by\nprocessing the proposed Proof-of-Federated-Learning (PoFL) consensus which is\nembedded in the smart contract of blockchain. Both theoretical and practical\nanalysis of the proposed solution are provided. Specifically, the proposed\nblockchain based federated learning results in more number of vehicles\nuploading their models in a given time, which can potentially lead to a more\naccurate model in less time as compared to the same solution without using\nblockchain. It also outperforms the other blockchain approaches for message\ndissemination by reducing 65.2% of time delay in consensus, improving at least\n8.2% message delivery rate and preserving privacy of neighbor vehicle more\nefficiently. The economic model to incentivize vehicles participating in\nfederated learning and message dissemination is further analyzed using\nStackelberg game model.",

This problem\nreduces to the estimation of a single parameter when $\\mathcal{P}$ has a\nsupport set of size $K = 2$. After noting that this special case is tackled\nvery well by prior-posterior-ratio (PPR) martingale confidence sequences\n\\citep{waudby-ramdas-ppr}, we propose a generalisation to mode estimation, in\nwhich $\\mathcal{P}$ may take $K \\geq 2$ values. To begin, we show that the\n\"one-versus-one\" principle to generalise from $K = 2$ to $K \\geq 2$ classes is\nmore efficient than the \"one-versus-rest\" alternative. We then prove that our\nresulting stopping rule, denoted PPR-1v1, is asymptotically optimal (as the\nmistake probability is taken to $0$). PPR-1v1 is parameter-free and\ncomputationally light, and incurs significantly fewer samples than competitors\neven in the non-asymptotic regime.

For example,\nBFT-inspired protocols such as Algorand tend to be secure in the partially\nsynchronous setting, while longest chain protocols like Bitcoin will normally\nrequire stronger synchronicity to be secure. Another fundamental distinction,\ndirectly relevant to scalability solutions such as sharding, is whether or not\na single untrusted user is able to point to *certificates*, which provide\nincontrovertible proof of block confirmation. Algorand produces such\ncertificates, while Bitcoin does not. Are these properties accidental? Or are\nthey inherent consequences of the paradigm of protocol design? Our aim in this\npaper is to understand what, fundamentally, governs the nature of security for\npermissionless blockchain protocols. Using the framework developed in\n(Lewis-Pye and Roughgarden, 2021), we prove general results showing that these\nquestions relate directly to properties of the user selection process, i.e.,\nthe method (such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake) which is used to select\nusers with the task of updating state. Our results suffice to establish, for\nexample, that the production of certificates is impossible for proof-of-work\nprotocols, but is automatic for standard forms of proof-of-stake protocols. As\na byproduct of our work, we also define a number of security notions and\nidentify the equivalences and inequivalences among them.",

We approach this research question by formalizing a basic consumption\nmodel for PoS blockchains. Applying this model to six archetypal blockchains\ngenerates three main findings: First, we confirm the concerns around the energy\nfootprint of PoW by showing that Bitcoin's energy consumption exceeds the\nenergy consumption of all PoS-based systems analyzed by at least three orders\nof magnitude. Second, we illustrate that there are significant differences in\nenergy consumption among the PoSbased systems analyzed, with permissionless\nsystems having an overall larger energy footprint.

            "summary": "In the last few years, a countless number of permissioned blockchain\nsolutions have been proposed, with each one to claim that it revolutionizes the\nway of the transaction processing along with the security and privacy\npreserving mechanisms that it provides. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the most\npopular permissioned blockchain architectures that has made a significant\nimpact on the market. However, there are only few papers of finding\narchitectural risks regarding the security and the privacy preserving\nmechanisms of Hyperledger Fabric. This paper separates the attack surface of\nthe blockchain platform into four components, namely, consensus, chaincode,\nnetwork and privacy preserving mechanisms, in all of which an attacker (from\ninside or outside the network) can exploit the platform's design and gain\naccess to or misuse the network. In addition, we highlight the appropriate\ncounter-measures that can be taken in each component to address the\ncorresponding risks and provide a significantly secure and enhanced privacy\npreserving Fabric network. We hope that by bringing this paper into light, we\ncan aid developers to avoid security flaws and implementations that can be\nexploited by attackers but also to motivate further research to harden the\nplatform's security and the client's privacy.",

Blockchain technology (BCT) has\ngained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization,\ntransparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, poor\ninteroperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains\nincluding Industrial IoT and Industry 4.0. The mismatch between the\nrequirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network\ncapabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture.\nInspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new\ndirection of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies,\nand smart industries focusing the potential merits and challenges in terms of\ninfrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead,\nbusiness model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence. We highlighted the\nconvergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future\nindustrial IoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful\ndeployment of BCT schemes.

However, Bitcoin-derived blockchains and their variants\nsuffer from the limitations of the CAP Trilemma, which is difficult to be\nsolved through optimizing consensus protocols. Moreover, the P2P network of\nblockchains have problems in efficiency and reliability without considering the\nmatching of physical and logical topologies. For the CAP Trilemma in consortium\nblockchains, we propose a physical topology based on the multi-dimensional\nhypercube with excellent partition tolerance in probability. On the other hand,\nthe general hypercube has advantages in solving the mismatch problems in P2P\nnetworks. The general topology is further extended to a hierarchical recursive\ntopology with more medium links or short links to balance the reliability\nrequirements and the costs of physical network. We prove that the hypercube\ntopology has better partition tolerance than the regular rooted tree topology\nand the ring lattice topology, and effectively fits the upper-layer protocols.\nAs a result, blockchains constructed by the proposed topology can reach the CAP\nguarantee bound through adopting the proper transmission and the consensus\nprotocols protocols that have strong consistency and availability.",

In real-world applications, authentication\nsystems that involve a single biometric faced many issues, especially lack of\naccuracy and noisy data, which boost the research community to create\nmultibiometric systems that involve a variety of biometrics. Those systems\nprovide better performance and higher accuracy compared to other authentication\nmethods. However, most of them are inconvenient and requires complex\ninteractions from the user. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a novel\nmultimodal authentication system that relies on machine learning and\nblockchain, with the aim of providing a more secure, transparent, and\nconvenient authentication mechanism. The proposed system combines four\nimportant biometrics, fingerprint, face, age, and gender. The supervised\nlearning algorithm Decision Tree has been used to combine the results of the\nbiometrics verification process and produce a confidence level related to the\nuser. The initial experimental results show the efficiency and robustness of\nthe proposed multimodal systems.",

Key architectural aspects of blockchain\nsolutions are examined in terms of their ability to withstand various types of\ncommon IoT and blockchain attacks, deliver enhanced privacy features, and\nassure adequate performance levels while processing large amounts of\ntransactions being generated in an IoT environment. The analysis carried out\nidentified that the defences currently provided by blockchain platforms are not\nsufficient to thwart all the prominent attacks against blockchains, with\nblockchain 1.0 and 2.0 platforms being susceptible to the majority of them. On\nthe other side, privacy related mechanisms are being supported, to varying\ndegrees, by all platforms investigated; however, each of the them tackles\nspecific only privacy aspects, thus rendering the overall privacy evaluation a\nchallenging task which needs to be considered in an ad-hoc basis.

            "summary": "A verifiable random function (VRF in short) is a powerful pseudo-random\nfunction that provides a non-interactively public verifiable proof for the\ncorrectness of its output. Recently, VRFs have found essential applications in\nblockchain design, such as random beacons and proof-of-stake consensus\nprotocols. To our knowledge, the first generation of blockchain systems used\ninherently inefficient proof-of-work consensuses, and the research community\ntried to achieve the same properties by proposing proof-of-stake schemes where\nresource-intensive proof-of-work is emulated by cryptographic constructions.\nUnfortunately, those most discussed proof-of-stake consensuses (e.g., Algorand\nand Ouroborous family) are not future-proof because the building blocks are\nsecure only under the classical hard assumptions; in particular, their designs\nignore the advent of quantum computing and its implications. In this paper, we\npropose a generic compiler to obtain the post-quantum VRF from the simple VRF\nsolution using symmetric-key primitives (e.g., non-interactive zero-knowledge\nsystem) with an intrinsic property of quantum-secure. Our novel solution is\nrealized via two efficient zero-knowledge systems ZKBoo and ZKB++,\nrespectively, to validate the compiler correctness. Our proof-of-concept\nimplementation indicates that even today, the overheads introduced by our\nsolution are acceptable in real-world deployments. We also demonstrate\npotential applications of a quantum-secure VRF, such as quantum-secure\ndecentralized random beacon and lottery-based proof of stake consensus\nblockchain protocol.",

However, the related work lacks a thorough\ninvestigation of corner cases that deviate from the protocol in terms of\ntransaction selection strategy. Therefore, we build a custom simulator that\nextends open source simulation tools to support multiple chains and enables us\nto investigate such corner cases. Our experiments show that malicious actors\nwho diverge from the proposed transaction selection strategy make more profit\nas compared to honest miners. Moreover, they have a detrimental effect on the\nprocessing throughput of the PHANTOM (and GHOSTDAG) due to same transactions\nbeing included in more than one block of different chains.

The existing blockchain solutions show downsides in communication and\nstorage scalability, as well as decentralization. In this article, we propose\nLightChain , which is the first blockchain architecture that operates over a\nDistributed Hash Table (DHT) of participating peers. LightChain is a\npermissionless blockchain that provides addressable blocks and transactions\nwithin the network, which makes them efficiently accessible by all peers. Each\nblock and transaction is replicated within the DHT of peers and is retrieved in\nan on-demand manner. Hence, peers in LightChain are not required to retrieve or\nkeep the entire ledger. LightChain is fair as all of the participating peers\nhave a uniform chance of being involved in the consensus regardless of their\ninfluence such as hashing power or stake. We provide formal mathematical\nanalysis and experimental results (simulations and cloud deployment) to\ndemonstrate the security, efficiency, and fairness of LightChain , and show\nthat LightChain is the only existing blockchain that can provide integrity\nunder the corrupted majority power of peers. As we experimentally demonstrate,\ncompared to the mainstream blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, LightChain\nrequires around 66 times smaller per node storage, and is around 380 times\nfaster on bootstrapping a new node to the system, and each LightChain node is\nrewarded equally likely for participating in the protocol.",

            "summary": "The Bitcoin P2P network currently represents a reference benchmark for modern\ncryptocurrencies. Its underlying protocol defines how transactions and blocks\nare distributed through all participating nodes. To protect user privacy, the\nidentity of the node originating a message is kept hidden. However, an\nadversary observing the whole network can analyze the spread pattern of a\ntransaction to trace it back to its source. This is possible thanks to the\nso-called rumor centrality, which is caused by the symmetry in the spreading of\ngossip-like protocols.\n  Recent works try to address this issue by breaking the symmetry of the\nDiffusion protocol, currently used in Bitcoin, and leveraging proxied\nbroadcast. Nonetheless, the complexity of their design can be a barrier to\ntheir adoption in real life. In this work, we propose Clover, a novel\ntransaction relay protocol that protects the source of transaction messages\nwith a simple, yet effective, design. Compared to previous solutions, our\nprotocol does not require building propagation graphs, and reduces the ability\nof the adversary to gain precision by opening multiple connections towards the\nsame node. Experimental results show that the deanonymization accuracy of an\neavesdropper adversary against Clover is up to 10 times smaller compared to\nDiffusion.",

The aim of the paper is to raise a set of concerns arising in the\ncriminal justice and policing circles, based on the interviews with law\nenforcement practitioners, and to see how cryptos could be reconciled with\npublic security and safety. We propose a simplified classification of crimes\nrelated to crypto currency. We study the development of blockchains in a\nbroader context of applied cryptography and payment technology. Ransomware is a\nbig threat but we also need protection against corporate misconduct or\nnegligence, with untested financial services breaching customer trust or\ngovernment regulations.

However, light nodes fail to detect a DA attack with high probability if\na malicious node hides a small stopping set of the LDPC code. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that a suitable co-design of specialized LDPC codes and the light\nnode sampling strategy leads to a high probability of detection of DA attacks.\nWe consider different adversary models based on their computational\ncapabilities of finding stopping sets.

            "summary": "The rise of the subscription-based business model has led to a corresponding\nincrease in the number of subscriptions where a customer needs to manage their\npayments. This management of payments for multiple subscriptions has become a\nvery complicated and insecure task for customers, especially when it comes to\nrenewing payment details when the card is lost, stolen, or expires. In\naddition, this, mostly manual, process is vulnerable to human error, digital\nfrauds, and data breaches, according to security reports. Thus, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach to automate, manage and simplify the Financial\nSupply Chain involved in the process of updating and managing payments to user\nsubscriptions. This is done by utilising the Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain\nframework, that allows a consumer to enter their payment card details in a\ncentral digital wallet and link their subscriptions to their cards. The card\nbeing updated triggers an event on the blockchain, which allow for the payment\ndetails to be updated on subscription systems automatically. The verification\ntests performed on the prototype of the proposed system shows that its current\nimplementation has been securely achieved.",

            "summary": "Nakamoto's seminal work gave rise to permissionless blockchains -- as well as\na wide range of proposals to mitigate their performance shortcomings. Despite\nsubstantial throughput and energy efficiency achievements, most proposals only\nbring modest (or marginal) gains in transaction commit latency. Consequently,\ncommit latencies in today's permissionless blockchain landscape remain\nprohibitively high. This paper proposes NimbleChain, a novel algorithm that\nextends permissionless blockchains based on Nakamoto consensus with a fast path\nthat delivers causal promises of commitment, or simply promises. Since promises\nonly partially order transactions, their latency is only a small fraction of\nthe totally-ordered commitment latency of Nakamoto consensus. Still, the weak\nconsistency guarantees of promises are strong enough to correctly implement\ncryptocurrencies. To the best of our knowledge, NimbleChain is the first system\nto bring together fast, partially-ordered transactions with consensus-based,\ntotally-ordered transactions in a permissionless setting. This hybrid\nconsistency model is able to speed up cryptocurrency transactions while still\nsupporting smart contracts, which typically have (strong) sequential\nconsistency needs. We implement NimbleChain as an extension of Ethereum and\nevaluate it in a 500-node geo-distributed deployment. The results show\nNimbleChain can promise a cryptocurrency transactions up to an order of\nmagnitude faster than a vanilla Ethereum implementation, with marginal\noverheads.",

Most of\nthe state-of-the-art techniques for detecting malicious actors depend on the\ntransactional behavior of individual wallet addresses but do not analyze the\nmoney trails. We propose a heuristics-based approach that adds new features\nassociated with money trails to analyze and find suspicious activities in\ncryptocurrency blockchains. Here, we focus only on the cyclic behavior and\nidentify hidden patterns present in the temporal transactions graphs in a\nblockchain. We demonstrate our methods on the transaction data of the Ethereum\nblockchain. We find that malicious activities (such as Gambling, Phishing, and\nMoney Laundering) have different cyclic patterns in Ethereum. We also identify\ntwo suspicious temporal cyclic path-based transfers in Ethereum.

This\ngeneralization allows the consensus process to be run by an incomplete network\nof nodes provided with (non-synchronized) same-speed clocks. Not all nodes are\nactive in every step, so the network size does not hamper the efficiency, as\nlong as the gossiping broadcast delivers the messages to every node in\nreasonable time. These network assumptions model more closely real-life\ncommunication channels, so the Cob protocol may be applicable to a variety of\npractical problems, such as blockchain platforms implementing sharding. Cob has\nthe same Bernoulli-like distribution that upper-bounds the number of steps as\nthe MBA protocol.

            "summary": "Smart contracts are programs running on blockchain to execute transactions.\nWhen input constraints or security properties are violated at runtime, the\ntransaction being executed by a smart contract needs to be reverted to avoid\nundesirable consequences. On Ethereum, the most popular blockchain that\nsupports smart contracts, developers can choose among three\ntransaction-reverting statements (i.e., require, if...revert, and if...throw)\nto handle anomalous transactions. While these transaction-reverting statements\nare vital for preventing smart contracts from exhibiting abnormal behaviors or\nsuffering malicious attacks, there is limited understanding of how they are\nused in practice. In this work, we perform the first empirical study to\ncharacterize transaction-reverting statements in Ethereum smart contracts. We\nmeasured the prevalence of these statements in 3,866 verified smart contracts\nfrom popular dapps and built a taxonomy of their purposes via manually\nanalyzing 557 transaction-reverting statements. We also compared template\ncontracts and their corresponding custom contracts to understand how developers\ncustomize the use of transaction-reverting statements. Finally, we analyzed the\nsecurity impact of transaction-reverting statements by removing them from smart\ncontracts and comparing the mutated contracts against the original ones. Our\nstudy led to important findings, which can shed light on further research in\nthe broad area of smart contract quality assurance and provide practical\nguidance to smart contract developers on the appropriate use of\ntransaction-reverting statements.",

This ledger is maintained by a\nnetwork of nodes that obeys a set of rules, called a consensus protocol, which\nhelps to resolve inconsistencies among local copies of a blockchain. In this\npaper, we build a mathematical framework for the consensus protocol designer,\nspecifying (a) the measurement of a resource which nodes strategically invest\nin and compete for to win the right to build new blocks in the blockchain; and\n(b) a payoff function for such efforts. Thus, the equilibrium of an associated\nstochastic differential game can be implemented by selecting nodes in\nproportion to this specified resource and penalizing dishonest nodes by its\nloss. This associated, induced game can be further analyzed using mean field\ngames. The problem can be broken down into two coupled PDEs, where an\nindividual node's optimal control path is solved using a\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and where the evolution of states\ndistribution is characterized by a Fokker-Planck equation. We develop numerical\nmethods to compute the mean field equilibrium for both steady states at the\ninfinite time horizon and evolutionary dynamics. As an example, we show how the\nmean field equilibrium can be applied to the Bitcoin blockchain mechanism\ndesign. We demonstrate that a blockchain can be viewed as a mechanism that\noperates in a decentralized setup and propagates properties of the mean field\nequilibrium over time, such as the underlying security of the blockchain.",

            "summary": "Nakamoto consensus underlies the security of many of the world's largest\ncryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Common lore is that Nakamoto\nconsensus only achieves consistency and liveness under a regime where the\ndifficulty of its underlying mining puzzle is very high, negatively impacting\noverall throughput and latency. In this work, we study Nakamoto consensus under\na wide range of puzzle difficulties, including very easy puzzles. We first\nanalyze an adversary-free setting and show that, surprisingly, the common\nprefix of the blockchain grows quickly even with easy puzzles. In a setting\nwith adversaries, we provide a small backwards-compatible change to Nakamoto\nconsensus to achieve consistency and liveness with easy puzzles. Our insight\nrelies on a careful choice of \\emph{symmetry-breaking strategy}, which was\nsignificantly underestimated in prior work. We introduce a new method --\n\\emph{coalescing random walks} -- to analyzing the correctness of Nakamoto\nconsensus under the uniformly-at-random symmetry-breaking strategy. This method\nis more powerful than existing analysis methods that focus on bounding the\nnumber of {\\it convergence opportunities}.",

One can buy crypto-currency called Ether of the Ethereum\nblockchain from exchanges and pay for the transaction fees. In the case of test\nnetworks (such as Rinkeby) or scientific research blockchains (such as\nBloxberg), free crypto-currency, Ether, is distributed to users via faucets.\nSince transaction slots on the blocks, storage and smart contract executions\nare consuming blockchain resources, Ethers are distributed by fixed small\namounts to users. Users may have different amount of Ether requirements; some\nsmall amounts and some large amounts during different times. As a result,\nrather than allowing the user to get a fixed small amount of Ether, a more\ngeneral distribution mechanism that allows a user to demand and claim arbitrary\namounts of Ether, while satisfying fairness among users, is needed. For this\nend, Max-min Fairness based schemes have been used in centralized settings. Our\nwork contributes a Max-min Fairness based algorithm and its Solidity smart\ncontract implementation that requires low transaction costs independent of the\nnumber of users. This is important on the Ethereum blockchain, since a smart\ncontract execution with transaction costs depending on the number of users\nwould mean block gas limit exhaustion problem will eventually be met, making\nthe smart contract ineffective.

Phishing\nscam detection methods will protect possible victims and build a healthier\nblockchain ecosystem. Usually, the existing works define phishing scam\ndetection as a node classification task by learning the potential features of\nusers through graph embedding methods such as random walk or graph neural\nnetwork (GNN). However, these detection methods are suffered from high\ncomplexity due to the large scale of the blockchain transaction network,\nignoring temporal information of the transaction. Addressing this problem, we\ndefined the transaction pattern graphs for users and transformed the phishing\nscam detection into a graph classification task. To extract richer information\nfrom the input graph, we proposed a multi-channel graph classification model\n(MCGC) with multiple feature extraction channels for GNN. The transaction\npattern graphs and MCGC are more able to detect potential phishing scammers by\nextracting the transaction pattern features of the target users. Extensive\nexperiments on seven benchmark and Ethereum datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed MCGC can not only achieve state-of-the-art performance in the graph\nclassification task but also achieve effective phishing scam detection based on\nthe target users' transaction pattern graphs.",

Blockchain consensus algorithms are the\nprimary vehicle for the nodes within a blockchain network to reach an\nagreement. In recent years, many blockchain consensus algorithms have been\nproposed mainly for private and permissioned blockchain networks. However, the\nperformance of these algorithms and their reliability in hostile environments\nor the presence of byzantine and other network failures are not well\nunderstood. In addition, the testing and validation of blockchain applications\ncome with many technical challenges. In this paper, we apply chaos engineering\nand testing to understand the performance of consensus algorithms in the\npresence of different loads, byzantine failure and other communication failure\nscenarios. We apply chaos engineering to evaluate the performance of three\ndifferent consensus algorithms (PBFT, Clique, Raft) and their respective\nblockchain platforms. We measure the blockchain network's throughput, latency,\nand success rate while executing chaos and load tests. We develop lightweight\nblockchain applications to execute our test in a semi-production environment.\nOur results show that using chaos engineering helps understand how different\nconsensus algorithms perform in a hostile or unreliable environment and the\nlimitations of blockchain platforms.

To\nenhance the accountability and fairness of federated learning systems, we\npresent a blockchain-based trustworthy federated learning architecture.

Additionally, we propose a weighted fair data sampler algorithm\nto enhance fairness in training data. We evaluate the proposed approach using a\nCOVID-19 X-ray detection use case.

A\nsimilar situation is evident in smart grids and applies equally to the energy\nsupply industry. This fragmentation ultimately leads to missed opportunities in\nterms of business models which could connect customers with service providers.\nWe present a first draft of an architecture: SINA - Smart Interoperability\nArchitecture. SINA is based on existing decentralized infrastructure, which\navoids creating a dependency of the market participants on an overpowering\nservice provider. The core element of the technical solution is an open-source\nmodule integrated in the private clouds of the manufacturers, energy suppliers\nand service providers. The architecture addresses problems of data ownership,\nprivacy and data security avoiding central administrative structures. It\nmanages data access and transfer in a decentralized and distributed system.\nSINA uses a blockchain and smart contracts to make sure that the pieces of\ninformation about which data are accessed, by whom they are accessed, how they\nare processed, and which monetary transactions take place are immutably stored\nand made available. This allows providers to offer services to users in a\ntransparent and trustworthy manner.

More specifically, we compute the probability of committing a faulty\nblock and measure the security by computing the number of years to fail.\nFinally, to show the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct a\nnumerical analysis and evaluate the results obtained.",

            "summary": "With the continuous expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, edge\ncomputing mode has emerged in recent years to overcome the shortcomings of\ntraditional cloud computing mode, such as high delay, network congestion, and\nlarge resource consumption. Thus, edge-thing systems will replace the classic\ncloud-thing/cloud-edge-thing systems and become mainstream gradually, where IoT\ndevices can offload their tasks to neighboring edge nodes. A common problem is\nhow to utilize edge computing resources. For the sake of fairness, double\nauction can be used in the edge-thing system to achieve an effective resource\nallocation and pricing mechanism. Due to the lack of third-party management\nagencies and mutual distrust between nodes, in our edge-thing systems, we\nintroduce blockchains to prevent malicious nodes from tampering with\ntransaction records and smart contracts to act as an auctioneer to realize\nresources auction. Since the auction results stored in this blockchain-based\nsystem are transparent, they are threatened with inference attacks. Thus in\nthis paper, we design a differentially private combinatorial double auction\nmechanism by exploring the exponential mechanism such that maximizing the\nrevenue of edge computing platform, in which each IoT device requests a\nresource bundle and edge nodes compete with each other to provide resources. It\ncan not only guarantee approximate truthfulness and high revenue, but also\nensure privacy security. Through necessary theoretical analysis and numerical\nsimulations, the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms can be validated.",

This interaction creates a network of Internet of\nThings (IoT) devices where data travel continuously. With the increase of\ndevices and the need for the network to extend via fog computing, we have\nfog-based IoT networks. However, with more endpoints introduced to it, the\nnetwork becomes open to malicious attackers. This work attempts to protect\nfog-based IoT networks by creating a platform that secures the endpoints\nthrough public-key encryption. The servers are allowed to mask the data packets\nshared within the network. To be able to track all of the encryption processes,\nwe incorporated the use of permissioned blockchains. This technology completes\nthe security layer by providing an immutable and automated data structure to\nfunction as a hyper ledger for the network. Each data transaction incorporates\na handshake mechanism with the use of a public key pair. This design guarantees\nthat only devices that have proper access through the keys can use the network.\nHence, management is made convenient and secure. The implementation of this\nplatform is through a wireless server-client architecture to simulate the data\ntransactions between devices. The conducted qualitative tests provide an\nin-depth feasibility investigation on the network's levels of security.

            "summary": "Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on Contact\nTracing (CT) models has significantly increased to prevent spread of this\nhighly contagious virus and be prepared for the potential future ones. Since\nthe spreading probability of the novel coronavirus in indoor environments is\nmuch higher than that of the outdoors, there is an urgent and unmet quest to\ndevelop/design efficient, autonomous, trustworthy, and secure indoor CT\nsolutions. Despite such an urgency, this field is still in its infancy. The\npaper addresses this gap and proposes the Trustworthy Blockchain-enabled system\nfor Indoor Contact Tracing (TB-ICT) framework. The TB-ICT framework is proposed\nto protect privacy and integrity of the underlying CT data from unauthorized\naccess. More specifically, it is a fully distributed and innovative blockchain\nplatform exploiting the proposed dynamic Proof of Work (dPoW) credit-based\nconsensus algorithm coupled with Randomized Hash Window (W-Hash) and dynamic\nProof of Credit (dPoC) mechanisms to differentiate between honest and dishonest\nnodes. The TB-ICT not only provides a decentralization in data replication but\nalso quantifies the node's behavior based on its underlying credit-based\nmechanism. For achieving high localization performance, we capitalize on\navailability of Internet of Things (IoT) indoor localization infrastructures,\nand develop a data driven localization model based on Bluetooth Low Energy\n(BLE) sensor measurements. The simulation results show that the proposed TB-ICT\nprevents the COVID-19 from spreading by implementation of a highly accurate\ncontact tracing model while improving the users' privacy and security.",

This paper proposes a Swarm-Federated Deep Learning\nframework in the IoV system (IoV-SFDL) that integrates SL into the FDL\nframework.

These three ideas could be implemented separately by different\nresearch groups and institutions, however, they will strongly benefit from each\nother's synergistic effect.",

This crisis\nalso reveals the brittleness of existing medical services, such as\nover-centralization of medical resources, the hysteresis of medical services\ndigitalization, and weak security and privacy protection of medical data. The\nintegration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and blockchain is expected\nto be a panacea to COVID-19 attributed to the ubiquitous presence and the\nperception of IoMT as well as the enhanced security and immutability of the\nblockchain. However, the synergy of IoMT and blockchain is also faced with\nchallenges in privacy, latency, and context-absence. The emerging edge\nintelligence technologies bring opportunities to tackle these issues. In this\narticle, we present a blockchain-empowered edge intelligence for IoMT in\naddressing the COVID-19 crisis. We first review IoMT, edge intelligence, and\nblockchain in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We then present an architecture\nof blockchain-empowered edge intelligence for IoMT after discussing the\nopportunities of integrating blockchain and edge intelligence. We next offer\nsolutions to COVID-19 brought by blockchain-empowered edge intelligence from 1)\nmonitoring and tracing COVID-19 pandemic origin, 2) traceable supply chain of\ninjectable medicines and COVID-19 vaccines, and 3) telemedicine and remote\nhealthcare services.

Each node in\nLachesis protocol operates on a local block DAG, namely \\emph{OPERA DAG}.\nAiming for a low time to finality (TTF) for transactions, our general model\nconsiders DAG streams of high speed but asynchronous events. We integrate\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) into a DAG model in Lachesis protocol to improve\nperformance and security. Our general model of trustless system leverages\nparticipants' stake as their validating power~\\cite{stakedag}. Lachesis's\nconsensus algorithm uses Lamport timestamps, graph layering and concurrent\ncommon knowledge to guarantee a consistent total ordering of event blocks and\ntransactions. In addition, Lachesis protocol allows dynamic participation of\nnew nodes into Opera network. Lachesis optimizes DAG storage and processing\ntime by splitting local history into checkpoints (so-called epochs). We also\npropose a model to improve stake decentralization, and network safety and\nliveness ~\\cite{stairdag}.\n  Built on our novel Lachesis protocol, Fantom's Opera platform is a public,\nleaderless, asynchronous BFT, layer-1 blockchain, with guaranteed deterministic\nfinality. Hence, Lachesis protocol is suitable for distributed ledgers by\nleveraging asynchronous partially ordered sets with logical time ordering\ninstead of blockchains. We also present our proofs into a model that can be\napplied to abstract asynchronous distributed system.",

However, the ICVs relying on data driven perception and driving\nmodels face many challenges, including the lack of comprehensive knowledge to\ndeal with complicated driving context. In this paper, we are motivated to\ninvestigate cooperative knowledge sharing for ICVs. We propose a secure and\nefficient directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain based knowledge sharing\nframework, aiming to cater for the micro-transaction based vehicular networks.\nThe framework can realize both local and cross-regional knowledge sharing.\nThen, the framework is applied to autonomous driving applications, wherein\nmachine learning based models for autonomous driving control can be shared. A\nlightweight tip selection algorithm (TSA) is proposed for the DAG based\nknowledge sharing framework to achieve consensus and identity verification for\ncross-regional vehicles. To enhance model accuracy as well as minimizing\nbandwidth consumption, an adaptive asynchronous distributed learning (ADL)\nbased scheme is proposed for model uploading and downloading. Experiment\nresults show that the blockchain based knowledge sharing is secure, and it can\nresist attacks from malicious users. In addition, the proposed adaptive ADL\nscheme can enhance driving safety related performance compared to several\nexisting algorithms.",

            "summary": "Fault tolerance of a blockchain is often characterized by the fraction $f$ of\n\"adversarial power\" that it can tolerate in the system. Despite the fast\nprogress in blockchain designs in recent years, existing blockchain systems can\nstill only tolerate $f$ below $0.5$. Can practically usable blockchains\ntolerate a malicious majority, i.e., $f$ above $0.5$?\n  This work presents a positive answer to this question. We first note that the\nwell-known impossibility of {\\em byzantine consensus} for $f$ above $0.5$ does\nnot carry over to blockchains. To tolerate $f$ above $0.5$, we use {\\em\nbyzantine broadcast}, instead of byzantine consensus, as the core of the\nblockchain. A major obstacle in doing so, however, is that the resulting\nblockchain may have extremely low throughput. To overcome this central\ntechnical challenge, we propose a novel byzantine broadcast protocol OverlayBB,\nthat can tolerate $f$ above $0.5$ while achieving good throughput. Using\nOverlayBB as the core, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of\na novel Proof-of-Stake blockchain called BCube. BCube can tolerate a malicious\nmajority, while achieving practically usable transaction throughput and\nconfirmation latency in our experiments with $10000$ nodes and under $f = 0.7$.\nTo our knowledge, BCube is the first blockchain that can achieve such\nproperties.",

Still, there are gaps that remain unaddressed. There is a lack of\ntransparency in the healthcare system, which results in inherent trust problems\nbetween patients and hospitals. In the present day, a patient does not know\nwhether he or she will get the proper treatment from the hospital for the fee\ncharged. A patient can claim reimbursement of the medical bill from any\ninsurance company. However, today there is minimal scope for the Insurance\nCompany to verify the validity of such bills or medical records. A patient can\nprovide fake details to get financial benefits from the insurance company.\nAgain, there are trust issues between the patient (i.e., the insurance claimer)\nand the insurance company.

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled Secure and Smart\nHealthCare System. Fairness of all the entities: patient, hospital, or\ninsurance company involved in the system is guaranteed with no one trusting\neach other. Privacy and security of patients' medical data are ensured as well.\nWe also propose a method for privacy-preserving sharing of aggregated data with\nthe research community for their own purpose.

We aim\nto explain the rationale behind these savings products in simple terms. The key\nto this puzzle is that asset deposits in cryptocurrency ecosystems are of\nintrinsic economic value, as they facilitate network consensus mechanisms and\nautomated marketplaces (e.g. for lending). These functions create wealth for\nthe participants, and they provide unique advantages unavailable in traditional\nfinancial systems. Our review speaks to the notion of decentralized basic\nincome - analogous to universal basic income but guaranteed by financial\nproducts on blockchains instead of public policies. We will go through their\nimplementations of how savings can be channeled into the staking deposits in\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols, through fixed-rate lending protocols and\nstaking derivative tokens, thereby exposing savers with minimal risks.

            "summary": "The recent surge in federated data management applications has brought forth\nconcerns about the security of underlying data and the consistency of replicas\nin the presence of malicious attacks. A prominent solution in this direction is\nto employ a permissioned blockchain framework that is modeled around\ntraditional Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols. Any federated\napplication expects its data to be globally scattered to achieve faster access.\nBut, prior works have shown that traditional BFT protocols are slow. This has\nled to the rise of sharded-replicated blockchains. Existing BFT protocols for\nthese sharded blockchains are efficient if client transactions require access\nto a single-shard, but face performance degradation if there is a cross-shard\ntransaction that requires access to multiple shards. As cross-shard\ntransactions are common, to resolve this dilemma, we present RingBFT, a novel\nmeta-BFT protocol for sharded blockchains. RingBFT requires shards to adhere to\nthe ring order, and follow the principle of process, forward, and re-transmit\nwhile ensuring the communication between shards is linear. Our evaluation of\nRingBFT against state-of-the-art sharding BFT protocols illustrates that\nRingBFT achieves up to 18x higher throughput, gracefully scales to nearly 500\nglobally distributed nodes, and achieves a peak throughput of 1.2 million\ntransactions per second.",

            "summary": "We previously proposed a cross-referencing method for enabling multiple\npeer-to-peer network domains to manage their own public blockchains and\nperiodically exchanging the state of the latest fixed block in the blockchain\nwith hysteresis signatures among all the domains via an upper network layer. In\nthis study, we evaluated the effectiveness of our method from three theoretical\nviewpoints: decentralization, scalability, and tamper resistance. We show that\nthe performance of the entire system can be improved because transactions and\nblocks are distributed only inside the domain. We argue that the transaction\nprocessing capacity will increase to 56,000 transactions per second, which is\nas much as that of a VISA credit card system. The capacity is also evaluated by\nmultiplying the number of domains by the average reduction in\ntransaction-processing time due to the increase in block size and reduction in\nthe block-generation-time interval by domain partition. For tamper resistance,\neach domain has evidence of the hysteresis signatures of the other domains in\nthe blockchain. We introduce two types of tamper-resistance-improvement ratios\nas evaluation measures of tamper resistance for a blockchain and theoretically\nexplain how tamper resistance is improved using our cross-referencing method.\nWith our method, tamper resistance improves as the number of domains increases.\nThe proposed system of 1,000 domains are 3-10 times more tamper-resistant than\nthat of 100 domains, and the capacity is 10 times higher. We conclude that our\nmethod enables a more scalable and tamper-resistant public blockchain balanced\nwith decentralization.",

While nodes in this network are known,\nthe connections among them are kept hidden, as it is commonly believed that\nthis helps protect from deanonymization and low-level attacks. However,\nadversaries can bypass this limitation by inferring connections through side\nchannels. At the same time, the lack of topology information hinders the\nanalysis of the network, which is essential to improve efficiency and security.\nIn this paper, we thoroughly review network-level attacks and empirically show\nthat topology obfuscation is not an effective countermeasure. We then argue\nthat the benefits of an open topology potentially outweigh its risks, and\npropose a protocol to reliably infer and monitor connections among reachable\nnodes of the Bitcoin network. We formally analyze our protocol and\nexperimentally evaluate its accuracy in both trusted and untrusted settings.\nResults show our system has a low impact on the network, and has precision and\nrecall are over 90% with up to 20% of malicious nodes in the network.",

While traditional\nexchanges use order books to match and execute trades, DEXs are typically\norganized as constant function market makers (CFMMs). CFMMs accept and reject\nproposed trades based on the evaluation of a function that depends on the\nproposed trade and the current reserves of the DEX. For trades that involve\nonly two assets, CFMMs are easy to understand, via two functions that give the\nquantity of one asset that must be tendered to receive a given quantity of the\nother, and vice versa. When more than two assets are being exchanged, it is\nharder to understand the landscape of possible trades. We observe that various\nproblems of choosing a multi-asset trade can be formulated as convex\noptimization problems, and can therefore be reliably and efficiently solved.",

            "summary": "IoT data markets in public and private institutions have become increasingly\nrelevant in recent years because of their potential to improve data\navailability and unlock new business models. However, exchanging data in\nmarkets bears considerable challenges related to disclosing sensitive\ninformation. Despite considerable research focused on different aspects of\nprivacy-enhancing data markets for the IoT, none of the solutions proposed so\nfar seems to find a practical adoption. Thus, this study aims to organize the\nstate-of-the-art solutions, analyze and scope the technologies that have been\nsuggested in this context, and structure the remaining challenges to determine\nareas where future research is required. To accomplish this goal, we conducted\na systematic literature review on privacy enhancement in data markets for the\nIoT, covering 50 publications dated up to July 2020, and provided updates with\n24 publications dated up to May 2022. Our results indicate that most research\nin this area has emerged only recently, and no IoT data market architecture has\nestablished itself as canonical. Existing solutions frequently lack the\nrequired combination of anonymization and secure computation technologies.\nFurthermore, there is no consensus on the appropriate use of blockchain\ntechnology for IoT data markets and a low degree of leveraging existing\nlibraries or reusing generic data market architectures. We also identified\nsignificant challenges remaining, such as the copy problem and the recursive\nenforcement problem that-while solutions have been suggested to some extent-are\noften not sufficiently addressed in proposed designs. We conclude that\nprivacy-enhancing technologies need further improvements to positively impact\ndata markets so that, ultimately, the value of data is preserved through data\nscarcity and users' privacy and businesses-critical information are protected.",

            "summary": "Trust is the basis of any distributed, fault-tolerant, or secure system. A\ntrust assumption specifies the failures that a system, such as a blockchain\nnetwork, can tolerate and determines the conditions under which it operates\ncorrectly. In systems subject to Byzantine faults, the trust assumption is\nusually specified through sets of processes that may fail together. Trust has\ntraditionally been symmetric, such that all processes in the system adhere to\nthe same, global assumption about potential faults. Recently, asymmetric trust\nmodels have also been considered, especially in the context of blockchains,\nwhere every participant is free to choose who to trust.\n  In both cases, it is an open question how to compose trust assumptions.\nConsider two or more systems, run by different and possibly disjoint sets of\nparticipants, with different assumptions about faults: how can they work\ntogether? This work answers this question for the first time and offers\ncomposition rules for symmetric and for asymmetric quorum systems. These rules\nare static and do not require interaction or agreement on the new trust\nassumption among the participants. Moreover, they ensure that if the original\nsystems allow for running a particular protocol (guaranteeing consistency and\navailability), then so will the joint system. At the same time, the composed\nsystem tolerates as many faults as possible, subject to the underlying\nconsistency and availability properties.\n  Reaching consensus with asymmetric trust in the model of personal Byzantine\nquorum systems (Losa et al., DISC 2019) was shown to be impossible, if the\ntrust assumptions of the processes diverge from each other. With asymmetric\nquorum systems, and by applying our composition rule, we show how consensus is\nactually possible, even with the combination of disjoint sets of processes.",

            "summary": "Elections repeat commonly after a fixed time interval, ranging from months to\nyears. This results in limitations on governance since elected candidates or\npolicies are difficult to remove before the next elections, if needed, and\nallowed by the corresponding law. Participants may decide (through a public\ndeliberation) to change their choices but have no opportunity to vote for these\nchoices before the next elections. Another issue is the peak-end effect, where\nthe judgment of voters is based on how they felt a short time before the\nelections. To address these issues, we propose Always on Voting (AoV) -- a\nrepetitive voting framework that allows participants to vote and change elected\ncandidates or policies without waiting for the next elections. Participants are\npermitted to privately change their vote at any point in time, while the effect\nof their change is manifested at the end of each epoch, whose duration is\nshorter than the time between two main elections. To thwart the problem of\npeak-end effect in epochs, the ends of epochs are randomized and made\nunpredictable, while preserved within soft bounds. These goals are achieved\nusing the synergy between a Bitcoin puzzle oracle, verifiable delay function,\nand smart contracts.",

However, these\nblockchains have inherent scalability limits caused by the protocol's consensus\nproperties. In particular, the \\emph{consistency} property demonstrates a tight\ntrade-off between block production speed and the system's security in terms of\nresisting adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel method, Ironclad,\nthat improves blockchain consistency bound by assigning a different weight to\nrandomly selected blocks. We apply our method to the original Nakamoto protocol\nand rigorously prove that such a combination can improve the consistency bound\nsignificantly by analyzing the fundamental consensus properties. Such an\nimprovement enables a much faster block production rate than the original\nNakamoto protocol under the same security guarantee with the same proportion of\nmalicious mining power (see Figure 1).",

In this paper, we\nfocus on analyzing the performance of Hyperledger Fabric v1.1 - one of the most\npopular permissioned blockchain systems. Prior works have analyzed Hyperledger\nFabric v0.6 in depth, but newer versions of the system undergo significant\nchanges that warrant new analysis. Existing works on benchmarking the system\nare limited in their scope: some consider only small networks, others consider\nscalability of only parts of the system instead of the whole. We perform a\ncomprehensive performance analysis of Hyperledger Fabric v1.1 at scale. We\nextend an existing benchmarking tool to conduct experiments over many servers\nwhile scaling all important components of the system. Our results demonstrate\nthat Fabric v1.1's scalability bottlenecks lie in the communication overhead\nbetween the execution and ordering phase. Furthermore, we show that scaling the\nKafka cluster that is used for the ordering phase does not affect the overall\nthroughput.",

The model is a\ntwo-stage Stackelberg game in which each stage forms a sub-game. In stage I,\npools are the leaders who assign a computing power to be consumed by miners. In\nstage II, miners decide of their power consumption and distribution. They find\nthemselves in a social dilemma in which they must choose between mining in\nsolo, therefore prioritizing their individual preferences, and participating in\na pool for the collective interest. The model relies on a pool protocol based\non a simulated game in which the miners compete for the reward won by the pool.\nThe solutions for the stage I sub-game and the simulated protocol game are\nunique and stable Nash equilibriums while the stage II sub-game leads to a\nstable cooperative equilibrium only when miners choose their strategies\naccording to certain criteria. We conclude that the cooperative optimal mining\nmodel has the potential to favor Bitcoin decentralization and stability.\nMainly, the social dilemma faced by miners together with the balance of\nincentives ensure a certain distribution of the network computing power between\npools and solo miners, while equilibriums in the game solutions provide\nstability to the system.",

Many research\nworks focus on future smart cities with a holistic approach towards smart city\ndevelopment. In this paper, we introduce such future smart cities that leverage\nblockchain technology in areas like data security, energy and waste management,\ngovernance, transport, supply chain, including emergency events, and\nenvironmental monitoring. Blockchain, being a decentralized immutable ledger,\nhas the potential to promote the development of smart cities by guaranteeing\ntransparency, data security, interoperability, and privacy. Particularly, using\nblockchain in emergency events will provide interoperability between many\nparties involved in the response, will increase timeliness of services, and\nestablish transparency. In that case, if a current fee-based or\nfirst-come-first-serve-based processing is used, emergency events may get\ndelayed in being processed due to competition, and thus, threatening people's\nlives. Thus, there is a need for transaction prioritization based on the\npriority of information and quick creation of blocks (variable interval block\ncreation mechanism). Also, since the leaders ensure transaction prioritization\nwhile generating blocks, leader rotation and proper election procedure become\nimportant for the transaction prioritization process to take place honestly and\nefficiently. In our consensus protocol, we deploy a machine learning (ML)\nalgorithm to achieve efficient leader election and design a novel dynamic block\ncreation algorithm. Also, to ensure honest assessment from the followers on the\nblocks generated by the leaders, a peer-prediction-based verification mechanism\nis proposed. Both security analysis and simulation experiments are carried out\nto demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our proposed scheme.",

The PLS blockchain is not a cryptocurrency\ninstrument; it is an immutable ledger offering guaranteed non-repudiation to\nlow-power clients without use of public key crypto. The novelty of the\nsituation is in the fact that every PLS client has to obtain a proof of absence\nin all blocks of the chain to which its counterparty does not contribute, and\nwe show that it is possible without traversing the block's Merkle tree.\n  We obtain weight statistics of a leaf path on a sparse Merkle tree\ntheoretically, as our ground case. Using the theory we quantify the\ncommunication cost of a client interacting with the blockchain. We show that\nlarge savings can be achieved by providing a bitmap index of the tree\ncompressed using Tunstall's method. We further show that even in the case of\ncorrelated access, as in two IoT devices posting messages for each other in\nconsecutive blocks, it is possible to prevent compression degradation by\nre-randomising the IDs using a pseudorandom bijective function. We propose a\nlow-cost function of this kind and evaluate its quality by simulation, using\nthe avalanche criterion.",

Smart contracts on a blockchain network provide transparent,\nimmutable and independently verifiable proofs by all participants of the\nnetwork. We leverage this open and transparent nature of smart contracts on a\nblockchain to define incentivization rules for the contributors, which is based\non a novel scalar quantity - federated contribution. Such a smart contract\nbased reward-driven model has the potential to revolutionize the federated\nlearning adoption in enterprises. Our contribution is two-fold: first is to\nshow how smart contract based blockchain can be a very natural communication\nchannel for federated learning. Second, leveraging this infrastructure, we can\nshow how an intuitive measure of each agents' contribution can be built and\nintegrated with the life cycle of the training and reward process.",

            "summary": "Most self-service payment terminals require network connectivity for\nprocessing electronic payments. The necessity to maintain network connectivity\nincreases costs, introduces cybersecurity risks, and significantly limits the\nnumber of places where the terminals can be installed. Leading payment service\nproviders have proposed offline payment solutions that rely on algorithmically\ngenerated payment tokens. Existing payment token solutions, however, require\ncomplex mechanisms for authentication, transaction management, and most\nimportantly, security risk management. In this paper, we present VolgaPay, a\nblockchain-based system that allows merchants to deploy secure offline payment\nterminal infrastructure that does not require collection and storage of any\nsensitive data. We design a novel payment protocol which mitigates security\nthreats for all the participants of VolgaPay, such that the maximum loss from\ngaining full access to any component by an adversary incurs only a limited\nscope of harm. We achieve significant enhancements in security, operation\nefficiency, and cost reduction via a combination of polynomial multi-hash chain\nmicropayment channels and blockchain grafting for off-chain channel state\ntransition. We implement the VolgaPay payment system, and with thorough\nevaluation and security analysis, we demonstrate that VolgaPay is capable of\ndelivering a fast, secure, and cost-efficient solution for offline payment\nterminals.",

            "summary": "Understanding the strategic behavior of miners in a blockchain is of great\nimportance for its proper operation. A common model for mining games considers\nan infinite time horizon, with players optimizing asymptotic average\nobjectives. Implicitly, this assumes that the asymptotic behaviors are realized\nat human-scale times, otherwise invalidating current models. We study the\nmining game utilizing Markov Decision Processes. Our approach allows us to\ndescribe the asymptotic behavior of the game in terms of the stationary\ndistribution of the induced Markov chain. We focus on a model with two players\nunder immediate release, assuming two different objectives: the (asymptotic)\naverage reward per turn and the (asymptotic) percentage of obtained blocks.\n  Using tools from Markov chain analysis, we show the existence of a strategy\nachieving slow mixing times, exponential in the policy parameters. This result\nemphasizes the imperative need to understand convergence rates in mining games,\nvalidating the standard models. Towards this end, we provide upper bounds for\nthe mixing time of certain meaningful classes of strategies. This result yields\ncriteria for establishing that long-term averaged functions are coherent as\npayoff functions. Moreover, by studying hitting times, we provide a criterion\nto validate the common simplification of considering finite states models. For\nboth considered objectives functions, we provide explicit formulae depending on\nthe stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, this\nshows that both mentioned objectives are not equivalent. Finally, we perform a\nmarket share case study in a particular regime of the game. More precisely, we\nshow that an strategic player with a sufficiently large processing power can\nimpose negative revenue on honest players.",

One\nmodular component is a pluggable ordering service that establishes consensus on\nthe order of transactions and batches them into blocks. However, as of the time\nof this writing, there is no production grade Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT)\nordering service for Fabric, with the latest version (v2.1) supporting only\nCrash Fault-Tolerance (CFT). In our work, we address crucial aspects of BFT\nintegration into Fabric that were left unsolved in all prior works, making them\nunfit for production use. In this work we describe the design and\nimplementation of a BFT ordering service for Fabric, employing a new BFT\nconsensus library. The new library, based on the BFT-Smart protocol and written\nin Go, is tailored to the blockchain use-case, yet is general enough to cater\nto a wide variety of other uses. We evaluate the new BFT ordering service by\ncomparing it with the currently supported Raft-based CFT ordering service in\nHyperledger Fabric.",

Although it is well\nknown that pipelined HotStuff is secure against up to $1/3$ of Byzantine nodes,\nits performance in terms of throughput and delay is still under-explored. In\nthis paper, we develop a multi-metric evaluation framework to quantitatively\nanalyze pipelined \\mbox{HotStuff's performance} with respect to its chain\ngrowth rate, chain quality, and latency. We then propose two attack strategies\nand evaluate their effects on the performance of pipelined HotStuff. Our\nanalysis shows that the chain growth rate (resp, chain quality) of pipelined\nHotStuff under our attacks can drop to as low as 4/9 (resp, 12/17) of that\nwithout attacks when $1/3$ nodes are Byzantine. As another application, we use\nour framework to evaluate certain engineering optimizations adopted by\nLibraBFT. We find that these optimizations make the system more vulnerable to\nour attacks than the original pipelined HotStuff. Finally, we provide two\ncountermeasures to thwart these attacks.

However, these approaches have not attained a widespread adoption\ndue to their inability in delivering a cloud-like performance, in terms of the\nscalability in transaction throughput, storage, and compute capacity. In this\nwork, we determine that the major obstacle to public blockchain scalability is\ntheir underlying unstructured P2P networks. We further show that a centralized\nnetwork can support the deployment of decentralized smart contracts. We propose\na novel approach for achieving scalable decentralization: instead of trying to\nmake blockchain scalable, we deliver decentralization to already scalable cloud\nby using an Ethereum smart contract. We introduce Blockumulus, a framework that\ncan deploy decentralized cloud smart contract environments using a novel\ntechnique called overlay consensus. Through experiments, we demonstrate that\nBlockumulus is scalable in all three dimensions: computation, data storage, and\ntransaction throughput. Besides eliminating the current code execution and\nstorage restrictions, Blockumulus delivers a transaction latency between 2 and\n5 seconds under normal load. Moreover, the stress test of our prototype reveals\nthe ability to execute 20,000 simultaneous transactions under 26 seconds, which\nis on par with the average throughput of worldwide credit card transactions.",

            "summary": "We propose a model for games in which the players have shared access to a\nblockchain that allows them to deploy smart contracts to act on their behalf.\nThis changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions about rationality since a\ncontract can commit a player to act irrationally in specific subgames, making\ncredible otherwise non-credible threats. This is further complicated by\nconsidering the interaction between multiple contracts which can reason about\neach other. This changes the nature of the game in a nontrivial way as choosing\nwhich contract to play can itself be considered a move in the game. Our model\ngeneralizes known notions of equilibria, with a single contract being\nequivalent to a Stackelberg equilibrium, and two contracts being equivalent to\na reverse Stackelberg equilibrium. We prove a number of bounds on the\ncomplexity of computing SPE in such games with smart contracts. We show that\ncomputing an SPE is $\\textsf{PSPACE}$-hard in the general case. Specifically,\nin games with $k$ contracts, we show that computing an SPE is\n$\\Sigma_k^\\textsf{P}$-hard for games of imperfect information. We show that\ncomputing an SPE remains $\\textsf{PSPACE}$-hard in games of perfect information\nif we allow for an unbounded number of contracts. We give an algorithm for\ncomputing an SPE in two-contract games of perfect information that runs in time\n$O(m\\ell)$ where $m$ is the size of the game tree and $\\ell$ is the number of\nterminal nodes. Finally, we conjecture the problem to be $\\textsf{NP}$-complete\nfor three contracts.",

Before a disclosure, only the original sender of each\nmessage should know its contents. To accomplish this, we task a small council\nwith executing a distributed generation and threshold sharing of an asymmetric\nkey pair. The public key can be used to encrypt messages which only become\nreadable once the threshold-shared decryption key is reconstructed at a\npredefined point in time and recorded on-chain. With blockchains like Ethereum,\nit is possible to coordinate such procedures and attach economic stakes to the\nactions of participating individuals. In this paper, we present ETHTID, an\nEthereum smart contract application to coordinate Threshold Information\nDisclosure. We base our implementation on ETHDKG [1], a smart contract\napplication for distributed key generation and threshold sharing, and adapt it\nto fit our differing use case as well as add functionality to oversee a\nscheduled reconstruction of the decryption key. For our main cost saving\noptimisation, we show that the security of the underlying cryptographic scheme\nis maintained.

            "summary": "The popularity and amazing attractiveness of cryptocurrencies, and especially\nBitcoin, absorb countless enthusiasts daily. Although Blockchain technology\nprevents fraudulent behavior, it cannot detect fraud on its own. There are\nalways unimaginable ways to commit fraud, and the need to use anomaly detection\nmethods to identify abnormal and fraudulent behaviors has become a necessity.\nThe main purpose of this study is to present a new method for detecting\nanomalies in Bitcoin with more appropriate efficiency. For this purpose, in\nthis study, the diagnosis of the collective anomaly was used, and instead of\ndiagnosing the anomaly of individual addresses and wallets, the anomaly of\nusers was examined, and the anomaly was more visible among users who had\nmultiple wallets. In addition to using the collective anomaly detection method\nin this study, the Trimmed_Kmeans algorithm was used for clustering and the\nproposed method succeeded in identifying 14 users who had committed theft,\nfraud, and hack with 26 addresses in 9 cases. Compared to previous works, which\ndetected a maximum of 7 addresses in 5 cases of fraud, the proposed method has\nperformed well. Therefore, the proposed method, by presenting a new approach,\nin addition to reducing the processing power to extract features, succeeded in\ndetecting abnormal users and also was able to find more transactions and\naddresses committed a scam.",

            "summary": "Blockchain's immutability can resist unauthorized changes of ledgers, thus it\ncan be used as a trust enhancement mechanism to a shared system. Indeed,\nblockchain has been considered to solve the security and privacy issues of the\nInternet of Things (IoT). In this regard, most researches currently focus on\nthe realization of various access control models and architectures, and are\nworking towards making full use of the blockchain to secure IoT systems. It is\nworth noting that there has been an increasingly heavy pressure on the\nblockchain storage caused by dealing with massive IoT data and handling\nmalicious access behaviors in the system, and not many countermeasures have\nbeen seen to curb the increase. However, this problem has not been paid enough\nattention. In this paper, we implement an attribute-based access control scheme\nusing smart contracts in Quorum blockchain. It provides basic access control\nfunctions and conserves storage by reducing the number of smart contracts. In\naddition, a reputation-based technique is introduced to cope with malicious\nbehaviors. Certain illegal transactions can be blocked by the credit-assessment\nalgorithm, which deters possibly malicious nodes and gives more chance to\nwell-behaved nodes. The feasibility of our proposed scheme is demonstrated by\ndoing experiment on a testbed and conducting a case study. Finally, the system\nperformance is assessed based on experimental measurement.",

            "summary": "Climate change and global warming are the significant challenges of the new\ncentury. A viable solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is via a\nglobally incentivized market mechanism proposed in the Kyoto protocol. In this\nview, the carbon dioxide (or other greenhouse gases) emission is considered a\ncommodity, forming a carbon trading system. There have been attempts in\ndeveloping this idea in the past decade with limited success. The main\nchallenges of current systems are fragmented implementations, lack of\ntransparency leading to over-crediting and double-spending, and substantial\ntransaction costs that transfer wealth to brokers and agents. We aim to create\na Carbon Credit Ecosystem using smart contracts that operate in conjunction\nwith blockchain technology in order to bring more transparency, accessibility,\nliquidity, and standardization to carbon markets. This ecosystem includes a\ntokenization mechanism to securely digitize carbon credits with clear minting\nand burning protocols, a transparent mechanism for distribution of tokens, a\nfree automated market maker for trading the carbon tokens, and mechanisms to\nengage all stakeholders, including the energy industry, project verifiers,\nliquidity providers, NGOs, concerned citizens, and governments.

This\npaper describes a simple stochastic performance model of the PBFT consensus\nmechanism, which is refined as not only a queueing system with complicated\nservice times but also a level-independent quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process.\nFrom the level-independent QBD process, we apply the matrix-geometric solution\nto obtain a necessary and sufficient condition under which the PBFT consensus\nsystem is stable, and to be able to numerically compute the stationary\nprobability vector of the QBD process. Thus we provide four useful performance\nmeasures of the PBFT consensus mechanism, and can numerically calculate the\nfour performance measures. Finally, we use some numerical examples to verify\nthe validity of our theoretical results, and show how the four performance\nmeasures are influenced by some key parameters of the PBFT consensus. By means\nof the theory of multi-dimensional Markov processes, we are optimistic that the\nmethodology and results given in this paper are applicable in a wide range\nresearch of PBFT consensus mechanism and even other types of consensus\nmechanisms.",

It permits on-chain interactions to\nachieve trustworthy properties such as traceability, transparency, and\naccountability. However, current blockchain trustworthiness is only confined to\non-chain, creating a \"trust gap\" to the physical, off-chain environment. This\nis due to the lack of a scheme that can truthfully reflect the physical world\nin a real-time and consistent manner. Such an absence hinders further\nreal-world blockchain applications, especially for security-sensitive ones.\n  In this paper, we propose a scheme to extend blockchain trust from on-chain\nto off-chain, and take trustworthy vaccine transportation as an example. Our\nscheme consists of 1) a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-enabled trusted\nenvironment monitoring system built with the Arm Cortex-M33 microcontroller\nthat continuously senses the inside of a vaccine box through trusted sensors\nand generates anti-forgery data; and 2) a consistency protocol to upload the\nenvironment status data from the TEE system to blockchain in a truthful,\nreal-time consistent, continuous and fault-tolerant fashion. Our security\nanalysis indicates that no adversary can tamper with the vaccine in any way\nwithout being captured. We carry out an experiment to record the internal\nstatus of a vaccine shipping box during transportation, and the results\nindicate that the proposed system incurs an average latency of 84 ms in local\nsensing and processing followed by an average latency of 130 ms to have the\nsensed data transmitted to and available in the blockchain.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technology is among the fastest-growing technologies in the world\ntoday. It has been adopted in diverse areas but mostly in financial systems,\nsuch as Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Therefore, it is a niche that has attracted\ninterest from researchers from various fields, including computer science.\nOther areas where Blockchain is being embraced are the Smart Grid and Internet\nof Things (IoT) technologies, among others. While it is all good and improving\nmany areas of applications, Blockchain still has some shortcomings. For\nexample, it is not designed for high scalability when accommodating normal\ntransactions. On the other hand, a parallel technology that has diverse\napplications in distributed networks better known as edge computing has\nemerged. Its main advantage is that it increases the speed of pf processes\nwithin those networks. However, like Blockchain, edge computing has its\nshortcomings. Its security systems and management systems have been found to be\nwanting. Hence the idea to integrate the two technologies and take advantage of\ntheir strengths. A blend of the two would lead to advanced network servers,\nhuge data storage, and heightened security in transactions. However, this\nintegration will best happen when some measures are taken. For example, there\nis a need to address scalability, resource management satisfactorily, and the\nsecurity of the systems. To solve the integration problem, a decentralized\nBlockchain-based model of Edge computing is proposed in this paper.",

            "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) could be very useful in blockchain applications\nsuch as DeFi and NFT trading. However, training / running large-scale DNNs as\npart of a smart contract is infeasible on today's blockchain platforms, due to\ntwo fundamental design issues of these platforms. First, blockchains nowadays\ntypically require that each node maintain the complete world state at any time,\nmeaning that the node must execute all transactions in every block. This is\nprohibitively expensive for computationally intensive smart contracts involving\nDNNs. Second, existing blockchain platforms expect smart contract transactions\nto have deterministic, reproducible results and effects. In contrast, DNNs are\nusually trained / run lock-free on massively parallel computing devices such as\nGPUs, TPUs and / or computing clusters, which often do not yield deterministic\nresults.\n  This paper proposes novel platform designs, collectively called A New Hope\n(ANH), that address the above issues. The main ideas are (i)\ncomputing-intensive smart contract transactions are only executed by nodes who\nneed their results, or by specialized serviced providers, and (ii) a\nnon-deterministic smart contract transaction leads to uncertain results, which\ncan still be validated, though at a relatively high cost; specifically for\nDNNs, the validation cost can often be reduced by verifying properties of the\nresults instead of their exact values. In addition, we discuss various\nimplications of ANH, including its effects on token fungibility, sharding,\nprivate transactions, and the fundamental meaning of a smart contract.",

The sudden explosion and uncontrolled\nworldwide spread of COVID-19 show the limitations of existing healthcare\nsystems in timely handling public health emergencies. In such contexts,\ninnovative technologies such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nhave emerged as promising solutions for fighting coronavirus epidemic. In\nparticular, blockchain can combat pandemics by enabling early detection of\noutbreaks, ensuring the ordering of medical data, and ensuring reliable medical\nsupply chain during the outbreak tracing. Moreover, AI provides intelligent\nsolutions for identifying symptoms caused by coronavirus for treatments and\nsupporting drug manufacturing. Therefore, we present an extensive survey on the\nuse of blockchain and AI for combating COVID-19 epidemics. First, we introduce\na new conceptual architecture which integrates blockchain and AI for fighting\nCOVID-19. Then, we survey the latest research efforts on the use of blockchain\nand AI for fighting COVID-19 in various applications. The newly emerging\nprojects and use cases enabled by these technologies to deal with coronavirus\npandemic are also presented.

            "summary": "The recent advent of various forms of Federated Knowledge Distillation (FD)\npaves the way for a new generation of robust and communication-efficient\nFederated Learning (FL), where mere soft-labels are aggregated, rather than\nwhole gradients of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) as done in previous FL schemes.\nThis security-per-design approach in combination with increasingly performant\nInternet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices opens up a new realm of\npossibilities to utilize private data from industries as well as from\nindividuals as input for artificial intelligence model training. Yet in\nprevious FL systems, lack of trust due to the imbalance of power between\nworkers and a central authority, the assumption of altruistic worker\nparticipation and the inability to correctly measure and compare contributions\nof workers hinder this technology from scaling beyond small groups of already\nentrusted entities towards mass adoption. This work aims to mitigate the\naforementioned issues by introducing a novel decentralized federated learning\nframework where heavily compressed 1-bit soft-labels, resembling 1-hot label\npredictions, are aggregated on a smart contract. In a context where workers'\ncontributions are now easily comparable, we modify the Peer Truth Serum for\nCrowdsourcing mechanism (PTSC) for FD to reward honest participation based on\npeer consistency in an incentive compatible fashion. Due to heavy reductions of\nboth computational complexity and storage, our framework is a fully\non-blockchain FL system that is feasible on simple smart contracts and\ntherefore blockchain agnostic. We experimentally test our new framework and\nvalidate its theoretical properties.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we propose a trust-centric privacy-preserving blockchain for\ndynamic spectrum access in IoT networks. To be specific, we propose a trust\nevaluation mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of sensing nodes and\ndesign a Proof-of-Trust (PoT) consensus mechanism to build a scalable\nblockchain with high transaction-per-second (TPS). Moreover, a privacy\nprotection scheme is proposed to protect sensors' real-time geolocatioin\ninformation when they upload sensing data to the blockchain. Two smart\ncontracts are designed to make the whole procedure (spectrum sensing, spectrum\nauction, and spectrum allocation) run automatically. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the expected computation cost of the PoT consensus algorithm for\nreliable sensing nodes is low, and the cooperative sensing performance is\nimproved with the help of trust value evaluation mechanism.In addition,\nincentivization and security are also analyzed, which show that our design not\nonly can encourage nodes' participation, but also resist to many kinds of\nattacks which are frequently encountered in trust-based blockchain systems.",

            "summary": "In recent years, the confidentiality of smart contracts has become a\nfundamental requirement for practical applications. While many efforts have\nbeen made to develop architectural capabilities for enforcing confidential\nsmart contracts, a few works arise to extend confidential smart contracts to\nMulti-Party Computation (MPC), i.e., multiple parties jointly evaluate a\ntransaction off-chain and commit the outputs on-chain without revealing their\nsecret inputs/outputs to each other. However, existing solutions lack public\nverifiability and require O(n) transactions to enable negotiation or resist\nadversaries, thus suffering from inefficiency and compromised security. In this\npaper, we propose Cloak, a framework for enabling Multi-Party Transaction (MPT)\non existing blockchains. An MPT refers to transitioning blockchain states by an\npublicly verifiable off-chain MPC. We identify and handle the challenges of\nsecuring MPT by harmonizing TEE and blockchain. Consequently, Cloak secures the\noff-chain nondeterministic negotiation process (a party joins an MPT without\nknowing identities or the total number of parties until the MPT proposal\nsettles), achieves public verifiability (the public can validate that the MPT\ncorrectly handles the secret inputs/outputs from multiple parties and\nreads/writes states on-chain), and resists Byzantine adversaries. According to\nour proof, Cloak achieves better security with only 2 transactions, superior to\nprevious works that achieve compromised security at O(n) transactions cost. By\nevaluating examples and real-world MPTs, the gas cost of Cloak reduces by 32.4%\non average.",

However, while new privacy protection techniques keep coming out,\nhow existing ones can best fit development settings is little studied.\nSuffering from limited architectural support in terms of programming\ninterfaces, state-of-the-art solutions can hardly reach general developers. In\nthis paper, we proposed the CLOAK framework for developing confidential smart\ncontracts. The key capability of CLOAK is allowing developers to implement and\ndeploy practical solutions to multi-party transaction (MPT) problems, i.e.,\ntransact with secret inputs and states owned by different parties by simply\nspecifying it. To this end, CLOAK introduced a domain-specific annotation\nlanguage for declaring privacy specifications and further automatically\ngenerating confidential smart contracts to be deployed with trusted execution\nenvironment (TEE) on blockchain. In our evaluation on both simple and\nreal-world applications, developers managed to deploy business services on\nblockchain in a concise manner by only developing CLOAK smart contracts whose\nsize is less than 30% of the deployed ones.",

In this case, we derive a proportional response (PR) update\nprotocol which converges to market equilibria at which griefing is irrelevant.\nConvergence holds for a wide range of miners risk profiles and various degrees\nof resource mobility between blockchains with different mining technologies.\nOur empirical findings in a case study with four mineable cryptocurrencies\nsuggest that risk diversification, restricted mobility of resources (as\nenforced by different mining technologies) and network growth, all are\ncontributing factors to the stability of the inherently volatile blockchain\necosystem.",

            "summary": "Existing committee-based Byzantine state machine replication (SMR) protocols,\ntypically deployed in production blockchains, face a clear trade-off: (1) they\neither achieve linear communication cost in the happy path, but sacrifice\nliveness during periods of asynchrony, or (2) they are robust (progress with\nprobability one) but pay quadratic communication cost. We believe this\ntrade-off is unwarranted since existing linear protocols still have asymptotic\nquadratic cost in the worst case. We design Ditto, a Byzantine SMR protocol\nthat enjoys the best of both worlds: optimal communication on and off the happy\npath (linear and quadratic, respectively) and progress guarantee under\nasynchrony and DDoS attacks. We achieve this by replacing the\nview-synchronization of partially synchronous protocols with an asynchronous\nfallback mechanism at no extra asymptotic cost. Specifically, we start from\nHotStuff, a state-of-the-art linear protocol, and gradually build Ditto. As a\nseparate contribution and an intermediate step, we design a 2-chain version of\nHotStuff, Jolteon, which leverages a quadratic view-change mechanism to reduce\nthe latency of the standard 3-chain HotStuff. We implement and experimentally\nevaluate all our systems. Notably, Jolteon's commit latency outperforms\nHotStuff by 200-300ms with varying system size. Additionally, Ditto adapts to\nthe network and provides better performance than Jolteon under faulty\nconditions and better performance than VABA (a state-of-the-art asynchronous\nprotocol) under faultless conditions. This proves our case that breaking the\nrobustness-efficiency trade-off is in the realm of practicality.",

            "summary": "In recent years, phishing scams have become the crime type with the largest\nmoney involved on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain platform. Meanwhile,\ngraph neural network (GNN) has shown promising performance in various node\nclassification tasks. However, for Ethereum transaction data, which could be\nnaturally abstracted to a real-world complex graph, the scarcity of labels and\nthe huge volume of transaction data make it difficult to take advantage of GNN\nmethods. Here in this paper, to address the two challenges, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Incremental deep Graph learning model (SIEGE), for the phishing\nscam detection problem on Ethereum. In our model, two pretext tasks designed\nfrom spatial and temporal perspectives help us effectively learn useful node\nembedding from the huge amount of unlabelled transaction data. And the\nincremental paradigm allows us to efficiently handle large-scale transaction\ndata and help the model maintain good performance when the data distribution is\ndrastically changing. We collect transaction records about half a year from\nEthereum and our extensive experiments show that our model consistently\noutperforms strong baselines in both transductive and inductive settings.",

            "summary": "Since the emergence of Ethereum, blockchain-based decentralized applications\n(DApps) have become increasingly popular and important. To balance the\nsecurity, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an\non-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain\nand an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its\noff-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the\ninconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause\nundesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions\nsent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be\nreversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in\nthe transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to\nperform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of\nfamiliarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we\ninvestigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in\nEthereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in\ninconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such\non-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model\nto guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate\nthe automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework,\nDArcher, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in DApps. We have\nevaluated DArcher on 11 popular real-world DApps. DArcher achieves high\nprecision (99.3%), recall (87.6%), and accuracy (89.4%) in bug detection and\nsignificantly outperforms the baseline methods. It has found 15 real bugs in\nthe 11 DApps. So far, six of the 15 bugs have been confirmed by the developers,\nand three have been fixed. These promising results demonstrate the usefulness\nof DArcher.",

            "summary": "Blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology (DLT) where data is\nshared among users connected over the internet. Transactions are data state\nchanges on the blockchain that are permanently recorded in a secure and\ntransparent way without the need of a third party. Besides, the introduction of\nsmart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability to the blockchain\nand revolutionized the software ecosystem leading toward decentralized\napplications (DApps) attracting businesses and organizations to employ this\ntechnology. Although promising, blockchains and smart contracts have no access\nto the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events\nresides; consequently, the usability of smart contracts in terms of performance\nand programmability would be limited to the on-chain data. Hence,\n\\emph{blockchain oracles} are introduced to mitigate the issue and are defined\nas trusted third-party services that send and verify the external information\n(i.e., feedback) and submit it to smart contracts for triggering state changes\nin the blockchain. In this paper, we will study and analyze blockchain oracles\nwith regard to how they provide feedback to the blockchain and smart contracts.\nWe classify the blockchain oracle techniques into two major groups such as\nvoting-based strategies and reputation-based ones. The former mainly relies on\nparticipants' stakes for outcome finalization while the latter considers\nreputation in conjunction with authenticity proof mechanisms for data\ncorrectness and integrity. We then provide a structured description of patterns\nin detail for each classification and discuss research directions in the end.",

            "summary": "The asset trading volume on blockchain-based exchanges (DEX) increased\nsubstantially since the advent of Automated Market Makers (AMM). Yet, AMMs and\ntheir forks compete on the same blockchain, incurring unnecessary network and\nblock-space overhead, by attracting sandwich attackers and arbitrage\ncompetitions. Moreover, conceptually speaking, a blockchain is one database,\nand we find little reason to partition this database into multiple competing\nexchanges, which then necessarily require price synchronization through\narbitrage.\n  This paper shows that DEX arbitrage and trade routing among similar AMMs can\nbe performed efficiently and atomically on-chain within smart contracts. These\ninsights lead us to create a new AMM design, an Automated Arbitrage Market\nMaker, short A2MM DEX. A2MM aims to unite multiple AMMs to reduce overheads,\ncosts and increase blockchain security. With respect to Miner Extractable Value\n(MEV), A2MM serves as a decentralized design for users to atomically collect\nMEV, mitigating the dangers of centralized MEV relay services.\n  We show that A2MM offers essential security benefits. First, A2MM strengthens\nthe blockchain consensus security by mitigating the competitive exploitation of\nMEV, therefore reducing the risks of consensus forks. A2MM reduces the network\nlayer overhead of competitive transactions, improves network propagation,\nleading to less stale blocks and better blockchain security. Through trade\nrouting, A2MM reduces the predatory risks of sandwich attacks by taking\nadvantage of the minimum profitable victim input. A2MM also offers financial\nbenefits to traders. Failed swap transactions from competitive trading occupy\nvaluable block space, implying an upward pressure on transaction fees. Our\nevaluations shows that A2MM frees up 32.8% block-space of AMM-related\ntransactions. In expectation, A2MM's revenue allows to reduce swap fees by 90%.",

            "summary": "This paper describes the work carried out by the Inter-American Development\nBank, the IDB Lab, LACChain, Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC), and Tecnologico\nde Monterrey to identify and eliminate quantum threats in blockchain networks.\n  The advent of quantum computing threatens internet protocols and blockchain\nnetworks because they utilize non-quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms.\nWhen quantum computers become robust enough to run Shor's algorithm on a large\nscale, the most used asymmetric algorithms, utilized for digital signatures and\nmessage encryption, such as RSA, (EC)DSA, and (EC)DH, will be no longer secure.\nQuantum computers will be able to break them within a short period of time.\nSimilarly, Grover's algorithm concedes a quadratic advantage for mining blocks\nin certain consensus protocols such as proof of work.\n  Today, there are hundreds of billions of dollars denominated in\ncryptocurrencies that rely on blockchain ledgers as well as the thousands of\nblockchain-based applications storing value in blockchain networks.\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications require solutions that\nguarantee quantum resistance in order to preserve the integrity of data and\nassets in their public and immutable ledgers. We have designed and developed a\nlayer-two solution to secure the exchange of information between blockchain\nnodes over the internet and introduced a second signature in transactions using\npost-quantum keys. Our versatile solution can be applied to any blockchain\nnetwork. In our implementation, quantum entropy was provided via the IronBridge\nPlatform from CQC and we used LACChain Besu as the blockchain network.",

These P2P technologies are\nable to securely diffuse information within and across networks, without need\nfor trustees or central authorities to enforce consensus. In this contribution,\nwe propose a minimalistic stochastic model to understand the dynamics of\nblockchain-based consensus. By leveraging on random-walk theory, we model block\npropagation delay on different network topologies and provide a classification\nof blockchain systems in terms of two emergent properties. Firstly, we identify\ntwo performing regimes: a functional regime corresponding to an optimal system\nfunction; and a non-functional regime characterised by a congested or branched\nstate of sub-optimal blockchains. Secondly, we discover a phase transition\nduring the emergence of consensus and numerically investigate the corresponding\ncritical point. Our results provide important insights into the consensus\nmechanism and sub-optimal states in decentralised systems.",

However, participants who lack programming knowledge\noften have difficulties reading the smart contract source codes, which leads to\npotential security risks and barriers to participation. Objective: Our\nobjective is to translate the smart contract source codes into natural language\ndescriptions to help people better understand, operate, and learn smart\ncontracts. Method: This paper proposes an automated translation tool for\nSolidity smart contracts, termed SolcTrans, based on an abstract syntax tree\nand formal grammar. We have investigated 3,000 smart contracts and determined\nthe part of speeches of corresponding blockchain terms. Among them, we further\nfiltered out contract snippets without detailed comments and left 811 snippets\nto evaluate the translation quality of SolcTrans. Results: Experimental results\nshow that even with a small corpus, SolcTrans can achieve similar performance\nto the state-of-the-art code comments generation models for other programming\nlanguages. In addition, SolcTrans has consistent performance when dealing with\ncode snippets with different lengths and gas consumption. Conclusion: SolcTrans\ncan correctly interpret Solidity codes and automatically convert them into\ncomprehensible English text. We will release our tool and dataset for\nsupporting reproduction and further studies in related fields.",

            "summary": "Regulatory radio spectrum management is evolving from traditional static\nfrequency allocation and assignment schemes towards dynamic spectrum management\nand access schemes. This evolution is necessitated by a number of factors\nincluding underutilization of licensed spectrum bands, changing market and\ntechnological developments and increased demand for spectrum for emerging\napplications in multimedia communications, internet-of-things and fifth\ngeneration (5G) wireless networks. In simple terms dynamic spectrum management\ninvolves allowing unlicensed users known as secondary users (SUs) to access the\nlicensed spectrum of a licensed user also known as primary user (PU). This is\nprimarily achieved using spectrum sharing schemes that leverage spectrum\ndatabase and cognitive radio techniques. However, the use of spectrum database\nand cognitive radio techniques faces reliability, security and privacy concerns\nfor spectrum sharing. There is also a need to support other requirements of\ndynamic spectrum management such as secondary spectrum trading market and\ndynamic spectrum access coordination. In this work, we review the use of\nblockchains for enabling spectrum sharing and other aspects of dynamic spectrum\nmanagement. The review covers the use of blockchain to record spectrum\nmanagement information such as spectrum sensing results and spectrum auction\ntransactions in a secure manner. The article also covers the use of smart\ncontracts to support complex service-levelagreements (SLAs) between network\noperators which is key to supporting a self-organized secondary spectrum\nsharing market and enforcement of regulatory policies. A taxonomy of the\nintersection between blockchain and various concepts of dynamic spectrum\nmanagement is also provided",

Although the healthcare blockchain technology has attracted broad\ninterests and attention in industry, government and academia, the security and\nprivacy concerns remain the focus of debate when deploying blockchains for\ninformation sharing in the healthcare sector from business operation to\nresearch collaboration. This paper focuses on the security and privacy\nrequirements for medical data sharing using blockchain, and provides a\ncomprehensive analysis of the security and privacy risks and requirements,\naccompanied by technical solution techniques and strategies. First, we discuss\nthe security and privacy requirements and attributes required for electronic\nmedical data sharing by deploying the healthcare blockchain. Second, we\ncategorize existing efforts into three reference blockchain usage scenarios for\nelectronic medical data sharing, and discuss the technologies for implementing\nthese security and privacy properties in the three categories of usage\nscenarios for healthcare blockchain, such as anonymous signatures,\nattribute-based encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, verification techniques for\nsmart contract security. Finally, we discuss other potential blockchain\napplication scenarios in healthcare sector. We conjecture that this survey will\nhelp healthcare professionals, decision makers, and healthcare service\ndevelopers to gain technical and intuitive insights into the security and\nprivacy of healthcare blockchains in terms of concepts, risks, requirements,\ndevelopment and deployment technologies and systems.",

Blockchains are relatively independent systems that are apt to form\nisolated data islands. Then cross-chain interaction is proposed to connect\ndifferent blockchains. However, the current cross-chain methods do not maintain\nthe security of the original blockchain. They either depend on a less secure\nthird-party system or a less secure method. This makes the cross-chain\ninteraction less secure than the original blockchains (the security downgrade\nissues), or the cross-chain interaction can be done even if the paired\nblockchain does not exist (the blockchain invisible issue). In this paper, we\nfirst propose a system interaction model and use it to analyze the possible\nsecurity issues. Based on conclusions got from the proposed model, we propose\nthe cross-chain method that verifies the data of the paired blockchain by the\nconsensus algorithm of the paired blockchain (the CIFuV method). With this\nmethod, the cross-chain interaction can be as the same security as in the\npaired blockchain. At last, we evaluate the security issues during the system\ninteraction process, and the possibility to have the CIFuV model on the public\nblockchains.",

The choice of trust metric will depend on context, circumstance and\nuser requirements and there is no single best metric for use in all\ncircumstances. Where different users require different trust metrics to be\nemployed the trust score calculations should still be based on all available\ntrust evidence. Trust is normally computed using past experiences but, in\npractice (especially in centralised systems), the validity and accuracy of\nthese experiences are taken for granted. In this paper, we provide a formal\nframework and practical blockchain-based implementation that allows independent\ntrust providers to implement different trust metrics in a distributed manner\nwhile still allowing all trust providers to base their calculations on a common\nset of trust evidence. Further, our design allows experiences to be provably\nlinked to interactions without the need for a central authority. This leads to\nthe notion of evidence-based trust with provable interactions.

In particular, it is\nexpected that the eigenvalues of the original hypergraph interlace the\neigenvalues of the perturbed hypergraph. Here we work on hypergraphs where, in\naddition, each vertex--edge incidence is given a real number, and we prove\ninterlacing results for the adjacency matrix, the Kirchoff Laplacian and the\nnormalized Laplacian. Tightness of the inequalities is also shown.",

Each node of a Merkle tree is equipped with a hash value computed from\nthose of their descendants. A Merkle tree is often used for representing a\nstate of a blockchain system since it can be used for efficiently auditing the\nstate in a trustless manner. Due to the safety-critical nature of blockchains,\nensuring the correctness of their implementation is paramount.\n  We show our formally verified implementation of the core part of Plebeia\nusing F*. Plebeia is a library to manipulate an extension of Merkle trees\n(called Plebeia trees). It is being implemented as a part of the storage system\nof the Tezos blockchain system. To this end, we gradually ported Plebeia to F*;\nthe OCaml code extracted from the modules ported to F* is linked with the\nunverified part of Plebeia. By this gradual porting process, we can obtain a\nworking code from our partially verified implementation of Plebeia; we\nconfirmed that the binary passes all the unit tests of Plebeia.\n  More specifically, we verified the following properties on the implementation\nof Plebeia: (1) Each tree-manipulating function preserves the invariants on the\ndata structure of a Plebeia tree and satisfies the functional requirements as a\nnested key-value store; (2) Each function for serializing/deserializing a\nPlebeia tree to/from the low-level storage is implemented correctly; and (3)\nThe hash function for a Plebeia tree is relatively collision-resistant with\nrespect to the cryptographic safety of the blake2b hash function. During\nporting Plebeia to F*, we found a bug in an old version of Plebeia, which was\noverlooked by the tests bundled with the original implementation. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work that verifies a production-level\nimplementation of a Merkle-tree library by F*.",

While electric vehicles (EVs) have become\nmore popular and slowly gain widespread adoption, the corresponding battery\ncharging infrastructures still limits EVs' use in our everyday life. This is\nespecially true for EV owners that do not have the option to operate charging\nhardware, such as wall boxes, at their premises. Charging an EV without an\nat-home wall box is time-consuming since the owner has to drive to the charger,\ncharge the vehicle while waiting nearby, and finally drive back home. Thus, a\nconvenient and easy-to-use solution is required to overcome the issue and\nincentivize EVs for daily commuters. Therefore, we propose an ecosystem and a\nservice platform for (semi-)autonomous electric vehicles that allow them to\nutilize their \"free\"-time, e.g., at night, to access public and private\ncharging infrastructure, charge their batteries, and get back home before the\nowner needs the car again. To do so, we utilize the concept of the\nMachine-to-Everything Economy (M2X Economy) and outline a decentralized\necosystem for smart machines that transact, interact and collaborate via\nblockchain-based smart contracts to enable a convenient battery charging\nmarketplace for (semi-)autonomous EVs.",

Traditionally, such\nefficiency-related questions were tackled only at the level of the overall\nsystem, and in a peer-to-peer (P2P) setting where miners directly connect to\none another. Despite it being common today for miners to pool compute\ncapacities in a mining pool managed by a centralized coordinator, efficiency in\nsuch a coordinated setting has barely been studied.\n  In this paper, we propose a simple model of a proof-of-work blockchain with\nlatencies for both the P2P and the coordinated settings. We derive a\nclosed-form expression for the efficiency in the coordinated setting with an\narbitrary number of miners and arbitrary latencies, both for the overall system\nand for each individual miner. We leverage this result to show that\ninequalities arise from variability in the delays, but that if all miners are\nequidistant from the coordinator, they have equal efficiency irrespective of\ntheir compute capacities. We then prove that, under a natural consistency\ncondition, the overall system efficiency in the P2P setting is higher than that\nin the coordinated setting. Finally, we perform a simulation-based study to\ndemonstrate that even in the P2P setting delays between miners introduce\ninequalities, and that there is a more complex interplay between delays and\ncompute capacities.",

However, more attention has been paid to\nthe single-chain consensus schemes. The multi-chains consensus with trusted\nminers participation has been not considered, thus offering opportunities for\nmalicious users to launch Diverse Miners Behaviors (DMB) attacks on different\nchains. DMB attackers can be friendly in the consensus process of some chains\ncalled mask-chains to enhance trust value, while on other chains called\nkill-chains they engage in destructive behaviors of network. In this paper, we\npropose a multi-chains consensus scheme named as Proof-of-DiscTrust (PoDT) to\ndefend against DMB attacks. Distinctive trust idea (DiscTrust) is introduced to\nevaluate the trust value of each user concerning different chains. A dynamic\nbehaviors prediction scheme is designed to strengthen DiscTrust to prevent\nintensive DMB attackers who maintain high trust by alternately creating true or\nfalse blocks on kill-chains. On this basis, a trusted miners selection\nalgorithm for multi-chains can be achieved at a round of block creation.\nExperimental results show that PoDT is secure against DMB attacks and more\neffective than traditional consensus schemes in multi-chains environments.",

This paper explores the\nopportunities stemming from the realization of cloud-enabled HAPS in the\ncontext of telecommunications applications and services. The paper first\nadvocates for the potential physical advantages of deploying HAPS as flying\ndata-centers, also known as super-macro base stations. The paper then describes\nvarious cloud services that can be offered from the HAPS and the merits that\ncan be achieved by this integration, such as enhancing the quality, speed, and\nrange of the offered services. The proposed services span a wide range of\nfields, including satellites, Internet of Things (IoT), ad hoc networks (such\nas sensor; vehicular; and aerial networks), gaming, and social networks. For\neach service, the paper illustrates the methods that would be used by cloud\nproviders to offload the service data to the HAPS and enable the cloud\ncustomers to consume the service. The paper further sheds light on the\nchallenges that need to be addressed for realizing practical cloud-enabled\nHAPS, mainly, those related to high energy, processing power, quality of\nservice (QoS), and security considerations. Finally, the paper discusses some\nopen issues on the topic, namely, HAPS mobility and message routing, HAPS\nsecurity via blockchain and machine learning, artificial intelligence-based\nresource allocation in cloud-enabled HAPS, and integration with vertical\nheterogeneous networks.",

            "summary": "Motivated by the recent surge of criminal activities with\ncross-cryptocurrency trades, we introduce a new topological perspective to\nstructural anomaly detection in dynamic multilayer networks. We postulate that\nanomalies in the underlying blockchain transaction graph that are composed of\nmultiple layers are likely to also be manifested in anomalous patterns of the\nnetwork shape properties. As such, we invoke the machinery of clique persistent\nhomology on graphs to systematically and efficiently track evolution of the\nnetwork shape and, as a result, to detect changes in the underlying network\ntopology and geometry. We develop a new persistence summary for multilayer\nnetworks, called stacked persistence diagram, and prove its stability under\ninput data perturbations. We validate our new topological anomaly detection\nframework in application to dynamic multilayer networks from the Ethereum\nBlockchain and the Ripple Credit Network, and demonstrate that our stacked PD\napproach substantially outperforms state-of-art techniques.",

Digital information\ndistribution often requires deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and\nData Fusion techniques which have also gained popularity in both, civilian and\nmilitary environments, such as, emergence of Smart Cities and Internet of\nBattlefield Things (IoBT). This usually requires capturing and consolidating\ndata from multiple sources. Because datasets do not necessarily originate from\nidentical sensors, fused data typically results in a complex Big Data problem.\nDue to potentially sensitive nature of IoT datasets, Blockchain technology is\nused to facilitate secure sharing of IoT datasets, which allows digital\ninformation to be distributed, but not copied. However, blockchain has several\nlimitations related to complexity, scalability, and excessive energy\nconsumption. We propose an approach to hide information (sensor signal) by\ntransforming it to an image or an audio signal. In one of the latest attempts\nto the military modernization, we investigate sensor fusion approach by\ninvestigating the challenges of enabling an intelligent identification and\ndetection operation and demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed Deep\nLearning and Anomaly Detection models that can support future application for\nspecific hand gesture alert system from wearable devices.",

            "summary": "Demand for blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is far larger than\nsupply, necessitating a mechanism that selects a subset of transactions to\ninclude \"on-chain\" from the pool of all pending transactions. This paper\ninvestigates the problem of designing a blockchain transaction fee mechanism\nthrough the lens of mechanism design. We introduce two new forms of\nincentive-compatibility that capture some of the idiosyncrasies of the\nblockchain setting, one (MMIC) that protects against deviations by\nprofit-maximizing miners and one (OCA-proofness) that protects against\noff-chain collusion between miners and users.\n  This study is immediately applicable to a recent (August 5, 2021) and major\nchange to Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism, based on a proposal called\n\"EIP-1559.\" Historically, Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism was a\nfirst-price (pay-as-bid) auction. EIP-1559 suggested making several tightly\ncoupled changes, including the introduction of variable-size blocks, a\nhistory-dependent reserve price, and the burning of a significant portion of\nthe transaction fees. We prove that this new mechanism earns an impressive\nreport card: it satisfies the MMIC and OCA-proofness conditions, and is also\ndominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) except when there is a sudden\ndemand spike. We also introduce an alternative design, the \"tipless mechanism,\"\nwhich offers an incomparable slate of incentive-compatibility guarantees -- it\nis MMIC and DSIC, and OCA-proof unless in the midst of a demand spike.",

Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1\nmillion trades of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021,\nobtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize\nstatistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of\ninteractions, show that traders typically specialize on NFTs associated with\nsimilar objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the\nsame kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to\ntheir visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous\nobjects. Finally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales using simple\nmachine learning algorithms and find that sale history and, secondarily, visual\nfeatures are good predictors for price. We anticipate that these findings will\nstimulate further research on NFT production, adoption, and trading in\ndifferent contexts.",

            "summary": "The blockchain technology has been extensively studied to enable distributed\nand tamper-proof data processing in federated learning (FL). Most existing\nblockchain assisted FL (BFL) frameworks have employed a third-party blockchain\nnetwork to decentralize the model aggregation process. However, decentralized\nmodel aggregation is vulnerable to pooling and collusion attacks from the\nthird-party blockchain network. Driven by this issue, we propose a novel BFL\nframework that features the integration of training and mining at the client\nside. To optimize the learning performance of FL, we propose to maximize the\nlong-term time average (LTA) training data size under a constraint of LTA\nenergy consumption. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of\ntraining client selection and resource allocation (i.e., the transmit power and\ncomputation frequency at the client side), and solve the long-term mixed\ninteger non-linear programming based on a Lyapunov technique. In particular,\nthe proposed dynamic resource allocation and client scheduling (DRACS)\nalgorithm can achieve a trade-off of [$\\mathcal{O}(1/V)$,\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{V})$] to balance the maximization of the LTA training data\nsize and the minimization of the LTA energy consumption with a control\nparameter $V$. Our experimental results show that the proposed DRACS algorithm\nachieves better learning accuracy than benchmark client scheduling strategies\nwith limited time or energy consumption.",

The\nautomatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with\nkeyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts\neffectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source\ncode. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the\napplication scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models\nare vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification\nmodel based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve\nthese problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize\nthe model. Our experimental studies on over 3,300 real-world Ethereum smart\ncontracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code\nand has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good\nresistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition,\nour analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract\nclassification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.",

To\nachieve state machine replication in blockchains built on top of consensus, one\nneeds to guarantee fairness of user transactions. A huge body of work has been\ncarried out on the relation between state machine replication and consensus in\nthe past years, in a variety of system models and with respect to varied\nproblem specifications. We systematize this work by proposing novel and\nrigorous abstractions for state machine replication and repeated consensus in a\nsystem model that accounts for realistic blockchains in which blocks may\ncontain several transactions issued by one or more users, and where validity\nand order of transactions within a block is determined by an external\napplication-dependent function that can capture various approaches for\norder-fairness in the literature. Based on these abstractions, we propose a\nreduction from state machine replication to repeated consensus, such that user\nfairness is achieved using the consensus module as a black box. This approach\nallows to achieve fairness as an add-on on top of preexisting consensus modules\nin blockchains based on repeated consensus.",

            "summary": "Blockchain has received tremendous attention as a secure, distributed, and\nanonymous framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). As a distributed system,\nblockchain trades off scalability for distribution, which limits the\ntechnologys adaptation for large scale networks such as IoT. All transactions\nand blocks must be broadcast and verified by all participants which limits\nscalability and incurs computational and communication overheads. The existing\nsolutions to scale blockchains have so far led to partial recentralization,\nlimiting the technologys original appeal. In this paper, we introduce a\ndistributed yet scalable Verification and Communication architecture for\nblockchain referred to as Vericom. Vericom concurrently achieves high\nscalability and distribution using hash function outputs to shift blockchains\nfrom broadcast to multicast communication. Unlike conventional blockchains\nwhere all nodes must verify new transactions/blocks, Vericom uses the hash of\nIoT traffic to randomly select a set of nodes to verify transactions/blocks\nwhich in turn reduces the processing overhead. Vericom incorporates two layers:\ni) transmission layer where a randomized multicasting method is introduced\nalong with a backbone network to route traffic, i.e., transactions and blocks,\nfrom the source to the destination, and ii) verification layer where a set of\nrandomly selected nodes are allocated to verify each transaction or block. The\nperformance evaluation shows that Vericom reduces the packet and processing\noverhead as compared with conventional blockchains. In the worst case, packet\noverhead in Vericom scales linearly with the number of nodes while the\nprocessing overhead remains scale-independent.",

Optical fiber communication networks\nare vulnerable to several types of security threats, such as single point\nfailure, wormhole attacks, and sybil attacks. Therefore, blockchain is a\npromising solution to protect confidential information against attacks and\nhelps in achieving trusted network architecture by creating a distributed\nledger platform. Recently, blockchain has received much attention because of\nits decentralized and distributed ledger technology. Hence, blockchain has also\nbeen employed to protect network against such attacks. However, blockchain\ntechnology's security relies on the platform of computational complexity, and\nbecause of the evolution of quantum computers, it will become insecure in the\nnear future. Therefore, for enhancing blockchain security, research focus on\ncombining quantum key distribution (QKD) with blockchain. This new technology\nis known as quantum-secured blockchain. The article describes the attacks in\noptical networks and provides a solution to protect network against security\nattacks by employing quantum-secured blockchain in optical networks. It\nprovides a brief overview of blockchain technology with its security loopholes\nand focuses on QKD, which makes blockchain technology more robust against\nquantum-attacks.

Such schemes\nare especially effective when large chunks of data have to be managed.\nMoreover, we present methods for low-cost data handling in Ethereum, namely the\nevent-logs, the transaction payload, and the almost surprising exploitation of\nunused function arguments. Finally, we evaluate these methods on a\ncomprehensive set of experiments.",

With the\nincreasing popularity of smart contracts, blockchain systems, in particular\nEthereum, have been the \"paradise\" of versatile fraud activities in which\nPonzi, Honeypot and Phishing are the prominent ones. Formal verification and\nsymbolic analysis have been employed to combat these destructive scams by\nanalyzing the codes and function calls, yet the vulnerability of each\n\\emph{individual} scam should be predefined discreetly. In this work, we\npresent SCSGuard, a novel deep learning scam detection framework that harnesses\nthe automatically extractable bytecodes of smart contracts as their new\nfeatures. We design a GRU network with attention mechanism to learn from the\n\\emph{N-gram bytecode} patterns, and determines whether a smart contract is\nfraudulent or not. Our framework is advantageous over the baseline algorithms\nin three aspects. Firstly, SCSGuard provides a unified solution to different\nscam genres, thus relieving the need of code analysis skills. Secondly, the\ninference of SCSGuard is faster than the code analysis by several order of\nmagnitudes. Thirdly, experimental results manifest that SCSGuard achieves high\naccuracy (0.92$\\sim$0.94), precision (0.94$\\sim$0.96\\%) and recall\n(0.97$\\sim$0.98) for both Ponzi and Honeypot scams under similar settings, and\nis potentially useful to detect new Phishing smart contracts.",

The\ncentralized work method in the LoRa system, where all packages are processed\nand kept in the central cloud, cannot well exploit the resources in LoRa\ngateways and also makes it vulnerable to security risks, such as data\nfalsification or data loss. On the other hand, the blockchain has the potential\nto provide a decentralized and secure infrastructure for the LoRa system.\nHowever, there are significant challenges in deploying blockchain at LoRa\ngateways with limited edge computing abilities. This article proposes a design\nand implementation of the blockchain-enabled LoRa system with edge computing by\nusing the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, which is called as HyperLoRa.\nAccording to different features of LoRa data, a blockchain network with\nmultiple ledgers is designed, each of which stores a specific kind of LoRa\ndata. LoRa gateways can participate in the operations of the blockchain and\nshare the ledger that keep the time-critical network data with small size.\nThen, the edge computing abilities of LoRa gateways are utilized to handle the\njoin procedure and application packages processing. Furthermore, a HyperLoRa\nprototype is implemented on embedded hardware, which demonstrates the\nfeasibility of deploying the blockchain into LoRa gateways with limited\ncomputing and storage resources. Finally, various experiments are conducted to\nevaluate the performances of the proposed LoRa system.",

            "summary": "Natural forking in blockchain refers to a phenomenon that there are a set of\nblocks at one block height at the same time, implying that various nodes have\ndifferent perspectives of the main chain. Natural forking might give rise to\nmultiple adverse impacts on blockchain, jeopardizing the performance and\nsecurity of the system consequently. However, the ongoing literature in\nanalyzing natural forking is mainly from the macro point of view, which is not\nsufficient to incisively understand this phenomenon. In this paper, we fill\nthis gap through leveraging the large deviation theory to conduct a microscopic\nstudy of natural forking, which resorts to investigating the instantaneous\ndifference between block generation and dissemination in blockchain. Our work\nis derived comprehensively and complementarily via a three-step process, where\nboth the natural forking probability and its decay rate are presented. Through\nsolid theoretical derivation and extensive numerical simulations, we find 1)\nthe probability of the mismatch between block generation and dissemination\nexceeding a given threshold dwindles exponentially with the increase of natural\nforking robustness related parameter or the difference between the block\ndissemination rate and block creation rate; 2) the natural forking robustness\nrelated parameter may emphasize a more dominant effect on accelerating the\nabortion of natural forking in some cases; 3) when the self-correlated block\ngeneration rate is depicted as the stationary autoregressive process with a\nscaling parameter, it is found that setting a lower scaling parameter may speed\nup the failure of natural forking. These findings are valuable since they offer\na fresh theoretical basis to engineer optimal countermeasures for thwarting\nnatural forking and thereby enlivening the blockchain network.",

Bitcoins\nare associated with alpha-numeric addresses and are transferred via\ntransactions. Each transaction is composed of a set of input addresses\n(associated with unspent outputs received from previous transactions) and a set\nof output addresses (to which Bitcoins are transferred). Despite Bitcoin was\ndesigned with anonymity in mind, different heuristic approaches exist to detect\nwhich addresses in a specific transaction belong to the same entity. By\napplying these heuristics, we build an Address Correspondence Network: in this\nrepresentation, addresses are nodes are connected with edges if at least one\nheuristic detects them as belonging to the same entity. %addresses are nodes\nand edges are drawn between addresses detected as belonging to the same entity\nby at least one heuristic. %nodes represent addresses and edges model the\nlikelihood that two nodes belong to the same entity %In this network, connected\ncomponents represent sets of addresses controlled by the same entity. In this\npaper, we analyse for the first time the Address Correspondence Network and\nshow it is characterised by a complex topology, signalled by a broad, skewed\ndegree distribution and a power-law component size distribution. Using a\nlarge-scale dataset of addresses for which the controlling entities are known,\nwe show that a combination of external data coupled with standard community\ndetection algorithms can reliably identify entities. The complex nature of the\nAddress Correspondence Network reveals that usage patterns of individual\nentities create statistical regularities; and that these regularities can be\nleveraged to more accurately identify entities and gain a deeper understanding\nof the Bitcoin economy as a whole.",

However, we identify attacks to break the claimed security. In\nthis paper, we show our results by providing a security analysis on its dBFT\nprotocol.

These attacks break\nthe security of dBFT with no more than $f$ nodes. Then, we provide\nrecommendations on how to fix the system against the identified attacks.

In this study, we review the existing literature and broadly\nclassify the BT applications.

Side blockchains are vulnerable to stalling attacks where a\nside blockchain node pushes the hash of a block to the trusted blockchain but\nmakes the block unavailable to other side blockchain nodes. Recently, Sheng et\nal. proposed a data availability oracle based on LDPC codes and a data\ndispersal protocol as a solution to the above problem. While showing\nimprovements, the codes and dispersal protocol were designed disjointly which\nmay not be optimal in terms of the communication cost associated with the\noracle. In this paper, we provide a tailored dispersal protocol and specialized\nLDPC code construction based on the Progressive Edge Growth (PEG) algorithm,\ncalled the dispersal-efficient PEG (DE-PEG) algorithm, aimed to reduce the\ncommunication cost associated with the new dispersal protocol. Our new code\nconstruction reduces the communication cost and, additionally, is less\nrestrictive in terms of system design.",

It offers an only a forward flow of products with almost no\nsecurity and tracking process. In time, the system will lag behind due to the\nlimitations in quality inspection, fraudulent information, and monopolistic\nbehavior of supply chain entities. Inclusion of counterfeiting products and\nopaqueness of the system urge renovation in this sector. The recent evolution\nof Industry 4.0 leads to the alternation in the supply chain introducing the\nsmart supply chain. Technological advancement can now reshape the\ninfrastructure of the supply chain for the future. In this paper, we suggest a\nconceptual framework utilizing Blockchain and Smart Contract to monitor the\noverall oil supply chain. Blockchain is a groundbreaking technology to monitor\nand support the security building of a decentralized type supply chain over a\npeer-to-peer network. The use of the Internet of Things (IoT), especially\nsensors, opens broader window to track the global supply chain in real-time. We\nconstruct a methodology to support reverse traceability for each participant of\nthe supply chain. The functions and characteristics of Blockchain and Smart\nContract are defined. Implementation of Smart Contracts has also been shown\nwith detailed analysis. We further describe the challenges of implementing such\na system and validate our framework's adaptability in the real world.

            "summary": "Smart contract is one of the core features of Ethereum and has inspired many\nblockchain descendants. Since its advent, the verification paradigm of smart\ncontract has been improving toward high scalability. It shifts from the\nexpensive on-chain verification to the orchestration of off-chain VM (virtual\nmachine) execution and on-chain arbitration with the pinpoint protocol. The\nrepresentative projects are TrueBit, Arbitrum, YODA, ACE, and Optimism.\nInspired by visionaries in academia and industry, we consider the DNN\ncomputation to be promising but on the next level of complexity for the\nverification paradigm of smart contract. Unfortunately, even for the\nstate-of-the-art verification paradigm, off-chain VM execution of DNN\ncomputation has an orders-of-magnitude slowdown compared to the native\noff-chain execution.\n  To enable the native off-chain execution of verifiable DNN computation, we\npresent Agatha system, which solves the significant challenges of misalignment\nand inconsistency: (1) Native DNN computation has a graph-based computation\nparadigm misaligned with previous VM-based execution and arbitration; (2)\nNative DNN computation may be inconsistent cross platforms which invalidates\nthe verification paradigm. In response, we propose the graph-based pinpoint\nprotocol (GPP) which enables the pinpoint protocol on computational graphs, and\nbridges the native off-chain execution and the contract arbitration. We also\ndevelop a technique named Cross-evaluator Consistent Execution (XCE), which\nguarantees cross-platform consistency and forms the correctness foundation of\nGPP. We showcase Agatha for the DNN computation of popular models (MobileNet,\nResNet50 and VGG16) on Ethereum. Agatha achieves a negligible on-chain\noverhead, and an off-chain execution overhead of 3.0%, which represents an\noff-chain latency reduction of at least 602x compared to the state-of-the-art\nverification paradigm.",

However it lacked a crucial element\npresent in current fiat-based systems - the ability to continuously spend or\ntransfer coins. Bitcoin reignited the interest in cryptocurrencies in the last\ndecade but is now seen as more of an asset store as opposed to a financial\ninstrument. One interesting thing that has come out of the Bitcoin system is\nblockchains and the associated distributed consensus protocols. In this paper\nwe propose a transferable electronic cash scheme using blockchain technology\nwhich allows users to continuously reuse coins within the system.",

            "summary": "Pyramid schemes are investment scams in which top-level participants in a\nhierarchical network recruit and profit from an expanding base of defrauded\nnewer participants. Pyramid schemes have existed for over a century, but there\nhave been no in-depth studies of their dynamics and communities because of the\nopacity of participants' transactions.\n  In this paper, we present an empirical study of Forsage, a pyramid scheme\nimplemented as a smart contract and at its peak one of the largest consumers of\nresources in Ethereum. As a smart contract, Forsage makes its (byte)code and\nall of its transactions visible on the blockchain. We take advantage of this\nunprecedented transparency to gain insight into the mechanics, impact on\nparticipants, and evolution of Forsage.\n  We quantify the (multi-million-dollar) gains of top-level participants as\nwell as the losses of the vast majority (around 88%) of users. We analyze\nForsage code both manually and using a purpose-built transaction simulator to\nuncover the complex mechanics of the scheme. Through complementary study of\npromotional videos and social media, we show how Forsage promoters have\nleveraged the unique features of smart contracts to lure users with false\nclaims of trustworthiness and profitability, and how Forsage activity is\nconcentrated within a small number of national communities.",

            "summary": "It is impossible to solve the Byzantine consensus problem in an open network\nof $n$ participants if only $2n/3$ or less of them are correct. As blockchains\nneed to solve consensus, one might think that blockchains need more than $2n/3$\ncorrect participants. But it is yet unknown whether consensus can be solved\nwhen less than $2n/3$ participants are correct and $k$ participants are\nrational players, which misbehave if they can gain the loot. Trading correct\nparticipants for rational players may not seem helpful to solve consensus since\nrational players can misbehave whereas correct participants, by definition,\ncannot.\n  In this paper, we show that consensus is actually solvable in this model,\neven with less than $2n/3$ correct participants. The key idea is a baiting\nstrategy that lets rational players pretend to misbehave in joining a coalition\nbut rewards them to betray this coalition before the loot gets stolen. We\npropose TRAP, a protocol that builds upon recent advances in the theory of\naccountability to solve consensus as soon as\n$n>\\max\\bigl(\\frac{3}{2}k+3t,2(k+t)\\bigr)$: by assuming that private keys\ncannot be forged, this protocol is an equilibrium where no coalition of $k$\nrational players can coordinate to increase their expected utility regardless\nof the arbitrary behavior of up to $t$ Byzantine players.\n  Finally, we show that a baiting strategy is necessary and sufficient to solve\nthis, so-called rational agreement problem. First, we show that it is\nimpossible to solve this rational agreement problem without implementing a\nbaiting strategy. Second, the existence of TRAP demonstrates the sufficiency of\nthe baiting strategy. Our TRAP protocol finds applications in blockchains to\nprevent players from disagreeing, that could otherwise lead to \"double\nspending\".",

As convergence of these two emerging ideas, we propose to enhance DL\narchitectures with the most salient time-conditioned topological information of\nthe data and introduce the concept of zigzag persistence into time-aware graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs). Zigzag persistence provides a systematic and\nmathematically rigorous framework to track the most important topological\nfeatures of the observed data that tend to manifest themselves over time. To\nintegrate the extracted time-conditioned topological descriptors into DL, we\ndevelop a new topological summary, zigzag persistence image, and derive its\ntheoretical stability guarantees. We validate the new GCNs with a time-aware\nzigzag topological layer (Z-GCNETs), in application to traffic forecasting and\nEthereum blockchain price prediction.

            "summary": "Smart Contracts are software programs that are deployed and executed within a\nblockchain infrastructure. Due to their immutable nature, directly resulting\nfrom the specific characteristics of the deploying infrastructure, smart\ncontracts must be thoroughly tested before their release. Testing is one of the\nmain activities that can help to improve the reliability of a smart contract,\nso as to possibly prevent considerable loss of valuable assets. It is therefore\nimportant to provide the testers with tools that permit them to assess the\nactivity they performed. Mutation testing is a powerful approach for assessing\nthe fault-detection capability of a test suite. In this paper, we propose SuMo,\na novel mutation testing tool for Ethereum Smart Contracts. SuMo implements a\nset of 44 mutation operators that were designed starting from the latest\nSolidity documentation, and from well-known mutation testing tools. These allow\nto simulate a wide variety of faults that can be made by smart contract\ndevelopers. The set of operators was designed to limit the generation of\nstillborn mutants, which slow down the mutation testing process and limit the\nusability of the tool. We report a first evaluation of SuMo on open-source\nprojects for which test suites were available. The results we got are\nencouraging, and they suggest that SuMo can effectively help developers to\ndeliver more reliable smart contracts.",

A key requirement of practical PoW blockchains\nis to adapt to mining power variations over time. In this paper, we consider\nthe design of provably secure parallel-chain protocols which can adapt to such\nmining power variations.\n  The Bitcoin difficulty adjustment rule adjusts the difficulty target of block\nmining periodically to get a constant mean inter-block time. While\nsuperficially simple, the rule has proved itself to be sophisticated and\nsuccessfully secure, both in practice and in theory. We show that natural\nadaptations of the Bitcoin adjustment rule to the parallel-chain case open the\ndoor to subtle, but catastrophic safety and liveness breaches. We uncover a\nmeta-design principle that allow us to design variable mining difficulty\nprotocols for three popular PoW blockchain proposals (Prism, OHIE, and\nFruitchains) inside a common rubric.\n  The principle has three components:(M1) a pivot chain, based on which blocks\nin all chains choose difficulty, (M2) a monotonicity condition for referencing\npivot chain blocks and (M3) translating additional protocol aspects from using\nlevels (depth) to using \"difficulty levels\". We show that protocols employing a\nsubset of these principles may have catastrophic failures. The security of the\ndesigns is also proved using a common rubric - the key technical challenge\ninvolves analyzing the interaction between the pivot chain and the other\nchains, as well as bounding the sudden changes in difficulty target experienced\nin non-pivot chains. We empirically investigate the responsivity of the new\nmining difficulty rule via simulations based on historical Bitcoin data, and\nfind that the protocol very effectively controls the forking rate across all\nthe chains.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technology (BT) Ethereum Smart Contracts allows programmable\ntransactions that involve the transfer of monetary assets among peers on a BT\nnetwork independent of a central authorizing agency. Ethereum Smart Contracts\nare programs that are deployed as decentralized applications, having the\nbuilding blocks of the blockchain consensus protocol. This technology enables\nconsumers to make agreements in a transparent and conflict-free environment.\nHowever, the security vulnerabilities within these smart contracts are a\npotential threat to the applications and their consumers and have shown in the\npast to cause huge financial losses. In this paper, we propose a framework that\ncombines static and dynamic analysis to detect Denial of Service (DoS)\nvulnerability due to an unexpected revert in Ethereum Smart Contracts. Our\nframework, SmartScan, statically scans smart contracts under test (SCUTs) to\nidentify patterns that are potentially vulnerable in these SCUTs and then uses\ndynamic analysis to precisely confirm their exploitability of the\nDoS-Unexpected Revert vulnerability, thus achieving increased performance and\nmore precise results. We evaluated SmartScan on a set of 500 smart contracts\ncollected from the Etherscan. Our approach shows an improvement in precision\nand recall when compared to available state-of-the-art techniques.",

It has been previously pointed out that quantum\ndevices provide a computational advantage in performing PoW in the context of\nBitcoin. Here we make the case that this quantum advantage extends not only to\nall existing PoW mechanisms, but to any possible PoW as well. This has strong\nconsequences regarding both quantum-based attacks on the integrity of the\nentirety of the blockchain, as well as more legitimate uses of quantum\ncomputation for the purpose of mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For\nthe first case, we estimate when these quantum attacks will become feasible,\nfor various cryptocurrencies, and discuss the impact of such attacks. For the\nlatter, we derive a precise formula to calculate the economic incentive for\nswitching to quantum-based cryptocurrency miners. Using this formula, we\nanalyze several test scenarios, and conclude that investing in quantum hardware\nfor cryptocurrency mining has the potential to pay off immensely.",

Therefore, in this paper, we present a detailed review of the\nsecurity-critical drone applications, and security-related challenges in drone\ncommunication such as DoS attacks, Man-in-the-middle attacks, De-Authentication\nattacks, and so on. Furthermore, as part of solution architectures, the use of\nBlockchain, Software Defined Networks (SDN), Machine Learning, and Fog/Edge\ncomputing are discussed as these are the most emerging technologies. Drones are\nhighly resource-constrained devices and therefore it is not possible to deploy\nheavy security algorithms on board. Blockchain can be used to cryptographically\nstore all the data that is sent to/from the drones, thereby saving it from\ntampering and eavesdropping. Various ML algorithms can be used to detect\nmalicious drones in the network and to detect safe routes. Additionally, the\nSDN technology can be used to make the drone network reliable by allowing the\ncontroller to keep a close check on data traffic, and fog computing can be used\nto keep the computation capabilities closer to the drones without overloading\nthem.",

The following strategies and trends were generally observed\nin these technologies:\n  Cryptography: the hashing algorithm was found to be the most used\ncryptographic primitive in enterprise or changeover privacy solutions.\nCoordination via on-chain contracts - a common strategy was to use a shared\npublicly ledger to coordinate data privacy groups and more generally managed\nidentities and access control.\n  Transaction and contract code sharing: there was a variety of different\nlevels of privacy around the business logic (smart contract code) visibility.\nSome solutions only allowed authorised peers to view code while others made\nthis accessible to everybody that was a member of the shared ledger.\n  Data migrations for data privacy applications: significant challenges exist\nwhen using cryptographically stored data in terms of being able to run system\nupgrades.\n  Multiple blockchain ledgers for data privacy: solutions attempted to create a\nnew private blockchain for every private data relationship which was eventually\nabandoned in favour of one shared ledger with private data\ncollections/transactions that were anchored to the ledger with a hash in order\nto improve scaling.",

The judge actively obtains the result rather than passively waiting\nfor it sent by a competitor.

One is secure\nagainst a semi-honest adversary with low computation and communication cost,\nwhile the other is secure against a malicious adversary.\n  Basing on TPIC, we present multi-party comparisons through concrete\napplications, including a joint bidding scheme and a practical auction. Brief\nsecurity proofs and analysis for the applications are presented. In comparison,\nour auction scheme is more efficient with lower cost, making it feasible in\npractice rather than a theoretical design.

It is widely accepted that a paradigm shift to a\ndecentralized power system with bidirectional power flow is necessary to the\nintegration of DERs. The virtual power plant (VPP) emerges as a promising\nparadigm for managing DERs to participate in the power system. In this paper,\nwe develop a blockchain-based VPP energy management platform to facilitate a\nrich set of transactive energy activities among residential users with\nrenewables, energy storage, and flexible loads in a VPP. Specifically, users\ncan interact with each other to trade energy for mutual benefits and provide\nnetwork services, such as feed-in energy, reserve, and demand response, through\nthe VPP. To respect the users' independence and preserve their privacy, we\ndesign a decentralized optimization algorithm to optimize the users' energy\nscheduling, energy trading, and network services. Then we develop a prototype\nblockchain network for VPP energy management and implement the proposed\nalgorithm on the blockchain network. By experiments using real-world\ndata-trace, we validated the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithm and\nthe blockchain system. The simulation results demonstrate that our\nblockchain-based VPP energy management platform reduces the users' cost by up\nto 38.6% and reduces the overall system cost by 11.2%.",

            "summary": "Permissionless blockchain protocols are known to consume an outrageous amount\nof computing power and suffer from a trade-off between latency and confidence\nin transaction confirmation. The recently proposed Algorand blockchain protocol\nemploys Byzantine agreements and has shown transaction confirmation latency on\nthe order of seconds. Its strong resilience to Denial-of-Service and Sybil\nattacks and its low computing power footprint make it a strong candidate for\nthe venue of decentralized economies and business ecosystems across industries.\nNevertheless, Algorand's throughput is still far from the requirements of such\napplications. In this paper, we empower Algorand's protocol by multiplexing its\nbyzantine agreements in order to improve performance. Experiments on wide area\nnetworks with up to ten thousand nodes show a 4-fold throughput increase\ncompared to the original Algorand protocol.",

However, the AI training demands tremendous computing resource,\nwhich is limited in most 6G devices. Meanwhile, miners in Proof-of-Work (PoW)\nbased blockchains devote massive computing power to block mining, and are\nwidely criticized for the waste of computation. To address this dilemma, we\npropose an Evolved-Proof-of-Work (E-PoW) consensus that can integrate the\nmatrix computations, which are widely existed in AI training, into the process\nof brute-force searches in the block mining. Consequently, E-PoW can connect AI\nlearning and block mining via the multiply used common computing resource.\nExperimental results show that E-PoW can salvage by up to 80 percent computing\npower from pure block mining for parallel AI training in 6G systems.",

To achieve blockchain\nconsensus in wireless network, one of the important steps is to broadcast new\nblock using wireless channel. Under wireless network protocols, the block\ntransmitting will be affected significantly. In this work, we focus on the\nconsensus process in blockchain-based wireless local area network (B-WLAN) by\ninvestigating the impact of the media access control (MAC) protocol, CSMA/CA.\nWith the randomness of the backoff counter in CSMA/CA, it is possible for\nlatter blocks to catch up or outpace the earlier one, which complicates\nblockchain forking problem. In view of this, we propose mining strategies to\npause mining for reducing the forking probability, and a discard strategy to\nremove the forking blocks that already exist in CSMA/CA backoff procedure.\nBased on the proposed strategies, we design Block Access Control (BAC)\napproaches to effectively schedule block mining and transmitting for improving\nthe performance of B-WLAN. Then, Markov chain models are presented to conduct\nperformance analysis in B-WLAN. The results show that BAC approaches can help\nthe network to achieve a high transaction throughput while improving block\nutilization and saving computational power. Meanwhile, the trade-off between\ntransaction throughput and block utilization is demonstrated, which can act as\na guidance for practical deployment of blockchain.",

As a promising solution of decentralization, scalability and\nsecurity, leveraging blockchain in FL has attracted much attention in recent\nyears. However, the traditional consensus mechanisms designed for blockchain\nlike Proof of Work (PoW) would cause extreme resource consumption, which\nreduces the efficiency of FL greatly, especially when the participating devices\nare wireless and resource-limited. In order to address device asynchrony and\nanomaly detection in FL while avoiding the extra resource consumption caused by\nblockchain, this paper introduces a framework for empowering FL using Direct\nAcyclic Graph (DAG)-based blockchain systematically (DAG-FL). Accordingly,\nDAG-FL is first introduced from a three-layer architecture in details, and then\ntwo algorithms DAG-FL Controlling and DAG-FL Updating are designed running on\ndifferent nodes to elaborate the operation of DAG-FL consensus mechanism. After\nthat, a Poisson process model is formulated to discuss that how to set\ndeployment parameters to maintain DAG-FL stably in different federated learning\ntasks. The extensive simulations and experiments show that DAG-FL can achieve\nbetter performance in terms of training efficiency and model accuracy compared\nwith the typical existing on-device federated learning systems as the\nbenchmarks.",

However, data privacy concerns\nsuch as the protection of trade secrets have hindered adoption of blockchain\ntechnology. Although consortium blockchains only allow authorised supply chain\nentities to read/write to the ledger, privacy preservation of trade secrets\ncannot be ascertained. In this work, we propose a privacy-preservation\nframework, PrivChain, to protect sensitive data on blockchain using zero\nknowledge proofs. PrivChain provides provenance and traceability without\nrevealing any sensitive information to end-consumers or supply chain entities.\nIts novelty stems from: a) its ability to allow data owners to protect trade\nrelated information and instead provide proofs on the data, and b) an\nintegrated incentive mechanism for entities providing valid proofs over\nprovenance data. In particular, PrivChain uses Zero Knowledge Range Proofs\n(ZKRPs), an efficient variant of ZKPs, to provide origin information without\ndisclosing the exact location of a supply chain product. Furthermore, the\nframework allows to compute proofs and commitments off-line, decoupling the\ncomputational overhead from blockchain. The proof verification process and\nincentive payment initiation are automated using blockchain transactions, smart\ncontracts, and events. A proof of concept implementation on Hyperledger Fabric\nreveals a minimal overhead of using PrivChain for blockchain enabled supply\nchains.",

It could\nrepresent a step forward in empowering users, granting them control over their\ndata. This work conducts a systematic literature review to investigate\nstate-of-the-art measures based on SSI and Blockchain technologies for dealing\nwith electronic health records (EHRs), identifying gaps, and determining the\nkey questions for future research. As a result, this review shows a growing\ninterest in Blockchain methods to handle EHRs, but few works consider using the\nself-sovereign identity approaches. The results obtained in this work also\nsuggest that: Blockchain technologies provide a viable alternative to deliver\nEHR solutions such as patient monitoring, healthcare data trading, and\nprescription control; consolidated Blockchain technologies are the preferred\ncore components of most effective strategies; keeping raw health data off-chain\nhelps to create scalable solutions; health data standards make searching\nmedical records in Blockchain structures feasible; Smart Contracts are\nessential components of Blockchain-based EHR solutions; the concepts of data\nownership and Self-Sovereign Identity have been neither adequately defined nor\nemployed in the health context.",

Through the adaptation of\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled NGN, the shape of healthcare systems can\nbe altered to achieve smart and secure healthcare capable of coping with\nepidemics that may emerge at any given moment. In this article, we envision a\ncooperative and distributed healthcare framework that relies on\nstate-of-the-art computing, communication, and intelligence capabilities,\nnamely, Federated Learning (FL), mobile edge computing (MEC), and Blockchain,\nto enable epidemic (or suspicious infectious disease) discovery, remote\nmonitoring, and fast health-authority response. The introduced framework can\nalso enable secure medical data exchange at the edge and between different\nhealth entities. Such a technique, coupled with the low latency and high\nbandwidth functionality of 5G and beyond networks, would enable mass\nsurveillance, monitoring and analysis to occur at the edge.

Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection\nand training the model in a single organization, which is most common weakness\ndue to the privacy and security of raw data communication. To solve this\nchallenging task, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework\nthat provides collaborative data training solutions by coordinating multiple\nhospitals to train and share encrypted federated models without leakage of data\nprivacy. The blockchain ledger technology provides the decentralization of\nfederated learning model without any central server. The proposed homomorphic\nencryption scheme encrypts and decrypts the gradients of model to preserve the\nprivacy. More precisely, the proposed framework: i) train the local model by a\nnovel capsule network to segmentation and classify COVID-19 images, ii) then\nuse the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model that encrypts\nand decrypts the gradients, and finally the model is shared over a\ndecentralized platform through proposed blockchain-based federated learning\nalgorithm.

            "summary": "Smart contracts are programs that execute inside blockchains such as Ethereum\nto manipulate digital assets. Since bugs in smart contracts may lead to\nsubstantial financial losses, there is considerable interest in formally\nproving their correctness. However, the specification and verification of smart\ncontracts faces challenges that do not arise in other application domains.\nSmart contracts frequently interact with unverified, potentially adversarial\noutside code, which substantially weakens the assumptions that formal analyses\ncan (soundly) make. Moreover, the core functionality of smart contracts is to\nmanipulate and transfer resources; describing this functionality concisely\nrequires dedicated specification support. Current reasoning techniques do not\nfully address these challenges, being restricted in their scope or\nexpressiveness (in particular, in the presence of re-entrant calls), and\noffering limited means of expressing the resource transfers a contract\nperforms.\n  In this paper, we present a novel specification methodology tailored to the\ndomain of smart contracts. Our specification constructs and associated\nreasoning technique are the first to enable: (1) sound and precise reasoning in\nthe presence of unverified code and arbitrary re-entrancy, (2) modular\nreasoning about collaborating smart contracts, and (3) domain-specific\nspecifications based on resources and resource transfers, which allow\nexpressing a contract's behavior in intuitive and concise ways and exclude\ntypical errors by default. We have implemented our approach in 2vyper, an\nSMT-based automated verification tool for Ethereum smart contracts written in\nthe Vyper language, and demonstrated its effectiveness in succinctly capturing\nand verifying strong correctness guarantees for real-world contracts.",

After a rightful request, an\nindividual's personal data need to be rectified or deleted, which is impossible\nin an immutable blockchain. To solve this issue, we exploit a legal property of\npseudonymized data: They are only regarded personal data if they can be\nassociated with an individual's identity. We make use of this fact by\npresenting P3, a pseudonym provisioning system for secure usage logs including\na protocol for recording new usages. For each new block, a one-time transaction\npseudonym is generated. The pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees\nunlinkability and enables proof of ownership. These properties enable\nGDPR-compliant use of blockchain, as data subjects can exercise their legal\nrights with regards to their personal data.

Despite having the benefits of a completely decentralized\narchitecture which supports transparency and distributed control, existing\nprivate blockchains limit the data, assets, and processes within its closed\nboundary, which restricts secure and verifiable service provisioning to the\nend-consumers. Thus, platforms such as e-commerce with multiple sellers or\ncloud federation with a collection of cloud service providers cannot be\ndecentralized with the existing blockchain platforms. This paper proposes a\ndecentralized gateway architecture interfacing private blockchain with\nend-users by leveraging the unique combination of public and private blockchain\nplatforms through interoperation. Through the use case of decentralized cloud\nfederations, we have demonstrated the viability of the solution. Our testbed\nimplementation with Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, with three service\nproviders, shows that such consortium can operate within an acceptable response\nlatency while scaling up to 64 parallel requests per second for cloud\ninfrastructure provisioning. Further analysis over the Mininet emulation\nplatform indicates that the platform can scale well with minimal impact over\nthe latency as the number of participating service providers increases.",

In IPFS,\ndata is hosted by an open set of nodes and data requests are broadcast to\nconnected peers in addition to being routed via a distributed hash table (DHT).\nIn this paper, we present a passive monitoring methodology that exploits this\ndesign for obtaining data requests from a significant and upscalable portion of\nnodes. Using an implementation of our approach for the IPFS network and data\ncollected over a period of fifteen months, we demonstrate how our methodology\nenables profound insights into, among other things: the size of the IPFS\nnetwork, activity levels and structure, and content popularity distributions.\nWe furthermore present that our methodology can be abused for attacks on users'\nprivacy. For example, we were able to identify and successfully surveil the\nIPFS nodes corresponding to public IPFS/HTTP gateways.We give a detailed\nanalysis of the mechanics and reasons behind implied privacy threats and\ndiscuss possible countermeasures.",

            "summary": "Cryptocurrencies have received a lot of research attention in recent years\nfollowing the release of the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin. With the rise in\ncryptocurrency transactions, the need for smart contracts has also increased.\nSmart contracts, in a nutshell, are digitally executed contracts wherein some\nparties execute a common goal. The main problem with most of the current smart\ncontracts is that there is no privacy for a party's input to the contract from\neither the blockchain or the other parties. Our research builds on the Hawk\nproject that provides transaction privacy along with support for smart\ncontracts. However, Hawk relies on a special trusted party known as a manager,\nwhich must be trusted not to leak each party's input to the smart contract. In\nthis paper, we present a practical private smart contract protocol that\nreplaces the manager with an MPC protocol such that the function to be executed\nby the MPC protocol is relatively lightweight, involving little overhead added\nto the smart contract function, and uses practical sigma protocols and\nhomomorphic commitments to prove to the blockchain that the sum of the incoming\nbalances to the smart contract matches the sum of the outgoing balances.",

            "summary": "Blockchain technology and, in particular, blockchain-based transaction offers\nus information that has never been seen before in the financial world. In\ncontrast to fiat currencies, transactions through virtual currencies like\nBitcoin are completely public. And these transactions of cryptocurrencies are\npermanently recorded on Blockchain and are available at any time. Therefore,\nthis allows us to build transaction networks (TN) to analyze illegal\nphenomenons such as phishing scams in blockchain from a network perspective. In\nthis paper, we propose a Transaction SubGraph Network (TSGN) based\nclassification model to identify phishing accounts in Ethereum. Firstly we\nextract transaction subgraphs for each address and then expand these subgraphs\ninto corresponding TSGNs based on the different mapping mechanisms. We find\nthat TSGNs can provide more potential information to benefit the identification\nof phishing accounts. Moreover, Directed-TSGNs, by introducing direction\nattributes, can retain the transaction flow information that captures the\nsignificant topological pattern of phishing scams. By comparing with the TSGN,\nDirected-TSGN indeed has much lower time complexity, benefiting the graph\nrepresentation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that, combined with\nnetwork representation algorithms, the TSGN model can capture more features to\nenhance the classification algorithm and improve phishing nodes' identification\naccuracy in the Ethereum networks.",

Major\nmessaging applications are moving towards end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to give\ntheir users the privacy they are demanding. However the current security\nmechanisms employed by different service providers are not unfeigned E2EE\nimplementations, and are blended with many vulnerabilities. In the present\nscenario, the major part of the E2EE mechanism is controlled by the service\nprovider's servers, and the decryption keys are stored by them in case of\nbackup restoration. These shortcomings diminish the user's confidence in the\nprivacy of their data while using these apps. A public Key infrastructure (PKI)\nmechanism can be used to circumvent some of these issues, but it comes with\nhigh monetary costs, which makes it impossible to roll out for millions of\nusers. The paper proposes a blockchain-based E2EE framework that can mitigate\nthe contemporary vulnerabilities in messaging applications. The user's device\ngenerates the public/private key pair during application installation, and asks\nits mobile network operator (MNO) to issue a digital certificate and store it\non the blockchain.

We further study the comparative\nstatics by varying several design features.

The improvements were significantly more\npronounced for inquiries that had higher product, trade, and temporal\ngranularity; 2) blockchain-enabled solution was robust in the face of increased\ngranularity, while the conventional solution experienced 50% and 66.7% decline\nrespectively in completeness and accuracy of information.

The interaction between our new\ncontributions is also addressed. In doing so, we establish a generalized IoB\nsecurity model by quantum channel networking in terms of both time and space\nquantum entanglements with quantum key distribution (QKD). Our IoB can interact\nwith general structured things (e.g., supply chain systems) having online\ntrading and payment capability via stable digital currency and can handle\nvector-valued data streams requiring synchronized services. Thus, within our\ndesigned QKD, a generalized random number generator for private and public keys\nis proposed by a mixed zero-sum and non-zero-sum resource-competition pricing\npolicy. The effectiveness of this policy is justified by diffusion modeling\nwith approximation theory and numerical implementations.",

The\nscalability and peak performance of Fabric is primarily limited by the\nbottlenecks present in its block validation/commit phase. We propose Blockchain\nMachine, a hardware accelerator coupled with a hardware-friendly communication\nprotocol, to act as the validator peer. It can be adapted to applications and\ntheir smart contracts, and is targeted for a server with network-attached FPGA\nacceleration card. The Blockchain Machine retrieves blocks and their\ntransactions in hardware directly from the network interface, which are then\nvalidated through a configurable and efficient block-level and\ntransaction-level pipeline. The validation results are then transferred to the\nhost CPU where non-bottleneck operations are executed. From our implementation\nintegrated with Fabric v1.4 LTS, we observed up to 12x speedup in block\nvalidation when compared to software-only validator peer, with commit\nthroughput of up to 68,900 tps. Our work provides an acceleration platform that\nwill foster further research on hardware acceleration of permissioned\nblockchains.",

Although decentralization\nis one of the typical characteristics of blockchain, we urgently call for\neffective regulation to detect these illegal behaviors to ensure the safety and\nstability of user transactions. Identity inference, which aims to make a\npreliminary inference about account identity, plays a significant role in\nblockchain security. As a common tool, graph mining technique can effectively\nrepresent the interactive information between accounts and be used for identity\ninference. However, existing methods cannot balance scalability and end-to-end\narchitecture, resulting high computational consumption and weak feature\nrepresentation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to analyze user's\nbehavior from the perspective of the transaction subgraph, which naturally\ntransforms the identity inference task into a graph classification pattern and\neffectively avoids computation in large-scale graph. Furthermore, we propose a\ngeneric end-to-end graph neural network model, named $\\text{I}^2 \\text{BGNN}$,\nwhich can accept subgraph as input and learn a function mapping the transaction\nsubgraph pattern to account identity, achieving de-anonymization.

Lately, each PoS blockchain has\ndesigned a unique reward mechanism, yet, many of them are prone to free-rider\nand nothing-at-stake problems.

We formulate the block validation game wherein\nthe rewards are distributed for validating the blocks correctly.

The breaches could be the interception of raw videos\nwhile in transit to distant surveillance analytics centers (SAC), infiltration\nto cameras and network video records (NVR), or abuse of cameras and stored\nvideos. Hence, the traditional video surveillance system (VSS) cannot guarantee\nthe protection of the privacy of individuals caught on CCTV cameras. Wherefore,\nthis paper proposes a Secure and Privacy-preserving Stored surveillance video\nsharing (SePriS) mechanism for authorized users/nodes based on smart contracts,\nblockchain (BC), and the enciphering of video frames using DAB, a mechanism\ndeveloped based on discrete cosine transform (DCT), advanced encryption\nstandard (AES), and block shuffling (BS) algorithm. The BC-based solution\ncreates an environment auspicious for creating decentralized, reliable SACs and\nstorage sites with secure and privacy-aware sharing of stored surveillance\nvideos across SAC nodes and by law enforcers, police departments, and courts\nsecurely connected to the SAC nodes.

For\nthat purpose, we propose a discrete-time Markov model to capture the expected\ndelay incurred by the BC. Unlike other models in the literature, we consider\nthe effect that timers and forks have on the end-to-end latency.",

            "summary": "Data marketplaces (DMs) promote the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT)\nin smart cities. To facilitate the easy exchanges of real-time IoT data streams\nbetween device owners and third-party applications, it is required to provide\nscalable, interoperable, and secured services for large numbers of distributed\nIoT devices operated by different application vendors. Thanks to\ndecentralization, immutability, and auditability, Blockchain is promising to\nenable a tamper-proof and trust-free framework to enhance performance and\nsecurity issues in centralized DMs. However, directly integrating blockchains\ninto large-scale IoT-based DMs still faces many limitations, such as high\nresource and energy demands, low transaction throughput, poor scalability, and\nchallenges in privacy preservation. This paper introduces a novel Federated\nLedgers-based Framework for Hierarchical Decentralized Data Marketplaces\n(Fed-DDM). In Fed-DDM, participants are divided into multiple permissioned\ndomains given their registrations. Each domain leverages an efficient Byzantine\nFault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol to commit transactions of a domain on\na private intra-ledger. A public inter-ledger network adopts a scalable\nProof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol to federate multiple private\nintra-ledger networks. We design a smart contract-enabled inter-ledger protocol\nto guarantee the security of the cross-domain operations on a public federated\nledger without exposing sensitive privacy information from private ledgers. A\nproof-of-concept prototype is implemented, and the experimental results verify\nthe feasibility of the proposed Fed-DDM solution with performance and security\nguarantees.",

            "summary": "Programming errors in Ethereum smart contracts can result in catastrophic\nfinancial losses from stolen cryptocurrency. While vulnerability detectors can\nprevent vulnerable contracts from being deployed, this does not mean that such\ncontracts will not be deployed. Once a vulnerable contract is instantiated on\nthe blockchain and becomes the target of attacks, the identification of exploit\ntransactions becomes indispensable in assessing whether it has been actually\nexploited and identifying which malicious or subverted accounts were involved.\n  In this work, we study the problem of post-factum investigation of Ethereum\nattacks using Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) specially crafted for use in the\nblockchain. IoC definitions need to capture the side-effects of successful\nexploitation in the context of the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, we define a\nmodel for smart contract execution, comprising multiple abstraction levels that\nmirror the multiple views of code execution on a blockchain. Subsequently, we\ncompare IoCs defined across the different levels in terms of their\neffectiveness and practicality through EtherClue, a prototype tool for\ninvestigating Ethereum security incidents. Our results illustrate that\ncoarse-grained IoCs defined over blocks of transactions can detect exploit\ntransactions with less computation; however, they are contract-specific and\nsuffer from false negatives. On the other hand, fine-grained IoCs defined over\nvirtual machine instructions can avoid these pitfalls at the expense of\nincreased computation which are nevertheless applicable for practical use.",

Besides, DNS domain names are not fully\ncontrolled by the users, which can be easily taken down by the authorities and\nregistrars. Since blockchain has its unique properties like immutability and\ndecentralization, it seems to be promising to build a decentralized name\nservice on blockchain. Ethereum Name Service (ENS), as a novel name service\nbuilt atop Etheruem, has received great attention from the community. Yet, no\nexisting work has systematically studied this emerging system, especially the\nsecurity issues and misbehaviors in ENS. To fill the void, we present the first\nlarge-scale study of ENS by collecting and analyzing millions of event logs\nrelated to ENS. We characterize the ENS system from a number of perspectives.\nOur findings suggest that ENS is showing gradually popularity during its four\nyears' evolution, mainly due to its distributed and open nature that ENS domain\nnames can be set to any kinds of records, even censored and malicious contents.\nWe have identified several security issues and misbehaviors including\ntraditional DNS security issues and new issues introduced by ENS smart\ncontracts. Attackers are abusing the system with thousands of squatting ENS\nnames, a number of scam blockchain addresses and malicious websites, etc. Our\nexploration suggests that our community should invest more effort into the\ndetection and mitigation of issues in Blockchain-based Name Services towards\nbuilding an open and trustworthy name service.",

Diverse malicious network\nattacks are ubiquitous, along with the worldwide implementation of the Internet\nof Vehicles, which exposes a range of reliability and privacy threats for\nmanaging data in CAV networks. Combined with the fact that the capability of\nexisting CAVs in handling intensive computation tasks is limited, this implies\na need for designing an efficient assessment system to guarantee autonomous\ndriving safety without compromising data security. In this article we propose a\nnovel framework, namely Blockchain-enabled intElligent Safe-driving assessmenT\n(BEST), which offers a smart and reliable approach for conducting safe driving\nsupervision while protecting vehicular information. Specifically, a promising\nsolution that exploits a long short-term memory model is introduced to assess\nthe safety level of the moving CAVs. Then we investigate how a distributed\nblockchain obtains adequate trustworthiness and robustness for CAV data by\nadopting a byzantine fault tolerance-based delegated proof-of-stake consensus\nmechanism. Simulation results demonstrate that our presented BEST gains better\ndata credibility with a higher prediction accuracy for vehicular safety\nassessment when compared with existing schemes.

However, during the discovery of cost-efficient routes for the\ntransaction, critical information may be revealed about the transacting\nentities.\n  This paper initiates the study of privacy-preserving route discovery\nmechanisms for payment channel networks. In particular, we present LightPIR, an\napproach which allows a source to efficiently discover a shortest path to its\ndestination without revealing any information about the endpoints of the\ntransaction. The two main observations which allow for an efficient solution in\nLightPIR are that: (1) surprisingly, hub labelling algorithms - which were\ndeveloped to preprocess \"street network like\" graphs so one can later\nefficiently compute shortest paths - also work well for the graphs underlying\npayment channel networks, and that (2) hub labelling algorithms can be directly\ncombined with private information retrieval.\n  LightPIR relies on a simple hub labeling heuristic on top of existing hub\nlabeling algorithms which leverages the specific topological features of\ncryptocurrency networks to further minimize storage and bandwidth overheads. In\na case study considering the Lightning network, we show that our approach is an\norder of magnitude more efficient compared to a privacy-preserving baseline\nbased on using private information retrieval on a database that stores all\npairs shortest paths.",

            "summary": "Blockchain (BC) systems are highly distributed peer-to-peer networks that\noffer an alternative to centralized services and promise robustness to\ncoordinated attacks. However, the resilience and overall security of a BC\nsystem rests heavily on the structural properties of its underlying\npeer-to-peer overlay. Despite their success, BC overlay networks' critical\ndesign aspects, connectivity properties and network-layer inter-dependencies\nare still poorly understood. In this work, we set out to fill this gap and\nstudy the most important overlay network structural properties and robustness\nto targeted attacks of seven distinct BC networks. In particular, we probe and\ncrawl these BC networks every two hours to gather information about all their\navailable peers, over a duration of 28 days. We analyze 335 network snapshots\nper BC network, for a total of 2345 snapshots. We construct, at frequent\nintervals, connectivity graphs for each BC network, consisting of all potential\nconnections between peers. We analyze the structural graph properties of these\nnetworks and compare them across the seven BC networks. We also study how these\nproperties associate with the resilience of each network to partitioning\nattacks, i.e., when peers are selected, attacked and taken offline, using\ndifferent selection strategies driven by the aforementioned structural\nproperties. In fact, we show that by targeting fewer than 10 highly-connected\npeers, major BCs such as Bitcoin can be partitioned into disjoint, i.e.,\ndisconnected, components. Finally, we uncover a hidden interconnection between\ndifferent BC networks, where certain peers participate in more than one BC\nnetwork, which has serious implications for the robustness of the overall BC\nnetwork ecosystem.",

We present a novel approach using a modified dining-cryptographers\nprotocol to distributed shares of an (n,k)-Shamir's secret sharing scheme.\nFinally, all group members broadcast their received share through the network,\nallowing any recipient of k shares to reconstruct the message, enforcing\nanonymity. If less than k group members broadcast their shares, the message\ncannot be decoded thus preventing privacy breaches for the originator. Our\nsystem provides (n-|attackers|)-anonymity for up to k-1 attackers and has\nlittle performance impact on dissemination.

            "summary": "Scaling blockchain efficiency is crucial to its widespread usage in which the\npayment channel is one of the most prominent approaches. With payment channels\nand the network they construct, two users can move some transactions off-chain\nin a predetermined duration to avoid expensive and time-consuming on-chain\nsettlements. Existing work is devoted to designing high-throughput payment\nchannel networks (PCNs) or efficient PCN routing policies to reduce the fee. In\nthis paper, we investigate the PCN routing from a different perspective by\nanswering whether the routing fee of transactions can be saved by being a bit\nmore patient. The key idea is to reorder the processing sequence of atomic\ntransactions, other than to handle each of them separately and immediately. We\npresent two mechanisms, one is periodic transaction processing assisted by a\nPCN broker and the other is purely strategic waiting. In the former, all the\nincoming transactions in a short time interval are processed collectively. We\nformulate an optimization model to minimize their total routing fee and derive\nthe optimal permutation of processing transactions as well as the routing\npolicy for each of them. A Shapley value based scheme is presented to\nredistribute the benefit of reordering among the transactions efficiently and\nfairly. In the latter, we model the waiting time of a strategic transaction on\na single payment channel as the first passage time problem in queueing theory\nwhen the transaction value is higher than the edge capacity upon its arrival.\nBy capturing the capacity dynamics, we are able to calculate the recursive\nexpression of waiting for time distribution that is useful to gauge a user's\ncost of patience. Experimental results manifest that our cost redistribution\nmechanism can effectively save routing fees for all the transactions, and the\nwaiting time distribution coincides with the model well.",

            "summary": "Contact tracing is a very effective way to control the COVID-19-like\npandemics. It aims to identify individuals who closely contacted an infected\nperson during the incubation period of the virus and notify them to quarantine.\nHowever, the existing systems suffer from privacy, security, and efficiency\nissues. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an efficient\nand privacy-preserving Blockchain-based infection control system. Instead of\ndepending on a single authority to run the system, a group of health\nauthorities, that form a consortium Blockchain, run our system. Using\nBlockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of\nfailure and denial of service attacks, but also brings transparency because all\ntransactions can be validated by different parties. Although contact tracing is\nimportant, it is not enough to effectively control an infection. Thus, unlike\nmost of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system\nconsists of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public\nplaces access control, and safe-places recommendation. The access control\nsubsystem prevents infected people from visiting public places to prevent\nspreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones based\non the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones.\nOur analysis demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy\nof the users against identification, social graph disclosure, and tracking\nattacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks. Moreover, our\nextensive performance evaluations demonstrate the scalability of our system\n(which is desirable in pandemics) due to its low communication, computation,\nand storage overheads.",

To reduce\nthe average block generation time, a group of individual miners can form a\nmining pool to aggregate their computing power to solve the puzzle together and\nshare the reward contained in the block. However, if the aggregated computing\npower of the pool forms a substantial portion of the total computing power in\nthe network, the pooled mining undermines the core spirit of blockchain, i.e.,\nthe decentralization, and harms its security. To discourage the pooled mining,\nwe develop a new consensus protocol called Proof-of-Age (PoA) that builds upon\nthe native PoW protocol. The core idea of PoA lies in using Age-of-Work (AoW)\nto measure the effective mining period that the miner has devoted to\nmaintaining the security of blockchain. Unlike in the native PoW protocol, in\nour PoA protocol, miners benefit from its effective mining period even if they\nhave not successfully mined a block. We first employ a continuous time Markov\nchain (CTMC) to model the block generation process of the PoA based blockchain.\nBased on this CTMC model, we then analyze the block generation rates of the\nmining pool and solo miner respectively. Our analytical results verify that\nunder PoA, the block generation rates of miners in the mining pool are reduced\ncompared to that of solo miners, thereby disincentivizing the pooled mining.\nFinally, we simulate the mining process in the PoA blockchain to demonstrate\nthe consistency of the analytical results.",

In\nthis context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide\ncollaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices\nto train a shared AI model without exposing their data, which enjoys\nconsiderable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL\nimplementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing\ndecentralized FL training without the need for any central server.\nParticularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm,\ncalled FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into\ndecentralized, secure, and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an\noverview of the fundamental concepts and explores the opportunities of FLchain\nin MEC networks. We identify several main topics in FLchain design, including\ncommunication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and\nprivacy protection. The key solutions for FLchain design are provided, and the\nlessons learned as well as the outlooks are also discussed.

However, the existing works have limitations that curb the\nwide adoption of the technology, such as the expensive creation and closure of\nchannels, strict synchronization between the main chain and off-chain channels,\nfrozen deposits, and inability to execute multi-party smart contracts. In this\nwork, we present Speedster, an account-based state-channel system that aims to\naddress the above issues. To this end, Speedster leverages the latest\ndevelopment of secure hardware to create dispute-free certified channels that\ncan be operated efficiently off the Blockchain. Speedster is fully\ndecentralized and provides better privacy protection. It supports fast native\nmulti-party contract execution, which is missing in prior TEE-enabled channel\nnetworks. Compared to the Lightning Network, Speedster improves the throughput\nby about 10,000X and generates 97% less on-chain data with a comparable network\nscale.",

            "summary": "Authorization or access control limits the actions a user may perform on a\ncomputer system, based on predetermined access control policies, thus\npreventing access by illegitimate actors. Access control for the Internet of\nThings (IoT) should be tailored to take inherent IoT network scale and device\nresource constraints into consideration. However, common authorization systems\nin IoT employ conventional schemes, which suffer from overheads and\ncentralization. Recent research trends suggest that blockchain has the\npotential to tackle the issues of access control in IoT. However, proposed\nsolutions overlook the importance of building dynamic and flexible access\ncontrol mechanisms. In this paper, we design a decentralized attribute-based\naccess control mechanism with an auxiliary Trust and Reputation System (TRS)\nfor IoT authorization. Our system progressively quantifies the trust and\nreputation scores of each node in the network and incorporates the scores into\nthe access control mechanism to achieve dynamic and flexible access control. We\ndesign our system to run on a public blockchain, but we separate the storage of\nsensitive information, such as user's attributes, to private sidechains for\nprivacy preservation. We implement our solution in a public Rinkeby Ethereum\ntest-network interconnected with a lab-scale testbed. Our evaluations consider\nvarious performance metrics to highlight the applicability of our solution for\nIoT contexts.",

With a\nfull scale ZTA implementation, it is unlikely that adversaries will be able to\nspread through the network starting from a compromised endpoint. However, the\nalready authenticated and authorised session of a compromised endpoint can be\nleveraged to perform limited, though malicious, activities ultimately rendering\nthe endpoints the Achilles heel of ZTA. To effectively detect such attacks,\ndistributed collaborative intrusion detection systems with an attack\nscenario-based approach have been developed. Nonetheless, Advanced Persistent\nThreats (APTs) have demonstrated their ability to bypass this approach with a\nhigh success ratio. As a result, adversaries can pass undetected or potentially\nalter the detection logging mechanisms to achieve a stealthy presence.\nRecently, blockchain technology has demonstrated solid use cases in the cyber\nsecurity domain. In this paper, motivated by the convergence of ZTA and\nblockchain-based intrusion detection and prevention, we examine how ZTA can be\naugmented onto endpoints. Namely, we perform a state-of-the-art review of ZTA\nmodels, real-world architectures with a focus on endpoints, and\nblockchain-based intrusion detection systems. We discuss the potential of\nblockchain's immutability fortifying the detection process and identify open\nchallenges as well as potential solutions and future directions.",

We\ndevelop a framework for determining the value to LPs of supplying liquidity to\na CFMM with fees when the underlying process follows a general diffusion.\nFocusing on a popular class of CFMMs which we call Geometric Mean Market Makers\n(G3Ms), our approach also allows one to select optimal fees for maximizing LP\nvalue.

Transaction requests in these networks may\nbe declined because of unavailability of funds due to temporary uneven\ndistribution of the channel balances. In this paper, we investigate how to\nalleviate unnecessary payment blockage via proper prioritization of the\ntransaction execution order. Specifically, we consider the scheduling problem\nin PCNs: as transactions continuously arrive on both sides of a channel, nodes\nneed to decide which ones to process and when in order to maximize their\nobjective, which in our case is the channel throughput. We introduce a\nstochastic model to capture the dynamics of a payment channel under random\narrivals, and propose that channels can hold incoming transactions in buffers\nup to some deadline in order to enable more elaborate processing decisions. We\ndescribe a policy that maximizes the channel success rate/throughput for\nuniform transaction requests of fixed amounts, both in the presence and absence\nof buffering capabilities, and formally prove its optimality. We also develop a\ndiscrete event simulator of a payment channel, and evaluate different heuristic\nscheduling policies in the more general heterogeneous amounts case, with the\nresults showing superiority of the heuristic extension of our policy in this\ncase as well. Our work opens the way for more formal research on improving PCN\nperformance via joint consideration of routing and scheduling decisions.",

Proceeding with\nan examination of AMM market microstructure, we show how non-linear price\neffect translates into slippage for traders and impermanent losses for\nliquidity providers.

            "summary": "Second-price auctions with deposits are frequently used in blockchain\nenvironments. An auction takes place on-chain: bidders deposit an amount that\nfully covers their bid (but possibly exceeds it) in a smart contract. The\ndeposit is used as insurance against bidders not honoring their bid if they\nwin. The deposit, but not the bid, is publicly observed during the bidding\nphase of the auction.\n  The visibility of deposits can fundamentally change the strategic structure\nof the auction if bidding happens sequentially: Bidding is costly since deposit\nare costly to make. Thus, deposits can be used as a costly signal for a high\nvaluation. This is the source of multiple inefficiencies: To engage in costly\nsignalling, a bidder who bids first and has a high valuation will generally\nover-deposit in equilibrium, i.e.~deposit more than he will bid. If high\nvaluations are likely there can, moreover, be entry deterrence through high\ndeposits: a bidder who bids first can deter subsequent bidders from entering\nthe auction. Pooling can happen in equilibrium, where bidders of different\nvaluations deposit the same amount. The auction fails to allocate the item to\nthe bidder with the highest valuation.",

In most instances, the assets\nbeing traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade\nand their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the\njurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do\nnot formally recognise proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part\nof the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in rampant\nillegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, we\nmotivate the need for regulated blockchain consensus protocols with a case\nstudy of the illegal, cryptocurrency based, Silk Road darknet market. We\npresent a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring\nlegal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain distributed consensus.\nAs per our regulatory framework, we derive conditions under which legal\ntransaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which\nare, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal\ntransactions. Finally, we show that with a small change to the standard\nblockchain consensus execution policy (appropriately introduced through\nregulation), the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network can be\nmaximized.",

            "summary": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the most widely adopted incentive model in current\nblockchain systems, which unfortunately is energy inefficient. Proof-of-Stake\n(PoS) is then proposed to tackle the energy issue. The rich-get-richer concern\nof PoS has been heavily debated in the blockchain community. The debate is\ncentered around the argument that whether rich miners possessing more stakes\nwill obtain higher staking rewards and further increase their potential income\nin the future. In this paper, we define two types of fairness, i.e.,\nexpectational fairness and robust fairness, that are useful for answering this\nquestion. In particular, expectational fairness illustrates that the expected\nincome of a miner is proportional to her initial investment, indicating that\nthe expected return on investment is a constant. To better capture the\nuncertainty of mining outcomes, robust fairness is proposed to characterize\nwhether the return on investment concentrates to a constant with high\nprobability as time evolves. Our analysis shows that the classical PoW\nmechanism can always preserve both types of fairness as long as the mining game\nruns for a sufficiently long time. Furthermore, we observe that current PoS\nblockchains implement various incentive models and discuss three\nrepresentatives, namely ML-PoS, SL-PoS and C-PoS. We find that (i) ML-PoS\n(e.g., Qtum and Blackcoin) preserves expectational fairness but may not achieve\nrobust fairness, (ii) SL-PoS (e.g., NXT) does not protect any type of fairness,\nand (iii) C-PoS (e.g., Ethereum 2.0) outperforms ML-PoS in terms of robust\nfairness while still maintaining expectational fairness. Finally, massive\nexperiments on real blockchain systems and extensive numerical simulations are\nperformed to validate our analysis.",

            "summary": "In recent years, prominent blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum\nhave experienced explosive growth in transaction volume, leading to frequent\nsurges in demand for limited block space and causing transaction fees to\nfluctuate by orders of magnitude. Existing systems sell space using first-price\nauctions; however, users find it difficult to estimate how much they need to\nbid in order to get their transactions accepted onto the chain. If they bid too\nlow, their transactions can have long confirmation times. If they bid too high,\nthey pay larger fees than necessary.\n  In light of these issues, new transaction fee mechanisms have been proposed,\nmost notably EIP-1559, aiming to provide better usability. EIP-1559 is a\nhistory-dependent mechanism that relies on block utilization to adjust a base\nfee. We propose an alternative design -- a {\\em dynamic posted-price mechanism}\n-- which uses not only block utilization but also observable bids from past\nblocks to compute a posted price for subsequent blocks. We show its potential\nto reduce price volatility by providing examples for which the prices of\nEIP-1559 are unstable while the prices of the proposed mechanism are stable.\nMore generally, whenever the demand for the blockchain stabilizes, we ask if\nour mechanism is able to converge to a stable state. Our main result provides\nsufficient conditions in a probabilistic setting for which the proposed\nmechanism is approximately welfare optimal and the prices are stable. Our main\ntechnical contribution towards establishing stability is an iterative algorithm\nthat, given oracle access to a Lipschitz continuous and strictly concave\nfunction $f$, converges to a fixed point of $f$.",

Today, threat actors are highly motivated, persistent, and\nwell-founded and operate in a coordinated manner to commit a diversity of\nattacks using various sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures. Given\nthe risks these threats present, it has become clear that organizations need to\ncollaborate and share cyber threat information (CTI) and use it to improve\ntheir security posture. In this paper, we present TRADE -- TRusted Anonymous\nData Exchange -- a collaborative, distributed, trusted, and anonymized CTI\nsharing platform based on blockchain technology. TRADE uses a blockchain-based\naccess control framework designed to provide essential features and\nrequirements to incentivize and encourage organizations to share threat\nintelligence information. In TRADE, organizations can fully control their data\nby defining sharing policies enforced by smart contracts used to control and\nmanage CTI sharing in the network. TRADE allows organizations to preserve their\nanonymity while keeping organizations fully accountable for their action in the\nnetwork. Finally, TRADE can be easily integrated within existing threat\nintelligence exchange protocols - such as trusted automated exchange of\nintelligence information (TAXII) and OpenDXL, thereby allowing a fast and\nsmooth technology adaptation.",

            "summary": "Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, facilitating the convenience of payment by\nproviding a decentralized online solution, have not been widely adopted so far\ndue to slow confirmation of transactions. Offline delegation offers an\nefficient way to exchange coins. However, in such an approach, the coins that\nhave been delegated confront the risk of being spent twice since the\ndelegator's behaviour cannot be restricted easily on account of the absence of\neffective supervision. Even if a third party can be regarded as a judge between\nthe delegator and delegatee to secure transactions, she still faces the threat\nof being compromised or providing misleading assure. Moreover, the approach\nequipped with a third party contradicts the real intention of decentralized\ncryptocurrency systems. In this paper, we propose \\textit{DelegaCoin}, an\noffline delegatable cryptocurrency system to mitigate such an issue. We exploit\ntrusted execution environments (TEEs) as decentralized \"virtual agents\" to\nprevent malicious delegation. In DelegaCoin, an owner can delegate his coins\nthrough offline-transactions without interacting with the blockchain network. A\nformal model and analysis, prototype implementation, and further evaluation\ndemonstrate that our scheme is provably secure and practically feasible.",

            "summary": "Ethereum smart contracts are automated decentralized applications on the\nblockchain that describe the terms of the agreement between buyers and sellers,\nreducing the need for trusted intermediaries and arbitration. However, the\ndeployment of smart contracts introduces new attack vectors into the\ncryptocurrency systems. In particular, programming flaws in smart contracts can\nbe and have already been exploited to gain enormous financial profits. It is\nthus an emerging yet crucial issue to detect vulnerabilities of different\nclasses in contracts in an efficient manner. Existing machine learning-based\nvulnerability detection methods are limited and only inspect whether the smart\ncontract is vulnerable, or train individual classifiers for each specific\nvulnerability, or demonstrate multi-class vulnerability detection without\nextensibility consideration. To overcome the scalability and generalization\nlimitations of existing works, we propose ESCORT, the first Deep Neural Network\n(DNN)-based vulnerability detection framework for Ethereum smart contracts that\nsupport lightweight transfer learning on unseen security vulnerabilities, thus\nis extensible and generalizable. ESCORT leverages a multi-output NN\narchitecture that consists of two parts: (i) A common feature extractor that\nlearns the semantics of the input contract; (ii) Multiple branch structures\nwhere each branch learns a specific vulnerability type based on features\nobtained from the feature extractor. Experimental results show that ESCORT\nachieves an average F1-score of 95% on six vulnerability types and the\ndetection time is 0.02 seconds per contract. When extended to new vulnerability\ntypes, ESCORT yields an average F1-score of 93%. To the best of our knowledge,\nESCORT is the first framework that enables transfer learning on new\nvulnerability types with minimal modification of the DNN model architecture and\nre-training overhead.",

The integration of innovative technologies like\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and\nBlockchain with Healthcare services has led to improved performance and\nefficiency through data-based learning and interconnection of systems. On the\nother hand, it has also increased complexities and has brought its own share of\nvulnerabilities due to the heavy influx, sharing, and storage of healthcare\ndata. The protection of the same from cyber-attacks along with privacy\npreservation through authenticated access is one of the significant challenges\nfor the healthcare sector. For this purpose, the use of blockchain-based\nnetworks can lead to a considerable reduction in the vulnerabilities of the\nhealthcare systems and secure their data. This chapter explores blockchain's\nrole in strengthening healthcare data security by answering the questions\nrelated to what data use, when we need, why we need, who needs, and how\nstate-of-the-art techniques use blockchains to secure healthcare data. As a\ncase study, we also explore and analyze the state-of-the-art implementations\nfor blockchain in healthcare data security for the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "summary": "In cryptocurrencies, the block reward is meant to serve as the incentive\nmechanism for miners to commit resources to create blocks and in effect secure\nthe system. Existing systems primarily divide the reward in proportion to\nexpended resources and follow one of two static models for total block reward:\n(i) a fixed reward for each block (e.g., Ethereum), or (ii) one where the block\nreward halves every set number of blocks (e.g., the Bitcoin model of halving\nroughly every 4 years) but otherwise remains fixed between halvings. In recent\nwork, a game-theoretic analysis of the static model under asymmetric miner\ncosts showed that an equilibrium always exists and is unique. Their analysis\nalso reveals how asymmetric costs can lead to large-scale centralization in\nblockchain mining, a phenomenon that has been observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum\nand highlighted by other studies. In this work we introduce a novel family of\nmining reward functions, HaPPY-Mine (HAsh-Pegged Proportional Yield), which peg\nthe value of the reward to the hashrate of the system, decreasing the reward as\nthe hashrate increases. HaPPY-Mine distributes rewards in proportion to\nexpended hashrate and inherits the safety properties of the generalized\nproportional reward function. We study HaPPY-Mine under a heterogeneous miner\ncost model and show that an equilibrium always exists with a unique set of\nminer participants and a unique total hashrate. Significantly, we prove that a\nHaPPY-Mine equilibrium is more decentralized than the static model equilibrium\nunder a set of metrics including number of mining participants and hashrate\ndistribution. Finally, we show that any HaPPY-Mine equilibrium is also safe\nagainst collusion and sybil attacks, and explore how the market value of the\ncurrency affects the equilibrium.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, such algorithms offer\nlimited throughput and degrade quickly in the presence of faults. In this paper\nwe propose \\thesystem, the first BFT communication abstraction that organizes\nparticipants in a tree to perform scalable vote aggregation and that, in faulty\nruns, is able to terminate the protocol within an optimal number of\nreconfigurations ($f+1$).

            "summary": "In recent years, the interest growth in the Blockchains (BC) and\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) integration -- termed as BIoT -- for more trust via\ndecentralization has led to great potentials in various use cases such as\nhealth care, supply chain tracking, and smart cities. A key element of BIoT\necosystems is the data transactions (TX) that include the data collected by IoT\ndevices. BIoT applications face many challenges to comply with the European\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) i.e., enabling users to hold on to\ntheir rights for deleting or modifying their data stored on publicly accessible\nand immutable BCs. In this regard, this paper identifies the requirements of\nBCs for being GDPR compliant in BIoT use cases. Accordingly, an on-chain\nsolution is proposed that allows fine-grained modification (update and erasure)\noperations on TXs' data fields within a BC. The proposed solution is based on a\ncryptographic primitive called Chameleon Hashing. The novelty of this approach\nis manifold. BC users have the authority to update their data, which are\naddressed at the TX level with no side-effects on the block or chain. By\nperforming and storing the data updates, all on-chain, traceability and\nverifiability of the BC are preserved. Moreover, the compatibility with TX\naggregation mechanisms that allow the compression of the BC size is maintained.",

Many edge cloud-based system designs have been\nproposed, but some technical challenges still remain, such as low quality of\nservices (QoS), data privacy and system security due to centralized healthcare\narchitectures. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach of data\noffloading and data sharing for healthcare using edge cloud and blockchain.\nFirst, an efficient data offloading scheme is proposed where IoT health data\ncan be offloaded to nearby edge servers for data processing with privacy\nawareness. Then, a data sharing scheme is integrated to enable data exchange\namong healthcare users via blockchain. Particularly, a trustworthy access\ncontrol mechanism is developed using smart contracts for access authentication\nto achieve secure EHRs sharing. Implementation results from extensive\nreal-world experiments show the superior advantages of the proposal over the\nexisting schemes in terms of improved QoS, enhanced data privacy and security,\nand low smart contract costs.",

As blockchain-based software enters production\nsystems, it is paramount to follow proper engineering practices, ensure the\nrequired level of testing, and assess the readiness of the developed system.\nThe existing research aims at addressing the testing-related issues and\nchallenges of engineering blockchain-based software by providing suitable\ntechniques and tools. However, like any emerging discipline, the best practices\nand tools for testing blockchain-based systems are not yet sufficiently\ndeveloped. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the testing of\nBlockchain-based Applications (BC-Apps). First, we provide a discussion on\nidentified challenges that are associated with BCApp testing. Second, we use a\nlayered approach to discuss the state-of-the-art testing efforts in the area of\nBC technologies. In particular, we present an overview of the existing testing\ntools and techniques that provide testing solutions either for different\ncomponents at various layers of the BC-App stack or across the whole stack.\nThird, we provide a set of future research directions based on the identified\nBC testing challenges and gaps in the literature review of existing testing\nsolutions for BC-Apps. Moreover, we reflect on the specificity of BC-based\nsoftware development procedure, which makes some of the existing tools or\ntechniques inadequate, and call for the definition of standardised testing\nprocedures and techniques for BC-Apps. The aim of our study is to highlight the\nimportance of BC-based software testing and to pave the way for disciplined,\ntestable, and verifiable BC software development.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) is probably the most transparent payment network in the world,\nthanks to the full history of transactions available to the public. Though,\nBitcoin is not a fully anonymous environment, rather a pseudonymous one,\naccounting for a number of attempts to beat its pseudonimity using clustering\ntechniques. There is, however, a recurring assumption in all the cited\ndeanonymization techniques: that each transaction output has an address\nattached to it. That assumption is false. An evidence is that, as of block\nheight 591,872, there are several millions transactions with at least one\noutput for which the Bitcoin Core client cannot infer an address. In this\npaper, we present a novel approach based on sound graph theory for identifying\ntransaction inputs and outputs. Our solution implements two simple yet\ninnovative features: it does not rely on BTC addresses and explores all the\ntransactions stored in the blockchain. All the other existing solutions fail\nwith respect to one or both of the cited features. In detail, we first\nintroduce the concept of Unknown Transaction and provide a new framework to\nparse the Bitcoin blockchain by taking them into account. Then, we introduce a\ntheoretical model to detect, study, and classify -- for the first time in the\nliterature -- unknown transaction patterns in the user network. Further, in an\nextensive experimental campaign, we apply our model to the Bitcoin network to\nuncover hidden transaction patterns within the Bitcoin user network. Results\nare striking: we discovered more than 30,000 unknown transaction DAGs, with a\nfew of them exhibiting a complex yet ordered topology and potentially connected\nto automated payment services. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed\nframework is the only one that enables a complete study of the unknown\ntransaction patterns, hence enabling further research in the fields -- for\nwhich we provide some directions.",

            "summary": "An urgent demand of deploying BFT consensus over the Internet is raised for\nimplementing blockchain services. The deterministic (partial) synchronous\nprotocols can be simple and fast in good network conditions, but are subject to\ndenial-of-service when synchrony assumption fails. Asynchronous protocols, on\nthe contrary, are robust against the adversarial network, but are substantially\nmore complicated and slower for the inherent use of randomness.\n  Facing the issues, optimistic asynchronous atomic broadcast ( Kursawe-Shoup,\n2002; Ramasamy-Cachin, 2005) was proposed to improve the normal-case\nperformance of the slow asynchronous consensus. They run a deterministic\nfastlane if the network condition remains good, and can fall back to a fully\nasynchronous protocol via a pace-synchronization mechanism if the fastlane\nfails. Unfortunately, existing pace-synchronization directly uses a heavy tool\nof asynchronous multi-valued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA).\n  We present Bolt-Dumbo Transformer (BDT), a generic framework for practical\noptimistic asynchronous atomic broadcast. At the core of BDT, we set forth a\nnew fastlane abstraction that is simple and fast, while preparing honest\nparties to gracefully face potential fastlane failures caused by malicious\nleader or bad network. This enables a highly efficient pace-synchronization to\nhandle fallback. The resulting design reduces a cumbersome MVBA to a variant of\nthe conceptually simplest binary agreement only. Besides detailed security\nanalyses, we also give concrete instantiations of our framework and implement\nthem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BDT can enjoy both the low latency\nof deterministic protocols (e.g. 2-chain version of HotStuff) and the\nrobustness of state-of-the-art asynchronous protocols in practice.",

            "summary": "Motivated by the immutable nature of Ethereum smart contracts and of their\ntransactions, quite many approaches have been proposed to detect defects and\nsecurity problems before smart contracts become persistent in the blockchain\nand they are granted control on substantial financial value.\n  Because smart contracts source code might not be available, static analysis\napproaches mostly face the challenge of analysing compiled Ethereum bytecode,\nthat is available directly from the official blockchain. However, due to the\nintrinsic complexity of Ethereum bytecode (especially in jump resolution),\nstatic analysis encounters significant obstacles that reduce the accuracy of\nexiting automated tools.\n  This paper presents a novel static analysis algorithm based on the symbolic\nexecution of the Ethereum operand stack that allows us to resolve jumps in\nEthereum bytecode and to construct an accurate control-flow graph (CFG) of the\ncompiled smart contracts. EtherSolve is a prototype implementation of our\napproach. Experimental results on a significant set of real world Ethereum\nsmart contracts show that EtherSolve improves the accuracy of the execrated\nCFGs with respect to the state of the art available approaches.\n  Many static analysis techniques are based on the CFG representation of the\ncode and would therefore benefit from the accurate extraction of the CFG. For\nexample, we implemented a simple extension of EtherSolve that allows to detect\ninstances of the re-entrancy vulnerability.",

Through DLO, the Atomic Appends problem, intended as the need of a\nprimitive able to append multiple records to distinct ledgers in an atomic way,\nis studied as a basic interconnection problem among ledgers.\n  In this work, we propose the Distributed Grow-only Set object (DSO), which\ninstead of maintaining a sequence of records, as in a DLO, maintains a set of\nrecords in an immutable way: only Add and Get operations are provided. This\nobject is inspired by the Grow-only Set (G-Set) data type which is part of the\nConflict-free Replicated Data Types. We formally specify the object and we\nprovide a consensus-free Byzantine-tolerant implementation that guarantees\neventual consistency. We then use our Byzantine-tolerant DSO (BDSO)\nimplementation to provide consensus-free algorithmic solutions to the Atomic\nAppends and Atomic Adds (the analogous problem of atomic appends applied on\nG-Sets) problems, as well as to construct consensus-free Single-Writer BDLOs.\nWe believe that the BDSO has applications beyond the above-mentioned problems.",

In this paper, an empirical study on existing altcoins is\ncarried out to offer a thorough understanding of various aspects associated\nwith altcoin innovations. Firstly, we construct the dataset of altcoins,\nincluding source code repositories, GitHub fork relations, and market\ncapitalizations (cap). Then, we analyze the altcoin innovations from the\nperspective of source code similarities. The results demonstrate that more than\n85% of altcoin repositories present high code similarities. Next, a temporal\nclustering algorithm is proposed to mine the inheritance relationship among\nvarious altcoins. The family pedigrees of altcoin are constructed, in which the\naltcoin presents similar evolution features as biology, such as power-law in\nfamily size, variety in family evolution, etc. Finally, we investigate the\ncorrelation between code innovations and market capitalization. Although we\nfail to predict the price of altcoins based on their code similarities, the\nresults show that altcoins with higher innovations reflect better market\nprospects.",

Coordination Vulnerabilities Disclosure (CVD) is one\nof the most popular vulnerabilities sharing solutions, in which some security\nworkers (SWs) can develop undisclosed vulnerabilities patches together.\nHowever, CVD assumes that sharing participants (SWs) are all honest, and thus\noffering chances for dishonest SWs to leak undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities. To\ncombat such threats, we propose an Undisclosed IIoT Vulnerabilities Trusted\nSharing Protection (UIV-TSP) scheme with dynamic token. In this article, a\ndynamic token is an implicit access credential for an SW to acquire an\nundisclosed vulnerability information, which is only held by the system and\nconstantly updated as the SW access. Meanwhile, the latest updated token can be\nstealthily sneaked into the acquired information as the traceability token.\nOnce the undisclosed vulnerability information leaves the SW host, the embedded\nself-destruct program will be automatically triggered to prevent leaks since\nthe destination MAC address in the traceability token has changed. To quickly\ndistinguish dishonest SWs, trust mechanism is adopted to evaluate the trust\nvalue of SWs. Moreover, we design a blockchain-assisted continuous logs storage\nmethod to achieve the tamper-proofing of dynamic token and the transparency of\nundisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities sharing. The simulation results indicate that\nour proposed scheme is resilient to suppress dishonest SWs and protect the IoT\nundisclosed vulnerabilities effectively.",

These economies\ncan be modelled as multi-product Cournot competitions or all-pay auctions\n(Tullock contests) when individual firms have market power, or as Fisher\nmarkets with quasi-linear utilities when every firm has negligible influence on\nmarket outcomes. In the former case, we provide a formal proof that Gradient\nAscent (GA) can be Li-Yorke chaotic for a step size as small as $\\Theta(1/n)$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of firms. In stark contrast, for the Fisher market\ncase, we derive a Proportional Response (PR) protocol that converges to market\nequilibrium. The positive results on the convergence of the PR dynamics are\nobtained in full generality, in the sense that they hold for Fisher markets\nwith \\emph{any} quasi-linear utility functions. Conversely, the chaos results\nfor the GA dynamics are established even in the simplest possible setting of\ntwo firms and one good, and they hold for a wide range of price functions with\ndifferent demand elasticities. Our findings suggest that by considering\nmulti-agent interactions from a market rather than a game-theoretic\nperspective, we can formally derive natural learning protocols which are stable\nand converge to effective outcomes rather than being chaotic.",

            "summary": "Several attacks have been proposed against Proof-of-Work blockchains, which\nmay increase the attacker's share of mining rewards (e.g., selfish mining,\nblock withholding). A further impact of such attacks, which has not been\nconsidered in prior work, is that decreasing the profitability of mining for\nhonest nodes incentivizes them to stop mining or to leave the attacked chain\nfor a more profitable one. The departure of honest nodes exacerbates the attack\nand may further decrease profitability and incentivize more honest nodes to\nleave. In this paper, we first present an empirical analysis showing that there\nis a statistically significant correlation between the profitability of mining\nand the total hash rate, confirming that miners indeed respond to changing\nprofitability. Second, we present a theoretical analysis showing that selfish\nmining under such elastic hash supply leads either to the collapse of a chain,\ni.e., all honest nodes leaving, or to a stable equilibrium depending on the\nattacker's initial share.",

However, it has been assumed by the design that the OS\ndevelopers, smartphone vendors, or governments will not violate people's\nprivacy. We propose a privacy-preserving exposure notification under situations\nwhere none of the middle entities can be trusted. We believe that it can be\nachieved with small changes to the existing mechanism: random numbers are\ngenerated on the application side instead of the OS, and the positive test\nresults are reported to a public ledger (e.g. blockchain) rather than to a\ngovernment server, with endorsements from the medical institutes with blind\nsignatures. We also discuss how to incentivize the peer-to-peer maintenance of\nthe public ledger if it should be newly built. We show that the level of\nverifiability is much higher with our proposed design if a consumer group were\nto verify the privacy protections of the deployed systems.

            "summary": "Code comment has been an important part of computer programs, greatly\nfacilitating the understanding and maintenance of source code. However,\nhigh-quality code comments are often unavailable in smart contracts, the\nincreasingly popular programs that run on the blockchain. In this paper, we\npropose a Multi-Modal Transformer-based (MMTrans) code summarization approach\nfor smart contracts. Specifically, the MMTrans learns the representation of\nsource code from the two heterogeneous modalities of the Abstract Syntax Tree\n(AST), i.e., Structure-based Traversal (SBT) sequences and graphs. The SBT\nsequence provides the global semantic information of AST, while the graph\nconvolution focuses on the local details. The MMTrans uses two encoders to\nextract both global and local semantic information from the two modalities\nrespectively, and then uses a joint decoder to generate code comments. Both the\nencoders and the decoder employ the multi-head attention structure of the\nTransformer to enhance the ability to capture the long-range dependencies\nbetween code tokens. We build a dataset with over 300K <method, comment> pairs\nof smart contracts, and evaluate the MMTrans on it. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the MMTrans outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in\nterms of four evaluation metrics by a substantial margin, and can generate\nhigher quality comments.",

The coordination of DERs\nthrough an aggregator, such as a utility, system operator, or a third-party\ncoordinator, emerges as a promising paradigm. However, it is not well\nunderstood how to enable trust between the aggregator and DERs to integrate\nDERs efficiently. In this paper, we develop a trustable and distributed\ncoordination system for DERs using blockchain technology. We model various DERs\nand formulate a cost minimization problem for DERs to optimize their energy\ntrading, scheduling, and demand response. We use the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem in a distributed fashion. To\nimplement the distributed algorithm in a trustable way, we design a smart\ncontract to update multipliers and communicate with DERs in a blockchain\nnetwork. We validate our design by experiments using real-world data, and the\nsimulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

            "summary": "The infection rate of COVID-19 and lack of an approved vaccine has forced\ngovernments and health authorities to adopt lockdowns, increased testing, and\ncontact tracing to reduce the spread of the virus. Digital contact tracing has\nbecome a supplement to the traditional manual contact tracing process. However,\nalthough there have been a number of digital contact tracing apps proposed and\ndeployed, these have not been widely adopted owing to apprehensions surrounding\nprivacy and security. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based\nprivacy-preserving contact tracing protocol, \"Did I Meet You\" (DIMY), that\nprovides full-lifecycle data privacy protection on the devices themselves as\nwell as on the back-end servers, to address most of the privacy concerns\nassociated with existing protocols. We have employed Bloom filters to provide\nefficient privacy-preserving storage, and have used the Diffie-Hellman key\nexchange for secret sharing among the participants. We show that DIMY provides\nresilience against many well known attacks while introducing negligible\noverheads. DIMY's footprint on the storage space of clients' devices and\nback-end servers is also significantly lower than other similar state of the\nart apps.",

            "summary": "Miners in a blockchain system are suffering from ever-increasing storage\ncosts, which in general have not been properly compensated by the users'\ntransaction fees. This reduces the incentives for the miners' participation and\nmay jeopardize the blockchain security. We propose to mitigate this blockchain\ninsufficient fee issue through a Fee and Waiting Tax (FWT) mechanism, which\nexplicitly considers the two types of negative externalities in the system.\nSpecifically, we model the interactions between the protocol designer, users,\nand miners as a three-stage Stackelberg game. By characterizing the equilibrium\nof the game, we find that miners neglecting the negative externality in\ntransaction selection cause they are willing to accept insufficient-fee\ntransactions. This leads to the insufficient storage fee issue in the existing\nprotocol. Moreover, our proposed optimal FWT mechanism can motivate users to\npay sufficient transaction fees to cover the storage costs and achieve the\nunconstrained social optimum. Numerical results show that the optimal FWT\nmechanism guarantees sufficient transaction fees and achieves an average social\nwelfare improvement of 33.73\\% or more over the existing protocol. Furthermore,\nthe optimal FWT mechanism achieves the maximum fairness index and performs well\neven under heterogeneous-storage-cost miners.",
