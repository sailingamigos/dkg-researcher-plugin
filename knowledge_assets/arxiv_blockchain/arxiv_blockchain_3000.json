            "summary": "Blockchain has come a long way: a system that was initially proposed\nspecifically for cryptocurrencies is now being adapted and adopted as a\ngeneral-purpose transactional system. As blockchain evolves into another data\nmanagement system, the natural question is how it compares against distributed\ndatabase systems. Existing works on this comparison focus on high-level\nproperties, such as security and throughput. They stop short of showing how the\nunderlying design choices contribute to the overall differences. Our work fills\nthis important gap and provides a principled framework for analyzing the\nemerging trend of blockchain-database fusion.\n  We perform a twin study of blockchains and distributed database systems as\ntwo types of transactional systems. We propose a taxonomy that illustrates the\ndichotomy across four dimensions, namely replication, concurrency, storage, and\nsharding. Within each dimension, we discuss how the design choices are driven\nby two goals: security for blockchains, and performance for distributed\ndatabases. To expose the impact of different design choices on the overall\nperformance, we conduct an in-depth performance analysis of two blockchains,\nnamely Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric, and two distributed databases, namely\nTiDB, and etcd. Lastly, we propose a framework for back-of-the-envelope\nperformance forecast of blockchain-database hybrids.",

With the help of only one connected honest node in the system, our\nmethod also allows any node to verify any tampering of the coded Merkle tree by\njust downloading $\\Theta(\\log b)$ bytes.

Despite many\npromising results, we observe a worrying trend that the blockchain landscape is\nfragmented in which many systems exist in silos. Apart from a handful of\ngeneral-purpose blockchains, such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric, there are\nhundreds of others designed for specific applications and typically do not talk\nto each other. In this paper, we describe our vision of interoperable\nblockchains. We argue that supporting interaction among different blockchains\nrequires overcoming challenges that go beyond data standardization. The\nunderlying problem is to allow smart contracts running in different blockchains\nto communicate. We discuss three open problems: access control, general\ncross-chain transactions, and cross-chain communication. We describe partial\nsolutions to some of these problems in the literature. Finally, we propose a\nnovel design to overcome these challenges.",

Despite recent intensive research on using sharding techniques to\nenhance the scalability of blockchain systems, existing solutions do not\nefficiently address cross-shard transactions. In this paper, we introduce\nSharPer, a permissioned blockchain system that improves scalability by\nclustering (partitioning) the nodes and assigning different data shards to\ndifferent clusters where each data shard is replicated on the nodes of a\ncluster. SharPer supports both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions and\nprocesses intra-shard transactions of different clusters as well as cross-shard\ntransactions with non-overlapping clusters simultaneously. In SharPer, the\nblockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph where each cluster\nmaintains only a view of the ledger. SharPer also incorporates a flattened\nprotocol to establish consensus among clusters on the order of cross-shard\ntransactions. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of SharPer in\nterms of performance and scalability especially in workloads with a low\npercentage of cross-shard transactions.",

            "summary": "The fast developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies provide\na promising opportunity to build large-scale systems to connect numerous\nheterogeneous devices into the Internet. Most existing IIoT infrastructures are\nbased on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot\neffectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties.\nBlockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT\ninfrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and\nimmutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to\nsupport immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain\ntechnology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant\nchallenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage\nissue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure,\n\\textit{ChainSplitter}. Specially, the proposed architecture features a\nhierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored\nin the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network\nof the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds\nlocal IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud\ninfrastructure together through two connectors, the \\textit{blockchain\nconnector} and the \\textit{cloud connector}, to construct the hierarchical\nblockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds\nblocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud\nconnector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay\nnetwork and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of\nthe proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT\ncase.",

Current research\ninto autonomous vehicles is accelerating rapidly and will soon become a\ncritical component of a ride-hailing platform's architecture. Implementing an\nautonomous vehicle ride-hailing platform proves a difficult challenge due to\nthe centralized nature of traditional ride-hailing architectures. In a\ntraditional ride-hailing environment the drivers operate their own personal\nvehicles so it follows that a fleet of autonomous vehicles would be required\nfor a centralized ride-hailing platform to succeed. Decentralization of the\nride-hailing platform would remove a road block along the way to an autonomous\nvehicle ride-hailing platform by allowing owners of autonomous vehicles to add\ntheir vehicle to a community driven fleet when not in use. Blockchain\ntechnology is an attractive choice for this decentralized architecture due to\nits immutability and fault tolerance.

Moreover, the peer\nreview process on most all existing publication platforms (including both\nopen-access and publisher platforms) is prone to be ineffective, since there is\nno proper incentive to reviewers for performing high-qualified reviews.\nPubChain is an alternative platform to the existing publication venues aiming\nto address their drawbacks. No central third-party owns the contents (i.e.,\npapers and reviews) of PubChain.

We\nempirically show that the low throughput of such blockchains is due to the I/O\nbottleneck associated with using Merkle trees for processing transactions. We\npresent RAINBLOCK, a new architecture for public blockchains that increases\nthroughput without affecting security. RAINBLOCK achieves this by tackling the\nI/O bottleneck on two fronts: first, decoupling transaction processing from\nI/O, and removing I/O from the critical path; second, reducing I/O\namplification by customizing storage for blockchains. RAINBLOCK uses a novel\nvariant of the Merkle tree, the Distributed Sharded Merkle tree (DSM-TREE) to\nstore system state. We evaluate RAINBLOCK using workloads based on public\nEthereum traces (including smart contracts) and show that RAINBLOCK processes\n20K transactions per second in a geo-distributed setting with four regions\nspread across three continents.",

Scaling the performance of Bitcoin has a been a major recent direction\nof research. One successful direction of work has involved replacing proof of\nwork (PoW) by proof of stake (PoS). Proposals to scale the performance in the\nPoW setting itself have focused mostly on parallelizing the mining process,\nscaling throughput; the few proposals to improve latency have either sacrificed\nthroughput or the latency guarantees involve large constants rendering it\npractically useless. Our first contribution is to design a new PoW blockchain\nPrism++ that has provably low latency and high throughput; the design retains\nthe parallel-chain approach espoused in Prism but invents a new confirmation\nrule to infer the permanency of a block by combining information across the\nparallel chains. We show security at the level of Bitcoin with very small\nconfirmation latency (a small constant factor of block interarrival time). A\nkey aspect to scaling the performance is to use a large number of parallel\nchains, which puts significant strain on the system. Our second contribution is\nthe design and evaluation of a practical system to efficiently manage the\nmemory, computation, and I/O imperatives of a large number of parallel chains.\nOur implementation of Prism++ achieves a throughput of over 80,000 transactions\nper second and confirmation latency of tens of seconds on networks of up to 900\nEC2 Virtual Machines.",

However, due to the power-intensive and a low-throughput consensus\nmechanism in existing blockchain, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are still\nchallenges in integrating blockchain technology into resource-constrained IoT\nplatforms. In this paper, Microchain, based on a hybrid Proof-of-Credit\n(PoC)-Voting-based Chain Finality (VCF) consensus protocol, is proposed to\nprovide a secure, scalable and lightweight distributed ledger for IoT systems.\nBy using a bias-resistant randomness protocol and a cryptographic sortition\nalgorithm, a random subset of nodes are selected as a final committee to\nperform the consensus protocol. The hybrid consensus mechanism relies on PoC, a\npure Proof of stake (PoS) protocol, to determine whether or not a participant\nis qualified to propose a block, given a fair initial distribution of the\ncredit assignment. The voting-based chain finality protocol is responsible for\nfinalizing a history of blocks by resolving conflicting checkpoint and\nselecting a unique chain. A proof-of-conception prototype is implemented and\ntested on a physical network environment. The experimental results verify that\nthe Micorchain is able to offer a partially decentralized, scalable and\nlightweight distributed ledger protocol for IoT applications.",

Cloud-centric blockchain implementations for IoT have shown\nsatisfactory performance. However, some features of blockchain are not\nnecessary for IoT. For instance, a competitive consensus. This research\npresents the idea of customizing and encapsulating the features of blockchain\ninto software-defined components to host them on edge devices.

While the majority of the public have a\nfavorable view of surveillance in terms of crime deterrence, individuals do not\naccept the invasive monitoring of their private life. To date, however, there\nis not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video\nsurveillance systems. The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and\ntheir applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this\nchallenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based\nPrivacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It\nenables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of\npeople captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS\ninto a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of\ncarrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and\nvideo access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is\ncarried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without\ncluttering the network.",

            "summary": "To promote the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart communities\nand smart cities, a real-time data marketplace middleware platform, called the\nIntelligent IoT Integrator (I3), has been recently proposed. While facilitating\nthe easy exchanges of real-time IoT data streams between device owners and\nthird-party applications through the marketplace, I3 is presently a monolithic,\ncentralized platform for a single community. Although the service oriented\narchitecture (SOA) has been widely adopted in the IoT and cyber-physical\nsystems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture to provide\nscalable, inter-operable and extensible services for large numbers of\ndistributed IoT devices and different application vendors. Traditional security\nsolutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance\nbottleneck or susceptible to a single point of failure. Inspired by\ncontainerized microservices and blockchain technology, this paper proposed a\nBLockchain-ENabled Secure Microservices for Decentralized Data Marketplaces\n(BlendSM-DDM). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based\nsecurity mechanism is introduced to secure data exchange and payment among\nparticipants in the marketplace. BlendSM-DDM is able to offer a decentralized,\nscalable and auditable data exchanges for the data marketplace.",

So far, most existing solutions focus on an\nhonest-but-curious server, while security designs against a malicious server\nhave not drawn enough attention. A few recent works have attempted to construct\nverifiable SSE that enables the data owner to verify the integrity of search\nresults. Nevertheless, these verification mechanisms are highly dependent on\nspecific SSE schemes, and fail to support complex queries. A general\nverification mechanism is desired that can be applied to all SSE schemes.\n  In this work, instead of concentrating on a central server, we explore the\npotential of the smart contract, an emerging blockchain-based decentralized\ntechnology, and construct decentralized SSE schemes where the data owner can\nreceive correct search results with assurance without worrying about potential\nwrongdoings of a malicious server. We study both public and private blockchain\nenvironments and propose two designs with a trade-off between security and\nefficiency. To better support practical applications, the multi-user setting of\nSSE is further investigated where the data owner allows authenticated users to\nsearch keywords in shared documents. We implement prototypes of our two designs\nand present experiments and evaluations to demonstrate the practicability of\nour decentralized SSE schemes.",

            "summary": "A blockchain is a database of sequential events that is maintained by a\ndistributed group of nodes. A key consensus problem in blockchains is that of\ndetermining the next block (data element) in the sequence. Many blockchains\naddress this by electing a new node to propose each new block. The new block is\n(typically) appended to the tip of the proposer's local blockchain, and\nsubsequently broadcast to the rest of the network. Without network delay (or\nadversarial behavior), this procedure would give a perfect chain, since each\nproposer would have the same view of the blockchain. A major challenge in\npractice is forking. Due to network delays, a proposer may not yet have the\nmost recent block, and may, therefore, create a side chain that branches from\nthe middle of the main chain. Forking reduces throughput, since only one a\nsingle main chain can survive, and all other blocks are discarded. We propose a\nnew P2P protocol for blockchains called Barracuda, in which each proposer,\nprior to proposing a block, polls $\\ell$ other nodes for their local blocktree\ninformation. Under a stochastic network model, we prove that this lightweight\nprimitive improves throughput as if the entire network were a factor of $\\ell$\nfaster. We provide guidelines on how to implement Barracuda in practice,\nguaranteeing robustness against several real-world factors.",

Unfortunately, Byzantine\nconsensus solutions used in blockchains are at best proved correct \"by hand\" as\nwe are not aware of any of them having been formally verified. In this paper,\nwe propose two contributions: (i) we illustrate the severity of the problem by\nlisting six vulnerabilities of blockchain consensus including two new\ncounter-examples; (ii) we then formally verify two Byzantine fault tolerant\ncomponents of Red Belly Blockchain using the ByMC model checker. First, we\nspecify a simple broadcast primitive in 116 lines of code that is verified in\n40 seconds on a 2-core Intel machine. Then, we specify a blockchain consensus\nalgorithm in 276 lines of code that is verified in 17 minutes on a 64-core AMD\nmachine using MPI.

            "summary": "A key aspect of Federated Learning (FL) is the requirement of a centralized\naggregator to maintain and update the global model. However, in many cases\norchestrating a centralized aggregator might be infeasible due to numerous\noperational constraints. In this paper, we introduce BAFFLE, an aggregator\nfree, blockchain driven, FL environment that is inherently decentralized.\nBAFFLE leverages Smart Contracts (SC) to coordinate the round delineation,\nmodel aggregation and update tasks in FL. BAFFLE boosts computational\nperformance by decomposing the global parameter space into distinct chunks\nfollowed by a score and bid strategy. In order to characterize the performance\nof BAFFLE, we conduct experiments on a private Ethereum network and use the\ncentralized and aggregator driven methods as our benchmark. We show that BAFFLE\nsignificantly reduces the gas costs for FL on the blockchain as compared to a\ndirect adaptation of the aggregator based method. Our results also show that\nBAFFLE achieves high scalability and computational efficiency while delivering\nsimilar accuracy as the benchmark methods.",

KRNC allows the\nfiat money that the public already owns to be upgraded with cryptographic\ninflation protection, eliminating the problems inherent in bootstrapping new\ncurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n  The paper includes two independently significant contributions to the\nliterature. First, it replaces the non-structural axioms invoked in prior work\nwith a new formal method for reasoning about trust, liveness, and safety from\nfirst principles.

            "summary": "Blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, use an approach called \"metering\" to\nassign a cost to smart contract execution, an approach which is designed to\nincentivise miners to operate the network and protect it against DoS attacks.\nIn the past, the imperfections of Ethereum metering allowed several DoS attacks\nwhich were countered through modification of the metering mechanism.\n  This paper presents a new DoS attack on Ethereum which systematically\nexploits its metering mechanism. We first replay and analyse several months of\ntransactions, during which we discover a number of discrepancies in the\nmetering model, such as significant inconsistencies in the pricing of the\ninstructions. We further demonstrate that there is very little correlation\nbetween the execution cost and the utilised resources, such as CPU and memory.\nBased on these observations, we present a new type of DoS attack we call\nResource Exhaustion Attack, which uses these imperfections to generate\nlow-throughput contracts. To do this, we design a genetic algorithm that\ngenerates contracts with a throughput on average 200 times slower than typical\ncontracts. We then show that all major Ethereum client implementations are\nvulnerable and, if running on commodity hardware, would be unable to stay in\nsync with the network when under attack. We argue that such an attack could be\nfinancially attractive not only for Ethereum competitors and speculators, but\nalso for Ethereum miners. Finally, we discuss short-term and potential\nlong-term fixes against such attacks. Our attack has been responsibly disclosed\nto the Ethereum Foundation and awarded a bug bounty reward of 5,000 USD.",

Blockchain, as\nexpected by both research and industry communities, has emerged as a good\nsolution to address these issues. The major issues in IV data sharing are\ntrust, data accuracy and reliability of data sharing in the communication\nchannel. Blockchain technology, previously working for the cryptocurrency, has\nrecently applied to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with\nsimilar topologies of IV data sharing. In this chapter, we present a new\nframework, namely biometric blockchain (BBC), for secure IV data sharing. In\nour new scheme, biometric information is exploited as a cue to record who is\nresponsible in the data sharing activities, while the proposed BBC technology\nserves as the backbone of the IV data-sharing architecture. Hence, the proposed\nBBC technology provides a more reliable trust environment between the vehicles\nwhile personal identities are traceable in the proposed new scheme.",

ContraMaster uses data-flow,\ncontrol-flow, and the dynamic contract state to guide its mutations. It then\nmonitors the executions of target contract programs, and validates the results\nagainst a general-purpose semantic test oracle to discover vulnerabilities.\nBeing a dynamic technique, it guarantees that each discovered vulnerability is\na violation of the test oracle and is able to generate the attack script to\nexploit this vulnerability. In contrast to rule-based approaches, ContraMaster\nhas not shown any false positives, and it easily generalizes to unknown types\nof vulnerabilities (e.g., logic errors). We evaluate ContraMaster on 218\nvulnerable smart contracts. The experimental results confirm its practical\napplicability and advantages over the state-of-the-art techniques, and also\nreveal three new types of attacks.",

This article presents a unique concept of\nblockchain that integrates hardware security primitives called Physical\nUnclonable Functions (PUFs) to solve scalability, latency, and energy\nrequirement challenges and is called PUFchain. Data management and security\n(and privacy) of data, devices, and individuals, are some of the issues in the\nIoE architectures that need to be resolved. Integrating the blockchain into the\nIoE environment can help solve these issues and helps in the aspects of data\nstorage and security. This article introduces a new blockchain architecture\ncalled PUFchain and introduces a new consensus algorithm called \"Proof of\nPUF-Enabled Authentication\" (PoP) for deployment in PUFchain. The proposed PoP\nis the PUF integration into our previously proposed Proof-of-Authentication\n(PoAh) consensus algorithm and can be called \"Hardware-Assisted\nProof-of-Authentication (HA-PoAh)\". However, PUF integration is possible in the\nexisting and new consensus algorithms. PoP utilizes PUFs which are responsible\nfor generating a unique key that cannot be cloned and hence provide the highest\nlevel of security. A PUF uses the nanoelectronic manufacturing variations that\nare introduced during the fabrication of an integrated circuit to generate the\nkeys. Hence, once generated from a PUF module, the keys cannot be cloned or\ngenerated from any other module. PUFchain uses a PUF and Hashing module which\nperforms the necessary cryptographic functions. Hence the mining process is\noffloaded to the hardware module which reduces the processing times. PoP is\napproximately 1,000X faster than the well-established Proof-of-Work (PoW) and\n5X faster than Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh).",

The model is parametric on two probability distribution\nfunctions governing block production and communication delay, which are key to\ncapture the complexity of the mechanism used to synchronize the many\ndistributed local copies of a blockchain. The proposed model is equipped with\nsimulation algorithms for both bounded and unbounded number of distributed\ncopies of the blockchain. They are used to study fast blockchain systems, i.e.,\nblockchains in which the average time of block production can match the average\ntime of message broadcasting used for blockchain synchronization. In\nparticular, the model and the algorithms are useful to understand efficiency\ncriteria associated with fast blockchains for identifying, e.g., when\nincreasing the block production will have negative impact on the stability of\nthe distributed data structure given the network's broadcast delay.",

In our previous proof-of-concept work, we have shown that separating\ncomputation from consensus can provide a significant throughput increase\nwithout compromising security. In our architecture, Consensus Nodes only define\nthe transaction order but do not execute transactions. Instead, computing the\nblock result is delegated to compute-optimized Execution Nodes, and dedicated\nVerification Nodes check the computation result. During normal operation,\nConsensus Nodes do not inspect the computation but oversee that participating\nnodes execute their tasks with due diligence and adjudicate potential result\nchallenges. While the architecture can significantly increase throughput,\nVerification Nodes still have to duplicate the computation fully. In this\npaper, we refine the architecture such that result verification is distributed\nand parallelized across many Verification Nodes. The full architecture\nsignificantly increases throughput and delegates the computation work to the\nspecialized Execution Nodes and the onus of checking it to a variety of less\npowerful Verification Nodes. We provide a full protocol specification of the\nverification process, including challenges to faulty computation results and\nthe resulting adjudication process. Furthermore, we formally prove liveness and\nsafety of the system.",

Attempts to address\nthis challenge include layer-2 solutions, such as Bitcoin's Lightning or\nEthereum's Plasma network, that move work off the main chain. Another prominent\ntechnique is sharding, i.e., breaking the network into many interconnected\nnetworks. However, these scaling approaches significantly increase the\ncomplexity of the programming model by breaking ACID guarantees increasing the\ncost and time for application development.\n  In this paper, we describe a novel approach where we split the work\ntraditionally assigned to cryptocurrency miners into two different node roles.\nSpecifically, the selection and ordering of transactions are performed\nindependently from their execution. The focus of this paper is to formalize the\nsplit of consensus and computation, and prove that this approach increases\nthroughput without compromising security.\n  In contrast to most existing proposals, our approach achieves scaling via\nseparation of concerns, i.e., better utilization of network resources, rather\nthan sharding. This approach allows established programming paradigms for smart\ncontracts (which generally assume transactional atomicity) to persist without\nintroducing additional complexity. We present simulations on a proof-of-concept\nnetwork of 32 globally distributed nodes. While the consensus algorithm was\nidentical in all simulations (a 2-step-commit protocol with rotating block\nproposer), block computation was either included in a consensus nodes' regular\noperations (conventional architecture) or delegated to specialized execution\nnodes (separation of concerns). Separation of concerns enables our system to\nachieve a throughput increase by a factor of 56 compared to conventional\narchitectures without loss of safety or decentralization.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we describe a virtual services marketplace, called Nubo,\ndesigned to connect buyers of virtual services (or tenants) with providers of\nthose services on a cloud computing platform. The marketplace is implemented as\na collection of distributed microservices along with a marketplace portal that\nruns as a Web application. The heart of Nubo is the Saranyu tenant and service\nmanagement microservice. Saranyu is a decentralized application (dApp) built on\ntop of the J.P. Morgan Quorum blockchain. Tenant and service accounts are\nrepresented as static (nonnegotiable) smart contracts written in the Solidity\nlanguage. Quorum provides a tamper evident and tamper resistant distributed\nledger, whereby multiple cloud and service providers can co-operate to provide\nservice resources to tenants in a trustworthy fashion. Services offer resources\nconsisting of a collection of attributes describing what the tenant can\nconsume, and tenants subscribe to service resources through the Nubo\nMarketplace portal. The Service Manager microservice provides multitenant\nsupport for containerized services built for deployment and orchestration using\nDocker that were originally not designed to be managed through Saranyu. We\ndiscuss our design goals for Nubo, describe the overall architecture, discuss\nsome details on how Saranyu uses the blockchain and smart contracts, and\nprovide comprehensive performance and scalability data measured on the Saranyu\nREST API. The results indicate Saranyu is competitive with published results\nfor comparable operations on the Havana release of OpenStack Keystone, but\nSaranyu provides a much richer collection of tenant and service management\nfunctionality than Keystone.",

Various innovative models for data\nsharing and management have privacy and centrality issues. To alleviate these\nlimitations, we have incorporated blockchain in user modeling. In this paper,\nwe constructed a decentralized data sharing architecture with MultiChain\nblockchain in the travel domain, which is also applicable to other similar\ndomains including education, health, and sports. Businesses that operate in the\ntourism industries including travel and tour agencies, hotels and resorts,\nshopping malls are connected to the MultiChain and they share their user\nprofile data via stream in the MultiChain. The paper presents the hotel booking\nservice for an imaginary hotel as one of the enterprise nodes, which collects\nuser profile data with proper validation and will allow users to decide which\nof their data to be shared thus ensuring user control over their data and the\npreservation of privacy. The data from the repository is converted into an open\ndata format while sharing via stream in the blockchain so that other enterprise\nnodes, after receiving the data, can easily convert them and store into their\nown repositories. The paper presents an evaluation of the performance of the\nmodel by measuring the latency and memory consumption with three test scenarios\nthat mostly affect the user experience.

However, one\nparticularly critical threat in the PoS setting is the well-known long-range\nattacks caused by secret key leakage (LRSL attack). Specifically, an adversary\ncan attempt to control/compromise accounts possessing substantial stake at some\npast moment such that double-spend or erase past transactions, violating the\nfundamental persistence property of blockchain. Puncturable signatures provide\na satisfying solution to construct practical proof-of-stake blockchain\nresilient to LRSL attack, despite of the fact that existent constructions are\nnot efficient enough for practical deployments.\n  In this paper, we provide an in-depth study of puncturable signatures and\nexplore its applications in the proof-of-stake blockchain. We formalize a\nsecurity model that allows the adversary for adaptive signing and puncturing\nqueries, and show a construction with efficient puncturing operations based on\nthe Bloom filter data structure and strong Diffie-Hellman assumption. The\npuncturing functionality we desire is for a particular part of message, like\nprefix, instead of the whole message. Furthermore, we use puncturable\nsignatures to construct practical proof-of-stake blockchain protocols that are\nresilient to LRSL attack, while previously the forward-secure signature is used\nto immunize this attack. We implement our scheme and provide experimental\nresults showing that in comparison with the forward-secure signature, our\nconstruction performs substantially better on signature size, signing and\nverification efficiency, significantly on key update efficiency.",

            "summary": "Creating efficient deep neural networks involves repetitive manual\noptimization of the topology and the hyperparameters. This human intervention\nsignificantly inhibits the process. Recent publications propose various Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) algorithms that automate this work. We have applied a\ncustomized NAS algorithm with network morphism and Bayesian optimization to the\nproblem of cryptocurrency predictions, where it achieved results on par with\nour best manually designed models. This is consistent with the findings of\nother teams, while several known experiments suggest that given enough\ncomputing power, NAS algorithms can surpass state-of-the-art neural network\nmodels designed by humans. In this paper, we propose a blockchain network\nprotocol that incentivises independent computing nodes to run NAS algorithms\nand compete in finding better neural network models for a particular task. If\nimplemented, such network can be an autonomous and self-improving source of\nmachine learning models, significantly boosting and democratizing the access to\nAI capabilities for many industries.",

            "summary": "Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) powered by distributed ledger technologies\nenables more flexible and faster digital identification workflows, while at the\nsame time limiting the control and influence of central authorities. However, a\nglobal identity solution must be able to handle myriad credential types from\nmillions of issuing organizations. As metadata about types of digital\ncredentials is readable by everyone on the public permissioned ledger with\nHyperledger Indy, anyone could find relevant and trusted credential types for\ntheir use cases by looking at the records on the blockchain. To this date, no\nefficient full-text search mechanism exists that would allow users to search\nfor credential types in a simple and efficient fashion tightly integrated into\ntheir applications. In this work, we propose a full-text search framework based\non the publicly available metadata on the Hyperledger Indy ledger for\nretrieving matching credential types. The proposed solution is able to find\ncredential types based on textual input from the user by using a full-text\nsearch engine and maintaining a local copy of the ledger. Thus, we do not need\nto rely on information about credentials coming from a very large candidate\npool of third parties we would need to trust, such as the website of a company\ndisplaying its own identifier and a list of issued credentials. We have also\nproven the feasiblity of the concept by implementing and evaluating a prototype\nof the full-text credential metadata search service.",

            "summary": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) are viewed as one of the most promising\nscalability solutions for cryptocurrencies today. Roughly, PCNs are networks\nwhere each node represents a user and each directed, weighted edge represents\nfunds escrowed on a blockchain; these funds can be transacted only between the\nendpoints of the edge. Users efficiently transmit funds from node A to B by\nrelaying them over a path connecting A to B, as long as each edge in the path\ncontains enough balance (escrowed funds) to support the transaction. Whenever a\ntransaction succeeds, the edge weights are updated accordingly. However, in\ndeployed PCNs, channel balances (i.e., edge weights) are not revealed to users\nfor privacy reasons; users know only the initial weights at time 0. Hence, when\nrouting transactions, users first guess a path, then check if it supports the\ntransaction. This guess-and-check process dramatically reduces the success rate\nof transactions. At the other extreme, knowing full channel balances can give\nsubstantial improvements in success rate at the expense of privacy. In this\nwork, we study whether a network can reveal noisy channel balances to trade off\nprivacy for utility. We show fundamental limits on such a tradeoff, and propose\nnoise mechanisms that achieve the fundamental limit for a general class of\ngraph topologies. Our results suggest that in practice, PCNs should operate\neither in the low-privacy or low-utility regime; it is not possible to get\nlarge gains in utility by giving up a little privacy, or large gains in privacy\nby sacrificing a little utility.",

Nevertheless, this ability comes with\nthe cost of storing a large (distributed) ledger, which has become unsuitable\nfor personal devices of any kind. Although the simplified payment verification\n(SPV) clients can address this storage issue, a Bitcoin SPV client has to rely\non other Bitcoin nodes to obtain its transaction history and the current\napproaches offer no privacy guarantees to the SPV clients.\n  This work presents $T^3$, a trusted hardware-secured Bitcoin full client that\nsupports efficient oblivious search/update for Bitcoin SPV clients without\nsacrificing the privacy of the clients. In this design, we leverage the trusted\nexecution and attestation capabilities of a trusted execution environment (TEE)\nand the ability to hide access patterns of oblivious random access memory\n(ORAM) to protect SPV clients' requests from a potentially malicious server.\nThe key novelty of $T^3$ lies in the optimizations introduced to conventional\nORAM, tailored for expected SPV client usages. In particular, by making a\nnatural assumption about the access patterns of SPV clients, we are able to\npropose a two-tree ORAM construction that overcomes the concurrency limitation\nassociated with traditional ORAMs. We have implemented and tested our system\nusing the current Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output database. Our experiment\nshows that the system is feasible to be deployed in practice while providing\nstrong privacy and security guarantees to Bitcoin SPV clients.",

The\nproof is general and relies on well-defined specifications of certain\ncomponents. This lays the ground for simple proofs of correctness for sharded\nprotocols obtained by following the proposed scheme.\n  The framework is not left as an obscure specification of some high level\nstructure; explicit use is demonstrated by applying it to shard Algorand.

            "summary": "In the era of the Internet of information, we have gone through layering,\ncross-layer, and cross-system design paradigms. Recently, the ``curse of\nmodeling\" and ``curse of dimensionality\" of the cross-system design paradigm\nhave resulted in the popularity of using artificial intelligence (AI) to\noptimize the Internet of information. However, many significant research\nchallenges remain to be addressed for the AI approach, including the lack of\nhigh-quality training data due to privacy and resources constraints in this\ndata-driven approach. To address these challenges, we need to take a look at\nhumans' cooperation in a larger time scale. To facilitate cooperation in modern\nhistory, we have built three major technologies: ``grid of transportation\",\n``grid of energy\", and ``the Internet of information\". In this paper, we argue\nthat the next cooperation paradigm could be the ``Internet of intelligence\n(Intelligence-Net)\", where intelligence can be easily obtained like energy and\ninformation, enabled by the recent advances in blockchain technology. We\npresent some recent advances in these areas, and discuss some open issues and\nchallenges that need to be addressed in the future.",

            "summary": "Since it takes time and effort to put a new product or service on the market,\none would like to predict whether it will be a success. In general this is not\npossible, but it is possible to follow best practices in order to maximise the\nchance of success. A smart contract is intended to encode business logic and is\ntherefore at the heart of every new business on the Ethereum blockchain. We\nhave investigated how to measure the success of smart contracts, and whether\nsuccessful smart contracts have characteristics that less successful smart\ncontracts lack. The appearance of a smart contract on a listing website such as\nEtherscan or StateoftheDapps is such a characteristic. In this paper, we\npresent a three-pronged analysis of the relative success of listed smart\ncontracts. First, we have used statistical analysis on the publicly visible\ntransaction history of the Ethereum blockchain to determine that listed\ncontracts are significantly more successful than their unlisted counterparts.\nNext, we have conducted a survey among more than 200 developers via an\nanonymous online survey about their experience with the listing process. A\nsignificant majority of respondents do not believe that listing a contract\nitself contributes to its success, but they believe that the extra attention\nthat is typically paid in tandem with the listing process does contribute.\nFinally, based on the respondents' answers, we have drafted 10 recommendations\nfor developers and validated them by submitting them to an international panel\nof experts.",

Conventional adoption of BC in IoT platform\ncauses high energy consumption, delay and computational overhead which are not\nappropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. This work proposes a\nmachine learning (ML) based smart access control framework in a public and a\nprivate BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient as\ncompared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city\narchitecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security\nand privacy issues. Moreover, BC has very minimal overhead on IoT platform as\nwell. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access\ncontrol issues which handle multiple permissions of various nodes and detects\nrelevant inconsistencies to notify the corresponding nodes.

Although certain approaches\nhave been proposed to address technical difficulties in personal data\nmanagement; most of them only provided preliminary methodological exploration.\nAlarmingly, when utilising Blockchain for developing a personal data management\nsystem, fictions have occurred in existing approaches and been promulgated in\nthe literature. Such fictions are theoretically doable; however, by thoroughly\nbreaking down consensus protocols and transaction validation processes, we\nclarify that such existing approaches are either impractical or highly\ninefficient due to the natural limitations of the blockchain and Smart\nContracts technologies. This encourages us to propose a feasible solution in\nwhich such fictions are reduced by designing a novel system architecture with a\nblockchain-based \"proof of permission\" protocol. We demonstrate the feasibility\nand efficiency of the proposed models by implementing a clinical data sharing\nservice built on top of a public blockchain platform.

Our false friends attack exploits the Kademlia-inspired peer discovery\nlogic used by Geth and enables a low-resource eclipsing of long-running, remote\nvictim nodes. An adversary only needs two hosts in distinct /24 subnets to\nlaunch the eclipse, which can then be leveraged to filter the victim's view of\nthe Blockchain.

            "summary": "The complexity of today's supply chain, organised in several tiers and\nincluding many companies located in different countries, makes it challenging\nto assess the history and integrity of procured physical parts, and to make\norganisations really accountable for their conduct. This enables malicious\npractices like counterfeiting and insertion of back doors, which are extremely\ndangerous, especially in supply chains of physical parts for industrial control\nsystems used in critical infrastructures, where a country and human lives can\nbe put at risk. This paper aims at mitigating these issues by proposing an\napproach where procured parts are uniquely identified and tracked along the\nchain, across multiple sites, to detect tampering. Our solution is based on\nconsortium blockchain and smart contract technologies, hence it is\ndecentralised, highly available and provides strong guarantees on the integrity\nof stored data and executed business logic. The unique identification of parts\nalong the chain is implemented by using physically unclonable functions (PUFs)\nas tamper-resistant IDs. We first define the threat model of an adversary\ninterested in tampering with physical products along the supply chain, then\nprovide the design of the tracking system that implements the proposed\nanti-counterfeiting approach. We present a security analysis of the tracking\nsystem against the designated threat model and a prototype evaluation to show\nits technical feasibility and assess its effectiveness in counterfeit\nmitigation. Finally, we discuss several key practical aspects concerning our\nsolution ad its integration with real supply chains.",

            "summary": "Distributed Leger Technologies (DLTs), most notably Blockchain technologies,\nbring decentralised platforms that eliminate a single trusted third party and\navoid the notorious single point of failure vulnerability. Since Nakamoto's\nBitcoin cryptocurrency system, an enormous number of decentralised applications\nhave been proposed on top of these technologies, aiming at more transparency\nand trustworthiness than their traditional counterparts. These applications\nspread over a lot of areas, e.g. financial services, healthcare,\ntransportation, supply chain management, and cloud computing. While Blockchain\nbrings transparency and decentralised trust intuitively due to the consensus of\na (very large) group of nodes (or, miners), it introduces very subtle\nimplications for other desirable properties such as privacy. In this work, we\ndemonstrate these subtle implications for Blockchain-based searchable\nencryption solutions, which are one specific use case of cloud computing\nservices. These solutions rely on Blockchain to achieve both the standard\nprivacy property and the new fairness property, which requires that search\noperations are carried out faithfully and are rewarded accordingly. We show\nthat directly replacing the server in an existing searchable encryption\nsolution with a Blockchain will cause undesirable operational cost, privacy\nloss, and security vulnerabilities. The analysis results indicate that a\ndedicated server is still needed to achieve the desired privacy guarantee. To\nthis end, we propose two frameworks which can be instantiated based on most\nexisting searchable encryption schemes. Through analysing these two frameworks,\nwe affirmatively show that a carefully engineered Blockchain-based solution can\nachieve the desired fairness property while preserving the privacy guarantee of\nthe original searchable encryption scheme simultaneously.",

Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token\nexchange between blockchains.

In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that\ndelivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains.\nHyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing\nprogramming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications\nin a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing\ncryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains.\nWe implement a prototype of HyperService in about 35,000 lines of code to\ndemonstrate its practicality.

Some of those challenges are currently being addressed by\ncoupling IoT applications with blockchains. However, current blockchain-backed\nIoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby\nunderutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a\nnew framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that\nprovides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the\nblockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control\ndecisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are\ncorrectly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a ``data\nmarketplace'' by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial\ntransaction and providing ``by design'' remuneration to data producers.\nFinally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for\ncryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to\ndistribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source\nIoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs\ntolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.",

However, a major concern in Ethereum is\nthe security of its smart contracts. Many identified bugs and vulnerabilities\nin smart contracts not only present challenges to maintenance of blockchain,\nbut also lead to serious financial loses. There is a significant need to better\nassist developers in checking smart contracts and ensuring their reliability.In\nthis paper, we propose a web service tool, named SmartEmbed, which can help\nSolidity developers to find repetitive contract code and clone-related bugs in\nsmart contracts. Our tool is based on code embeddings and similarity checking\ntechniques. By comparing the similarities among the code embedding vectors for\nexisting solidity code in the Ethereum blockchain and known bugs, we are able\nto efficiently identify code clones and clone-related bugs for any solidity\ncode given by users, which can help to improve the users' confidence in the\nreliability of their code. In addition to the uses by individual developers,\nSmartEmbed can also be applied to studies of smart contracts in a large scale.\nWhen applied to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum\nblockchain, we found that the clone ratio of solidity code is close to 90\\%,\nmuch higher than traditional software, and 194 clone-related bugs can be\nidentified efficiently and accurately based on our small bug database with a\nprecision of 96\\%.

Ethereum is a prominent blockchain\nplatform with the support of smart contracts. The smart contracts act as\nautonomous agents in critical decentralized applications and hold a significant\namount of cryptocurrency to perform trusted transactions and agreements.\nMillions of dollars as part of the assets held by the smart contracts were\nstolen or frozen through the notorious attacks just between 2016 and 2018, such\nas the DAO attack, Parity Multi-Sig Wallet attack, and the integer\nunderflow/overflow attacks. These attacks were caused by a combination of\ntechnical flaws in designing and implementing software codes. However, many\nmore vulnerabilities of less severity are to be discovered because of the\nscripting natures of the Solidity language and the non-updateable feature of\nblockchains. Hence, we surveyed 16 security vulnerabilities in smart contract\nprograms, and some vulnerabilities do not have a proper solution. This survey\naims to identify the key vulnerabilities in smart contracts on Ethereum in the\nperspectives of their internal mechanisms and software security\nvulnerabilities. By correlating 16 Ethereum vulnerabilities and 19 software\nsecurity issues, we predict that many attacks are yet to be exploited. And we\nhave explored many software tools to detect the security vulnerabilities of\nsmart contracts in terms of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and formal\nverification. This survey presents the security problems in smart contracts\ntogether with the available analysis tools and the detection methods. We also\ninvestigated the limitations of the tools or analysis methods with respect to\nthe identified security vulnerabilities of the smart contracts.",

            "summary": "Applications of blockchain technologies got a lot of attention in recent\nyears. They exceed beyond exchanging value and being a substitute for fiat\nmoney and traditional banking system. Nevertheless, being able to exchange\nvalue on a blockchain is at the core of the entire system and has to be\nreliable. Blockchains have built-in mechanisms that guarantee whole system's\nconsistency and reliability. However, malicious actors can still try to steal\nmoney by applying well known techniques like malware software or fake emails.\nIn this paper we apply supervised learning techniques to detect fraudulent\naccounts on Ethereum blockchain. We compare capabilities of Random Forests,\nSupport Vector Machines and XGBoost classifiers to identify such accounts\nbasing on a dataset of more than 300 thousands accounts. Results show that we\nare able to achieve recall and precision values allowing for the designed\nsystem to be applicable as an anti-fraud rule for digital wallets or currency\nexchanges. We also present sensitivity analysis to show how presented models\ndepend on particular feature and how lack of some of them will affect the\noverall system performance.",

            "summary": "The emerging parallel chain protocols represent a breakthrough to address the\nscalability of blockchain. By composing multiple parallel chain instances, the\nwhole systems' throughput can approach the network capacity. How to coordinate\ndifferent chains' blocks and to construct them into a global ordering is\ncritical to the performance of parallel chain protocol. However, the existed\nsolutions use either the global synchronization clock with the single-chain\nbottleneck or pre-defined ordering sequences with distortion of blocks'\ncausality to order blocks. In addition, the prior ordering methods rely on that\nhonest participants faithfully follow the ordering protocol, but remain silent\nfor any denial of ordering (DoR) attack.\n  On the other hand, the conflicting transactions included into the global\nblock sequence will make Simple Payment Verification (SPV) difficult. Clients\nusually need to store a full record of transactions to distinguish the\nconflictions and tell whether transactions are confirmed. However, the\nrequirement for a full record will greatly hinder blockchains' application,\nespecially for mobile scenarios.\n  In this technical report, we propose Eunomia, which leverages logical clock\nand fine-grained UTXO sharding to realize a simple, efficient, secure and\npermissionless parallel chain protocol. By observing the characteristics of the\nparallel chain, we find the blocks ordering issue in parallel chain has many\nsimilarities with the event ordering in the distributed system. Eunomia thus\nadopts \"virtual\" logical clock, which is optimized to have the minimum protocol\noverhead and runs in a distributed way. In addition, Eunomia combines the\nmining incentive with block ordering, providing incentive compatibility against\nDoR attack. What's more, the fine-grained UTXO sharding does well solve the\nconflicting transactions in parallel chain and is shown to be SPV-friendly.",

Online mapping is one of the fundamental services\noffered in smart cities which enables the vehicle owners to find shortest or\nfastest direction toward a destination thus reduces travel cost and air\npollution. However, existing online mapping services rely on centralized\nservers, e.g., Google, which collect data from users to offer service. This\nmethod is unlikely to scale with growth in the smart city participants and\nintroduces privacy concerns and data wall where data of the users is managed by\nbig companies. To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce DMap, a\nblockchain-based platform where the users can share data in an anonymous\ndistributed manner with service providers. To the best of our knowledge, DMap\nis the first distributed blockchain-based solution for online mapping. To\nimprove the scalability of the blockchain, we propose to use edge-computing\nalong with blockchain. To protect against malicious vehicles that may inject\nfalse data, we define a reputation system where the collected data of the\nvehicles is verified by monitoring the neighbor data.

            "summary": "Since the transport sector accounts for one of the highest shares of\ngreenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, several existing proposals state the idea to\ncontrol the by the transportation sector caused GHG emissions through an\nEmission Trading Systems (ETS). However, most existing approaches integrate GHG\nemissions through the fuel consumption and car registration, limiting the\ntracing of emissions in more complex modes e.g. shared vehicles, shared rides\nand even public transportation. This paper presents a new design of a\nuser-centric ETS and its implementation as a carbon Blockchain framework for\nSmart Mobility Data-market (cBSMD). The cBSMD allows for the seamless\ntransactions of token-equivalent GHG emissions when realizing a trip, or an\nemission trading action as well as the transaction of individual, service or\nsystem-wide emission performance data. We demonstrate an instance of the cBSMD\nimplementation for the transactions of an ETS where all travellers receive a\ncertain amount of emission credits in the form of tokens, linked to the GHG\nprice and a total emission cap. Travellers use their tokens each time they emit\nGHG when travelling in a multi-modal network, purchase tokens for a given trip\nwhen they have an insufficient token amount or sell when having a surplus of\ntokens due to a lower amount of emitted GHG. This instance of cBSMD is then\napplied to a case-study of 24hours of mobility of 3,186 travellers from\nOakville, Ontario, Canada, where we showcase different cBSMD transactions and\nanalyze token usage and emission performance.",

However, the mining\nprocess in mobile blockchain requires high computational and storage capability\nof mobile devices, which would hinder blockchain applications in mobile\nsystems. To meet this challenge, we propose a mobile edge computing (MEC) based\nblockchain network where multi-mobile users (MUs) act as miners to offload\ntheir mining tasks to a nearby MEC server via wireless channels. Specially, we\nformulate task offloading and user privacy preservation as a joint optimization\nproblem which is modelled as a Markov decision process, where our objective is\nto minimize the long-term system offloading costs and maximize the privacy\nlevels for all blockchain users. We first propose a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based offloading scheme which enables MUs to make optimal offloading\ndecisions based on blockchain transaction states and wireless channel qualities\nbetween MUs and MEC server. To further improve the offloading performances for\nlarger-scale blockchain scenarios, we then develop a deep RL algorithm by using\ndeep Q-network which can efficiently solve large state space without any prior\nknowledge of the system dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed\nRL-based offloading schemes significantly enhance user privacy, and reduce the\nenergy consumption as well as computation latency with minimum offloading costs\nin comparison with the benchmark offloading schemes.",

            "summary": "For current and future Internet of Things (IoT) networks, mobile edge-cloud\ncomputation offloading (MECCO) has been regarded as a promising means to\nsupport delay-sensitive IoT applications. However, offloading mobile tasks to\nthe cloud is vulnerable to security issues due to malicious mobile devices\n(MDs). How to implement offloading to alleviate computation burdens at MDs\nwhile guaranteeing high security in mobile edge cloud is a challenging problem.\nIn this paper, we investigate simultaneously the security and computation\noffloading problems in a multi-user MECCO system with blockchain. First, to\nimprove the offloading security, we propose a trustworthy access control using\nblockchain, which can protect cloud resources against illegal offloading\nbehaviours. Then, to tackle the computation management of authorized MDs, we\nformulate a computation offloading problem by jointly optimizing the offloading\ndecisions, the allocation of computing resource and radio bandwidth, and smart\ncontract usage. This optimization problem aims to minimize the long-term system\ncosts of latency, energy consumption and smart contract fee among all MDs. To\nsolve the proposed offloading problem, we develop an advanced deep\nreinforcement learning algorithm using a double-dueling Q-network. Evaluation\nresults from real experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate the\nsignificant advantages of our scheme over existing approaches.",

Virtually every\ncryptocurrency system has such a protocol at its core, and it is the efficiency\nof this protocol that determines the overall throughput and latency of the\nsystem. We develop our protocol on the grounds of the well-established field of\nAsynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT) systems. This allows us to\nformally reason about correctness, efficiency, and security in the strictest\npossible model, and thus convincingly prove the overall robustness of our\nsolution.\n  Our protocol improves upon the state-of-the-art HoneyBadgerBFT by Miller et\nal. by reducing the asymptotic latency while matching the optimal communication\ncomplexity.

Also, the machine learning process is often difficult to\nautomate. A unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning has\nbeen presented in the literature. It proposed building a trustable machine\nlearning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a\npermanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts on blockchain are\nused to automate the machine learning process. In the proposed framework, a\ncore machine learning algorithm can have three implementations: server layer\nimplementation, streaming layer implementation, and smart contract\nimplementation. However, there are still open questions. First, the streaming\nlayer usually deploys on edge devices and therefore has limited memory and\ncomputing power. How can we run machine learning on the streaming layer?\nSecond, most data that are stored on blockchain are financial transactions, for\nwhich fraud detection is often needed. However, in some applications, training\ndata are hard to obtain. Can we build good machine learning models to do fraud\ndetection with limited training data? These questions motivated this paper;\nwhich makes two contributions. First, it proposes training a machine learning\nmodel on the server layer and saving the model with a special binary data\nformat. Then, the streaming layer can take this blob of binary data as input\nand score incoming data online. The blob of binary data is very compact and can\nbe deployed on edge devices. Second, the paper presents a new method of\nsynthetic data generation that can enrich the training data set.

            "summary": "Consensus is one of the most fundamental distributed computing problems. In\nparticular, it serves as a building block in many replication based\nfault-tolerant systems and in particular in multiple recent blockchain\nsolutions. Depending on its exact variant and other environmental assumptions,\nsolving consensus requires multiple communication rounds. Yet, there are known\noptimistic protocols that guarantee termination in a single communication round\nunder favorable conditions.\n  In this paper we present a generic optimizer than can turn any consensus\nprotocol into an optimized protocol that terminates in a single communication\nround whenever all nodes start with the same predetermined value and no\nByzantine failures occur (although node crashes are allowed). This is\nregardless of the network timing assumptions and additional oracle capabilities\nassumed by the base consensus protocol being optimized.\n  In the case of benign failures, our optimizer works whenever the number of\nfaulty nodes $f<n/2$. For Byzantine behavior, our optimizer's resiliency\ndepends on the validity variant sought. In the case of classical validity, it\ncan accommodate $f<n/4$ Byzantine failures. With the more recent external\nvalidity function assumption, it works whenever $f<n/3$. Either way, our\noptimizer only relies on oral messages, thereby imposing very light-weight\ncrypto requirements.",

This allows us to track and investigate monetary flows between\ninvolved actors and gain insights into the financial structure of sextortion\ncampaigns. We find that sextortion spammers are somewhat sophisticated,\nfollowing pricing strategies and benefiting from cost reductions as their\noperations cut the upper-tail of the spamming supply chain. We discover that\none single entity is likely controlling the financial backbone of the majority\nof the sextortion campaigns and that the 11-month operation studied yielded a\nlower-bound revenue between \\$1,300,620 and \\$1,352,266.

To open a payment channel one has to publish\na transaction on-chain and pay the appropriate transaction fee. A transaction\ncan be routed in the network, as long as there is a path of channels with the\nnecessary capital. The intermediate nodes on this path can ask for a fee to\nforward the transaction. Hence, opening channels, although costly, can benefit\na party, both by reducing the cost of the party for sending a transaction and\nby collecting the fees from forwarding transactions of other parties.\n  This trade-off spawns a network creation game between the channel parties. In\nthis work, we introduce the first game theoretic model for analyzing the\nnetwork creation game on blockchain payment channels. Further, we examine\nvarious network structures (path, star, complete bipartite graph and clique)\nand determine for each one of them the constraints (fee value) under which they\nconstitute a Nash equilibrium, given a fixed fee policy. Last, we show that the\nstar is a Nash equilibrium when each channel party can freely decide the\nchannel fee. On the other hand, we prove the complete bipartite graph can never\nbe a Nash equilibrium, given a free fee policy.",

            "summary": "IP protocol is the core of TCP/IP network layer. However, since IP address\nand its Domain Name are allocated and managed by a single agency, there are\nrisks of centralization. The semantic overload of IP address also reduces its\nscalability and mobility, which further hinders the security.\n  This paper proposes a co-governing Multi-Identifier Network (MIN)\narchitecture that constructs a network layer with parallel coexistence of\nmultiple identifiers, including identity, content, geographic information, and\nIP address. On the management plane, we develop an efficient management system\nusing consortium blockchain with voting consensus, so the network can\nsimultaneously manage and support by hundreds or thousands of nodes with high\nthroughput. On the data plane, we propose an algorithm merging hash table and\nprefix tree (HTP) for FIB, which avoids the false-negative error and can\ninter-translate different identifiers with tens of billions of entries.\nFurther, we propose a scheme to transport IP packets using CCN as a tunnel for\nsupporting progressive deployment. We deployed the prototype of MIN to the\nlargest operators' network in Mainland China, Hongkong and Macao, and\ndemonstrated that the network can register identifier under co-governing\nconsensus algorithm, support VoD service very well.",

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a\npromising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application\ndevelopment. However, existing BaaS deployment solutions are mostly\nvendor-locked: they are either bound to a cloud provider or a blockchain\nplatform. In addition to deployment, design and implementation of\nblockchain-based applications is a hard task requiring deep expertise.\nTherefore, this paper presents a unified blockchain as a service platform\n(uBaaS) to support both design and deployment of blockchain-based applications.\nThe services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a\nservice and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform\nagnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design\npattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart\ncontract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain.\nThe proposed solutions are evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use\ncase in terms of feasibility and scalability.",

To tackle\nthese issues, permissioned blockchains were introduced as an alternative\napproach combining the positives of the two worlds and avoiding their\ndrawbacks.

In order to\nenhance security and privacy on the Internet, many security protocols have been\ndeveloped. Unfortunately, the security analyzes that have been carried out on\nthese protocols show that they are vulnerable to one or few attacks, which\neliminates the use of these protocols. Therefore, the need for a security\nprotocol on the Internet of Things (IoT) has not yet been resolved.\n  Recently, Khor and Sidorov cryptanalyzed the Wang et al. protocol and\npresented an improved version of it. In this paper, at first, we show that this\nprotocol also does not have sufficient security and so it is not recommended to\nbe used in any application. More precisely, we present a full secret disclosure\nattack against this protocol, which extracted the whole secrets of the protocol\nby two communication with the target tag.\n  In addition, Sidorv et al. recently proposed an ultralightweight mutual\nauthentication RFID protocol for blockchain enabled supply chains, supported by\nformal and informal security proofs.

As an instance of our\napproach, we develop an embedding of a core smart contract language into Coq\nand verify several important properties of a crowdfunding contract based on a\nprevious formalisation of smart contract execution in blockchains.",

            "summary": "Quantum Computers (QCs), once they mature, will be able to solve some\nproblems faster than Classic Computers. This phenomenon is called \"quantum\nadvantage\" (or a stronger term \"quantum supremacy\").\n  Quantum advantage will help us to speed up computations in many areas, from\nartificial intelligence to medicine. However, QC power can also be leveraged to\nbreak modern cryptographic algorithms, which pervade modern software: use cases\nrange from encryption of Internet traffic, to encryption of disks, to signing\nblockchain ledgers.\n  While the exact date when QCs will evolve to reach quantum advantage is\nunknown, the consensus is that this future is near. Thus, in order to maintain\ncrypto agility of the software, one needs to start preparing for the era of\nquantum advantage proactively.\n  In this paper, we recap the effect of quantum advantage on the existing and\nnew software systems, as well as the data that we currently store. We also\nhighlight similarities and differences between the security challenges brought\nby QCs and the challenges that software engineers faced twenty years ago while\nfixing widespread Y2K bug. Technically, the Y2K bug and the quantum advantage\nproblems are different: the former was caused by timing-related problems, while\nthe latter is caused by a cryptographic algorithm being non-quantum-resistant.\nHowever, conceptually, the problems are similar: we know what the root cause\nis, the fix (strategically) is straightforward, yet the implementation of the\nfix is challenging.\n  To address the quantum advantage challenge, we create a seven-step roadmap,\ndeemed 7E. It is inspired by the lessons-learnt from the Y2K era amalgamated\nwith modern knowledge. The roadmap gives developers a structured way to start\npreparing for the quantum advantage era, helping them to start planning for the\ncreation of new as well as the evolution of the existent software.",

Further, ZKlaims can be presented\nnon-interactively, mitigating the need for interactive proofs between the user\nand the verifier. This allows ZKlaims to be exchanged via fully decentralized\nservices and storages such as traditional peer-to-peer networks based on\ndistributed hash tables (DHTs) or even blockchains. To show this, we include a\nperformance evaluation of ZKlaims and show how it can be integrated in\ndecentralized identity provider services.",

At\nthe same time this research is challenging fundamental aspects of the Bitcoin\ncore concept. It has to be questioned whether all of these new approaches still\nadequately could be described as blockchain technology. We propose to use the\nterm Decentralized Consensus Technology as a general category instead.\nDecentralized Consensus Technology consists of decentralized ledger and\nnon-ledger technologies. Blockchain technology in turn is only one of multiple\nimplementations of the Decentralized Ledger Technology. Furthermore, we\nidentified three main characteristics of Decentralized Consensus Technology:\ndecentralization, trustlessness and ability to eventually reach consensus.\nDepending on the use case of the specific implementation the following\nadditional properties have to be considered: privacy, participation incentive,\nirreversibility and immutability, operation purpose, confirmation time,\ntransaction costs, ability to externalize transactions and computations and\nscalability possibilities.",

Smart contracts that\nare transparent about their function are more successful than opaque contracts.\nWe have therefore developed a tool (ContractVis) to explore the transparency of\nsmart contracts. The tool generates a replay script for the historic\ntransactions of a smart contract. The script executes the transactions with the\nsame arguments as recorded on the blockchain, but in a minimal test\nenvironment.

However, blockchain\nitself, though secured by its protocol, does not identify who owns the data and\nwho uses the data. Other than simply encrypting data into keys, in this paper,\nwe proposed a protocol called Biometric Blockchain (BBC) that explicitly\nincorporate the biometric cues of individuals to unambiguously identify the\ncreators and users in a blockchain-based system, particularly to address the\nincreasing needs to secure the food logistics, following the recently widely\nreported incident on wrongly labelled foods that caused the death of a customer\non a flight. The advantage of using BBC in the food logistics is clear: it can\nnot only identify if the data or labels are authentic, but also clearly record\nwho is responsible for the secured data or labels. As a result, such a\nBBC-based solution can great ease the difficulty to control the risks\naccompanying the food logistics, such as faked foods or wrong gradient labels.",

However, reaching consensus in an online,\ndigital world where identities are not tied to physical users is a challenging\nproblem. Proof-of-work provides a solution by linking representation to a\nvaluable, physical resource. While this has worked well, it uses a tremendous\namount of specialized hardware and energy, with no utility beyond blockchain\nsecurity. Here, we propose an alternative consensus scheme that directs the\ncomputational resources to the optimization of machine learning (ML) models, a\ntask with more general utility. This is achieved by a hybrid consensus scheme\nrelying on three parties: data providers, miners, and a committee. The data\nprovider makes data available and provides payment in return for the best\nmodel, miners compete about the payment and access to the committee by\nproducing ML optimized models, and the committee controls the ML competition.",

Although voltage regulation is a crucial ancillary service within\nactive distribution networks (ADNs), previous work has not adequately explored\nhow this service can be offered in terms of its incentivization, contract\nauditability and enforcement. Blockchain technology shows promise in being a\nkey enabler of TES, allowing agents to engage in trustless, persistent\ntransactions that are both enforceable and auditable. To that end, this paper\nproposes a blockchain based TES that enables agents to receive incentives for\nproviding voltage regulation services by i) maintaining an auditable reputation\nrating for each agent that is increased proportionately with each mitigation of\na voltage violation, ii) utilizing smart contracts to enforce the validity of\neach transaction and penalize reputation ratings in case of a mitigation\nfailure and iii) automating the negotiation and bidding of agent services by\nimplementing the contract net protocol (CNP) as a smart contract. Experimental\nresults on both simulated and real-world ADNs are executed to demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed system.",

            "summary": "All public blockchains are secured by a proof of opportunity cost among block\nproducers. For example, the security offered by proof-of-work (PoW) systems,\nlike Bitcoin, is due to spent computation; it is work precisely because it\ncannot be performed for free. In general, more resources provably lost in\nproducing blocks yields more security for the blockchain. When two blockchains\nshare the same mechanism for providing opportunity cost, as is the case when\nthey share the same PoW algorithm, the two chains compete for resources from\nblock producers. Indeed, if there exists a liquid market between resource\ntypes, then theoretically all blockchains will compete for resources. In this\npaper, we show that there exists a resource allocation equilibrium between any\ntwo blockchains, which is essentially driven by the fiat value of reward that\neach chain offers in return for providing security. We go on to prove that this\nequilibrium is singular and always achieved provided that block producers\nbehave in a greedy, but cautious fashion. The opposite is true when they are\noverly greedy: resource allocation oscillates in extremes between the two\nchains. We show that these results hold both in practice and in a block\ngeneration simulation. Finally, we demonstrate several applications of this\ntheory including a trustless price-ratio oracle, increased security for\nblockchains whose coins have lower fiat value, and a quantification of cost to\nallocating resources away from the equilibrium.",

            "summary": "We introduce DaiMoN, a decentralized artificial intelligence model network,\nwhich incentivizes peer collaboration in improving the accuracy of machine\nlearning models for a given classification problem. It is an autonomous network\nwhere peers may submit models with improved accuracy and other peers may verify\nthe accuracy improvement. The system maintains an append-only decentralized\nledger to keep the log of critical information, including who has trained the\nmodel and improved its accuracy, when it has been improved, by how much it has\nimproved, and where to find the newly updated model. DaiMoN rewards these\ncontributing peers with cryptographic tokens. A main feature of DaiMoN is that\nit allows peers to verify the accuracy improvement of submitted models without\nknowing the test labels. This is an essential component in order to mitigate\nintentional model overfitting by model-improving peers. To enable this model\naccuracy evaluation with hidden test labels, DaiMoN uses a novel learnable\nDistance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function proposed in this paper. Specific\nto each test dataset, DEL scrambles the test label vector by embedding it in a\nlow-dimension space while approximately preserving the distance between the\ndataset's test label vector and a label vector inferred by the classifier. It\ntherefore allows proof-of-improvement (PoI) by peers without providing them\naccess to true test labels. We provide analysis and empirical evidence that\nunder DEL, peers can accurately assess model accuracy. We also argue that it is\nhard to invert the embedding function and thus, DEL is resilient against\nattacks aiming to recover test labels in order to cheat.

In a cross-site genomic data\nsharing system, a secure and transparent access control audit module plays an\nessential role in ensuring the accountability. The 2018 iDASH competition first\ntrack provides us with an opportunity to design efficient logging and querying\nsystem for cross-site genomic dataset access audit. We designed a\nblockchain-based log system which can provide a light-weight and widely\ncompatible module for existing blockchain platforms. The submitted solution won\nthe third place of the competition. In this paper, we report the technical\ndetails in our system. Methods: We present two methods: baseline method and\nenhanced method. We started with the baseline method and then adjusted our\nimplementation based on the competition evaluation criteria and characteristics\nof the log system. To overcome obstacles of indexing on the immutable\nBlockchain system, we designed a hierarchical timestamp structure which\nsupports efficient range queries on the timestamp field. Results: We\nimplemented our methods in Python3, tested the scalability, and compared the\nperformance using the test data supplied by competition organizer. We\nsuccessfully boosted the log retrieval speed for complex AND queries that\ncontain multiple predicates. For the range query, we boosted the speed for at\nleast one order of magnitude. The storage usage is reduced by 25%. Conclusion:\nWe demonstrate that Blockchain can be used to build a time and space efficient\nlog and query genomic dataset audit trail. Therefore, it provides a promising\nsolution for sharing genomic data with accountability requirement across\nmultiple sites.",

Towards\nresolving this contradiction, various methods and techniques for mutable\nblockchains have been proposed in an effort to satisfy regulatory erasing\nrequirements while preserving blockchains' security. To this end, this work\naims to provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research\napproaches, technical workarounds and advanced cryptographic techniques that\nhave been put forward to resolve this conflict and to discuss their potentials,\nconstraints and limitations when applied in the wild to either permissioned or\npermissionless blockchains.",

            "summary": "In last years, there has been an increasing effort to leverage Distributed\nLedger Technology (DLT), including blockchain. One of the main topics of\ninterest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy\nmechanisms, as for example is the case of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a\ncryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into\nthe ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this\nwork we describe different strategies to construct Zero Knowledge Range Proofs\n(ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot in 2001; the one proposed\nin 2008 by Camenisch et al, and Bulletproofs, proposed in 2017. We also compare\nthese strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since Bulletproofs is the most\nefficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms\nand optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous\nschemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not\ndesirable in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain.\nIn case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be\npossible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, Bulletproofs can\nalso be used to construct generic Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), in the sense\nthat it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only\nrestricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of Proof of Knowledge\n(PoK). Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for\nDLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs\nprotocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced.",

At its core it is a novel\nconsensus protocol with exactly one block certified in each round: that is, the\nprotocol guarantees that the blockchain does not fork. In this paper, we report\non our effort to model and formally verify the Algorand consensus protocol in\nthe Coq proof assistant. Similar to previous consensus protocol verification\nefforts, we model the protocol as a state transition system and reason over\nreachable global states. However, in contrast to previous work, our model\nexplicitly incorporates timing issues (e.g., timeouts and network delays) and\nadversarial actions, reflecting a more realistic environment faced by a public\nblockchain. Thus far, we have proved asynchronous safety of the protocol: two\ndifferent blocks cannot be certified in the same round, even when the adversary\nhas complete control of message delivery in the network. We believe that our\nmodel is sufficiently general and other relevant properties of the protocol\nsuch as liveness can be proved for the same model.",

While SGX protection does not specifically take into consideration\nsuch threats, we show in the current paper that a simple malware attack\nexploiting a separation between the build and signing processes can have a\nserious damaging impact, practically nullifying SGX integrity protection\nmeasures. We also explore two possible mitigations against the attack, one\ncentralized leveraging SGX itself, and one distributed that relies on a smart\ncontract deployed on a blockchain infrastructure.

Prior analyses of the bitcoin and Prism\nbackbone protocols assume the lifespan of blockchain is finite. This paper\npresents a streamlined and strengthened analysis without the finite horizon\nassumption. Specifically, the results include a blockchain growth property, a\nblockchain quality property, and a common prefix property of the bitcoin\nbackbone protocol, as well as the liveness and persistence of the Prism\nbackbone protocol regardless of whether the blockchains have a infinite\nlifespan.

            "summary": "Ethereum smart contracts are executable programs, deployed on a peer-to-peer\nnetwork and executed in a consensus-based fashion. Their bytecode is public,\nimmutable and once deployed to the blockchain, cannot be patched anymore. As\nsmart contracts may hold Ether worth of several million dollars, they are\nattractive targets for attackers and indeed some contracts have successfully\nbeen exploited in the recent past, resulting in tremendous financial losses.\nThe correctness of smart contracts is thus of utmost importance. While first\napproaches on formal verification exist, they demand users to be well-versed in\nformal methods which are alien to many developers and are only able to analyze\nindividual contracts, without considering their execution environment, i.e.,\ncalls to external contracts, sequences of transaction, and values from the\nactual blockchain storage. In this paper, we present Annotary, a concolic\nexecution framework to analyze smart contracts for vulnerabilities, supported\nby annotations which developers write directly in the Solidity source code. In\ncontrast to existing work, Annotary supports analysis of inter-transactional,\ninter-contract control flows and combines symbolic execution of EVM bytecode\nwith a resolution of concrete values from the public Ethereum blockchain. While\nthe analysis of Annotary tends to weight precision higher than soundness, we\nanalyze inter-transactional call chains to eliminate false positives from\nunreachable states that traditional symbolic execution would not be able to\nhandle. We present the annotation and analysis concepts of Annotary, explain\nits implementation on top of the Laser symbolic virtual machine, and\ndemonstrate its usage as a plugin for the Sublime Text editor.",

            "summary": "Offchain protocols aim at bypassing the scalability and privacy limitations\nof classic blockchains by allowing a subset of participants to execute multiple\ntransactions outside the blockchain. While existing solutions like payment\nnetworks and factories depend on a complex routing protocol, other solutions\nsimply require participants to build a \\emph{childchain}, a secondary\nblockchain where their transactions are privately executed. Unfortunately, all\nchildchain solutions assume either synchrony or a trusted execution\nenvironment.\n  In this paper, we present Platypus a childchain that requires neither\nsynchrony nor a trusted execution environment. Relieving the need for a trusted\nexecution environment allows Platypus to ensure privacy without trusting a\ncentral authority, like Intel, that manufactures dedicated hardware chipset,\nlike SGX. Relieving the need for synchrony means that no attacker can steal\ncoins by leveraging clock drifts or message delays to lure timelocks.\n  In order to prove our algorithm correct, we formalize the chilchain problem\nas a Byzantine variant of the classic Atomic Commit problem, where closing a\nchildchain is equivalent to committing the whole set of payments previously\nrecorded on the childchain ``atomically'' on the main chain. Platypus is\nresilience optimal and we explain how to generalize it to crosschain payments.",

            "summary": "Byzantine general problem is the core problem of the consensus algorithm, and\nmany protocols are proposed recently to improve the decentralization level, the\nperformance and the security of the blockchain. There are two challenging\nissues when the blockchain is operating in practice. First, the outcomes of the\nconsensus algorithm are usually related to the incentive model, so whether each\nparticipant's value has an equal probability of being chosen becomes essential.\nHowever, the issues of fairness are not captured in the traditional security\ndefinition of Byzantine agreement. Second, the blockchain should be resistant\nto network failures, such as cloud services shut down or malicious attack,\nwhile remains the high performance most of the time.\n  This paper has two main contributions. First, we propose a novel notion\ncalled fair validity for Byzantine agreement. Intuitively, fair validity\nlower-bounds the expected numbers that honest nodes' values being decided if\nthe protocol is executed many times. However, we also show that any Byzantine\nagreement could not achieve fair validity in an asynchronous network, so we\nfocus on synchronous protocols. This leads to our second contribution: we\npropose a fair, responsive and partition-resilient Byzantine agreement protocol\ntolerating up to 1/3 corruptions. Fairness means that our protocol achieves\nfair validity. Responsiveness means that the termination time only depends on\nthe actual network delay instead of depending on any pre-determined time bound.\nPartition-resilience means that the safety still holds even if the network is\npartitioned, and the termination will hold if the partition is resolved.",

However, we identify a denial-of-service attack that is exposed\nby these solutions - an attacker can generate transactions that would overload\na single shard, thus delaying processing in the entire system. Moreover, we\nshow that in common scenarios, these protocols require most node operators to\nprocess almost all blockchain transactions. We present Ostraka, a blockchain\nnode architecture that shards (parallelizes) the nodes themselves. We prove\nthat replacing a unified node with an Ostraka node does not affect the security\nof the underlying consensus mechanism.

Access and operations in this\nband, aka Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), will be managed by a dynamic\nspectrum access system (SAS) to enable seamless spectrum sharing between\nsecondary users (SUs) and incumbent users. Despite its benefits, SAS's design\nrequirements, as set by FCC, present privacy risks to SUs, merely because SUs\nare required to share sensitive operational information (e.g., location,\nidentity, spectrum usage) with SAS to be able to learn about spectrum\navailability in their vicinity. In this paper, we propose TrustSAS , a\ntrustworthy framework for SAS that synergizes state-of-the-art cryptographic\ntechniques with blockchain technology in an innovative way to address these\nprivacy issues while complying with FCC's regulatory design requirements. We\nanalyze the security of our framework and evaluate its performance through\nanalysis, simulation and experimentation.

The issue\nconcerns ERC20's defined method approve() which was envisioned as a way for\ntoken holders to give permission for other users and dapps to withdraw a capped\nnumber of tokens. The security issue arises when a token holder wants to adjust\nthe amount of approved tokens from N to M (this could be an increase or\ndecrease). If malicious, a user or dapp who is approved for N tokens can\nfront-run the adjustment transaction to first withdraw N tokens, then allow the\napproval to be confirmed, and withdraw an additional M tokens. In this paper,\nwe evaluate 10 proposed mitigations for this issues and find that no solution\nis fully satisfactory.

            "summary": "Smart Cities evolve into complex and pervasive urban environments with a\ncitizens' mandate to meet sustainable development goals. Repositioning\ndemocratic values of citizens' choices in these complex ecosystems has turned\nout to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and\nopportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper\nintroduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively\nengaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public\nurban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the\nAncient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens\nassemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters.\nThe core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving\nwitness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence\nand testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the\nchallenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus\nto empower citizens' trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS\nlocalization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and\ncrowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how\nreal-time collective measurements over citizens' choices can be made in a fully\ndecentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by\ndeploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of\ntransport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated\nusing official accident data from public authorities, which are compared\nagainst wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus,\nself-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented\ndemocracy paradigm is outlined.",

We present Bonded Mining, a\nproactive DAA that works by collecting hash rate commitments secured by bond\nfrom miners. The difficulty is set directly from the commitments and the bond\nis used to penalize miners who deviate from their commitment. We devise a\nstatistical test that is capable of detecting hash rate deviations by utilizing\nonly on-blockchain data. The test is sensitive enough to detect a variety of\ndeviations from commitments, while almost never misclassifying honest miners.\nWe demonstrate in simulation that, under reasonable assumptions, Bonded Mining\nis more effective at maintaining a target block time than the Bitcoin Cash DAA,\none of the newest and most dynamic DAAs currently deployed. In this preliminary\nwork, the lowest hash rate miner our approach supports is 1% of the total and\nwe directly consider only two types of fundamental attacks.

            "summary": "Full nodes, which synchronize the entire blockchain history and independently\nvalidate all the blocks, form the backbone of any blockchain network by playing\na vital role in ensuring security properties. On the other hand, a user running\na full node needs to pay a heavy price in terms of storage costs. E.g., the\nBitcoin blockchain size has grown over 215GB, in spite of its low throughput.\nThe ledger size for a high throughput blockchain Ripple has already reached\n9TB, and it is growing at an astonishing rate of 12GB per day!\n  In this paper, we propose an architecture based on 'fountain codes', a class\nof erasure codes, that enables any full node to 'encode' validated blocks into\na small number of 'coded blocks', thereby reducing its storage costs by orders\nof magnitude. In particular, our proposed \"Secure Fountain (SeF)\" architecture\ncan achieve a near-optimal trade-off between the storage savings per node and\nthe 'bootstrap cost' in terms of the number of (honest) storage-constrained\nnodes a new node needs to contact to recover the blockchain. A key technical\ninnovation in SeF codes is to make fountain codes secure against adversarial\nnodes that can provide maliciously formed coded blocks. Our idea is to use the\nheader-chain as a 'side-information' to check whether a coded block is\nmaliciously formed while it is getting decoded. Further, the 'rateless\nproperty' of fountain codes helps in achieving high decentralization and\nscalability. Our experiments demonstrate that SeF codes tuned to achieve 1000x\nstorage savings enable full nodes to encode the 191GB Bitcoin blockchain into\n195MB on average. A new node can recover the blockchain from an arbitrary set\nof storage-constrained nodes as long as the set contains ~1100 honest nodes on\naverage. Note that for a 1000x storage savings, the fundamental bound on the\nnumber of honest nodes to contact is 1000: we need about 10% more in practice.",

This paper drew concepts from\ndifferential games, classical control engineering, and stochastic dynamical\nsystem to come up with a framework and example to model, simulate, and engineer\nnetworked token economies. A model on a generalized token economy is proposed\nwhere miners provide service to a platform in exchange for a cryptocurrency and\nusers consume service from the platform. Simulations of this model allow us to\nobserve outcomes of complex dynamics and reason about the evolution of the\nsystem.

            "summary": "Contemporary blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum execute transactions\nserially by miners and validators and determine the Proof-of-Work (PoW). Such\nserial execution is unable to exploit modern multi-core resources efficiently,\nhence limiting the system throughput and increasing the transaction acceptance\nlatency. The objective of this work is to increase the transaction throughput\nby introducing parallel transaction execution using a static analysis\ntechnique. We propose a framework DiPETrans for the distributed execution of\nthe transactions in a block. Here, peers in the blockchain network form a\ncommunity to execute the transactions and find the PoW parallelly, using a\nleader-follower approach. During mining, the leader statically analyzes the\ntransactions, creates different groups (shards) of independent transactions,\nand distributes them to followers to execute them in parallel. After the\ntransaction executes, the community's compute power is utilized to solve the\nPoW concurrently. When a block is successfully created, the leader broadcasts\nthe proposed block to other peers in the network for validation. On receiving a\nblock, validators re-execute the block transactions and accept the block if\nthey reach the same state as shared by the miner. Validation can also be done\nas a community, in parallel, following the same leader-follower approach as\nmining. We report experiments using over 5 Million real transactions from the\nEthereum blockchain and execute them using our DiPETrans framework to\nempirically validate the benefits of our techniques over traditional sequential\nexecution. We achieve a maximum speedup of 2.2x for the miner and 2.0x for the\nvalidator, with 100 to 500 transactions per block. Further, we achieve a peak\nof 5x end-to-end block creation speedup using a parallel miner over a serial\nminer when using 6 machines in the community.",

Fabric, in particular, has been shown\nto handle tens of thousands of transactions per second. However, this\nperformance is only achievable for contention-free transaction workloads. If\nmany transactions compete for a small set of hot keys in the world state, the\neffective throughput drops drastically. We therefore propose XOX: a novel\ntwo-pronged transaction execution approach that both minimizes invalid\ntransactions in the Fabric blockchain and maximizes concurrent execution. Our\napproach additionally prevents unintentional denial of service attacks by\nclients re-submitting conflicting transactions.

No public key infrastructure (PKI) needs to be maintained. And no\nrevocation lists need to be checked. In contrast to competing smart contract\napproaches, ours is hierarchically managed (like a PKI) enabling better\nvalidation of attribute providers and making it more useful for large entities\nto provide identity services for their constituents (e.g., a government) while\nstill enabling users to maintain a level of self-sovereignty.",

            "summary": "Blockchain based cryptocurrencies are usually unmanaged, distributed,\nconsensus-based systems in which no single entity has control. Managed\ncryptocurrencies can be implemented using private blockchains but are\nfundamentally different as the owners have complete control to do arbitrary\nactivity without transparency (since they control the mining). In this work we\nexplore a hybrid approach where a managed cryptocurrency is maintained through\ndistributed consensus based methods. The currency administrator can perform\nongoing management functions while the consensus methods enforce the rules of\nthe cryptocurrency and provide transparency for all management actions. This\nenables the introduction of money management features common in fiat currencies\nbut where the managing entity cannot perform arbitrary actions and transparency\nis enforced. We thus eliminate the need for users to trust the currency\nadministrator but also to enable the administrator to manage the\ncryptocurrency. We demonstrate how to implement our approach through modest\nmodifications to the implicit Bitcoin specification, however, our approach can\nbe applied to most any blockchain based cryptocurrency using a variety of\nconsensus methods.",

To help manufacturers\ndevelop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system\nleveraging the reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to\ntrain a machine learning model based on customers' data. Then, manufacturers\ncan predict customers' requirements and consumption behaviors in the future.\nThe working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage,\ncustomers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the\nmobile phone and the mobile edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data\nfrom various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the\ninitial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers\nsign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or\nmanufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized\naggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are\nuntampered, malicious customers or manufacturers' activities are traceable. In\nthe second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for\ncalculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end\nof the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary\nleader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers' privacy and\nimprove the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy on the extracted\nfeatures and propose a new normalization technique. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that our normalization technique outperforms batch normalization\nwhen features are under differential privacy protection. In addition, to\nattract more customers to participate in the crowdsourcing FL task, we design\nan incentive mechanism to award participants.",

A number of\nvulnerabilities and corresponding attacks of EOSIO's smart contracts have been\ndiscovered and observed in the wild, which caused a large amount of financial\ndamages. However, the majority of EOSIO's smart contracts are not open-sourced.\nAs a result, the WebAssembly code may become the only available object to be\nanalyzed in most cases. Unfortunately, current tools are web-application\noriented and cannot be applied to EOSIO WebAssembly code directly, which makes\nit more difficult to detect vulnerabilities from those smart contracts. In this\npaper, we propose \\toolname, a static analysis tool that can be used to detect\nvulnerabilities from EOSIO WASM code automatically. We focus on one particular\ntype of vulnerabilities named \\textit{fake-transfer}, and the exploitation of\nsuch vulnerabilities has led to millions of dollars in damages. To the best of\nour knowledge, it is the first attempt to build an automatic tool to detect\nvulnerabilities of EOSIO's smart contracts. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our tool is able to detect fake transfer vulnerabilities\nquickly and precisely.

            "summary": "Ride-sharing is a service that enables drivers to share their trips with\nother riders, contributing to appealing benefits of shared travel costs.\nHowever, the majority of existing platforms rely on a central third party,\nwhich make them subject to a single point of failure and privacy disclosure\nissues. Moreover, they are vulnerable to DDoS and Sybil attacks due to\nmalicious users involvement. Besides, high fees should be paid to the service\nprovider. In this paper, we propose a decentralized ride-sharing service based\non public Blockchain, named B-Ride. Both riders and drivers can find rides\nmatch while preserving their trip data, including pick-up/drop-off location,\nand departure/arrival date. However, under the anonymity of the public\nblockchain, a malicious user may submit multiple ride requests or offers, while\nnot committing to any of them, to discover better offer or to make the system\nunreliable. B-Ride solves this problem by introducing a time-locked deposit\nprotocol for a ride-sharing by leveraging smart contract and zero-knowledge set\nmembership proof. In a nutshell, both a driver and a rider have to show their\ncommitment by sending a deposit to the blockchain. Later, a driver has to prove\nto the blockchain on the agreed departure time that he has arrived at the\npick-up location. To preserve rider/driver location privacy by hiding the exact\npick-up location, the proof is done using zero-knowledge set membership\nprotocol. Moreover, to ensure a fair payment, a pay-as-you-drive methodology is\nintroduced based on the elapsed distance of the driver and the rider. Also, we\nintroduce a reputation-based trust model to rate drivers based on their past\ntrips to allow riders to select them based on their history on the system.\nFinally, we implement B-Ride in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results\nshow the applicability of our protocol atop the existing real-world blockchain.",

These\nprotocols provide a strong probabilistic safety guarantee in the presence of\nByzantine adversaries while their concurrent and leaderless nature enables them\nto achieve high throughput and scalability. Unlike blockchains that rely on\nproof-of-work, they are quiescent and green. Unlike traditional consensus\nprotocols where one or more nodes typically process linear bits in the number\nof total nodes per decision, no node processes more than logarithmic bits. It\ndoes not require accurate knowledge of all participants and exposes new\npossible tradeoffs and improvements in safety and liveness for building\nconsensus protocols.\n  The paper describes the Snow protocol family, analyzes its guarantees, and\ndescribes how it can be used to construct the core of an internet-scale\nelectronic payment system called Avalanche, which is evaluated in a large scale\ndeployment. Experiments demonstrate that the system can achieve high throughput\n(3400 tps), provide low confirmation latency (1.35 sec), and scale well\ncompared to existing systems that deliver similar functionality.

            "summary": "The underlying fundaments of blockchain are cryptography and cryptographic\nconcepts that provide reliable and secure decentralized solutions. Although\nmany recent papers study the use-cases of blockchain in different industrial\nareas, such as finance, health care, legal relations, IoT, information\nsecurity, and consensus building systems, only few studies scrutinize the\ncryptographic concepts used in blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, there\nis no Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) that gives a complete picture of the\nexisting cryptographic concepts which have been deployed or have the potential\nto be deployed in blockchain. In this paper, we thoroughly review and\nsystematize all cryptographic concepts which are already used in blockchain.\nAdditionally, we give a list of cryptographic concepts which have not yet been\napplied but have big potentials to improve the current blockchain solutions. We\nalso include possible instantiations of these cryptographic concepts in the\nblockchain domain. Last but not least, we explicitly postulate 21 challenging\nproblems that cryptographers interested in blockchain can work on.",

            "summary": "The consensus protocol named proof of work (PoW) is widely applied by\ncryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Although security of a PoW cryptocurrency is\nalways the top priority, it is threatened by mining attacks like selfish\nmining. Researchers have proposed many mining attack models with one attacker,\nand optimized the attacker's strategy. During these mining attacks, an attacker\npursues a higher relative revenue (RR) by wasting a large amount of\ncomputational power of the honest miners at the cost of a small amount of\ncomputational power of himself. In this paper, we propose a mining attack model\nwith two phases: the original system and the multi-attacker system. It is the\nfirst model to provide both theoretical and quantitative analysis of mining\nattacks with two attackers. We explain how the original system turns into the\nmulti-attacker system by introducing two attackers: the internal attacker and\nthe external attacker. If both attackers take the attacking strategy selfish\nmining, the RR of the internal attacker in multi-attacker system will drop by\nup to 31.9% compared with his RR in original system. The external attacker will\noverestimate his RR by up to 44.6% in multiattacker system. Unexpected\ncompetitions, auctions between attackers and overestimation of attackers'\ninfluence factor are three main causes of both attackers' dropping RR. We\npropose a mining strategy named Partial Initiative Release (PIR) which is a\nsemi-honest mining strategy in multi-attacker system. In some specific\nsituations, PIR allows the attacker to get more block reward by launching an\nattack in multi-attacker system.",

However, although Bitcoin\ntransactions are permanently recorded and publicly available, current\napproaches for detecting ransomware depend only on a couple of heuristics\nand/or tedious information gathering steps (e.g., running ransomware to collect\nransomware related Bitcoin addresses). To our knowledge, none of the previous\napproaches have employed advanced data analytics techniques to automatically\ndetect ransomware related transactions and malicious Bitcoin addresses.\n  By capitalizing on the recent advances in topological data analysis, we\npropose an efficient and tractable data analytics framework to automatically\ndetect new malicious addresses in a ransomware family, given only a limited\nrecords of previous transactions. Furthermore, our proposed techniques exhibit\nhigh utility to detect the emergence of new ransomware families, that is,\nransomware with no previous records of transactions.

Fault-tolerant protocols\nare extensively used in the distributed database infrastructure of large\nenterprises such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, as well as permissioned\nblockchain systems like IBM's Hyperledger Fabric. However, and in spite of\nyears of intensive research, existing fault-tolerant protocols do not\nadequately address all the characteristics of distributed system applications.\nIn particular, hybrid cloud environments consisting of private and public\nclouds are widely used by enterprises. However, fault-tolerant protocols have\nnot been adapted for such environments. In this paper, we introduce SeeMoRe, a\nhybrid State Machine Replication protocol to handle both crash and malicious\nfailures in a public/private cloud environment. SeeMoRe considers a private\ncloud consisting of nonmalicious nodes (either correct or crash) and a public\ncloud with both Byzantine faulty and correct nodes. SeeMoRe has three different\nmodes which can be used depending on the private cloud load and the\ncommunication latency between the public and the private cloud. We also\nintroduce a dynamic mode switching technique to transition from one mode to\nanother. Furthermore, we evaluate SeeMoRe using a series of benchmarks.

The outlier-aware consensus protocol exploits a supervised\nmachine learning algorithm which detects anomaly activities via a learned\ndetector in the first step. Then, the data goes through the inherent Practical\nByzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol in the hyperledger fabric\nfor ledger update.

            "summary": "In this paper, a novel framework that uses wireless mobile miners (MMs) for\ncomputation purposes in a blockchain system is proposed. In the introduced\nsystem, the blockchain ledger is located at the communication nodes (CNs), and\nthe MMs associated with CNs process the blockchain's proof-of-work (PoW)\ncomputation to verify the originality of the data. The MM that is the first to\nfinish its PoW will receive a reward by sending its computing result to the CNs\nthat are connected to other MMs. In the considered scenario, a blockchain\nforking event occurs if the MM having the shortest PoW delay fails to be the\nfirst to update its computing result to other MMs. To enable such mobile\noperations for a blockchain with minimum forking events, it is imperative to\nmaintain low-latency wireless communications between MMs and CNs. To analyze\nthe sensitivity of the system to latency, the probability of occurrence of a\nforking event is theoretically derived. The system is then designed so as to\ncompute the forked block's PoW again to recover from a forking event. For this\ncase, the average energy consumption of an MM is derived as a function of the\nsystem parameters such as the number of MMs and power consumed by the\ncomputing, transmission, and mobility processes of the MMs. Simulation results\nverify the analytical derivations and show that using a larger number of MMs\ncan reduce the energy consumption by up to 94.5% compared to a blockchain\nsystem with a single MM.",

            "summary": "The emergence of e-commerce and e-voting platforms has resulted in the rise\nin the volume of sensitive information over the Internet. This has resulted in\nan increased demand for secure and private means of information computation.\nTowards this, the Yao's Millionaires' problem, i.e., to determine the richer\namong two millionaires' securely, finds an application. In this work, we\npresent a new solution to the Yao's Millionaires' problem namely, Privacy\nPreserving Comparison (PPC). We show that PPC achieves this comparison in\nconstant time as well as in one execution. PPC uses semi-honest third parties\nfor the comparison who do not learn any information about the values. Further,\nwe show that PPC is collusion-resistance. To demonstrate the significance of\nPPC, we present a secure, approximate single-minded combinatorial auction,\nwhich we call TPACAS, i.e., Truthful, Privacy-preserving Approximate\nCombinatorial Auction for Single-minded bidders. We show that TPACAS, unlike\nprevious works, preserves the following privacies relevant to an auction: agent\nprivacy, the identities of the losing bidders must not be revealed to any other\nagent except the auctioneer (AU), bid privacy, the bid values must be hidden\nfrom the other agents as well as the AU and bid-topology privacy, the items for\nwhich the agents are bidding must be hidden from the other agents as well as\nthe AU. We demonstrate the practicality of TPACAS through simulations. Lastly,\nwe also look at TPACAS' implementation over a publicly distributed ledger, such\nas the Ethereum blockchain.",

The result is a diverse\necosystem, as exemplified by the development of a wide range of different\nblockchain protocols.

Existing efforts to\nsurvey the area reveal a fragmented terminology and the lack of a unified\nframework to reason about the properties of blockchain protocols. In this\npaper, we work towards bridging this gap. We present a five-dimensional design\nspace with a modular structure in which protocols can be compared and\nunderstood. Based on these five axes -- Optimality, Stability, Efficiency,\nRobustness and Persistence -- we organize the properties of existing protocols\nin subcategories of increasing granularity. The result is a dynamic scheme --\ntermed the PREStO framework -- which aids the interaction between stakeholders\nof different backgrounds, including managers and investors, and which enables\nsystematic reasoning about blockchain protocols. We illustrate its value by\ncomparing existing protocols and identifying research challenges, hence making\na first step towards understanding the blockchain ecosystem through a more\ncomprehensive lens.",

To fill this gap,\nwe introduce Cumulus, a low overhead, highly efficient, security provable\nsidechain protocol. Cumulus makes use of smart contracts to ensure that only\none block proposed in the sidechain will be enforced on the mainchain in each\nround, thereby achieving consensus in an efficient manner. We give a formal\nspecification of Cumulus which ensures safety and liveness without any online\nrequirements of clients.

            "summary": "Many blockchain-based algorithms, such as Bitcoin, implement a decentralized\nasset transfer system, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. As stated in the\noriginal paper by Nakamoto, at the heart of these systems lies the problem of\npreventing double-spending; this is usually solved by achieving consensus on\nthe order of transfers among the participants. In this paper, we treat the\nasset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determine its consensus\nnumber, showing that consensus is, in fact, not necessary to prevent\ndouble-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where\nonly a single process---the account owner---can withdraw from each account.\nSafety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas\nmisbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that\nthe consensus number of an asset transfer object is $1$. We then consider a\nmore general $k$-shared asset transfer object where up to $k$ processes can\natomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has\nconsensus number $k$. We establish our results in the context of shared memory\nwith benign faults, allowing us to properly understand the level of difficulty\nof the asset transfer problem. We also translate these results in the message\npassing setting with Byzantine players, a model that is more relevant in\npractice. In this model, we describe an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant\nasset transfer implementation that is both simpler and more efficient than\nstate-of-the-art consensus-based solutions. Our results are applicable to both\nthe permissioned (private) and permissionless (public) setting, as normally\ntheir differentiation is hidden by the abstractions on top of which our\nalgorithms are based.",

There is an emerging\ntrend beyond payments that blockchains could enable a new breed of\ndecentralized applications, and serve as the foundation for Internet's security\ninfrastructure. The immutable nature of the blockchain makes it a winner on\nsecurity and transparency; it is nearly inconceivable for ledgers to be altered\nin a way not instantly clear to every single user involved. However, most\nblockchains fall short in privacy aspects, particularly in data protection.\nGarlic Routing and Onion Routing are two of major Privacy Enhancing Techniques\n(PETs) which are popular for anonymization and security. Garlic Routing is a\nmethodology using by I2P Anonymous Network to hide the identity of sender and\nreceiver of data packets by bundling multiple messages into a layered\nencryption structure. The Onion Routing attempts to provide lowlatency\nInternet-based connections that resist traffic analysis, deanonymization\nattack, eavesdropping, and other attacks both by outsiders (e.g. Internet\nrouters) and insiders (Onion Routing servers themselves). As there are a few\ncontroversies over the rate of resistance of these two techniques to privacy\nattacks, we propose a PET-Enabled Sidechain (PETES) as a new privacy enhancing\ntechnique by integrating Garlic Routing and Onion Routing into a Garlic Onion\nRouting (GOR) framework suitable to the structure of blockchains. The\npreliminary proposed GOR aims to improve the privacy of transactions in\nblockchains via PETES structure.",

Here,\nwe extend this analysis to the case where there are \\emph{multiple}\n(non-colluding) selfish miners. We find that with multiple strategic miners,\nspecific deviations from honest mining by multiple strategic agents can\noutperform honest mining, even if individually miners would not be incentivised\nto be dishonest.

            "summary": "A Coordination Blockchain is a blockchain with the task of coordinating\nactivities of multiple private blockchains. This paper discusses the pros and\ncons of using Ethereum MainNet, the public Ethereum blockchain, as a\nCoordination Blockchain. The requirements Ethereum MainNet needs to fulfil to\nperform this role are discussed within the context of Ethereum Private\nSidechains, a private blockchain technology which allows many blockchains to be\noperated in parallel, and allows atomic crosschain transactions to execute\nacross blockchains. Ethereum MainNet is a permissionless network which aims to\noffer strong authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation properties, that\nincentivises good behaviour using crypto economics. This paper demonstrates\nthat Ethereum MainNet does deliver these properties. It then provides a\ncomprehensive review of the features of Ethereum Private Sidechains, with a\nfocus on the potential usage of Coordination Blockchains for these features.\nFinally, the merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain are\nassessed. For Ethereum Private Sidechains, we found that Ethereum MainNet is\nbest suited to storing long term static data that needs to be widely available,\nsuch as the Ethereum Registration Authority information. However, due to\nEthereum MainNet's probabilistic finality, it is not well suited to information\nthat needs to be available and acted upon immediately, such as the Sidechain\nPublic Keys and Atomic Crosschain Transaction state information that need to be\naccessible prior to the first atomic crosschain transaction being issued on a\nsidechain. Although this paper examined the use of Ethereum MainNet as a\nCoordination Blockchain within reference to Ethereum Private Sidechains, the\ndiscussions and observations of the typical tasks a Coordination blockchain may\nbe expected to perform are applicable more widely to any multi-blockchain\nsystem.",

Proof of Work (PoW)\nand Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) are the two main classes of consensus\nprotocols that are used in the blockchain consensus layer. PoW is highly\nscalable but very slow with about 7 (transactions/second) performance. BFT\nbased protocols are highly efficient but their scalability are limited to only\ntens of nodes. One of the main reasons for the BFT limitation is the quadratic\n$O(n^2)$ communication complexity of BFT based protocols for $n$ nodes that\nrequires $n \\times n$ broadcasting. In this paper, we present the {\\em Musch}\nprotocol which is BFT based and provides communication complexity $O(f n + n)$\nfor $f$ failures and $n$ nodes, where $f < n/3$, without compromising the\nlatency. Hence, the performance adjusts to $f$ such that for constant $f$ the\ncommunication complexity is linear. Musch achieves this by introducing the\nnotion of exponentially increasing windows of nodes to which complains are\nreported, instead of broadcasting to all the nodes. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first BFT-based blockchain protocol which efficiently addresses\nsimultaneously the issues of communication complexity and latency under the\npresence of failures.",

In this paper, we design a monolithic security\nmechanism for SDN based on Blockchain. Our mechanism decentralizes the control\nplane to overcome single-point failure while maintaining a network-wide view.\nThe mechanism also guarantees the authenticity, traceability, and\naccountability of application flows, and hence secures the programmable\nconfiguration. Moreover, the mechanism provides a fine-grained access control\nof network-wide resources and a secure controller-switch channel to further\nprotect resources and communication in SDN.",

A major effort in this direction is Hyperledger, an\nopen source project hosted by the Linux Foundation and backed by a consortium\nof over a hundred companies. A key component in permissioned blockchain\nprotocols is a byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus engine that orders\ntransactions. However, currently available BFT solutions in Hyperledger (as\nwell as in the literature at large) are inadequate for financial settings; they\nare not designed to ensure fairness or to tolerate selfish behavior that arises\nwhen financial institutions strive to maximize their own profit.\n  We present FairLedger, a permissioned blockchain BFT protocol, which is fair,\ndesigned to deal with rational behavior, and, no less important, easy to\nunderstand and implement. The secret sauce of our protocol is a new\ncommunication abstraction, called detectable all-to-all (DA2A), which allows us\nto detect participants (byzantine or rational) that deviate from the protocol,\nand punish them. We implement FairLedger in the Hyperledger open source\nproject, using Iroha framework, one of the biggest projects therein. To\nevaluate FairLegder's performance, we also implement it in the PBFT framework\nand compare the two protocols. Our results show that in failure-free scenarios\nFairLedger achieves better throughput than both Iroha's implementation and PBFT\nin wide-area settings.",

Blockchain relies on solving\ndifficult mathematical problems as proof-of-work within a network before blocks\nare added to the chain. Brute force approach, advocated by some as the fastest\nalgorithm for solving partial hash collisions and implemented in Bitcoin\nblockchain, implies exhaustive, sequential search. It involves incrementing the\nnonce (number) of the header by one, then taking a double SHA-256 hash at each\ninstance and comparing it with a target value to ascertain if lower than that\ntarget. It excessively consumes both time and power. In this paper, the\nauthors, therefore, suggest using an inner for-loop for the population-based\napproach. Comparison shows that it's a slightly faster approach than brute\nforce, with an average speed advantage of about 1.67% or 3,420 iterations per\nsecond and 73% of the time performing better. Also, we observed that the more\nthe total particles deployed, the better the performance until a pivotal point.\nFurthermore, a recommendation on taming the excessive use of power by networks,\nlike Bitcoin's, by using penalty by consensus is suggested.",

For efficiency purposes, the interpreter relies on\ncompact bitmap-based encodings of process models. An experimental evaluation\nshows that the proposed interpreted approach achieves comparable or lower costs\nrelative to existing compiled approaches.",

During the\nlast quarters the network size contains about 6 million users (nodes) with\nabout 150 million transactions. From PageRank and CheiRank probabilities,\nanalogous to trade import and export, we determine the dimensionless trade\nbalance of each user and model the contagion propagation on the network\nassuming that a user goes bankrupt if its balance exceeds a certain\ndimensionless threshold $\\kappa$. We find that the phase transition takes place\nfor $\\kappa<\\kappa_c\\approx0.1$ with almost all users going bankrupt. For\n$\\kappa>0.55$ almost all users remain safe. We find that even on a distance\nfrom the critical threshold $\\kappa_c$ the top PageRank and CheiRank users, as\na house of cards, rapidly drop to the bankruptcy. We attribute this effect to\nstrong interconnections between these top users which we determine with the\nreduced Google matrix algorithm. This algorithm allows to establish efficiently\nthe direct and indirect interactions between top PageRank users. We argue that\nthis study models the contagion on real financial networks.",

Within the architecture, a\nblockchain-based controller manages identity and access control policies and\nserves as a tamper-proof log of access events. In addition, off-chain edge\nnodes store the EHR data and apply policies specified in Abbreviated Language\nFor Authorization (ALFA) to enforce attribute-based access control on EHR data\nin collaboration with the blockchain-based access control logs.

Our C2P2 algorithm is the first algorithm to consider\nthe fact that the price of a cryptocurrency c might depend not only on\nhistorical prices, sentiments, global stock indices, but also on the prices and\npredicted prices of other cryptocurrencies. C2P2 therefore does not predict\ncryptocurrency prices one coin at a time --- rather it uses similarity metrics\nin conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple\ncryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21\ncoins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing\n2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific\nprediction paper from 2018 by 16%. In both cases, C2P2 is the winner on all\ncryptocurrencies considered. Moreover, we experimentally show that the use of\nsimilarity metrics within our C2P2 algorithm leads to a direct improvement for\n20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies ranging from 0.4% to 17.8%. Without the\nsimilarity component, C2P2 still beats competitors on 20 out of 21\ncryptocurrencies considered. We show that all these results are statistically\nsignificant via a Student's t-test with p<1e-5. Check our demo at\nhttps://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/dsail/demos/c2p2",

            "summary": "Smart contract transactions demonstrate issues of performance and correctness\nthat application programmers must work around. Although the blockchain\nconsensus mechanism approaches ACID compliance, use cases that rely on frequent\nstate changes are impractical due to the block publishing interval of $O(10^1)$\nseconds. The effective isolation level is Read-Committed, only revealing state\ntransitions at the end of the block interval. Values read may be stale and not\nmatch program order, causing many transactions to fail when a block is\ncommitted. This paper perceives the blockchain as a transactional data\nstructure, using this analogy in the development of a new algorithm,\nHash-Mark-Set (HMS), that improves transaction throughput by providing a\nRead-Uncommitted view of state variables. HMS creates a directed acyclic graph\n(DAG) from the pending transaction pool. The transaction order derived from the\nDAG is used to provide a Read-Uncommitted view of the data for new\ntransactions, which enter the DAG as they are received. An implementation of\nHMS is provided, interoperable with Ethereum and ready for use in smart\ncontracts. Over a wide range of transaction mixes, HMS is demonstrated to\nimprove throughput. A side product of the implementation is a new technique,\nRuntime Argument Augmentation (RAA), that allows smart contracts to communicate\nwith external data services before submitting a transaction. RAA has use cases\nbeyond HMS and can serve as a lightweight replacement for blockchain oracles.",

We\ncombine our findings with learnings from classical monetary policy, resulting\nin a comprehensive taxonomy of cryptocurrency stabilization. We use our\ntaxonomy to highlight the current state of development from different\nperspectives and show blank spots. For instance, while over 91% of projects\npromote 1-to-1 stabilization targets to external assets, monetary policy\nliterature suggests that the smoothing of short term volatility is often a more\nsustainable alternative. Our taxonomy bridges computer science and economics,\nfostering the transfer of expertise.

            "summary": "Modern malware can take various forms, and has reached a very high level of\nsophistication in terms of its penetration, persistence, communication and\nhiding capabilities. The use of cryptography, and of covert communication\nchannels over public and widely used protocols and services, is becoming a\nnorm. In this work, we start by introducing Resource Identifier Generation\nAlgorithms. These are an extension of a well-known mechanism called Domain\nGeneration Algorithms (DGA), which are frequently employed by cybercriminals\nfor bot management and communication. Our extension allows, beyond DNS, the use\nof other protocols. More concretely, we showcase the exploitation of the\nInterPlanetary file system (IPFS). This is a solution for the \"permanent web\",\nwhich enjoys a steadily growing community interest and adoption. The IPFS is,\nin addition, one of the most prominent solutions for blockchain storage. We go\nbeyond the straightforward case of using the IPFS for hosting malicious\ncontent, and explore ways in which a botmaster could employ it, to manage her\nbots, validating our findings experimentally. Finally, we discuss the\nadvantages of our approach for malware authors, its efficacy and highlight its\nextensibility for other distributed storage services.",

            "summary": "Off-chain protocols (channels) are a promising solution to the scalability\nand privacy challenges of blockchain payments. Current proposals, however,\nrequire synchrony assumptions to preserve the safety of a channel, leaking to\nan adversary the exact amount of time needed to control the network for a\nsuccessful attack. In this paper, we introduce Brick, the first payment channel\nthat remains secure under network asynchrony and concurrently provides correct\nincentives. The core idea is to incorporate the conflict resolution process\nwithin the channel by introducing a rational committee of external parties,\ncalled Wardens. Hence, if a party wants to close a channel unilaterally, it can\nonly get the committee's approval for the last valid state. Brick provides\nsub-second latency because it does not employ heavy-weight consensus. Instead,\nBrick uses consistent broadcast to announce updates and close the channel, a\nlight-weight abstraction that is powerful enough to preserve safety and\nliveness to any rational parties. Furthermore, we consider permissioned\nblockchains, where the additional property of auditability might be desired for\nregulatory purposes. We introduce Brick+, an off-chain construction that\nprovides auditability on top of Brick without conflicting with its privacy\nguarantees. We formally define the properties our payment channel construction\nshould fulfill, and prove that both Brick and Brick+ satisfy them. We also\ndesign incentives for Brick such that honest and rational behavior aligns.\nFinally, we provide a reference implementation of the smart contracts in\nSolidity.",

Compared with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that have\nbeen widely used in blockchain, the consensus mechanism designed on DAG\nstructure (simply called as DAG consensus) can overcome some shortcomings such\nas high resource consumption, high transaction fee, low transaction throughput\nand long confirmation delay. However, the theoretic analysis on the DAG\nconsensus is an untapped venue to be explored. To this end, based on one of the\nmost typical DAG consensuses, Tangle, we investigate the impact of network load\non the performance and security of the DAG-based ledger. Considering unsteady\nnetwork load, we first propose a Markov chain model to capture the behavior of\nDAG consensus process under dynamic load conditions. The key performance\nmetrics, i.e., cumulative weight and confirmation delay are analysed based on\nthe proposed model. Then, we leverage a stochastic model to analyse the\nprobability of a successful double-spending attack in different network load\nregimes. The results can provide an insightful understanding of DAG consensus\nprocess, e.g., how the network load affects the confirmation delay and the\nprobability of a successful attack. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate the\ntrade-off between security level and confirmation delay, which can act as a\nguidance for practical deployment of DAG-based ledgers.",

Moreover, for competitive\nreasons, retailers and manufacturers do not want to disclose their supply\nchains. However, upstream suppliers need to prove that they are part of a\n`stable' supply chain to get their invoices financed, which presents the\nupstream suppliers with huge, and often unsurmountable, obstacles to get the\nnecessary finance to fulfil the next order, or to expand their business. Using\na fictitious supply chain use case, which is based on a real world use case, we\ndemonstrate how these challenges have the potential to be solved by combining\nmore advanced and specialised blockchain technologies with other technologies\nsuch as Artificial Intelligence. We describe how atomic crosschain\nfunctionality can be utilised across private blockchains to retrieve the\ninformation required for an invoice financier to make informed decisions under\nuncertainty, and consider the effect this decision has on the overall stability\nof the supply chain.",

            "summary": "An effective atomic cross-chain swap protocol is introduced by Herlihy\n[Herlihy, 2018] as a distributed coordination protocol in order to exchange\nassets across multiple blockchains among multiple parties. An atomic\ncross-chain swap protocol guarantees; (1) if all parties conform to the\nprotocol, then all assets are exchanged among parties, (2) even if some parties\nor coalitions of parties deviate from the protocol, no party conforming to the\nprotocol suffers a loss, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from\nthe protocol. Herlihy [Herlihy, 2018] invented this protocol by using hashed\ntimelock contracts. A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph D =\n(V,A). Vertex set V denotes a set of parties and arc set A denotes a set of\nproposed asset transfers. Herlihy's protocol uses the graph topology and\nsignature information to set appropriate hashed timelock contracts. The space\ncomplexity of the protocol (i.e., the total number of bits written in the\nblockchains in a swap) is O(|A|^2). The local time complexity of the protocol\n(i.e., the maximum execution time of a contract in a swap to transfer the\ncorresponding asset) is O(|V||L|), where L is a feedback vertex set computed by\nthe protocol. We propose a new atomic cross-chain swap protocol which uses only\nsignature information and improves the space complexity to O(|A||V|) and the\nlocal time complexity to O(|V|).",

            "summary": "Bitcoin is the most successful cryptocurrency so far. This is mainly due to\nits novel consensus algorithm, which is based on proof-of-work combined with a\ncryptographically-protected data structure and a rewarding scheme that\nincentivizes nodes to participate. However, despite its unprecedented success\nBitcoin suffers from many inefficiencies. For instance, Bitcoin's consensus\nmechanism has been proved to be incentive-incompatible, its high reward\nvariance causes centralization, and its hardcoded deflation raises questions\nabout its long-term sustainability.\n  In this work, we revise the Bitcoin consensus mechanism by proposing\nStrongChain, a scheme that introduces transparency and incentivizes\nparticipants to collaborate rather than to compete. The core design of our\nprotocol is to reflect and utilize the computing power aggregated on the\nblockchain which is invisible and \"wasted\" in Bitcoin today. Introducing\nrelatively easy, although important changes to Bitcoin's design enables us to\nimprove many crucial aspects of Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies making it more\nsecure, efficient, and profitable for participants. We thoroughly analyze our\napproach and we present an implementation of StrongChain. The obtained results\nconfirm its efficiency, security, and deployability.",

Although it is clear how currency units are generated and\ntransacted on, it is unclear how to use the infrastructure of permissionless\nblockchains to manage other assets than the blockchain's currency units (e.g.,\ncars, houses, etc). In this paper, we propose a global asset management system\nby unifying permissioned and permissionless blockchains. A governmental\npermissioned blockchain authenticates the registration of end-user assets\nthrough smart contract deployments on a permissionless blockchain. Afterwards,\nend-users can transact on their assets through smart contract function calls\n(e.g., sell a car, rent a room in a house, etc).

Responsibility for executing and validating transactions is\nshifted to only the clients that have an interest in specific transactions\nrelating to blockchain applications that they use. As the core function of the\nconsensus system of a distributed ledger is to order transactions and ensure\ntheir availability, consensus participants do not necessarily need to be\nconcerned with the contents of those transactions. This reduces the problem of\nblock verification to data availability verification, which can be achieved\nprobabilistically with sub-linear complexity, without downloading the whole\nblock. The amount of resources required to reach consensus can thus be\nminimised, as transaction validity rules can be decoupled from consensus rules.\nWe also implement and evaluate several example LazyLedger applications, and\nvalidate that the workload of clients of specific applications does not\nsignificantly increase when the workload of other applications that use the\nsame chain increase.",

This issue arises due\nto the gap between Cryptography and Distributed Systems security, which deals\nwith traditional security problems that ignore the explicit consideration of\nincentives, and Game Theory, which deals best with situations involving\nincentives. With this work, we aim to offer a systematization of the work that\nrelates to this problem, considering papers that blend Game Theory with\nCryptography or Distributed systems and discussing how they can be related.\nThis gives an overview of the available tools, and we look at their (potential)\nuse in practice, in the context of existing blockchain based systems that have\nbeen proposed or implemented.",

            "summary": "Prosumers in many regions are facing reduced feed-in tariffs and currently\nhave no possibility to influence the level of remuneration for the locally\nproduced solar energy. Peer-to-peer communities may offer an alternative to the\nfeed-in tariff model by enabling prosumers to directly sell their solar energy\nto local consumers (possibly at a rate that is beneficial for both consumer and\nprosumer). The Quartierstrom project investigates a transactional energy system\nthat manages the exchange and remuneration of electricity between consumers,\nprosumers and the local electric grid provider in the absence of\nintermediaries. This whitepaper describes the prototypical real-world system\nbeing implemented in the town of Walenstadt, Switzerland, with 37 participating\nhouseholds. The community members of this pilot project pay a reduced tariff\nfor grid usage if the electricity produced by a prosumer is sold to another\ncommunity member, which is located on the same voltage or grid level downstream\na substation1. Such a tariff structure incentivizes local balancing, i.e.\nlocally produced energy can be consumed locally whenever possible to avoid\ncosts from higher grid levels. The blockchain is a novel technology suitable to\nlog the produced and consumed units of energy within a community, making it\npossible to implement market places. In those marketplaces, both prosumers and\nconsumers can indicate a price at which they are willing to sell / buy locally\nproduced solar energy without the intermediation of a utility. The key goals of\nthis project are the assessment of A) the technical, economical and ecological\nfeasibility of a blockchain-based community energy system regarding local\nutilization of solar energy, grid quality and energy efficiency and B)\nresulting dynamics regarding local market prices and user acceptance.",

            "summary": "Although the emergence of the programmable smart contract makes blockchain\nsystems easily embrace a wider range of industrial areas, how to execute smart\ncontracts efficiently becomes a big challenge nowadays. Due to the existence of\nByzantine nodes, the mechanism of executing smart contracts is quite different\nfrom that in database systems, so that existing successful concurrency control\nprotocols in database systems cannot be employed directly. Moreover, even\nthough smart contract execution follows a two-phase style, i.e, the miner node\nexecutes a batch of smart contracts in the first phase and the validators\nreplay them in the second phase, existing parallel solutions only focus on the\noptimization in the first phase, but not including the second phase.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel efficient concurrency control scheme which\nis the first one to do optimization in both phases. Specifically, (i) in the\nfirst phase, we give a variant of OCC (Optimistic Concurrency Control) protocol\nbased on {\\em batching} feature to improve the concurrent execution efficiency\nfor the miner and produce a schedule log with high parallelism for validators.\nAlso, a graph partition algorithm is devised to divide the original schedule\nlog into small pieces and further reduce the communication cost; and (ii) in\nthe second phase, we give a deterministic OCC protocol to replay all smart\ncontracts efficiently on multi-core validators where all cores can replay smart\ncontracts independently. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental\nresults illustrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-art solutions\nsignificantly.",

            "summary": "We present Harvey, an industrial greybox fuzzer for smart contracts, which\nare programs managing accounts on a blockchain. Greybox fuzzing is a\nlightweight test-generation approach that effectively detects bugs and security\nvulnerabilities. However, greybox fuzzers randomly mutate program inputs to\nexercise new paths; this makes it challenging to cover code that is guarded by\nnarrow checks, which are satisfied by no more than a few input values.\nMoreover, most real-world smart contracts transition through many different\nstates during their lifetime, e.g., for every bid in an auction. To explore\nthese states and thereby detect deep vulnerabilities, a greybox fuzzer would\nneed to generate sequences of contract transactions, e.g., by creating bids\nfrom multiple users, while at the same time keeping the search space and test\nsuite tractable. In this experience paper, we explain how Harvey alleviates\nboth challenges with two key fuzzing techniques and distill the main lessons\nlearned. First, Harvey extends standard greybox fuzzing with a method for\npredicting new inputs that are more likely to cover new paths or reveal\nvulnerabilities in smart contracts. Second, it fuzzes transaction sequences in\na targeted and demand-driven way. We have evaluated our approach on 27\nreal-world contracts. Our experiments show that the underlying techniques\nsignificantly increase Harvey's effectiveness in achieving high coverage and\ndetecting vulnerabilities, in most cases orders-of-magnitude faster; they also\nreveal new insights about contract code.",

While the effect\nof SM has been studied mostly in a two-miners scenario, it has not been\ninvestigated in a more practical context where there are multiple malicious\nminers individually performing SM.\n  To fill this gap, we carry out an empirical study that separately accounts\nfor different numbers of SM miners (who always perform SM) and strategic miners\n(who choose either SM or Nakamoto's mining protocol depending on which\nmaximises their individual mining reward).\n  Our result shows that SM is generally more effective as the number of SM\nminers increases, however its effectiveness does not vary in the presence of a\nlarge number of strategic miners. Under specific mining power distributions, we\nalso demonstrate that multiple miners can perform SM and simultaneously gain\nhigher mining rewards than they should. Surprisingly, we also show that the\nmore strategic miners there are, the more robust the systems become. Since\nblockchain miners should naturally be seen as self-interested strategic miners,\nour findings encourage blockchain system developers and engineers to attract as\nmany miners as possible to prevent SM and similar behaviour.",

Then,\nwe discuss the main ideas of two famous consensus mechanisms including Proof of\nWork (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), and list their limitations in IoT. Next,\ntwo mainstream Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) based consensus mechanisms, i.e., the\nTangle and Hashgraph, are reviewed to show why DAG consensus is more suitable\nfor IoT system than PoW and PoS. Potential issues and challenges of DAG based\nconsensus mechanism to be addressed in the future are discussed in the last.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin uses blockchain technology and proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism where\nnodes spend computing resources and earn rewards in return for spending these\nresources. This incentive system has caused power to be significantly biased\ntowards a few nodes, called mining pools. In fact, poor decentralization\nappears not only in PoW-based coins but also in coins adopting other mechanisms\nsuch as proof-of-stake (PoS) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS). In this\npaper, we target this centralization issue. To this end, we first define (m,\n\\varepsilon, \\delta)-decentralization as a state that satisfies 1) there are at\nleast m participants running a node and 2) the ratio between the total resource\npower of nodes run by the richest and \\delta-th percentile participants is less\nthan or equal to 1+\\varepsilon. To see if it is possible to achieve good\ndecentralization, we introduce sufficient conditions for the incentive system\nof a blockchain to reach (m, \\varepsilon, \\delta)-decentralization. When\nsatisfying the conditions, a blockchain system can reach full decentralization\nwith probability 1. However, to achieve this, the blockchain system should be\nable to assign a positive Sybil cost, where the Sybil cost is defined as the\ndifference between the cost for one participant running multiple nodes and the\ntotal cost for multiple participants each running one node. On the other hand,\nwe prove that when there is no Sybil cost, the probability of reaching (m,\n\\varepsilon, \\delta)-decentralization is upper bounded by a value close to 0,\nconsidering a large rich-poor gap. To determine the conditions that each system\ncannot satisfy, we also analyze protocols of all PoW, PoS, and DPoS coins in\nthe top 100 coins according to our conditions. Finally, we conduct data\nanalysis of these coins to validate our theory.",

            "summary": "Recently, graph embedding techniques have been widely used in the analysis of\nvarious networks, but most of the existing embedding methods omit the network\ndynamics and the multiplicity of edges, so it is difficult to accurately\ndescribe the detailed characteristics of the transaction networks. Ethereum is\na blockchain-based platform supporting smart contracts. The open nature of\nblockchain makes the transaction data on Ethereum completely public, and also\nbrings unprecedented opportunities for the transaction network analysis. By\ntaking the realistic rules and features of transaction networks into\nconsideration, we first model the Ethereum transaction network as a Temporal\nWeighted Multidigraph (TWMDG), where each node is a unique Ethereum account and\neach edge represents a transaction weighted by amount and assigned with\ntimestamp. Then we define the problem of Temporal Weighted Multidigraph\nEmbedding (T-EDGE) by incorporating both temporal and weighted information of\nthe edges, the purpose being to capture more comprehensive properties of\ndynamic transaction networks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed\nembedding method, we conduct experiments of node classification on real-world\ntransaction data collected from Ethereum. Experimental results demonstrate that\nT-EDGE outperforms baseline embedding methods, indicating that time-dependent\nwalks and multiplicity characteristic of edges are informative and essential\nfor time-sensitive transaction networks.",

Trying to use traditional IAM systems to reconcile heterogeneous\ndevices and complex federations of online services (e.g., IoT sensors and cloud\ncomputing solutions) adds a cumbersome architectural layer that can become hard\nto maintain and act as a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose\nUniquID, a blockchain-based solution that overcomes the need for centralized\nIAM architectures while providing scalability and robustness. We also present\nthe experimental results of a proof-of-concept UniquID enrolment network, and\nwe discuss two different use-cases that show the considerable value of a\nblockchain-based IAM.",

            "summary": "We present Charlotte, a framework for composable, authenticated distributed\ndata structures. Charlotte data is stored in blocks that reference each other\nby hash. Together, all Charlotte blocks form a directed acyclic graph, the\nblockweb; all observers and applications use subgraphs of the blockweb for\ntheir own data structures. Unlike prior systems, Charlotte data structures are\ncomposable: applications and data structures can operate fully independently\nwhen possible, and share blocks when desired. To support this composability, we\ndefine a language-independent format for Charlotte blocks and a network API for\nCharlotte servers.\n  An authenticated distributed data structure guarantees that data is immutable\nand self-authenticating: data referenced will be unchanged when it is\nretrieved. Charlotte extends these guarantees by allowing applications to plug\nin their own mechanisms for ensuring availability and integrity of data\nstructures. Unlike most traditional distributed systems, including distributed\ndatabases, blockchains, and distributed hash tables, Charlotte supports\nheterogeneous trust: different observers may have their own beliefs about who\nmight fail, and how. Despite heterogeneity of trust, Charlotte presents each\nobserver with a consistent, available view of data.\n  We demonstrate the flexibility of Charlotte by implementing a variety of\nintegrity mechanisms, including consensus and proof of work. We study the power\nof disentangling availability and integrity mechanisms by building a variety of\napplications. The results from these examples suggest that developers can use\nCharlotte to build flexible, fast, composable applications with strong\nguarantees.",

            "published": "2019-05-08T16:22:37Z",
            "summary": "5G mobile networks provide additional benefits in terms of lower latency,\nhigher data rates, and more coverage, in comparison to 4G networks, and they\nare also coming close to standardization. For example, 5G has a new level of\ndata transfer and processing speed that assures users are not disconnected when\nthey move from one cell to another; thus, supporting faster connection.\nHowever, it comes with its own technical challenges relating to resource\nmanagement, authentication handover and user privacy protection. In 5G, the\nfrequent displacement of the users among the cells as a result of repeated\nauthentication handovers often lead to a delay, contradicting the 5G\nobjectives. In this paper, we propose a new authentication approach that\nutilizes blockchain and software defined networking (SDN) techniques to remove\nthe re-authentication in repeated handover among heterogeneous cells. The\nproposed approach is designed to assure the low delay, appropriate for the 5G\nnetwork in which users can be replaced with the least delay among heterogeneous\ncells using their public and private keys provided by the devised blockchain\ncomponent while protecting their privacy. In our comparison between\nProof-of-Work (POW)-based and network-based models, the delay of our\nauthentication handover was shown to be less than 1ms. Also, our approach\ndemonstrated less signaling overhead and energy consumption compared to peer\nmodels.",

            "summary": "As cryptographic tokens and altcoins are increasingly being built to serve as\nutility tokens, the notion of useful work consensus protocols, as opposed to\nnumber-crunching PoW consensus, is becoming ever more important. In such\ncontexts, users get rewards from the network after they have carried out some\nspecific task useful for the network. While in some cases the proof of some\nutility or service can be proved, the majority of tasks are impossible to\nverify. In order to deal with such cases, we design Proof-of-Prestige (PoP) - a\nreward system that can run on top of Proof-of-Stake blockchains. PoP introduces\nprestige which is a volatile resource and, in contrast to coins, regenerates\nover time. Prestige can be gained by performing useful work, spent when\nbenefiting from services and directly translates to users minting power. PoP is\nresistant against Sybil and Collude attacks and can be used to reward workers\nfor completing unverifiable tasks, while keeping the system free for the\nend-users. We use two exemplar use-cases to showcase the usefulness of PoP and\nwe build a simulator to assess the cryptoeconomic behaviour of the system in\nterms of prestige transfer between nodes.",

            "summary": "The recent adoption of blockchain technologies and open permissionless\nnetworks suggest the importance of peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain transaction\nprotocols. Users should be able to atomically exchange tokens and assets\nwithout depending on centralized intermediaries such as exchanges. Recent\npeer-to-peer atomic cross-chain swap protocols use hashlocks and timelocks to\nensure that participants comply to the protocol. However, an expired timelock\ncould lead to a violation of the all-or-nothing atomicity property. An honest\nparticipant who fails to execute a smart contract on time due to a crash\nfailure or network delays at her site might end up losing her assets. Although\na crashed participant is the only participant who ends up worse off, current\nproposals are unsuitable for atomic cross-chain transactions in asynchronous\nenvironments where crash failures and network delays are the norm. In this\npaper, we present AC3WN, the first decentralized all-or-nothing atomic\ncross-chain commitment protocol. The redeem and refund events of the smart\ncontracts that exchange assets are modeled as conflicting events. An open\npermissionless network of witnesses is used to guarantee that conflicting\nevents could never simultaneously occur and either all smart contracts in an\natomic cross-chain transaction are redeemed or all of them are refunded.",

Thus it is\ncritical to ensure they are bug-free and well-designed before deployment. A\nContract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it\nto produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.\nThe detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and\nimprove the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain numerous\ndistinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to\nfind smart contract specified defects. To fill this gap, we collected\nsmart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world\nsmart contracts. We manually analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to\ndefine 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating\npotential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability\nproblems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we\ncreated an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different\ncountries. Feedback showed these contract defects are harmful and removing them\nwould improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts. We manually\nidentified our defined contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and\npublicly released our dataset. Finally, we summarized 5 impacts caused by\ncontract defects. These help developers better understand the symptoms of the\ndefects and removal priority.",

            "summary": "Several IoT applications are tightly dependent on the locations of the\ndevices. However, localization algorithms can be easily compromised by\ninjecting false locations. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based secure\nlocalization algorithm for the Internet of Things (IoT). The algorithm uses a\npublic ledger (Blockchain) that contains nodes position and the list of their\nneighbor nodes. This ledger is shared among the IoT devices. Once an IoT device\nis localized its new position and the list of neighbor nodes are added to the\nBlockchain. This shared localization data will be used later by other IoT\ndevices for their localization process. To avoid the attack where a malicious\nnode sends a fake position, the correctness of the claimed position are\nverified before adding it to the Blockchain. Moreover, data exchanged between\nnodes (IoT devices) are signed to guarantee their authenticity and integrity.\nThe integration of these security mechanisms into the localization process\npermits to exclude false data and therefore reduces the localization error. The\nsimulation results show that adding the proposed security mechanism improves\nthe localization accuracy of the algorithm when running in the presence of\nmalicious nodes.",

We first discuss opportunities and challenges in the integration of\nblockchain and biometrics, with emphasis in biometric template storage and\nprotection, a key problem in biometrics still largely unsolved. Blockchain\ntechnologies provide excellent architectures and practical tools for securing\nand managing the sensitive and private data stored in biometric templates, but\nat a cost. We explore experimentally the key tradeoffs involved in that\nintegration, namely: latency, processing time, economic cost, and biometric\nperformance. We experimentally study those factors by implementing a smart\ncontract on Ethereum for biometric template storage, whose cost-performance is\nevaluated by varying the complexity of state-of-the-art schemes for face and\nhandwritten signature biometrics. We report our experiments using popular\nbenchmarks in biometrics research, including deep learning approaches and\ndatabases captured in the wild. As a result, we experimentally show that\nstraightforward schemes for data storage in blockchain (i.e., direct and\nhash-based) may be prohibitive for biometric template storage using\nstate-of-the-art biometric methods. A good cost-performance tradeoff is shown\nby using a blockchain approach based on Merkle trees.",

            "summary": "The old mantra of decentralizing the Internet is coming again with fanfare,\nthis time around the blockchain technology hype. We have already seen a\ntechnology supposed to change the nature of the Internet: peer-to-peer. The\nreality is that peer-to-peer naming systems failed, peer-to-peer social\nnetworks failed, and yes, peer-to-peer storage failed as well. In this paper,\nwe will review the research on distributed systems in the last few years to\nidentify the limits of open peer-to-peer networks. We will address issues like\nsystem complexity, security and frailty, instability and performance. We will\nshow how many of the aforementioned problems also apply to the recent breed of\npermissionless blockchain networks. The applicability of such systems to mature\nindustrial applications is undermined by the same properties that make them so\ninteresting for a libertarian audience: namely, their openness, their\npseudo-anonymity and their unregulated cryptocurrencies. As such, we argue that\npermissionless blockchain networks are unsuitable to be the substrate for a\ndecentralized Internet. Yet, there is still hope for more decentralization,\nalbeit in a form somewhat limited with respect to the libertarian view of\ndecentralized Internet: in cooperation rather than in competition with the\nsuperpowerful datacenters that dominate the world today. This is derived from\nthe recent surge in interest in byzantine fault tolerance and permissioned\nblockchains, which opens the door to a world where use of trusted third parties\nis not the only way to arbitrate an ensemble of entities. The ability of\nestablish trust through permissioned blockchains enables to move the control\nfrom the datacenters to the edge, truly realizing the promises of edge-centric\ncomputing.",

This\nsystem provides statistical estimates for the economic difficulty of an attack\nand how the presence of certain actors influences protocol-level statistics,\nsuch as the expected time to regain liveness. This simulation system is\ninfluenced by the design of algorithmic trading and reinforcement learning\nsystems that use explicit modeling of an agent's reward mechanism to evaluate\nand optimize a fully autonomous agent. We implement and apply this simulation\nframework to Kadena's Chainweb, a parallelized Proof-of-Work system, that\ncontains complexity in how miner incentive compliance affects security and\ncensorship resistance. We provide the first formal description of Chainweb that\nis in the literature and use this formal description to motivate our simulation\ndesign. Our simulation results include a phase transition in block height\ngrowth rate as a function of shard connectivity and empirical evidence that\ncensorship in Chainweb is too costly for rational miners to engage in.

It adopts a variant of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), named\nfederated Byzantine agreement (FBA), which generalizes the traditional BFT\nalgorithm to make it more suitable for open-membership blockchains. To this\nend, FBA introduces a quorum slice concept, which consists of a set of nodes.\nIn FBA, a node can complete one consensus round when it receives specific\nmessages from nodes in a quorum slice appointed by the node. In this study, we\nanalyze FBA, whose security is highly dependent on the structure of quorum\nslices, and demonstrate that it is not superior to the traditional BFT\nalgorithm in terms of safety and liveness. Then, to analyze the security of the\nStellar consensus protocol (SCP), which is a construction for FBA, we\ninvestigate the current quorum slices in Stellar. We analyze the structure of\nquorum slices and measure the influence of each node quantitatively using two\nmetrics, PageRank (PR) and the newly proposed NodeRank (NR). The results show\nthat the Stellar system is significantly centralized. Thereafter, to determine\nhow the centralized structure can have a negative impact on the Stellar system,\nwe study the cascading failure caused by deleting only a few nodes (i.e.,\nvalidators) in Stellar. We show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run SCP\nif only two nodes fail. To make matters worse, these two nodes are run and\ncontrolled by a single organization, the Stellar foundation.",

First, we describe a novel\ndeep network architecture for computing compact temporal content hashes (TCHs)\nfrom audio-visual streams with durations of minutes or hours. Our TCHs are\nsensitive to accidental or malicious content modification (tampering) but\ninvariant to the codec used to encode the video. This is necessary due to the\ncuratorial requirement for archives to format shift video over time to ensure\nfuture accessibility. Second, we describe how the TCHs (and the models used to\nderive them) are secured via a proof-of-authority blockchain distributed across\nmultiple independent archives. We report on the efficacy of ARCHANGEL within\nthe context of a trial deployment in which the national government archives of\nthe United Kingdom, Estonia and Norway participated.",

            "summary": "A bug or error is a common problem that any software or computer program may\nencounter. It can occur from badly writing the program, a typing error or bad\nmemory management. However, errors can become a significant issue if the unsafe\nprogram is used for critical systems. Therefore, formal methods for these kinds\nof systems are greatly required. In this paper, we use a formal language that\nperforms deductive verification on an Ethereum Blockchain application based on\nsmart contracts, which are self-executing digital contracts. Blockchain systems\nmanipulate cryptocurrency and transaction information. Therefore , if a bug\noccurs in the blockchain, serious consequences such as a loss of money can\nhappen. Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose a language dedicated to\ndeductive verification, called Why3, as a new language for writing formal and\nverified smart contracts, thereby avoiding attacks exploiting such contract\nexecution vulnerabilities. We first write a Why3 smart contracts program; next\nwe formulate specifications to be proved as absence of RunTime Error properties\nand functional properties, then we verify the behavior of the program using the\nWhy3 system. Finally we compile the Why3 contracts to the Ethereum Virtual\nMachine (EVM). Moreover, we give a set of generic mathematical statements that\nallows verifying functional properties suited to any type of smart contracts\nholding cryptocurrency, showing that Why3 can be a suitable language to write\nsmart contracts. To illustrate our approach, we describe its application to a\nrealistic industrial use case.",

In this age\nof heterogeneous systems that integrate different technologies for optimized\nsolution to a specific real world problem, big data system are not an exception\nto any such rule. As far as the storage aspect of any big data system is\nconcerned, the primary facet in this regard is a storage infrastructure and\nNoSQL seems to be the right technology that fulfills its requirements. However,\nevery big data application has variable data characteristics and thus, the\ncorresponding data fits into a different data model. This paper presents\nfeature and use case analysis and comparison of the four main data models\nnamely document oriented, key value, graph and wide column. Moreover, a feature\nanalysis of 80 NoSQL solutions has been provided, elaborating on the criteria\nand points that a developer must consider while making a possible choice.\nTypically, big data storage needs to communicate with the execution engine and\nother processing and visualization technologies to create a comprehensive\nsolution. This brings forth second facet of big data storage, big data file\nformats, into picture. The second half of the research paper compares the\nadvantages, shortcomings and possible use cases of available big data file\nformats for Hadoop, which is the foundation for most big data computing\ntechnologies.

These sensitive and private data should only be accessed by\nauthorized users. Given a total medical data, users may care about parts of\nthem and other unrelated information might interfere with the user interested\ndata search and increase the risk of exposure. Besides accessing these data,\nusers may want to update them and propagate to other sharing peers so that all\npeers keep identical data after each update. To satisfy these requirements, in\nthis paper we propose a medical data sharing architecture that addresses the\npermission control using smart contracts on the blockchain and splits data into\nfined grained pieces shared with different peers then synchronize full data and\nthese pieces with bidirectional transformations. Medical data reside on each\nuser\\'s local database and permission related data are stored on smart\ncontracts. Only all peers have gained the newest shared data after updates can\nthey start to do next operations on it, which are enforced by smart contracts.\nBlockchain based immutable shared ledge enables users to trace data updates\nhistory.

As a result, we propose a\nnovel model training paradigm based on blockchain, named Galaxy Learning, which\naims to train a model with distributed data and to reserve the data ownership\nfor their owners. In this new paradigm, encrypted models are moved around\ninstead, and are federated once trained. Model training, as well as the\ncommunication, is achieved with blockchain and its smart contracts. Pricing of\ntraining data is determined by its contribution, and therefore it is not about\nthe exchange of data ownership. In this position paper, we describe the\nmotivation, paradigm, design, and challenges as well as opportunities of Galaxy\nLearning.",

            "summary": "Searching for available parking spaces is a major problem for drivers\nespecially in big crowded cities, causing traffic congestion and air pollution,\nand wasting drivers' time. Smart parking systems are a novel solution to enable\ndrivers to have real-time parking information for pre-booking. However, current\nsmart parking requires drivers to disclose their private information, such as\ndesired destinations. Moreover, the existing schemes are centralized and\nvulnerable to the bottleneck of the single point of failure and data breaches.\nIn this paper, we propose a distributed privacy-preserving smart parking system\nusing blockchain. A consortium blockchain created by different parking lot\nowners to ensure security, transparency, and availability is proposed to store\ntheir parking offers on the blockchain. To preserve drivers' location privacy,\nwe adopt a private information retrieval (PIR) technique to enable drivers to\nretrieve parking offers from blockchain nodes privately, without revealing\nwhich parking offers are retrieved. Furthermore, a short randomizable signature\nis used to enable drivers to reserve available parking slots in an anonymous\nmanner. Besides, we introduce an anonymous payment system that cannot link\ndrivers' to specific parking locations. Finally, our performance evaluations\ndemonstrate that the proposed scheme can preserve drivers' privacy with low\ncommunication and computation overhead.",

            "summary": "It is a common narrative that blockchains are immutable and so it is\ntechnically impossible to erase data stored on them. For legal and ethical\nreasons, however, individuals and organizations might be compelled to erase\nlocally stored data, be it encoded on a blockchain or not. The common\nassumption for blockchain networks like Bitcoin is that forcing nodes to erase\ndata contained on the blockchain is equal to permanently restricting them from\nparticipating in the system in a full-node role. Challenging this belief, in\nthis paper, we propose and demonstrate a pragmatic approach towards\nfunctionality-preserving local erasure (FPLE). FPLE enables full nodes to erase\ninfringing or undesirable data while continuing to store and validate most of\nthe blockchain. We describe a general FPLE approach for UTXO-based (i.e.,\nBitcoin-like) cryptocurrencies and present a lightweight proof-of-concept tool\nfor safely erasing transaction data from the local storage of Bitcoin Core\nnodes. Erasing nodes continue to operate in tune with the network even when\nerased transaction outputs become relevant for validating subsequent blocks.\nUsing only our basic proof-of-concept implementation, we are already able to\nsafely comply with a significantly larger range of erasure requests than, to\nthe best of our knowledge, any other full node operator so far.",

Similar to Bitcoin, Steemit is operated by a decentralized\ncommunity, where 21 members are periodically elected to cooperatively operate\nthe platform through the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol.\nOur study performed on 539 million operations performed by 1.12 million Steemit\nusers during the period 2016/03 to 2018/08 reveals that the actual level of\ndecentralization in Steemit is far lower than the ideal level, indicating that\nthe DPoS consensus protocol may not be a desirable approach for establishing a\nhighly decentralized social media platform. In Steemit, users create contents\nas posts which get curated based on votes from other users. The platform\nperiodically issues cryptocurrency as rewards to creators and curators of\npopular posts. Although such a reward system is originally driven by the desire\nto incentivize users to contribute to high-quality contents, our analysis of\nthe underlying cryptocurrency transfer network on the blockchain reveals that\nmore than 16% transfers of cryptocurrency in Steemit are sent to curators\nsuspected to be bots and also finds the existence of an underlying supply\nnetwork for the bots, both suggesting a significant misuse of the current\nreward system in Steemit.

Smart contracts are used to specify data usage policy,\ni.e., who can use what data under which conditions and what analytics to\nperform, while the distributed blockchain ledger is used to keep an\nirreversible and non-repudiable data usage record. To address the efficiency\nproblem of on-chain contract execution and to prevent exposing private data on\nthe publicly viewable blockchain, PrivacyGuard incorporates a novel TEE-based\noff-chain contract execution engine along with a protocol to securely commit\nthe execution result onto blockchain. We have built and deployed a prototype of\nPrivacyGuard with Ethereum and Intel SGX.

            "summary": "We study the problem of efficiently disseminating authenticated blockchain\ninformation from blockchain nodes (servers) to Internet of Things (IoT)\ndevices, through a wireless base station (BS). In existing blockchain\nprotocols, upon generation of a new block, each IoT device receives a copy of\nthe block header, authenticated via digital signature by one or more trusted\nservers. Since it relies on unicast transmissions, the required communication\nresources grow linearly with the number of IoT devices. We propose a more\nefficient scheme, in which a single copy of each block header is multicasted,\ntogether with the signatures of servers. In addition, if IoT devices tolerate a\ndelay, we exploit the blockchain structure to amortize the authentication in\ntime, by transmitting only a subset of signature in each block period. Finally,\nthe BS sends redundant information, via a repetition code, to deal with the\nunreliable wireless channel, with the aim of decreasing the amount of feedback\nrequired from IoT devices. Our analysis shows the trade-off between timely\nauthentication of blocks and reliability of the communication, depending on the\npacket loss rate offered by the channel. The numerical results show that the\nperformance benefits of the proposed scheme makes it a viable starting point\nfor designing new lightweight protocols for blockchains.",

Unlike existing protocols, the ContractChecker uniquely\ndelegates log auditing to the Blockchain, and has the advantages in reducing\nclient cost and lowering requirements on client availability, lending itself to\nmodern scenarios with mobile and web clients.\n  The ContractChecker collects the logs from both clients and the cloud server,\nand verifies the consistency by cross-checking the logs. By this means, it does\nnot only detects the attacks from malicious clients and server forging their\nlogs, but also is able to mitigate those attacks and recover the system from\nthem. In addition, we design new attacks against ContractChecker exploiting\nvarious limits in real Blockchain systems (e.g., write unavailability,\nBlockchain forks, contract race conditions). We analyze and harden the security\nof ContractChecker protocols against the proposed new attacks.\n  For evaluating the cost, we build a functional prototype of the\nContractChecker on Ethereum/Solidity. By experiments on private and public\nEthereum testnets, we extensively evaluate the cost of the ContractChecker in\ncomparison with that of existing client-based log auditing works. The result\nshows the ContractChecker can scale to hundreds of clients and save client\ncosts by more than one order of magnitude.",

Over a billion\ndollars worth of currency has been stolen since its release in July 2015. As\nsmart contracts cannot be updated after deployment, it is imperative that the\nprogramming language supports the development of robust contracts.\n  We propose Flint, a new statically-typed programming language specifically\ndesigned for writing robust smart contracts. Flint's features enforce the\nwriting of safe and predictable code. To encourage good practices, we introduce\nprotection blocks. Protection blocks restrict who can run code and when (using\ntypestate) it can be executed. To prevent vulnerabilities relating to the\nunintentional loss of currency, Flint Asset traits provide safe atomic\noperations, ensuring the state of contracts is always consistent.

Like\nhigh-frequency traders on Wall Street, these bots exploit inefficiencies in\nDEXes, paying high transaction fees and optimizing network latency to frontrun,\ni.e., anticipate and exploit, ordinary users' DEX trades.\n  We study the breadth of DEX arbitrage bots in a subset of transactions that\nyield quantifiable revenue to these bots. We also study bots' profit-making\nstrategies, with a focus on blockchain-specific elements. We observe bots\nengage in what we call priority gas auctions (PGAs), competitively bidding up\ntransaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering, i.e., early block\nposition and execution, for their transactions. PGAs present an interesting and\ncomplex new continuous-time, partial-information, game-theoretic model that we\nformalize and study. We release an interactive web portal, http://frontrun.me/,\nto provide the community with real-time data on PGAs.\n  We additionally show that high fees paid for priority transaction ordering\nposes a systemic risk to consensus-layer security. We explain that such fees\nare just one form of a general phenomenon in DEXes and beyond---what we call\nminer extractable value (MEV)---that poses concrete, measurable,\nconsensus-layer security risks. We show empirically that MEV poses a realistic\nthreat to Ethereum today.\n  Our work highlights the large, complex risks created by transaction-ordering\ndependencies in smart contracts and the ways in which traditional forms of\nfinancial-market exploitation are adapting to and penetrating blockchain\neconomies.",

Therefore we provide a test-suite with\nseveral promising consensus methods (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, Distributed\nProof-of-Work, and Practical Proof-of-Kernel-Work). This is the first work\nanalyzing the communication costs of blockchain consensus methods for knowledge\ndiscovery tasks in resource constraint devices. The experiments reveal that our\nproposed implementations of Distributed Proof-of-Work and Practical\nProof-of-Kernel-Work provide a benefit over Proof-of-Work in CPU usage and\ncommunication costs. The tests show further that in cases of low data rates,\nwhere latencies by mining do not cause harm proposed blockchain implementations\ncould be integrated. However, usage of blockchain requires data broadcasts,\nwhich leads to communication overhead as well as memory requirements based on\nthe address list.",

Scholars have been working on\nenergy conservation of Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning and other\nsystems in buildings. The application of occupant behavior data for building\nenergy optimization has started gaining attention from scholars. However,\noccupant behavior data concerns many aspects of occupants' privacy. Different\ntypes of occupant behavior data contain occupants' private information to\ndifferent levels. It is crucial to conduct privacy protection of occupant\nbehavior data when using occupant behavior for energy conservation. This paper\npresents the aspects of privacy issue when using occupant behavior data, and\nmethods to protect data privacy with blockchain technology. Both two options of\nusing blockchain for privacy protection, sending data records as transactions\nand storing files on the blockchain, are explained and evaluated with\ntemperature records from an open access paper. Sending data as transactions can\nbe used between sensors and local building management system. While storing\nfiles on blockchain can be used for collaboration of different building\nmanagement systems. Advantages, drawbacks, and potentials of using blockchain\nfor data and file transfer are discussed. The results should be helpful for\nusing occupant behavior data for building energy optimization.",

In a robotics environment, the old\ninformation is useful for human evaluation, or oracles interfacing with the\nblockchain but it is not useful for the robots that require only current\ninformation in order to continue their work. This causes a storage problem in\nblockchain nodes that have limited storage capacity, such as in the case of\nnodes attached to robots that are usually built around embedded solutions. This\npaper presents a time-segmentation solution for devices with limited storage\ncapacity, integrated in a particular robot-directed blockchain called\nRobotChain. Results are presented regarding the proposed solution that show\nthat the goal of restricting each node's capacity is reached without\ncompromising all the benefits that arise from the use of blockchains in these\ncontexts, and on the contrary, it allows for cheap nodes to use this\nblockchain, reduces storage costs and allows faster deployment of new nodes.",

As an example, we analyse the flash-crash observed on\n21st June 2017 in the Ethereum platform and show that a major phenomenon of\nsocial coordination led to a catastrophic cascade of events across several\ninterconnected systems. We propose the concept of ``emergent centralisation''\nto describe situations where a single system becomes critically important for\nthe functioning of the whole ecosystem, and argue that such situations are\nlikely to become more and more frequent in interconnected socio-technical\nsystems. We anticipate that the systemic approach we propose will have\nimplications for future assessments of trustless systems and call for the\nattention of policy-makers on the fragility of our interconnected and rapidly\nchanging world.",

As the complexity of such data ecosystems increases, and in\nturn leads to the generation of new reusable assets, it becomes ever more\ndifficult to track data usage, and to maintain a clear view on where data in a\nsystem has originated and makes onward contributions. Reliable traceability on\ndata usage is needed for accountability, both in demonstrating the right to use\ndata, and having assurance that the data is as it is claimed to be. Society is\ndemanding more accountability in data-driven and artificial intelligence\nsystems deployed and used commercially and in the public sector. This paper\nintroduces the conceptual design of a model for data traceability based on a\nBill of Materials scheme, widely used for supply chain traceability in\nmanufacturing industries, and presents details of the architecture and\nimplementation of a gateway built upon the model. Use of the gateway is\nillustrated through a case study, which demonstrates how data and artifacts\nused in an experiment would be defined and instantiated to achieve the desired\ntraceability goals, and how blockchain technology can facilitate accurate\nrecordings of transactions between contributors.",

Among various core components, consensus protocol is the defining\ntechnology behind the security and performance of blockchain. From incremental\nmodifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative alternative\nconsensus mechanisms, many consensus protocols have been proposed to improve\nthe performance of the blockchain network itself or to accommodate other\nspecific application needs.\n  In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis on the\nstate-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To facilitate the discussion\nof our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant results in\nthe classic theory of fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for\nfurther discussion. We identify five core components of a blockchain consensus\nprotocol, namely, block proposal, block validation, information propagation,\nblock finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain\nconsensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic\nabstractions and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are\nanalyzed using the five-component framework and compared with respect to\ndifferent performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide us new\ninsights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their\nsuitable application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance,\nscalability, drawbacks and trade-offs. We believe this survey will provide\nblockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive view on the\nstate-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing\nfuture protocols.",

There are many such\nmechanisms, each with substantially different methodologies and guarantees on\ncommunication complexity, resource usage, and fairness. In this paper, we\nillustrate that, despite these implementation-level differences, there are\nstrong statistical similarities between committee selection mechanisms. We\nconcretely show this by proving that the committee selection of the Avalanche\nconsensus protocol can be used to choose committees in the Stellar Consensus\nProtocol that satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for Byzantine\nagreement. We also verify these claims using simulations and numerically\nobserve sharp phase transitions as a function of protocol parameters.

            "summary": "In this paper, we develop a more general framework of block-structured Markov\nprocesses in the queueing study of blockchain systems, which can provide\nanalysis both for the stationary performance measures and for the sojourn times\nof any transaction and block. Note that an original aim of this paper is to\ngeneralize the two-stage batch-service queueing model studied in Li et al.\n\\cite{Li:2018} both ``from exponential to phase-type\" service times and ``from\nPoisson to MAP\" transaction arrivals. In general, the MAP transaction arrivals\nand the two stages of PH service times make our blockchain queue more suitable\nto various practical conditions of blockchain systems with crucial random\nfactors, for example, the mining processes, the block-generations, the\nblockchain-building and so forth. For such a more general blockchain queueing\nmodel, we focus on two basic research aspects: (1) By using the\nmatrix-geometric solution, we first obtain a sufficient stable condition of the\nblockchain system. Then we provide simple expressions for the average number of\ntransactions in the queueing waiting room, and the average number of\ntransactions in the block. (2) However, comparing with Li et al.\n\\cite{Li:2018}, analysis of the transaction-confirmation time becomes very\ndifficult and challenging due to the complicated blockchain structure. To\novercome the difficulties, we develop a computational technique of the first\npassage times by means of both the PH distributions of infinite sizes and the\n$RG$-factorizations. Finally, we hope that the methodology and results given in\nthis paper will open a new avenue to queueing analysis of more general\nblockchain systems in practice, and can motivate a series of promising future\nresearch on development of lockchain technologies.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we systematically explore the attack surface of the Blockchain\ntechnology, with an emphasis on public Blockchains. Towards this goal, we\nattribute attack viability in the attack surface to 1) the Blockchain\ncryptographic constructs, 2) the distributed architecture of the systems using\nBlockchain, and 3) the Blockchain application context. To each of those\ncontributing factors, we outline several attacks, including selfish mining, the\n51% attack, Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attacks, consensus delay (due to selfish behavior or distributed\ndenial-of-service attacks), Blockchain forks, orphaned and stale blocks, block\ningestion, wallet thefts, smart contract attacks, and privacy attacks. We also\nexplore the causal relationships between these attacks to demonstrate how\nvarious attack vectors are connected to one another. A secondary contribution\nof this work is outlining effective defense measures taken by the Blockchain\ntechnology or proposed by researchers to mitigate the effects of these attacks\nand patch associated vulnerabilities",

            "summary": "Machine Learning systems rely on data for training, input and ongoing\nfeedback and validation. Data in the field can come from varied sources, often\nanonymous or unknown to the ultimate users of the data. Whenever data is\nsourced and used, its consumers need assurance that the data accuracy is as\ndescribed, that the data has been obtained legitimately, and they need to\nunderstand the terms under which the data is made available so that they can\nhonour them. Similarly, suppliers of data require assurances that their data is\nbeing used legitimately by authorised parties, in accordance with their terms,\nand that usage is appropriately recompensed. Furthermore, both parties may want\nto agree on a specific set of quality of service (QoS) metrics, which can be\nused to negotiate service quality based on cost, and then receive affirmation\nthat data is being supplied within those agreed QoS levels. Here we present a\nconceptual architecture which enables data sharing agreements to be encoded and\ncomputationally enforced, remuneration to be made when required, and a trusted\naudit trail to be produced for later analysis or reproduction of the\nenvironment. Our architecture uses blockchain-based distributed ledger\ntechnology, which can facilitate transactions in situations where parties do\nnot have an established trust relationship or centralised command and control\nstructures. We explore techniques to promote faith in the accuracy of the\nsupplied data, and to let data users determine trade-offs between data quality\nand cost. Our system is exemplified through consideration of a case study using\nmultiple data sources from different parties to monitor traffic levels in urban\nlocations.",

            "summary": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives control of personal data\nback to the owners by appointing higher requirements and obligations on service\nproviders who manage and process personal data. As the verification of\nGDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is irregularly conducted;\nit is challenging to be certified that a service provider has been continuously\nadhering to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to\nperceive whether a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively\nprotects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design concept for\ndeveloping a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the\nemerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform\nare to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data\nowners for processing personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and\ntransparency by leveraging advanced features of the blockchain technology. The\nplatform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures only\ndesignated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in\nan immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography\ntechniques. By honestly participating in the platform, a service provider can\nbe endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant;\notherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by\nassociated parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the\nproposed design concept by developing a profile management platform implemented\non top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain framework, following\nby valuable analysis and discussion.",

            "summary": "To participate in the distributed consensus of permissionless blockchains,\nprospective nodes -- or miners -- provide proof of designated, costly\nresources. However, in contrast to the intended decentralization, current data\non blockchain mining unveils increased concentration of these resources in a\nfew major entities, typically mining pools. To study strategic considerations\nin this setting, we employ the concept of Oceanic Games, Milnor and Shapley\n(1978). Oceanic Games have been used to analyze decision making in corporate\nsettings with small numbers of dominant players (shareholders) and large\nnumbers of individually insignificant players, the ocean. Unlike standard\nequilibrium models, they focus on measuring the value (or power) per entity and\nper unit of resource} in a given distribution of resources. These values are\nviewed as strategic components in coalition formations, mergers and resource\nacquisitions. Considering such issues relevant to blockchain governance and\nlong-term sustainability, we adapt oceanic games to blockchain mining and\nillustrate the defined concepts via examples. The application of existing\nresults reveals incentives for individual miners to merge in order to increase\nthe value of their resources. This offers an alternative perspective to the\nobserved centralization and concentration of mining power. Beyond numerical\nsimulations, we use the model to identify issues relevant to the design of\nfuture cryptocurrencies and formulate prospective research questions.",

            "summary": "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks have emerged as a new technology in modern\nelectric power transmission networks. It allows bi-directional flow of\ncommunication and electricity between electric vehicles (EVs) and the Smart\nGrid (SG), in order to provide more sophisticated energy trading. However, due\nto the involvement of a huge amount of trading data and the presence of\nuntrusted entities in the visiting networks, the underlying V2G infrastructure\nsuffers from various security and privacy challenges. Although, several\nsolutions have been proposed in the literature to address these problems,\nissues like lack of mutual authentication and anonymity, incapability to\nprotect against several attack vectors, generation of huge overhead, and\ndependency on centralized infrastructures make security and privacy issues even\nmore challenging. To address the above mentioned problems, in this paper, we\npropose a blockchain oriented hierarchical authentication mechanism for\nrewarding EVs. The overall process is broadly classified into the following\nphases: 1) System Initialization, 2) Registration, 3) Hierarchical Mutual\nAuthentication, and 4) Consensus; wherein blockchain's distributed ledger has\nbeen employed for transaction execution in distributed V2G environments while\nElliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has been used for hierarchical\nauthentication. The designed hierarchical authentication mechanism has been\nemployed to preserve the anonymity of EVs and support mutual authentication\nbetween EVs, charging stations (CSs) and the central aggregator (CAG).\nAdditionally, it also supports minimal communicational and computational\noverheads on resource constrained EVs. Further, formal security verification of\nthe proposed scheme on widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet\nSecurity Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool validates its safeness\nagainst different security attacks.",

Due to the tremendous growth\nof various vehicular applications, a huge amount of data is generated through\nadvanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve driving safety and\nenhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in\napplications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize\nthe potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication\nand computation need to be addressed. In this direction, vehicular fog\ncomputing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing to\nconventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm\nthat has the potential to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by\npushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources, storage, and application\nservices) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable\ntransmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks\nin order to ensure the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction,\nseveral authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the literature but most\nof them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization, anonymity, and\ntrust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and\nkey-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)\nis proposed in this paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used\nfor maintaining the network information while the highly secure ECC is employed\nfor mutual authentication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs).\nAdditionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the\nconsidered VFC setup. The performance evaluation results against the existing\nstate-of-the-art reveal that the proposed scheme accomplishes enhanced security\nfeatures.",

            "summary": "As an append-only distributed database, blockchain is utilized in a vast\nvariety of applications including the cryptocurrency and Internet-of-Things\n(IoT). The existing blockchain solutions have downsides in communication and\nstorage efficiency, convergence to centralization, and consistency problems. In\nthis paper, we propose LightChain, which is the first blockchain architecture\nthat operates over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) of participating peers.\nLightChain is a permissionless blockchain that provides addressable blocks and\ntransactions within the network, which makes them efficiently accessible by all\nthe peers. Each block and transaction is replicated within the DHT of peers and\nis retrieved in an on-demand manner. Hence, peers in LightChain are not\nrequired to retrieve or keep the entire blockchain. LightChain is fair as all\nof the participating peers have a uniform chance of being involved in the\nconsensus regardless of their influence such as hashing power or stake.\nLightChain provides a deterministic fork-resolving strategy as well as a\nblacklisting mechanism, and it is secure against colluding adversarial peers\nattacking the availability and integrity of the system. We provide mathematical\nanalysis and experimental results on scenarios involving 10K nodes to\ndemonstrate the security and fairness of LightChain. As we experimentally show\nin this paper, compared to the mainstream blockchains like Bitcoin and\nEthereum, LightChain requires around 66 times less per node storage, and is\naround 380 times faster on bootstrapping a new node to the system, while each\nLightChain node is rewarded equally likely for participating in the protocol.",

In our framework, a multi-threaded miner\nconstructs a Block Graph (BG), capturing the object-conflicts relations between\nSCTs, and stores it in the block. Later, validators re-execute the same SCTs\nconcurrently and deterministically relying on this BG.\n  A malicious miner can modify the BG to harm the blockchain, e.g., to cause\ndouble-spending. To identify malicious miners, we propose Smart Multi-threaded\nValidator (SMV). Experimental analysis shows that the proposed multi-threaded\nminer and validator achieve significant performance gains over state-of-the-art\nSCT execution framework.",

By using\ninexpensive modular components and open source software, we lower the barrier\nfor participation in open science projects. We show how time series of\nmeasurement values using sensors, e.g., temperature, current, and vibration\nmeasurements, can be verifiably and immutably stored.

Currently, news publishers are collecting news from their correspond-ents\nthrough social networks, email, phone call, fax etc. and sometimes they buy\nnews from the agencies. However, the existing news sharing networks may not\nprovide security for data integrity and any third party may obstruct the\nregular flow of news sharing. Moreover, the existing news schemes are very\nvulnerable in case of disclosing the identity. Therefore, a universal platform\nis needed in the era of globalization where anyone can share and trade news\nfrom anywhere in the world securely, without the interference of third-party,\nand without disclosing the identity of an individual. Recently, blockchain has\ngained popularity because of its security mechanism over data, identity, etc.\nBlockchain enables a distrib-uted way of managing transactions where each\nparticipant of the network holds the same copy of the transactions. Therefore,\nwith the help of pseudonymity, fault-tolerance, immutability and the\ndistributed structure of blockchain, a scheme (termed as NEWSTRADCOIN) is\npresented in this paper in which not only news can be shared securely but also\nanyone can earn money by selling news.

To find how\ndistributed ledgers solve existing problems, this study looks for blockchain\nframeworks in the academic world. Identifying the existing frameworks can\ndemonstrate where the interest in the technology exists and where it can be\nmiss-ing. This study encountered several blockchain frameworks in development.\nHowever, there are few references to operational needs, testing, and deploy of\nthe technology. With the widespread use of the technology, either integrating\nwith pre-existing solutions, replacing legacy systems, or new implementations,\nthe need for testing, deploying, exploration, and maintenance is expected to\nin-tensify.",

            "summary": "One decade ago, Bitcoin was introduced, becoming the first cryptocurrency and\nestablishing the concept of \"blockchain\" as a distributed ledger. As of today,\nthere are many different implementations of cryptocurrencies working over a\nblockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However, many of them\nshare one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation\nof blocks (mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work\nscheme often consists in the resolution of a cryptography problem, most\ncommonly breaking a hash value, which can only be achieved through brute-force.\nThe main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously large\namounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the\ncurrency. In this paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a\nproof-of-useful-work scheme to support a cryptocurrency running over a\nblockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme requires\ntraining deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance\nof such model exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to\nverify the models delivered by miners in an easy way (certainly much more\nefficiently than the mining process itself), determining when a block is to be\ngenerated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for\nrewarding users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a\ntheoretical dissertation on how the mechanics of the system could be\narticulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access to artificial\nintelligence.",

Massive electric power and computing resources,\nincluding CPU, RAM, storage and sensors have been wasted to run blockchain\nnetwork based on these consensus protocols.

Hyperledger Fabric\nimplements a PBFT consensus in order to maintain a non forking blockchain at\nthe application level. We deployed this framework over an area network between\nFrance and Germany in order to evaluate its performance when potentially large\nnetwork delays are observed. Overall we found that when network delay increases\nsignificantly (i.e. up to 3.5 seconds at network layer between two clouds), we\nobserved that the blocks added to our blockchain had up to 134 seconds offset\nafter 100 th block from one cloud to another. Thus by delaying block\npropagation, we demonstrated that Hyperledger Fabric does not provide\nsufficient consistency guaranties to be deployed in critical environments.

Currently, identity federation is the most useful solution to overcome\nthe aforementioned issues and simplify the user experience by allowing\nefficient authentication mechanisms and use of identity information from data\ndistributed across multiple domains. However, this approach creates\nconsiderable complexity in managing trust relationships for both the cloud\nservice providers and their clients.

To protect against\nsuch faults while retaining the PoS selection and reward allocation schemes, we\nstudy weighted voting in validator committees. We formalize the block creation\nprocess and introduce validators' voting profiles which we update by a\nmultiplicative weights algorithm relative to validators' voting behavior and\naggregate blockchain rewards. Using this framework, we leverage weighted\nmajority voting rules that optimize collective decision making to show, both\nnumerically and analytically, that the consensus mechanism is more robust if\nvalidators' votes are appropriately scaled.

            "summary": "Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus exhibits higher throughput in\ncomparison to Proof of Work (PoW) in blockchains. But BFT-based protocols\nsuffer from scalability problems with respect to the number of replicas in the\nnetwork. The main reason for this limitation is the quadratic message\ncomplexity of BFT protocols. Previously, proposed solutions improve BFT\nperformance for normal operation, but will fall back to quadratic message\ncomplexity once the protocol observes a certain number of failures. This makes\nthe protocol performance unpredictable as it is not guaranteed that the network\nwill face a a certain number of failures.\n  As a result, such protocols are only scalable when conditions are favorable\n(i.e., the number of failures are less than a given threshold). To address this\nissue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a\nsubset of nodes $c$ as a root committee. Proteus guarantees stable performance,\nregardless of the number of failures in the network and it improves on the\nquadratic message complexity of typical BFT-based protocols to $O(cn)$, where\n$c<<n$, for large $n$.\n  Thus, message complexity remains small and less than quadratic when $c$ is\nasymptotically smaller than $n$, and this helps the protocol to provide stable\nperformance even during the view change process (change of root committee). Our\nview change process is different than typical BFT protocols as it replaces the\nwhole root committee compared to replacing a single primary in other protocols.\nWe deployed and tested our protocol on $200$ Amazon $EC2$ instances, with two\ndifferent baseline BFT protocols (PBFT and Bchain) for comparison. In these\ntests, our protocol outperformed the baselines by more than $2\\times$ in terms\nof throughput as well as latency.",

            "summary": "The blockchain technology enables mutually untrusting participants to reach\nconsensus on the state of a distributed and decentralized ledger (called a\nblockchain) in a permissionless setting. The consensus protocol of the\nblockchain imposes a unified view of the system state over the global network,\nand once a block is stable in the blockchain, its data is visible to all users\nand cannot be retrospectively modified or removed. Due to these properties, the\nblockchain technology is regarded as a general consensus infrastructure and\nbased on which a variety of systems have been built. This article presents a\nstudy and survey of permissionless blockchain systems in the context of secure\nlogging. We postulate the most essential properties required by a secure\nlogging system and by considering a wide range of applications, we give\ninsights into how the blockchain technology matches these requirements. Based\non the survey, we motivate related research perspectives and challenges for\nblockchain-based secure logging systems, and we highlight potential solutions\nto some specific problems.",

            "summary": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology intended at implementing secure\ndecentralized distributed systems, in which transactional data can be shared,\nstored and verified by participants of a system using cryptographic and\nconsensus mechanisms, elevating the need for a central\nauthentication/verification authority. Contrary to the belief, blockchain-based\nsystems are not inherently secure by design; it is crucial for security\nsoftware engineers to be aware of the various blockchain specific architectural\ndesign decisions and choices and their consequences on the dependability of the\nsoftware system. We argue that sub-optimal and ill-informed design decisions\nand choices of blockchain components and their configurations including smart\ncontracts, key management, cryptographic and consensus mechanisms, on-chain vs.\noff chain storage choices can introduce security technical debt into the\nsystem. The technical debt metaphor can serve as a powerful tool for early,\npreventive and transparent evaluation of the security design of\nblockchain-based systems by making the potential security technical debt\nvisible to security software engineers. We review the core architectural\ncomponents of blockchain-based systems and we show how the ill-choice or\nsub-optimal design decisions and configuration of these components can manifest\ninto security technical debt. We contribute to a taxonomy that classifies the\nblockchain specific design decisions and choices and we describe their\nconnection to potential debts. The taxonomy can help architects of this\ncategory of systems avoid potential security risks by visualising the security\ntechnical debts and raising its visibility. We use examples from two case\nstudies to discuss the taxonomy and its application.",

            "summary": "Public blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin provide transparency and\naccountability, and have strong non-repudiation properties, but fall far short\nof enterprise privacy requirements for business processes. Consequently\nconsortiums are exploring private blockchains to keep their membership and\ntransactions private. However, private blockchains do not provide adequate\nprotection against potential collusion by consortium members to revert the\nstate of the blockchain. To countenance this, the private blockchain state may\nbe \"pinned\" to a tamper resistant public blockchain. Existing solutions\noffering pinning to the public blockchain would reveal the transaction rate of\nthe private blockchain, and do not provide a mechanism to contest the validity\nof a pin. Moreover, they require that all transactions and members of the\nprivate blockchain be revealed. These challenges are hampering the wider\nadoption of private blockchain technology. We describe the primary author's\n`Anonymous State Pinning approach', which overcomes these limitations and\npresent a security proof to demonstrate pins can be challenged without\ncompromising these properties. We perform a gas cost analysis of the\nimplementation to estimate the operating cost of this technology, which shows\nthat pinning a private blockchain at the rate of one pin per hour would cost\nUS$508 per year. A hierarchical pinning approach is proposed which would allow\nmany private blockchains to pin to a management blockchain which would then pin\nto Ethereum MainNet. This approach saves money, but at the cost of increased\nfinality times.",

We design two approaches, the first where the commit\norder for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second\nwhere transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order\nwhile the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot\nisolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent\nand respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of\nSSI based on block height for the latter approach.

It\nwas well understood that a successful DS attack is established when the\nproportion of computing power an attacker possesses is higher than that the\nhonest network does. What is not yet well understood is how threatening a DS\nattack with less than 50% computing power used can be. Namely, DS attacks at\nany proportion can be of a threat as long as the chance to making a good profit\nexists. Profit is obtained when the revenue from making a successful DS attack\nis greater than the cost of carrying out one. We have developed a novel\nprobability theory for calculating a finite time attack probability. This can\nbe used to size up attack resources needed to obtain the profit. The results\nenable us to derive a sufficient and necessary condition on the value of a\ntransaction targeted by a DS attack. Our result is quite surprising: we\ntheoretically show that DS attacks at any proportion of computing power can be\nmade profitable. Given one's transaction size, the results can also be used to\nassess the risk of a DS attack. An example of the attack resources is provided\nfor the BitcoinCash network.",

Achieving consensus over a decentralized network poses challenges\nto transaction finality and performance. Currently, the highest-performing\nconsensus algorithms are speculative BFT algorithms, which, however, compromise\non the transaction finality guarantees offered by their non-speculative\ncounterparts.\n  In this paper, we introduce Albatross, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain\nconsensus algorithm that aims to combine the best of both worlds. At its heart,\nAlbatross is a high-performing, speculative BFT algorithm that offers strong\nprobabilistic finality. We complement this by periodically guaranteeing\nfinality through the Tendermint protocol. We prove our protocol to be secure\nunder standard BFT assumptions and analyze its performance both on a\ntheoretical and practical level. For that, we provide an open-source Rust\nimplementation of Albatross. Our real-world measurements support that our\nprotocol has a performance close to the theoretical maximum for single-chain\nProof-of-Stake consensus algorithms.",

In this work, the\ntestbed is used for TES simulation with centralized clearing market,\nhighlighting weaknesses in a centralized system. Additionally, we present a\nblockchain enabled decentralized market solution supported by distributed\ncomputing for TES, which on one hand can alleviate some of the problems that we\nidentify, but on the other hand, may introduce newer issues.

The popularity of blockchain\nnetworks was originated from a crypto-currency to serve as a decentralized and\ntamperproof transaction data ledger. Nowadays, blockchain as the key framework\nin the decentralized public data-ledger, has been applied to a wide range of\nscenarios far beyond crypto-currencies, such as Internet of Things (IoT),\nhealthcare, and insurance. This survey aims to fill the gap between the large\nnumber of studies on blockchain network, where game theory emerges as an\nanalytical tool, and the lack of a comprehensive survey on the game theoretical\napproaches applied in blockchain related issues. In this paper, we review game\nmodels proposed to address common issues in the blockchain network. The issues\ninclude security issues, e.g., selfish mining, majority attack and Denial of\nService (DoS) attack, issues regard mining management, e.g., computational\npower allocation, reward allocation, and pool selection, as well as issues\nregarding blockchain economic and energy trading. Additionally, we discuss\nadvantages and disadvantages of these selected game models and solutions.\nFinally, we highlight important challenges and future research directions of\napplying game theoretical approaches to incentive mechanism design, and the\ncombination of blockchain with other technologies.",

While a service oriented architecture (SOA) has been adopted by IoT\nand cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture\nto provide scalable and extensible services for a distributed IoT based SPS\nsystem. Furthermore, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized\nauthority, which can be a performance bottleneck or single point failure.\nInspired by microservices architecture and blockchain technology, this paper\nproposes a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Microservices Architecture for\nSmart public safety (BlendMAS). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a\nmicroservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data access\ncontrol in an SPS system. The functionality of security services are decoupled\ninto separate containerized microservices that are built using a smart\ncontract, and deployed on edge and fog computing nodes.

The network is hybridised, utilising digital systems for\nsharing and processing classical information combined with a fibre--optic\ninfrastructure and quantum devices for transmitting and processing quantum\ninformation. We deliver an energy efficient interactive mining protocol enacted\nbetween clients and servers which uses quantum information encoded in light and\nremoves the need for trust in network infrastructure. Instead, clients on the\nnetwork need only trust the transparent network code, and that their devices\nadhere to the rules of quantum physics. To demonstrate the energy efficiency of\nthe mining protocol, we elaborate upon the results of two previous experiments\n(one performed over 1km of optical fibre) as applied to this work. Finally, we\naddress some key vulnerabilities, explore open questions, and observe\nforward--compatibility with the quantum internet and quantum computing\ntechnologies.",

            "summary": "The blockchain technology has been changing our daily lives since Bitcoin -\ni.e., the first decentralized cryptocurrency - was invented and released as\nopen-source software by an unidentified person or a group called Satoshi\nNakamoto in 2009. Of many applications which can be implemented based on the\nblockchain, storage is an important one, a notable example of which is the\nInterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a distributed web based on a\npeer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open\nand focuses on public accessible files. To provide a solution for private file\nstorage in the blockchain way, in this paper we propose a Merkle-tree-based\nFile System (MTFS). In MTFS, the blockchain is more than a trust machine; it is\nan abstract of a cluster system. Distributed random nodes form a tree network\ncluster without a central controller to provide a secure private storage\nservice and faster message propagation. Advance proxy re-encryption algorithm\nis applied to guarantee secure file exchanges under permission. Merkle tree\nwill make sure that the files are distributed among the service nodes in a\nbalanced way. The proposed MTFS can be used not only for personal file storage\nand exchange but also for industry requiring mutual trust in file uploading and\ndownloading in making contracts like insurances.",

The search processes\nare independent across the players and the search speeds of players are\nproportional to their computational powers. One concrete application of this\nabstract model is the mining process of proof-of-work type blockchain systems,\nsuch as Bitcoin. Although one's winning probability is believed to be\nproportional to his computational power in previous studies on Bitcoin, we show\nthat it is not the case in the strict sense.\n  Because of the gaps between the winning probabilities and the proportions of\ncomputational powers, the Matthew effect will emerge in the system, where the\nrich get richer and the poor get poorer. In addition, we show that allowing the\nplayers to pool with each other or reducing the number of solutions to the\nproblem may aggravate the Matthew effect and vice versa.",

This lack of randomness is a consequential\nlimitation, given that a wide variety of real-world financial contracts, such\nas casino games and lotteries, depend entirely on randomness. As a result,\nseveral ad-hoc random number generation approaches have been developed to be\nused in smart contracts. These include ideas such as using an oracle or relying\non the block hash. However, these approaches are manipulatable, i.e. their\noutput can be tampered with by parties who might not be neutral, such as the\nowner of the oracle or the miners. We propose a novel game-theoretic approach\nfor generating provably unmanipulatable pseudorandom numbers on the blockchain.\nOur approach allows smart contracts to access a trustworthy source of\nrandomness that does not rely on potentially compromised miners or oracles,\nhence enabling the creation of a new generation of smart contracts that are not\nlimited to being non-probabilistic and can be drawn from the much more general\nclass of probabilistic programs.",

Byzantine processes seek to inflict maximum damage to the system,\nwhile rational processes best-respond to maximise their expected net gains. Our\nsecond contribution is to derive conditions under which consensus properties\nare satisfied or not in equilibrium. When the majority threshold is lower than\nthe proportion of Byzantine processes, invalid blocks are accepted in\nequilibrium. When the majority threshold is large, equilibrium can involve\ncoordination failures , in which no block is ever accepted.

In this study, we propose a novel highly secure distributed\ndynamic state estimation mechanism for wide-area (multi-area) smart grids,\ncomposed of geographically separated subregions, each supervised by a local\ncontrol center. We firstly propose a distributed state estimator assuming\nregular system operation, that achieves near-optimal performance based on the\nlocal Kalman filters and with the exchange of necessary information between\nlocal centers. To enhance the security, we further propose to (i) protect the\nnetwork database and the network communication channels against attacks and\ndata manipulations via a blockchain (BC)-based system design, where the BC\noperates on the peer-to-peer network of local centers, (ii) locally detect the\nmeasurement anomalies in real-time to eliminate their effects on the state\nestimation process, and (iii) detect misbehaving (hacked/faulty) local centers\nin real-time via a distributed trust management scheme over the network. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees regarding the false alarm rates of the proposed\ndetection schemes, where the false alarms can be easily controlled. Numerical\nstudies illustrate that the proposed mechanism offers reliable state estimation\nunder regular system operation, timely and accurate detection of anomalies, and\ngood state recovery performance in case of anomalies.",

Accordingly, we recommend\nagainst using blockchain with unstable consensus for any data whose value is\nlikely to persist beyond the life of the blockchain system.

However, a new trend towards a more\nproactive approach seems to be on the rise, where attackers do not search for\nvulnerable contracts anymore. Instead, they try to lure their victims into\ntraps by deploying seemingly vulnerable contracts that contain hidden traps.\nThis new type of contracts is commonly referred to as honeypots. In this paper,\nwe present the first systematic analysis of honeypot smart contracts, by\ninvestigating their prevalence, behaviour and impact on the Ethereum\nblockchain. We develop a taxonomy of honeypot techniques and use this to build\nHoneyBadger - a tool that employs symbolic execution and well defined\nheuristics to expose honeypots. We perform a large-scale analysis on more than\n2 million smart contracts and show that our tool not only achieves high\nprecision, but is also highly efficient. We identify 690 honeypot smart\ncontracts as well as 240 victims in the wild, with an accumulated profit of\nmore than $90,000 for the honeypot creators.

While most of the work has focused on\ndetecting *vulnerable* contracts, in this paper, we focus on finding how many\nof these vulnerable contracts have actually been *exploited*. We survey the\n23,327 vulnerable contracts reported by six recent academic projects and find\nthat, despite the amounts at stake, only 1.98% of them have been exploited\nsince deployment. This corresponds to at most 8,487 ETH (~1.7 million USD), or\nonly 0.27% of the 3 million ETH (600 million USD) at stake. We explain these\nresults by demonstrating that the funds are very concentrated in a small number\nof contracts which are *not exploitable* in practice.",

            "summary": "The rise of smart contract systems such as Ethereum has resulted in a\nproliferation of blockchain-based decentralized applications including\napplications that store and manage a wide range of data. Current smart\ncontracts are designed to be executed solely by miners and are revealed\nentirely on-chain, resulting in reduced scalability and privacy. In this paper,\nwe discuss that scalability and privacy of smart contracts can be enhanced by\nsplitting a given contract into an off-chain contract and an on-chain contract.\nSpecifically, functions of the contract that involve high-cost computation or\nsensitive information can be split and included as the off-chain contract, that\nis signed and executed by only the interested participants. The proposed\napproach allows the participants to reach unanimous agreement off-chain when\nall of them are honest, allowing computing resources of miners to be saved and\ncontent of the off-chain contract to be hidden from the public. In case of a\ndispute caused by any dishonest participants, a signed copy of the off-chain\ncontract can be revealed so that a verified instance can be created to make\nminers enforce the true execution result. Thus, honest participants have the\nability to redress and penalize any fraudulent or dishonest behavior, which\nincentivizes all participants to honestly follow the agreed off-chain contract.\nWe discuss techniques for splitting a contract into a pair of on/off-chain\ncontracts and propose a mechanism to address the challenges of handling\ndishonest participants in the system. Our implementation and evaluation of the\nproposed approach using an example smart contract demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach in Ethereum.",

They\ninteract with each other through well-defined interfaces to perform financial\ntransactions in a distributed system with no trusted third parties. But these\ninterfaces also provide a favorable setting for attackers, who can exploit\nsecurity vulnerabilities in smart contracts to achieve financial gain.\n  This paper presents SmartScopy, a system for automatic synthesis of\nadversarial contracts that identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a victim\nsmart contract. Our tool explores the space of \\emph{attack programs} based on\nthe Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification of a victim smart contract\nin the Ethereum ecosystem. To make the synthesis tractable, we introduce\n\\emph{summary-based symbolic evaluation}, which significantly reduces the\nnumber of instructions that our synthesizer needs to evaluate symbolically,\nwithout compromising the precision of the vulnerability query. Building on the\nsummary-based symbolic evaluation, SmartScopy further introduces a novel\napproach for partitioning the synthesis search space for parallel exploration,\nas well as a lightweight deduction technique that can prune infeasible\ncandidates earlier. We encoded common vulnerabilities of smart contracts in our\nquery language, and evaluated SmartScopy on the entire data set from etherscan\nwith $>$25K smart contracts. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of\nsummary-based symbolic evaluation and show that SmartScopy outperforms two\nstate-of-the-art smart contracts analyzers, Oyente and Contractfuzz, in terms\nof running time, precision, and soundness. Furthermore, running on recent\npopular smart contracts, SmartScopy uncovers 20 vulnerable smart contracts that\ncontain the recent BatchOverflow vulnerability and cannot be precisely detected\nby existing tools.",

To\nexpress and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on shared binary session types.\nTo control resource usage, Nomos employs automatic amortized resource analysis.\nTo prevent the duplication or deletion of assets, Nomos uses a linear type\nsystem. A monad integrates the effectful session-typed language with a\ngeneral-purpose functional language. Nomos' prototype implementation features\nlinear-time type checking and efficient type reconstruction that includes\nautomatic inference of resource bounds via off-the-shelf linear optimization.\nThe effectiveness of the language is evaluated with case studies about\nimplementing common smart contracts such as auctions, elections, and\ncurrencies. Nomos is completely formalized, including the type system, a cost\nsemantics, and a transactional semantics to instantiate Nomos contracts on a\nblockchain. The type soundness proof ensures that protocols are followed at\nrun-time and that types establish sound upper bounds on the resource\nconsumption, ruling out re-entrancy and out-of-gas vulnerabilities.",

Participants directly make payments through a network\nof payment channels without the overhead of committing onchain transactions.\nRouting is critical to the performance of offchain networks. Existing solutions\nuse either static routing with poor performance or dynamic routing with high\noverhead to obtain the dynamic channel balance information. In this paper, we\npropose Flash, a new dynamic routing solution that leverages the unique\ncharacteristics of transactions in offchain networks to strike a better\ntradeoff between path optimality and probing overhead. By studying the traces\nof real offchain networks, we find that the payment sizes are heavy-tailed, and\nmost payments are highly recurrent. Flash thus differentiates the treatment of\nelephant payments from mice payments. It uses a modified max-flow algorithm for\nelephant payments to find paths with sufficient capacity, and strategically\nroutes the payment across paths to minimize the transaction fees. Mice payments\nare directly sent by looking up a routing table with a few precomputed paths to\nreduce probing overhead. Testbed experiments and data-driven simulations show\nthat Flash improves the success volume of payments by up to 2.3x compared to\nthe state-of-the-art routing algorithm.",

            "summary": "A decentralized application (dapp for short) refers to an application that is\nexecuted by multiple users over a decentralized network. In recent years, the\nnumber of dapp keeps fast growing, mainly due to the popularity of blockchain\ntechnology. Despite the increasing importance of dapps as a typical application\ntype that is assumed to promote the adoption of blockchain, little is known on\nwhat, how, and how well dapps are used in practice. In addition, the insightful\nknowledge of whether and how a traditional application can be transformed to a\ndapp is yet missing. To bridge the knowledge gap, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive empirical study on an extensive dataset of 734 dapps that are\ncollected from three popular open dapp marketplaces, i.e., ethereum, state of\nthe dapp, and DAppRadar. We analyze the popularity of dapps, and summarize the\npatterns of how smart contracts are organized in a dapp. Based on the findings,\nwe draw some implications to help dapp developers and users better understand\nand deploy dapps.",

However, a systematic investigation of the relationship between\nonline attention and market dynamics, across multiple digital currencies, is\nstill lacking. Here, we quantify the interplay between the attention towards\ndigital currencies in Wikipedia and their market performance. We consider the\nentire edit history of currency-related pages, and their view history from July\n2015. First, we quantify the evolution of the cryptocurrency presence in\nWikipedia by analysing the editorial activity and the network of co-edited\npages. We find that a small community of tightly connected editors is\nresponsible for most of the production of information about cryptocurrencies in\nWikipedia. Then, we show that a simple trading strategy informed by Wikipedia\nviews performs better, in terms of returns on investment, than classic baseline\nstrategies for most of the covered period. Our results contribute to the recent\nliterature on the interplay between online information and investment markets,\nand we anticipate it will be of interest for researchers as well as investors.",

Therefore, to bridge the\nfragmented siloed information across global supply chain partners, the\ndiffusion of blockchain (BC) as one of the advanced distributed ledger\ntechnology (DLT) takeover the on-premise legacy systems. Nevertheless, the\nchallenging constraints of blockchain including scalability, accessing off-line\ndata, fee-less microtransactions and many more lead to the third wave of\nblockchain called IOTA. In this paper, we propose a framework for supporting\nprovenance in the electronic supply chain (ECS) by using permissioned IOTA\nledger. Realizing the crucial requirement of trustworthy data, we use Masked\nAuthenticated Messaging (MAM) channel provided by IOTA that allows the SC\nplayers to procure distributed information while keeping confidential trade\nflows, tamper-proof data, and fine-grained accessibility rights. To identify\noperational disruption, we devise a transparent product ledger through\ntransaction data and consignment information to keep track of the complete\nproduct journey at each intermediary step during SC processes.

We present a proof-of-concept design of PoDL\nthat is compatible with the majority of the cryptocurrencies that are based on\nhash-based PoW mechanisms.

Smart contracts permit the implementation of\napplication logic to foster distributed systems that are capable of removing\nintermediaries.

Over time,\nrequirements regarding contract execution may detach from the utilized chain\ndue to contradicting incentives and security or performance issues. To avoid a\nnovel form of lock in effect towards a host blockchain, we introduce a concept\nfor smart contract portability that permits any user to migrate contract logic\nand state between blockchains in a flexible and verifiable manner. As the\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is supported by a multitude of blockchain\nimplementations, it poses a common execution environment for smart contracts.\nWe provide a toolbox that facilitates smart contract portability between\nEVM-compatible blockchains without trust requirements in the entity executing\nthe migration process.

However, most\nof these IoT devices are generally not perfect-by-design even have security\nweaknesses or vulnerabilities. Thus, it is essential to update these IoT\ndevices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of\nthe involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based\non blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these\napproaches could compromise users privacy when updating the IoT devices.\n  In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software\nupdates protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive\nmechanism, as well protects the privacy of involved users. The vendor delivers\nthe updates and it makes a commitment by using a smart contract to provide\nfinancial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to the\nIoT devices. A transmission node gets financial incentive by providing a\nproof-of-delivery. The transmission node uses double authentication preventing\nsignature (DAPS) to carry out the fair exchange to obtain the\nproof-of-delivery. Specifically, the transmission node exchanges an\nattribute-based signature from a IoT device by using DAPS. Then, it uses the\nattribute-based signature as a proof-of-delivery to receive financial\nincentives. Generally, the IoT device has to execute complex computation for an\nattribute-based signature (ABS). It is intolerable for resource limited\ndevices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS)\nscheme to resist the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS\nand the protocol as well. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to\ndemonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol.",

Consequently, decentralized IoT has\nbeen proposed by taking advantage of the emerging technology of Blockchain.\nVoting systems are widely adopted in IoT, such as a leader election in wireless\nsensor networks. Self-tallying voting systems are alternatives to traditional\ncentralized voting systems in decentralized IoT since the traditional ones are\nnot suitable for such scenarios.

Expert observers and artificial intelligence (AI) progression\nmetrics indicate AI will exceed human intelligence within a few decades.\nWhether general AI that exceeds human capabilities (AGI) will be the single\ngreatest boon in history or a disaster is unknown. No proofs exist that AGI\nwill benefit humans or that AGI will not harm or eliminate humans.\n  Objective. I propose a set of logically distinct conceptual components that\nare necessary and sufficient to 1) ensure that most known AGI scenarios will\nnot harm humanity and 2) robustly align AGI values and goals with human values.\n  Methods. By systematically addressing each pathway category to malevolent AI\nwe can induce the methods/axioms required to redress the category.\n  Results and Discussion. Distributed ledger technology (DLT, blockchain) is\nintegral to this proposal, e.g. to reduce the probability of hacking, provide\nan audit trail to detect and correct errors or identify components causing\nvulnerability or failure and replace them or shut them down remotely and/or\nautomatically, and to separate and balance key AGI components via decentralized\napps (dApps). Smart contracts based on DLT are necessary to address evolution\nof AI that will be too fast for human monitoring and intervention.\n  The proposed axioms. 1) Access to technology by market license. 2)\nTransparent ethics embodied in DLT. 3) Morality encrypted via DLT. 4) Behavior\ncontrol structure with values (ethics) at roots. 5) Individual bar-code\nidentification of all critical components. 6) Configuration Item (from business\ncontinuity/disaster recovery planning). 7) Identity verification secured via\nDLT. 8) Smart automated contracts based on DLT. 9) Decentralized applications -\nAI software code modules encrypted via DLT. 10) Audit trail of component usage\nstored via DLT. 11) Social ostracism (denial of societal resources) augmented\nby DLT petitions.",

However, the traditional network of the ground\ncannot meet the requirements of transmission, processing, and storage among\nvehicles. Under this circumstance, integrating space and air nodes into the\nwhole network can provide comprehensive traffic information and reduce the\ntransmission delay. The high mobility and low latency in the Space-Air-Ground\nIntegrated Network (SAGIN) put forward higher requirements for security issues\nsuch as identity authentication, privacy protection, and data security. This\npaper simplifies the Blockchain and proposes an identity authentication and\nprivacy protection scheme based on the Hashchain in the SAGIN. The scheme\nfocuses on the characteristics of the wireless signal to identify and\nauthenticate the nodes. The verification and backup of the records on the block\nare implemented with the distributed streaming platform, Kafka algorithm,\ninstead of the consensus. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the security of this\nscheme. Afterward, the experimental results reveal the delay brought by the\nscheme using the simulation of SUMO, OMNeT++, and Veins.",

Anonymous\ncryptocurrencies are highly essential since users want to preserve their\nprivacy when conducting transactions. However, some users might misbehave with\nthe cover of anonymity such as rampant trafficking and extortion. Thus, it is\nimportant to balance anonymity and accountability of anonymous\ncryptocurrencies. In this paper, we solve this issue by proposing a linkable\ngroup signature (LGS) for signing cryptocurrency transactions, which can be\nused to trace a payer's identity in consortium blockchain based anonymous\ncryptocurrencies, in case the payer tries illegal activities. A payer keeps\nanonymous if he/she behaves honestly. We prove that the proposed scheme\nachieves full-anonymity, full-traceability and linkability in the random\noracle. Implementation of the proposed LGS scheme demonstrates its high\nefficiency thus, can be adopted in anonymous cryptocurrencies in reality.",

The key concept is a token controlled by a cryptographic private\nkey for spending, and represented by a public key for receiving and audit\npurposes. Ownership transfers are authorized with digital signatures and\nrecorded on a ledger visible to numerous participants. Several ways to enhance\nthe privacy of such ledgers have been proposed. In this paper we study two\nmajor techniques to enhance privacy of token transfers with the help of\nimproved cryptography: M\\\"obius and CryptoNote. The comparison is illuminating:\nboth techniques use \"ring signatures\" and some form of \"stealth addressing\" or\nkey derivation techniques, yet each does it in a completely different way.\nM\\\"obius is more recent and operates in a more co-operative way (with\npermission) and is not yet specified at a sufficiently detailed level. Our\nprimary goal is to explore the suitability of these two techniques for\nimproving the privacy of payments on cryptographic ledgers. We explain various\nconflicting requirements and strategic choices which arise when trying to\nconceal the identity of participants and the exact details of transactions in\nour context while simultaneously enabling fast final settlement of tokens with\na reasonable level of liquidity. We show that in these systems, third-party\nobservers see obfuscated settlement. We finish with a summary of explicit\nwarnings and advice for implementors of such systems.",

OXII is designed for workloads with (different degrees of)\ncontention. We then present ParBlockchain, a permissioned blockchain designed\nspecifically in the OXII paradigm. The evaluation of ParBlockchain using a\nseries of benchmarks reveals that its performance in workloads with any degree\nof contention is better than the state of the art permissioned blockchain\nsystems.",

            "summary": "Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are one of the main building blocks for\nsecuring communications over the Internet. Currently, PKIs are under the\ncontrol of centralized authorities, which is problematic as evidenced by\nnumerous incidents where they have been compromised. The distributed, fault\ntolerant log of transactions provided by blockchains and more recently, smart\ncontract platforms, constitutes a powerful tool for the decentralization of\nPKIs. To verify the validity of identity records, blockchain-based identity\nsystems store on chain either all identity records, or, a small (or even\nconstant) sized amount of data to verify identity records stored off chain.\nHowever, as most of these systems have never been implemented, there is little\ninformation regarding the practical implications of each design's tradeoffs.\n  In this work, we first implement and evaluate the only provably secure, smart\ncontract based PKI of [1] on top of Ethereum. This construction incurs\nconstant-sized storage at the expense of computational complexity. To explore\nthis tradeoff, we propose and implement a second construction which, eliminates\nthe need for trusted setup, preserves the security properties of [1] and, as\nillustrated through our evaluation, is the only version with constant-sized\nstate that can be deployed on the live chain of Ethereum. Furthermore, we\ncompare these two systems with the simple approach of most prior works, e.g.,\nthe Ethereum Name Service, where all identity records are stored on the smart\ncontract's state, to illustrate several shortcomings of Ethereum and its cost\nmodel. We propose several modifications for fine tuning the model, which would\nbe useful to be considered for any smart contract platform like Ethereum so\nthat it reaches its full potential to support arbitrary distributed\napplications.",

Prompted by the increasing\ncomplexity of power systems, decentralized IoT solutions are emerging, which\narrange local communities into transactive microgrids. The core functionality\nof these solutions is to provide mechanisms for matching producers with\nconsumers while ensuring system safety. However, there are multiple challenges\nthat these solutions still face: privacy, trust, and resilience. The privacy\nchallenge arises because the time series of production and consumption data for\neach participant is sensitive and may be used to infer personal information.\nTrust is an issue because a producer or consumer can renege on the promised\nenergy transfer. Providing resilience is challenging due to the possibility of\nfailures in the infrastructure that is required to support these market based\nsolutions. In this paper, we develop a rigorous solution for transactive\nmicrogrids that addresses all three challenges by providing an innovative\ncombination of MILP solvers, smart contracts, and publish-subscribe middleware\nwithin a framework of a novel distributed application platform, called\nResilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid.

            "summary": "Over the past five years, the rewards associated with mining Proof-of-Work\nblockchains have increased substantially. As a result, miners are heavily\nincentivized to design and utilize Application Specific Integrated Circuits\n(ASICs) that can compute hashes far more efficiently than existing general\npurpose hardware. Currently, it is difficult for most users to purchase and\noperate ASICs due to pricing and availability constraints, resulting in a\nrelatively small number of miners with respect to total user base for most\npopular cryptocurrencies. In this work, we aim to invert the problem of ASIC\ndevelopment by constructing a Proof-of-Work function for which an existing\ngeneral purpose processor (GPP, such as an x86 IC) is already an optimized\nASIC. In doing so, we will ensure that any would-be miner either already owns\nan ASIC for the Proof-of-Work system they wish to participate in or can attain\none at a competitive price with relative ease. In order to achieve this, we\npresent HashCore, a Proof-of-Work function composed of \"widgets\" generated\npseudo-randomly at runtime that each execute a sequence of general purpose\nprocessor instructions designed to stress the computational resources of such a\nGPP. The widgets will be modeled after workloads that GPPs have been optimized\nfor, for example, the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suite for x86 ICs, in a technique\nwe refer to as inverted benchmarking. We provide a proof that HashCore is\ncollision-resistant regardless of how the widgets are implemented. We observe\nthat GPP designers/developers essentially create an ASIC for benchmarks such as\nSPEC CPU 2017. By modeling HashCore after such benchmarks, we create a\nProof-of-Work function that can be run most efficiently on a GPP, resulting in\na more accessible, competitive, and balanced mining market.",

            "summary": "Recently, enterprises have paid attention to permissioned blockchain (BC),\nwhere business transactions among inter-authorized organizations (forming a\nconsortium) can automatically be executed on the basis of a distributed\nconsensus protocol, and applications of BC have expanded as permissioned BC has\nadopted the features of the smart contract (SC), which is programmable\nuser-defined business logic deployed in BC and executed with the consensus\nprotocol. A single BC-based system will be built across multiple management\ndomains (e.g., the data centers of each organization) having different\noperational policies (e.g., operational procedures, timing, etc.); although\nestablishing system management and operations over BC-based systems (e.g., SC\ninstallation for updates) will be important for production uses, such\nmulti-domain formation will trigger a problem in that executing system\noperations over BC-based systems will become time-consuming and costly due to\nthe difficulty in unifying and/or adjusting operational policies. Toward\nsolving the problem, we propose an operations execution method for BC-based\nsystems; the primary idea is to define operations as a smart contract so that\nunified and synchronized cross-organizational operations can be executed\neffectively by using BC-native features. For the recent BC architecture in\nwhich participating nodes have different types of roles, we designed the\nproposed method as a hybrid architecture characterized with in-BC consensus\nestablishment and execution status management and out-BC operations execution\nfor all types of nodes operated by agents that listen to triggered events\nincluding operational instructions defined in SCs. We implemented a prototype\nwith Hyperledger Fabric v1.2.0. A cost estimation with the prototype shows that\nthe total yearly cost of SC installation operations could be reduced by 74\npercent compared with a manual method.",

Similar to cloud platforms, a single blockchain-based\nsystem may need to serve multiple tenants simultaneously. However, design of\nmulti-tenant blockchain-based systems is challenging to architects in terms of\ndata and performance isolation, as well as scalability. First, tenants must not\nbe able to read other tenants' data and tenants with potentially higher\nworkload should not affect read/write performance of other tenants. Second,\nmulti-tenant blockchain-based systems usually require both scalability for each\nindividual tenant and scalability with number of tenants. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose a scalable platform architecture for multi-tenant\nblockchain-based systems to ensure data integrity while maintaining data\nprivacy and performance isolation. In the proposed architecture, each tenant\nhas an individual permissioned blockchain to maintain their own data and smart\ncontracts. All tenant chains are anchored into a main chain, in a way that\nminimizes cost and load overheads. The proposed architecture has been\nimplemented in a proof-of-concept prototype with our industry partner, Laava ID\nPty Ltd (Laava). We evaluate our proposal in a three-fold way: fulfilment of\nthe identified requirements, qualitative comparison with design alternatives,\nand quantitative analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed\narchitecture can achieve data integrity, performance isolation, data privacy,\nconfiguration flexibility, availability, cost efficiency and scalability.",

These\npermissionless block chains are showing the potential to be disruptive to the\nfinancial services industry. Their broader adoption is likely to be limited by\nthe maximum block size, the cost of the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, and\nthe increasing size of any given chain overwhelming most of the participating\nnodes. These factors have led to many cryptocurrency blockchains to become\ncentralized in the nodes with enough computing power and storage to be a\ndominant miner and validator. Permissioned chains operate in trusted\nenvironments and can, therefore, avoid the computationally expensive consensus\nmechanisms. Permissioned chains are still susceptible to asset storage demands\nand non-standard user interfaces that will impede their adoption. This paper\ndescribes an approach to addressing these limitations: permissioned blockchain\nthat uses off-chain storage of the data assets and this is accessed through a\nstandard browser and mobile app. The implementation in the Hyperledger\nframework is described as is an example use of patient-centered health data\nmanagement.",

Algorand uses an innovative process - called cryptographic\nsortition - to securely and unpredictably elect a set of voters from the\nnetwork periodically. These voters are responsible for reaching consensus\nthrough a Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol on one block per time, guaranteeing\nan overwhelming probability of linearity of the blockchain.\n  In this paper, we present a security analysis of Algorand. To the best of our\nknowledge, it is the first security analysis as well as the first formal study\non Algorand. We designed an attack scenario in which a group of malicious users\ntries to break the protocol, or at least limiting it to a reduced partition of\nnetwork users, by exploiting a possible security flaw in the messages\nvalidation process of the BA. Since the source code or an official simulator\nfor Algorand was not available at the time of our study, we created a simulator\n(which is available on request) to implement the protocol and assess the\nfeasibility of our attack scenario. Our attack requires the attacker to have a\ntrivial capability of establishing multiple connections with targeted nodes and\ncosts practically nothing to the attacker. Our results show that it is possible\nto slow down the message validation process on honest nodes, which eventually\nforces them to choose default values on the consensus; leaving the targeted\nnodes behind in the chain as compared to the non-attacked nodes. Even though\nour results are subject to the real implementation assumption, the core concept\nof our attack remains valid.",

Performing experiments on actual blockchains are\ndifficult because a large number of nodes in wide areas are necessary. In this\nstudy, we developed a blockchain network simulator SimBlock for such\nexperiments. Unlike the existing simulators, SimBlock can easily change\nbehavior of node, so that it enables to investigate the influence of nodes'\nbehavior on blockchains. We compared some simulation results with the measured\nvalues in actual blockchains to demonstrate the validity of this simulator.\nFurthermore, to show practical usage, we conducted two experiments which\nclarify the influence of neighbor node selection algorithms and relay networks\non the block propagation time. The simulator could depict the effects of the\ntwo techniques on block propagation time. The simulator will be publicly\navailable in a few months.",

LN is based upon a\nnetwork of micro-channels opened and closed by issuing transactions on the\nBlockchain and capable to interact among themselves thanks to the Multi-hop\nframework. In this work I analysed the evolution of LN from its topological\npoint of view and tried to understand how it impacts over some of Bitcoin's\nhistorical core foundamentals such as the resilience against attacks and\nfailures and the user's anonymity.

Since the first success in financial sector, blockchain has\nshown great potentials in various domains, e.g., internet of things and mobile\nnetworks. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based architecture for\ncontent delivery networks (B-CDN), which exploits the advances of the\nblockchain technology to provide a decentralized and secure platform to connect\ncontent providers (CPs) with users. On one hand, the proposed B-CDN will\nleverage the registration and subscription of the users to different CPs, while\nguaranteeing the user privacy thanks to virtual identity provided by the\nblockchain network. On the other hand, the B-CDN creates a public immutable\ndatabase of the requested contents (from all CPs), based on which each CP can\nbetter evaluate the user preference on its contents. The benefits of B-CDN are\ndemonstrated via an edge-caching application, in which a feature-based caching\nalgorithm is proposed for all CPs. The proposed caching algorithm is verified\nwith the realistic Movielens dataset. A win-win relation between the CPs and\nusers is observed, where the B-CDN improves user quality of experience and\nreduces cost of delivering content for the CPs.",

Empirically, this market has failed\nto yield stable equilibria with predictable prices for desired levels of\nservice. We argue that this is due to the absence of a dominant strategy\nequilibrium in the current fee mechanism. We propose an alternative fee setting\nmechanism that is inspired by generalized second price auctions. The design of\nsuch a mechanism is challenging because miners can use any criteria for\nincluding transactions and can manipulate the results of the auction after\nseeing the proposed fees. Nonetheless, we show that our proposed protocol is\nfree from manipulation as the number of users increases. We further show that,\nfor a large number of users and miners, the gain from manipulation is small for\nall parties. This results in users proposing fees that represent their true\nutility and lower variance of revenue for miners. Historical analysis shows\nthat Bitcoin users could have saved $272,528,000 USD in transaction fees while\nminers could have reduced the variance of fee income by an average factor of\n7.4 times.",

In this work, we propose an\narchitecture, which will make the communication of sensor devices to outside\nworld easier. Our proposed system removes certain layer from TCP-IP\ncommunication. We used a communication interface identifier protocol (CIIP)\nwhich can be used for smaller IoT sensors.",

Track occupation and signaling are\ngoverned by central control offices, while trains (and their drivers) receive\ninstructions. To make this setup more dynamic, the train operations can be\ndecentralized by enabling the trains to find routes and make decisions which\nare safeguarded and protocolled in an auditable manner. In this paper, we\npresent the findings of a first-of-its-kind blockchain-based prototype\nimplementation for railway control, based on decentralization but also ensuring\nthat the overall system state remains conflict-free and safe. We also show how\na blockchain-based approach simplifies usage billing and enables a\ntrain-to-train/machine-to-machine economy. Finally, first ideas addressing the\nuse of blockchain as a life-cycle approach for condition based monitoring and\npredictive maintenance in train operations are outlined.",

            "summary": "In today's blockchain system, designing a secure and high throughput\nblockchain on par with a centralized payment system is a difficult task.\nSharding is one of the most worthwhile emerging technologies for improving the\nsystem throughput while maintain high security level. However, previous\nsharding related designs have two main limitations: Firstly, the throughput of\ntheir random-based sharding system is not high enough as they did not leverage\nthe heterogeneity among validators. Secondly, to design an incentive mechanism\nto promote cooperation could incur a huge overhead on their system. In this\npaper, we propose RepChain, a reputation-based secure and fast blockchain\nsystem via sharding, which also provides high incentive to stimulate node\ncooperation. RepChain utilizes reputation to explicitly characterize the\nheterogeneity among the validators and lay the foundation for the incentive\nmechanism. We propose a new double-chain architecture which includes\ntransaction chain and reputation chain. For transaction chain, a Raft-based\nsynchronous consensus that can achieve high throughput has been presented. For\nreputation chain, the synchronous Byzantine fault tolerance that combines\ncollective signing has been utilized to achieve a consensus on both reputation\nscore and the related transaction blocks. It supports a high throughput\ntransaction chain with moderate generation speed. Moreover, we propose a\nreputation-based sharding and leader selection scheme. To analyze the security\nof RepChain, we propose a recursive formula to calculate the epoch security\nwithin only O(km^2) time. Furthermore, we implement and evaluate RepChain on\nthe Amazon Web Service platform. The results show our solution can enhance both\nthroughout and security level of the existing sharding-based blockchain system.",

            "summary": "Blockchains have recently gained popularity thanks to their ability to record\n\"digital truth\". They are designed to keep persistence, security, and avoid\nattacks which is useful for many applications. However, they are still\nproblematic in their energy consumption, governance, and scalability Current\nsolutions either require vast computing power via Proof-of-Work (PoW) or cannot\ndirectly utilize computing power as a resource in virtual mining. Here, we\npropose incentive-based protocols that use competitions to integrate computing\npower into blockchains. We introduce Proof-of-Accumulated-Work (PoAW): miners\ncompete in costumer-submitted jobs, accumulate recorded work whenever they are\nsuccessful, and, over time, are remunerated. The underlying competition\nreplaces the standard hash puzzle-based competitions of PoW. A competition is\nmanaged by a dynamically-created small masternode network (dTMN) of invested\nminers. dTMNs allow for scalability as we do not need the entire network to\nmanage the competition. Using careful design on incentives, our system\npreserves security, avoids attacks, and offers new markets to miners. When\nthere are no costumers the system converges into a standard protocol. Our\nproposed solution improves the way by which the blockchain infrastructure works\nand makes use of its computing power. We also discuss how the protocol can be\nused by fields that require solving difficult optimization problems, such as\nArtificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition in Big Data.",

In this paper we present FireLedger, which leverages the iterative\nnature of blockchains in order to improve their throughput in optimistic\nexecution scenarios. FireLedger trades latency for throughput in the sense that\nin FireLedger the last f + 1 blocks of each node's blockchain are considered\ntentative, i.e., they may be rescinded in case one of the last f + 1 blocks\nproposers was Byzantine. Yet, when optimistic assumptions are met, a new block\nis decided in each communication step, which consists of a proposer that sends\nonly its proposal and all other participants are sending a single bit each. Our\nperformance study demonstrates that in a single Amazon data-center, FireLedger\nrunning on 10 mid-range Amazon nodes obtains a throughput of up to 160K\ntransactions per second for (typical Bitcoin size) 512 bytes transactions. In a\n10 nodes Amazon geo-distributed setting with 512 bytes transactions, FireLedger\nobtains a throughput of 30K tps. Moreover, on higher end Amazon machines,\nFireLedger obtains $20%-600%$ better throughput than state of the art protocols\nlike HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt, depending on the exact configuration.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin is an immutable permissionless blockchain system that has been\nextensively used as a public bulletin board by many different applications that\nheavily relies on its immutability. However, Bitcoin's immutability is not\nwithout its fair share of demerits. Interpol exposed the existence of harmful\nand potentially illegal documents, images and links in the Bitcoin blockchain,\nand since then there have been several qualitative and quantitative analysis on\nthe types of data currently residing in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n  Although there is a lot of attention on blockchains, surprisingly the\nprevious solutions proposed for data redaction in the permissionless setting\nare far from feasible, and require additional trust assumptions. Hence, the\nproblem of harmful data still poses a huge challenge for law enforcement\nagencies like Interpol (Tziakouris, IEEE S&P'18).\n  We propose the first efficient redactable blockchain for the permissionless\nsetting that is easily integrable into Bitcoin, and that does not rely on heavy\ncryptographic tools or trust assumptions. Our protocol uses a consensus-based\nvoting and is parameterised by a policy that dictates the requirements and\nconstraints for the redactions; if a redaction gathers enough votes the\noperation is performed on the chain. As an extra feature, our protocol offers\npublic verifiability and accountability for the redacted chain. Moreover, we\nprovide formal security definitions and proofs showing that our protocol is\nsecure against redactions that were not agreed by consensus. Additionally, we\nshow the viability of our approach with a proof-of-concept implementation that\nshows only a tiny overhead in the chain validation of our protocol when\ncompared to an immutable one.",

            "summary": "Blockchain protocols are based on a distributed database where stored data is\nguaranteed to be immutable. The requirement that all nodes have to maintain\ntheir own local copy of the database ensures security while consensus\nmechanisms help deciding which data gets added to the database and keep\npowerful adversaries from derailing the system. However, since the database\nthat forms the foundation of a blockchain is a continuously growing list of\nblocks, scalability is an inherent problem of this technology. Some public\nblockchains need a few 100 GB to Terabytes of storage.\n  In this work, we present the concept Superlight with self-contained proofs,\nwhich is designed to improve scalability of a public blockchain, while\npreserving security and decentralization. Instead of all nodes having a local\ncopy of the whole blockchain to verify a transaction, nodes can derive the\nvalidity of a transaction by only using block headers. To keep the block\nheaders compact, BLS signatures are used to combine signatures. We provide a\ndefinition of SCPs and show the required steps of a client to create a proof\nthat is accepted by other nodes for transferring funds. The advantage of such a\nlight-client-only blockchain is the lower storage requirement, while the\ndrawback is an increased computational complexity due to BLS signatures,\nlimited use-cases due to lack of a global state, and the requirement for an\ninteractive protocol between sender, receiver, and miner to create a\ntransaction.",

When the clock of $i$ rings,\n$i$ can choose to communicate, and is then matched to a uniformly chosen node\n$j$. The nodes $j$ and $i$ may update their states based on the state of the\nother node. Previous work has focused on minimizing the time to consensus and\nthe probability of error, while our goal is minimizing the number of\ncommunications. We show that when $m>3 \\log\\log\\log(n)$, consensus can be\nreached at linear communication cost, but this is impossible if\n$m<\\log\\log\\log(n)$. We also study a synchronous variant of the model, where\nour upper and lower bounds on $m$ for achieving linear communication cost are\n$2\\log\\log\\log(n)$ and $\\log\\log\\log(n)$, respectively.

One of the key capabilities of these emerging platforms is\nthe ability to create self-enforcing smart contracts. However, the development\nof smart contracts has proven to be error-prone in practice, and as a result,\ncontracts deployed on public platforms are often riddled with security\nvulnerabilities. This issue is exacerbated by the design of these platforms,\nwhich forbids updating contract code and rolling back malicious transactions.\nIn light of this, it is crucial to ensure that a smart contract is secure\nbefore deploying it and trusting it with significant amounts of cryptocurrency.\nTo this end, we introduce the VeriSolid framework for the formal verification\nof contracts that are specified using a transition-system based model with\nrigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers to\nreason about and verify contract behavior at a high level of abstraction.\nVeriSolid allows the generation of Solidity code from the verified models,\nwhich enables the correct-by-design development of smart contracts.",

To date, threshold cryptosystems have been\nconsidered under permissioned settings with a limited adversary. Our framework\nrelies on an escrow service that slashes and redistributes deposits to\nincentivize participants to adhere desired behaviors. Today, more than ever,\nsophisticated escrow services can be implemented over public blockchains like\nEthereum, without additional trust assumptions. The key threat to rational\nthreshold cryptosystems is collusion---by cooperating `illegally', a subset of\nparticipants can reveal the cryptosystem's secret, which, in turn is translated\nto unfair profit. Our countermeasure to collusion is framing. If the escrow is\nnotified of collusion, it rewards the framer and slashes the deposits of all\nother participants. We show that colluding parties find themselves in the\nprisoner's dilemma, where the dominant strategy is framing.",

An operational model of CESs in distribution\nnetworks is presented considering various types of energy trading transactions\nand crowdsourcees.

The developed approach supports seamless P2P energy\ntrading between individual prosumers and/or the utility. The presented\noperational model can also be used to operate islanded microgrids. The CES\nframework and the operation algorithm are then prototyped through an efficient\nblockchain implementation, namely the IBM Hyperledger Fabric.

To achieve scalability across servers in more than 10 countries\nlocated on 4 different continents, we drastically revisited Byzantine fault\ntolerant blockchains and verification of signatures. The resulting blockchain,\ncalled the Red Belly Blockchain (RBBC), commits more than a hundred thousand\ntransactions issued by permissionless nodes. These transactions are grouped\ninto blocks within few seconds through a partially synchronous consensus run by\npermissioned nodes. It prevents double spending by guaranteeing that a unique\nblock is decided at any given index of the chain in a deterministic way by all\nparticipants. We compared the performance of RBBC against traditional Byzantine\nfault tolerant alternatives and more recent randomized solutions. In the same\ngeo-distributed environment with low-end machines, we noticed two interesting\ncomparisons: (i) the RBBC throughput scales to hundreds of machines whereas the\nclassic 3-step leader-based BFT state machine used by consortium blockchains\ncannot scale to 40 identically configured nodes; (ii) RBBC guarantees\ntransaction finality in 3 seconds and experiences a third of the latency that\nrandomized-based solutions like HoneyBadgerBFT can offer. This empirical\nevaluation demonstrates that blockchain scalability can be achieved without\nsacrificing security.",

            "summary": "Many blockchain-based protocols, such as Bitcoin, implement a decentralized\nasset transfer (or exchange) system. As clearly stated in the original paper by\nNakamoto, the crux of this problem lies in prohibiting any participant from\nengaging in double-spending. There seems to be a common belief that consensus\nis necessary for solving the double-spending problem. Indeed, whether it is for\na permissionless or a permissioned environment, the typical solution uses\nconsensus to build a totally ordered ledger of submitted transfers. In this\npaper we show that this common belief is false: consensus is not needed to\nimplement of a decentralized asset transfer system. We do so by introducing AT2\n(Asynchronous Trustworthy Transfers), a class of consensusless algorithms. To\nshow formally that consensus is unnecessary for asset transfers, we consider\nthis problem first in the shared-memory context. We introduce AT2$_{SM}$, a\nwait-free algorithm that asynchronously implements asset transfer in the\nread-write shared-memory model. In other words, we show that the consensus\nnumber of an asset-transfer object is one. In the message passing model with\nByzantine faults, we introduce a generic asynchronous algorithm called\nAT2$_{MP}$ and discuss two instantiations of this solution. First, AT2$_{D}$\nensures deterministic guarantees and consequently targets a small scale\ndeployment (tens to hundreds of nodes), typically for a permissioned\nenvironment. Second, AT2$_{P}$ provides probabilistic guarantees and scales\nwell to a very large system size (tens of thousands of nodes), ensuring\nlogarithmic latency and communication complexity. Instead of consensus, we\nconstruct AT2$_{D}$ and AT2$_{P}$ on top of a broadcast primitive with causal\nordering guarantees offering deterministic and probabilistic properties,\nrespectively.",

            "summary": "The online social networks facilitate naturally for the users to share\ninformation. On these platforms, each user shares information based on his or\nher interests. The particular information being shared by a user may be\nlegitimate or fake. Sometimes a misinformation, propagated by users and group\ncan create chaos or in some cases, might leads to cases of riots. Nowadays the\nthird party like ALT news and Cobrapost check the information authenticity, but\nit takes too much time to validate the news. Therefore, a robust and new system\nis required to check the information authenticity within the network, to stop\nthe propagation of misinformation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based\nframework for sharing the information securely at the peer level. In the\nblockchain model, a chain is created by combining blocks of information. Each\nnode of network propagates the information based on its credibility to its peer\nnodes. The credibility of a node will vary according to the respective\ninformation. Trust is calculated between sender and receiver in two ways:(i)\nLocal trust used for sharing information at the peer level and (ii) global\ntrust is used for a credibility check of each user in the network. We evaluate\nour framework using real dataset derived from Facebook. Our approach achieves\nan accuracy of 83% which shows the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

            "summary": "Security is one of the fundamental challenges in the Internet of Things (IoT)\ndue to the heterogeneity and resource constraints of the IoT devices. Device\nclassification methods are employed to enhance the security of IoT by detecting\nunregistered devices or traffic patterns. In recent years, blockchain has\nreceived tremendous attention as a distributed trustless platform to enhance\nthe security of IoT. Conventional device identification methods are not\ndirectly applicable in blockchain-based IoT as network layer packets are not\nstored in the blockchain. Moreover, the transactions are broadcast and thus\nhave no destination IP address and contain a public key as the user identity,\nand are stored permanently in blockchain which can be read by any entity in the\nnetwork. We show that device identification in blockchain introduces privacy\nrisks as the malicious nodes can identify users' activity pattern by analyzing\nthe temporal pattern of their transactions in the blockchain. We study the\nlikelihood of classifying IoT devices by analyzing their information stored in\nthe blockchain, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first work of its\nkind. We use a smart home as a representative IoT scenario. First, a blockchain\nis populated according to a real-world smart home traffic dataset. We then\napply machine learning algorithms on the data stored in the blockchain to\nanalyze the success rate of device classification, modeling both an informed\nand a blind attacker. Our results demonstrate success rates over 90\\% in\nclassifying devices. We propose three timestamp obfuscation methods, namely\ncombining multiple packets into a single transaction, merging ledgers of\nmultiple devices, and randomly delaying transactions, to reduce the success\nrate in classifying devices. The proposed timestamp obfuscation methods can\nreduce the classification success rates to as low as 20%.",

As each blockchain is designed to\nsupport specific types of assets and transactions, and no blockchain will\nprevail, the need to perform interblockchain transactions is already pressing.\n  In this work we examine the fundamental problem of interoperable and\ninterconnected blockchains. In particular, we begin by introducing the\nMulti-Distributed Ledger Objects (MDLO), which is the result of aggregating\nmultiple Distributed Ledger Objects -- DLO (a DLO is a formalization of the\nblockchain) and that supports append and get operations of records (e.g.,\ntransactions) in them from multiple clients concurrently. Next, we define the\nAtomicAppends problem, which emerges when the exchange of digital assets\nbetween multiple clients may involve appending records in more than one DLO.\nSpecifically, AtomicAppend requires that either all records will be appended on\nthe involved DLOs or none. We examine the solvability of this problem assuming\nrational and risk-averse clients that may fail by crashing, and under different\nclient utility and append models, timing models, and client failure scenarios.\nWe show that for some cases the existence of an intermediary is necessary for\nthe problem solution. We propose the implementation of such intermediary over a\nspecialized blockchain, we term Smart DLO (SDLO), and we show how this can be\nused to solve the AtomicAppends problem even in an asynchronous, client\ncompetitive environment, where all the clients may crash.",

Concurrent programming is hard because it requires to\ncope with many possible, unpredictable behaviors of communicating processes\ninteracting with each other. Right from the start in the 1960s, the main way of\ndealing with concurrency has been by reduction to sequential reasoning. We\ntrace this history, and illustrate it through several examples, from early\nideas based on mutual exclusion, passing through consensus and concurrent\nobjects, until today ledgers and blockchains.

Although the literature features a\nnumber of proposals for securing smart contracts, these proposals mostly focus\non proving the correctness or absence of a certain type of vulnerability within\na contract, but cannot protect deployed (legacy) contracts from being\nexploited. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of re-entrancy\nexploits and propose a novel smart contract security technology, dubbed Sereum\n(Secure Ethereum), which protects existing, deployed contracts against\nre-entrancy attacks in a backwards compatible way based on run-time monitoring\nand validation. Sereum does neither require any modification nor any semantic\nknowledge of existing contracts. By means of implementation and evaluation\nusing the Ethereum blockchain, we show that Sereum covers the actual execution\nflow of a smart contract to accurately detect and prevent attacks with a false\npositive rate as small as 0.06% and with negligible run-time overhead. As a\nby-product, we develop three advanced re-entrancy attacks to demonstrate the\nlimitations of existing offline vulnerability analysis tools.",

The\ncorrectness of computation is verifiable even under malicious majority\ncondition using information-theoretic Message Authentication Code (MAC), and\nthe privacy is preserved using Secret-Sharing. With state-of-the-art multiparty\ncomputation protocol and a layer2 solution, our privacy-preserving computation\nguarantees data security on blockchain, cryptographically, while reducing the\nheavy-lifting computation job to a few nodes. This breakthrough has several\nimplications on the future of decentralized networks. First, secure computation\ncan be used to support Private Smart Contracts, where consensus is reached\nwithout exposing the information in the public contract. Second, it enables\ndata to be shared and used in trustless network, without disclosing the raw\ndata during data-at-use, where data ownership and data usage is safely\nseparated. Last but not least, computation and verification processes are\nseparated, which can be perceived as computational sharding, this effectively\nmakes the transaction processing speed linear to the number of participating\nnodes. Our objective is to deploy our secure computation network as an layer2\nsolution to any blockchain system. Smart Contracts\\cite{smartcontract} will be\nused as bridge to link the blockchain and computation networks. Additionally,\nthey will be used as verifier to ensure that outsourced computation is\ncompleted correctly. In order to achieve this, we first develop a general MPC\nnetwork with advanced features, such as: 1) Secure Computation, 2) Off-chain\nComputation, 3) Verifiable Computation, and 4)Support dApps' needs like\nprivacy-preserving data exchange.",

However, the random nature of the attachment mechanism\ncoupled with the requirement of protection against double-spend transactions\nleaves open the possibility that not all transactions will be eventually\nvalidated. Such transactions are said to be orphaned, and will never be\nvalidated. Our principal contribution is to propose a simple modification to\nthe attachment mechanism for the Tangle (the IOTA DAG architecture). This\nmodification ensures that all transactions are validated in finite time, and\npreserves essential features of the popular Monte-Carlo selection algorithm. In\norder to demonstrate these results we derive a fluid approximation for the\nTangle (in the limit of infinite arrival rate) and prove that this fluid model\nexhibits the desired behavior.

Fission applies a hybrid\nnetwork which consists of a relay network, and a peer-to-peer network. The goal\nof the relay network is to minimize the transaction confirmation time by\nminimizing the information propagation latency. To optimize the performance on\nthe relay network in the presence of churn, dynamic network topologies, and\nnetwork heterogeneity, we propose an ultra-fast game-theoretic relay selection\nalgorithm that achieves near-optimal performance in a fully distributed manner.\nFission's peer-to-peer network complements the relay network and provides a\nvery high data availability via enabling users to contribute their storage and\nbandwidth for information dissemination (with incentive). We propose a\ndistributed online data retrieval strategy that optimally offloads the relay\nnetwork without degrading the system performance.

To the best of our knowledge, our framework is\nthe first one that utilizes one-time passwords (OTPs) in the setting of the\npublic blockchain. In SmartOTPs, the OTPs are aggregated by a Merkle tree and\nhash chains whereby for each authentication only a short OTP (e.g., 16B-long)\nis transferred from the authenticator to the client. Such a novel setting\nenables us to make a fully air-gapped authenticator by utilizing small QR codes\nor a few mnemonic words, while additionally offering resilience against quantum\ncryptanalysis. We have made a proof-of-concept based on the Ethereum platform.\nOur cost analysis shows that the average cost of a transfer operation is\ncomparable to existing 2FA solutions using smart contracts with\nmulti-signatures.",

However, the infancy\nstage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the knowledge we\nhave and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to\nnarrow this rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete\nblockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we\ndiscuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors\nrecognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the\nmicro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and\nprototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The\nhigh-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between\nthem and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic,\nenvironmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight\ninteresting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability\ndecision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two\nclassification methodologies for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they\ncan be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the blockchain knowledge\ndomain.",

Existing platforms allow such\nprocesses to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart\ncontracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these\nplatforms brush aside the question of who is allowed to execute which tasks in\nthe process, either by deferring the question altogether or by adopting a\nstatic approach where all actors are bound to roles upon process instantiation.\nYet, a key advantage of blockchains is their ability to support dynamic sets of\nactors. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in\ncollaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification\nlanguage. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus\nenabling policy consistency verification. The paper also outlines an approach\nto compile policy specifications into smart contracts for enforcement. An\nexperimental evaluation shows that the cost of policy enforcement increases\nlinearly with the number of roles and constraints.",

Two studies from 2017\nfound methods to distinguish decoys from real inputs, which enabled\ntraceability for a majority of transactions. Since then, a number protocol\nchanges have been introduced, but their effectiveness has not yet been\nreassessed. Furthermore, little is known about traceability of Monero\ntransactions across hard fork chains. We formalize a new method for tracing\nMonero transactions, which is based on analyzing currency hard forks. We use\nthat method to perform a (passive) traceability analysis on data from the\nMonero, MoneroV and Monero Original blockchains and find that only a small\namount of inputs are traceable. We then use the results to estimate the\neffectiveness of known heuristics for recent transactions and find that they do\nnot significantly outperform random guessing. Our findings suggest that Monero\nis currently mostly immune to known passive attack vectors and resistant to\ntracking and tracing methods applied to other cryptocurrencies.",

To mention a few:\nhealthcare data is fragmented across several silos negatively affecting\nresearch and services, about half of the clinical trials are never reported,\nthe cost of drug discovery is ever increasing, and substandard and fake\nmedicines are still a huge problem. Blockchain has the potential to solve these\nproblems as it provides trust without any intermediaries, has traceability as a\ndefault feature, and promises new business models by enabling novel incentive\nstructures. Due to its potential, blockchain has gathered significant interest\nin the healthcare industry. In this paper, we review major use cases of\nblockchain in healthcare: patient data management, pharmaceutical research,\nsupply chain management of medical goods, prescription management, billing\nclaims management, analytics, and telemedicine alongside the related projects.\nWe found that most of the blockchain projects are limited as white-papers,\nproof of concepts, and products with a limited user base.

We propose a novel\nframework, called vChain, that alleviates the storage and computing costs of\nthe user and employs verifiable queries to guarantee the results' integrity. To\nsupport verifiable Boolean range queries, we propose an accumulator-based\nauthenticated data structure that enables dynamic aggregation over arbitrary\nquery attributes. Two new indexes are further developed to aggregate\nintra-block and inter-block data records for efficient query verification.

            "summary": "There has been an unprecedented surge in the number of service providers\noffering a wide range of machine learning prediction APIs for tasks such as\nimage classification, language translation, etc. thereby monetizing the\nunderlying data and trained models. Typically, a data owner (API provider)\ndevelops a model, often over proprietary data, and leverages the infrastructure\nservices of a cloud vendor for hosting and serving API requests. Clearly, this\nmodel assumes complete trust between the API Provider and cloud vendor. On the\nother hand, a malicious/buggy cloud vendor may copy the APIs and offer an\nidentical service, under-report model usage metrics, or unfairly discriminate\nbetween different API providers by offering them a nominal share of the\nrevenue. In this work, we present the design of a blockchain based\ndecentralized trustless API marketplace that enables all the stakeholders in\nthe API ecosystem to audit the behavior of the parties without having to trust\na single centralized entity. In particular, our system divides an AI model into\nmultiple pieces and deploys them among multiple cloud vendors who then\ncollaboratively execute the APIs. Our design ensures that cloud vendors cannot\ncollude with each other to steal the combined model, while individual cloud\nvendors and clients cannot repudiate their input or model executions.",

            "summary": "Existing education systems are facing a threat of question paper leaking\n(QPL) in the exam which jeopardizes the quality of education. Therefore, it is\nhigh time to think about a more secure and flexible question sharing system\nwhich can prevent QPL issue in the future education system. Blockchain enables\na way of creating and storing transactions, contracts or anything that requires\nprotection against tampering, accessing etc. This paper presents a new scheme\nfor smart education, by utilizing the concept of blockchain, for question\nsharing. A two-phase encryption technique for encrypting question paper (QSP)\nis proposed. In the first phase, QSPs are encrypted using timestamp and in the\nsecond phase, previous encrypted QSPs are encrypted again using a timestamp,\nsalt hash and hashes from previous QSPs. These encrypted QSPs are stored in the\nblockchain along with a smart contract which helps the user to unlock the\nselected QSP. An algorithm is also proposed for selecting a QSP for the exam\nwhich picks a QSP randomly. Moreover, a timestamp based lock is imposed on the\nscheme so that no one can decrypt the QSP before the allowed time. Finally,\nsecurity is analyzed by proving different propositions and the superiority of\nthe proposed scheme over existing schemes is proven through a comparative study\nbased on the different features.",

To address the security issue, we propose a novel mechanism\nthat involves watchtowers incentivized to watch the channels and reveal a\nfraud. Our protocol does not require participants to be online constantly\nwatching the blockchain. The protocol is secure, incentive compatible and\nlightweight in communication. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of our\nprotocol implementable on the Lightning protocol. Towards efficiency, we\nexamine specific topological structures in the blockchain transaction graph and\ngeneralize the construction of channels to enable topologies better suited to\nspecific real-world needs.

To address\nthese limitations, we propose a simplified but effective framework, named\nFogBus for facilitating end-to-end IoT-Fog(Edge)-Cloud integration. FogBus\noffers a platform independent interface to IoT applications and computing\ninstances for execution and interaction. It not only assists developers in\nbuilding applications but also helps users in running multiple applications at\na time and service providers to manage their resources. In addition, FogBus\napplies Blockchain, authentication and encryption techniques to secure\noperations on sensitive data. Because of its lightweight and cross platform\nsoftware systems, it is easy to deploy, scalable and cost e_cient. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by creating a computing\nenvironment with it that integrates finger pulse oximeter as IoT devices with\nSmartphone-based gateway and Raspberry Pi-based Fog nodes for Sleep Apnea\nanalysis. We also run several experiments on this computing environment varying\nFogBus settings. The experimental results show that different FogBus settings\ncan improve latency, energy, network and CPU usage of the computing\ninfrastructure.",

However, when CROs in the same pool attack each other,\nall CROs will earn less. In this paper, we tackle the problem of prisoner's\ndilemma from the perspective of CROs. We first define a game that a CRO\ninfiltrates another pool and perform an attack. In such game, the honest CRO\ncan control the payoffs and increase its revenue. By simulating this game, we\npropose to apply Zero Determinant (ZD) strategy on strategy decision, which can\nbe categorized into cooperation and defecting.

They allow participants to\nvote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves\nstaking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked\ntokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated\nlist. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing\ntoken-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We\npropose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby\nonly voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined\nmultiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a\nsimple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two\nkey dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given\nitem) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way\nthat increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to\nevaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct\nsimulations using this model of voters and show that implementing\ntoken-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In\nparticular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our\nsimulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the\ngreatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed\ntoken-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this finding using a\nsimplified mathematical analysis.",

However, most of the prevalent\nblockchain networks are built upon the consensus protocols under the\ncrypto-puzzle framework known as proof-of-work. Such protocols face the\ninherent problem of transaction-processing bottleneck, as the networks achieve\nthe decentralized consensus for transaction confirmation at the cost of very\nhigh latency. In this paper, we study the problem of consensus formation in a\nsystem of multiple throughput-scalable blockchains with sharded consensus.\nSpecifically, the protocol design of sharded consensus not only enables\nparallelizing the process of transaction validation with sub-groups of\nprocessors, but also introduces the Byzantine consensus protocols for\naccelerating the consensus processes. By allowing different blockchains to\nimpose different levels of processing fees and to have different\ntransaction-generating rate, we aim to simulate the multi-service provision\neco-systems based on blockchains in real world. We focus on the dynamics of\nblockchain-selection in the condition of a large population of consensus\nprocessors. Hence, we model the evolution of blockchain selection by the\nindividual processors as an evolutionary game. Both the theoretical and the\nnumerical analysis are provided regarding the evolutionary equilibria and the\nstability of the processors' strategies in a general case.",

AVs are a complex system composed of many subsystems,\nmaking them a typical target for attackers. Therefore, the firmware of the\ndifferent subsystems needs to be updated to the latest version by the\nmanufacturer to fix bugs and introduce new features, e.g., using security\npatches. In this paper, we propose a distributed firmware update scheme for the\nAVs' subsystems, leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology. A\nconsortium blockchain made of different AVs manufacturers is used to ensure the\nauthenticity and integrity of firmware updates. Instead of depending on\ncentralized third parties to distribute the new updates, we enable AVs, namely\ndistributors, to participate in the distribution process and we take advantage\nof their mobility to guarantee high availability and fast delivery of the\nupdates. To incentivize AVs to distribute the updates, a reward system is\nestablished that maintains a credit reputation for each distributor account in\nthe blockchain. A zero-knowledge proof protocol is used to exchange the update\nin return for a proof of distribution in a trust-less environment. Moreover, we\nuse attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme to ensure that only authorized AVs\nwill be able to download and use a new update. Our analysis indicates that the\nadditional cryptography primitives and exchanged transactions do not affect the\noperation of the AVs network. Also, our security analysis demonstrates that our\nscheme is efficient and secure against different attacks.",

            "summary": "Public blockchains provide a decentralized method for storing transaction\ndata and have many applications in different sectors. In order for users to\ntrack transactions, a simple method is to let them keep a local copy of the\nentire public ledger. Since the size of the ledger keeps growing, this method\nbecomes increasingly less practical, especially for lightweight users such as\nIoT devices and smartphones. In order to cope with the problem, several\nsolutions have been proposed to reduce the storage burden. However, existing\nsolutions either achieve a limited storage reduction (e.g., simple payment\nverification), or rely on some strong security assumption (e.g., the use of\ntrusted server). In this paper, we propose a new approach to solving the\nproblem. Specifically, we propose an \\underline{e}fficient verification\nprotocol for \\underline{p}ublic \\underline{b}lock\\underline{c}hains, or EPBC\nfor short. EPBC is particularly suitable for lightweight users, who only need\nto store a small amount of data that is {\\it independent of} the size of the\nblockchain. We analyze EPBC's performance and security, and discuss its\nintegration with existing public ledger systems. Experimental results confirm\nthat EPBC is practical for lightweight users.",

Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the\nmotivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle.\nTherefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the\nmotivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the\ndifferences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an\nonline survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github\nrepositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses\nthat met our criteria for analysis.\n  The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced\nin non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating\na decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open\nSource Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents\nfound BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS\nprojects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the\nnon-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects,\ndecentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty\nin upgrading the software after release. Software development tools that are\ntuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an\narray of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development\ntasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable\nsimulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.",

Unfortunately, the theoretical foundations\nunderlying such blockchains have not been thoroughly investigated. To close\nthis gap, in this paper we study decentralised quorum construction by means of\nfederated Byzantine quorum systems, used by Stellar. We rigorously prove the\ncorrectness of basic broadcast abstractions over federated quorum systems and\nestablish their relationship to the classical Byzantine quorum systems. In\nparticular, we prove correctness in the realistic setting where Byzantine nodes\nmay lie about their trust choices. We show that this setting leads to a novel\nvariant of Byzantine quorum systems where different nodes may have different\nunderstanding of what constitutes a quorum.",

This prevents such blockchains from running Machine\nLearning algorithms, Zero-Knowledge proofs, etc. which may need non-trivial\ncomputation. In this paper, we present YODA, which is to the best of our\nknowledge the first solution for efficient computation of CICs in\npermissionless blockchains with guarantees for a threat model with both\nByzantine and selfish nodes. YODA selects one or more execution sets (ES) via\nSortition to execute a particular CIC off-chain. One key innovation is the\nMultI-Round Adaptive Consensus using Likelihood Estimation (MIRACLE) algorithm\nbased on sequential hypothesis testing. M I RACLE allows the execution sets to\nbe small thus making YODA efficient while ensuring correct CIC execution with\nhigh probability. It adapts the number of ES sets automatically depending on\nthe concentration of Byzantine nodes in the system and is optimal in terms of\nthe expected number of ES sets used in certain scenarios. Through a suite of\neconomic incentives and technical mechanisms such as the novel Randomness\nInserted Contract Execution (RICE) algorithm, we force selfish nodes to behave\nhonestly. We also prove that the honest behavior of selfish nodes is an\napproximate Nash Equilibrium. We present the system design and details of YODA\nand prove the security properties of MIRACLE and RICE. Our prototype\nimplementation built on top of Ethereum demonstrates the ability of YODA to run\nCICs with orders of magnitude higher gas per unit time as well as total gas\nrequirements than Ethereum currently supports. It also demonstrates the low\noverheads of RICE.",

To address\nthese issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for\nEMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud\nand the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this\nmeans, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at\nthe same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be\nmodified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically\naccording to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart\ncontracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CP-ABE-based access\ncontrol mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong\nprivacy preservation in data sharing.

            "summary": "This research aims to identify how Bitcoin-related news publications and\nonline discourse are expressed in Bitcoin exchange movements of price and\nvolume. Being inherently digital, all Bitcoin-related fundamental data (from\nexchanges, as well as transactional data directly from the blockchain) is\navailable online, something that is not true for traditional businesses or\ncurrencies traded on exchanges. This makes Bitcoin an interesting subject for\nsuch research, as it enables the mapping of sentiment to fundamental events\nthat might otherwise be inaccessible. Furthermore, Bitcoin discussion largely\ntakes place on online forums and chat channels. In stock trading, the value of\nsentiment data in trading decisions has been demonstrated numerous times [1]\n[2] [3], and this research aims to determine whether there is value in such\ndata for Bitcoin trading models. To achieve this, data over the year 2015 has\nbeen collected from Bitcointalk.org, (the biggest Bitcoin forum in post\nvolume), established news sources such as Bloomberg and the Wall Street\nJournal, the complete /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin subreddits, and the bitcoin-otc and\nbitcoin-dev IRC channels. By analyzing this data on sentiment and volume, we\nfind weak to moderate correlations between forum, news, and Reddit sentiment\nand movements in price and volume from 1 to 5 days after the sentiment was\nexpressed. A Granger causality test confirms the predictive causality of the\nsentiment on the daily percentage price and volume movements, and at the same\ntime underscores the predictive causality of market movements on sentiment\nexpressions in online communities",

Most of the\ncurrent IoT systems are using centralized cloud-based data sharing systems,\nwhich will be difficult to scale up to meet the demands of future IoT systems.\nInvolvement of such third-party service provider requires also trust from both\nsensor owner and sensor data user. Moreover, the fees need to be paid for their\nservices. To tackle both the scalability and trust issues and to automatize the\npayments, this paper presents a blockchain based proxy re-encryption scheme.\nThe system stores the IoT data in a distributed cloud after encryption. To\nshare the collected IoT data, the system establishes runtime dynamic smart\ncontracts between the sensor and data user without the involvement of a trusted\nthird party. It also uses a very efficient proxy re-encryption scheme which\nallows that the data is only visible by the owner and the person present in the\nsmart contract. This novel combination of smart contracts with proxy\nre-encryption provides an efficient, fast and secure platform for storing,\ntrading and managing of sensor data. The proposed system is implemented in an\nEthereum based testbed to analyze the performance and the security properties.",

            "summary": "Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern\nsmart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and\nreduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power\nsystem and can lead to a blackout. On the other hand, existing charging\ncoordination mechanisms suffer from several limitations. First, the need for a\ncentral charging coordinator (CC) presents a single point of failure that\njeopardizes the effectiveness of the charging coordination. Second, a\ntransparent charging coordination mechanism does not exist where users are not\naware whether the CC is honest or not in coordination charging requests among\nthem in a fair way. Third, existing mechanisms overlook the privacy concerns of\nthe involved customers. To address these limitations, in this paper, we\nleverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging\ncoordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator.\nFirst ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the\nblockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its\nState-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required\ncharging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract\nwill then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner\nsuch that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot\nwhile charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time\nslots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed\ncorrectly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum\ntest-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be\nacceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging\ncoordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",

            "summary": "Permissioned Blockchain has become quite popular with enterprises forming\nconsortium since it prioritizes trust over privacy. One of the popular\nplatforms for distributed ledger solution, Hyperledger Fabric, requires a\ntransaction to be endorsed or approved by a group of special members known as\nendorsers before undergoing validation. To endorse a transaction, an endorser\nmentions its identity along with the signature so that it can be verified\nlater. However, for certain transactions, difference in opinion may exist among\nendorsers. Disclosing the identity of an endorser may lead to conflict within\nthe consortium. In such cases, an endorsement policy which not only allows an\nendorser to support a transaction discreetly, but at the same time takes into\naccount the decision of the majority is preferred. Thus we propose an Anonymous\nEndorsement System which uses a threshold endorsement policy in order to\naddress the issue. All these factors motivated us to design a new ring\nsignature scheme, called Fabric' Constant-Sized Linkable Ring Signature\n(FCsLRS) with Transaction-Oriented linkability for hiding identity of the\nendorsers. We have implemented the signature scheme in Golang and analyzed its\nsecurity and performance by varying the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) modulus\nsize. Feasibility of implementation is supported by experimental analysis.\nSignature and tag generation time is quite fast and remains constant\nirrespective of change in message length or endorsement set size for a given\nRSA modulus value, assuming all the endorsers generates their signature in\nparallel. Lastly, we also discuss the integration of the scheme on v1.2\nHyperledger Fabric.",

            "summary": "Blockchain systems benefit from lessons in prior art such as fault tolerance,\ndistributed systems, peer-to-peer systems, and game theory. In this paper we\nargue that blockchain algorithms should tolerate both rational\n(self-interested) users and Byzantine (malicious) ones, rather than assuming\nall non-Byzantine users are altruistic and follow the protocols blindly. Such\nalgorithms are called BAR-tolerant [1]. To design a BAR-tolerant system, one\ncan follow these three steps: clearly define the utility function for the\nrational users, prove the algorithm is such that there is no benefit from\nunilaterally deviating (that is, it's a Byzantine Nash Equilibrium), then prove\nthe algorithm correct assuming the rational actors follow the protocol. We\npresent an example attack by rational users: the gatekeeping attack, where\nmembers of a system selfishly decide to prevent newcomers from joining. This\nattack may affect any stake-based system where the existing members prevent\nnewcomers from making a stake, and essentially form a cartel. We then sketch a\nBAR-tolerant consensus protocol for blockchain that can defend against this\nattack. It relies on a strict order to decide who gets to propose a new block\n(so there's no need to race to solve a crypto puzzle) and it relies on hardware\nID tokens to make sure every computer is only represented at most once as a\nblock proposer to mitigate Sybil attacks. It also defends against the\ngatekeeper attack. The BAR-tolerant approach is naturally also applicable to\nother blockchain algorithms.",

Each selfish miner maintains a private chain and makes it\npublic opportunistically for the purpose of acquiring more rewards\nincommensurate to his Hashrate. We establish a novel Markov chain model to\ncharacterize all the state transitions of public and private chains. The\nminimum requirement of Hashrate together with the minimum delay of being\nprofitable is derived in close-form. The former reduces to 21.48% with the\nsymmetric selfish miners, while their competition with asymmetric Hashrates\nputs forward a higher requirement of the profitable threshold. The profitable\ndelay increases with the decrease of the Hashrate of selfish miners, making the\nmining pools more cautious on performing selfish mining.",

However, with increased popularity, the demand for\nprocessing transactions has also grown leading to increased costs, confirmation\ntimes, and limited blockchain utility. There have been a number of proposals on\nhow to scale blockchains, such as Plasma, Polkadot, Elastico, RapidChain,\nBitcoin-NG, and OmniLedger. These solutions all propose the segmentation of\nevery function of a blockchain, namely consensus, permanent data storage,\ntransaction processing, and consistency, which significantly increases the\ncomplexity and difficulty of implementation. BlockReduce is a new blockchain\nstructure which only segments consistency, allowing it to scale to handle tens\nof thousands of transactions per second without impacting fault tolerance or\ndecentralization. Moreover, BlockReduce will significantly decrease node\nbandwidth requirements and network latency through incentives while\nsimultaneously minimizing other resource demands in order to prevent\ncentralization of nodes.",

            "summary": "Within the last few years, a countless number of blockchain systems have\nemerged on the market, each one claiming to revolutionize the way of\ndistributed transaction processing in one way or the other. Many blockchain\nfeatures, such as byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), are indeed valuable\nadditions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the\ntechnology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are\nfundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with\ntraditional database systems, which have been around for decades already.\n  These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines\nbetween blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of\nthis is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under\ndevelopment by IBM. By having a relaxed view on BFT, the transaction pipeline\nof Fabric highly resembles the workflow of classical distributed databases\nsystems.\n  This raises two questions: (1) Which conceptual similarities and differences\ndo actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed\ndatabase system? (2) Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by\ntransitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus\nblurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle\nthese questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database\nresearch, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then\nsolve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to\nFabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our\nexperimental evaluation shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly\nincreases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by\nup to a factor of 3x.",

One solution to protect privacy in healthcare is the use of\nblockchain technology. However, one of the primary problems with blockchain is\nits highly limited scalability. In this work here, we propose the utilization\nof a blockchain based protocol to provide secure management and analysis of\ndata. In this paper we use recently introduced PoW based protocol GHOSTDAG,\nthat generalizes Satoshi's blockchain to a direct acyclic graph of blocks\n(blockDAG) and provides high throughput while also avoiding the\nsecurity-scalability problem. We use two blockchains based on the original\nGHOSTDAG protocol, one that is private and one that is public. Using a private\nblockchain, we create a system where we use smart contracts to analyze patient\nhealth data. If the smart contract for any reason issues an alert for an\nabnormal reading then the system makes the record of that event to the public\nblockchain. This would resolve the privacy and security vulnerabilities\nassociated with remote patient monitoring and also the limited scalability\nproblem of Satoshi's original blockchain.",

It has gradually\nbecome a new generation of distributed, non-centralized and trust-based\ntechnology solution. However, the blockchain operation is expensive and\ntransaction is delayed. Take BitCoin as an example. On the one hand, a block is\nproduced every ten minute. On the other hand, once the new block is generated,\nit takes a certain time to propagate world wide. The slow speed of propagation\ndetermines that BitCoin can not use too small block interval time. Ethereum\nalso faces similar problems, so the concept of uncle block was introduced to\nreduce blockchain forks. This paper introduces a new tree structure based\nbroadcast propagation routing model, providing a novel method to organize\nnetwork nodes and message propagation mechanism. In oder to avoid the single\nnode failure problem, the tree cluster routing is proposed. The research shows\nthat the tree based routing can accelerate broadcast convergence time and\nreduce redundant traffic.",

Although the original distributed ledger technology (DLT) of\nblockchain is deemed secure and decentralized, the confirmation of transactions\nis inefficient by design. Recently adopted, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based\ndistributed ledgers validate transactions efficiently without the physically\nand environmentally costly building process of blocks (Lerner (2015)). However,\ncentrally-controlled confirmation against the odds of multiple validation\ndisqualifies the DAG as a decentralized-distributed ledger. In this regard, we\nintroduce an innovative DLT by reconstructing a chain of antichains based on a\ngiven DAG-pool of transactions. Each antichain (box) contains distinct nodes\nwhose approved transactions are recursively validated by subsequently\naugmenting nodes. The boxer node closes the box and keeps the hash of all\ntransactions confirmed by the box-genesis node. Designation of boxers and\nbox-geneses is conditionally randomized for decentralization. The boxes are\nserially concatenated with recursive confirmation (boxchain) without incurring\nthe cost of box generation. Rewards (boxcoin) are paid to the contributing\nnodes of the ecosystem whose trust is built on the doubly-secure protocol of\nconfirmation.

            "summary": "Civic crowdfunding (CC) is a popular medium for raising funds for civic\nprojects from interested agents. With Blockchains gaining traction, we can\nimplement CC in a reliable, transparent, and secure manner with smart contracts\n(SCs). The fundamental challenge in CC is free-riding. PPR, the proposal by\nZubrickas [23] of giving refund bonus to the contributors, in the case of the\nproject not getting provisioned, has attractive properties. However, as\nobserved by Chandra et al. [7], PPR faces a challenge wherein the agents defer\ntheir contribution until the deadline. We define this delaying of contributions\nas a race condition. To address this, their proposal, PPS, considers the\ntemporal aspects of a contribution. However, PPS is computationally complex,\nexpensive to implement as an SC, and it being sophisticated, it is difficult to\nexplain to a layperson. In this work, our goal is to identify all essential\nproperties a refund bonus scheme must satisfy in order to curb free-riding\nwhile avoiding the race condition. We prove Contribution Monotonicity and Time\nMonotonicity are sufficient conditions for this. We propose three elegant\nrefund bonus schemes satisfying these two conditions leading to three novel\nmechanisms for CC - PPRG, PPRE, and PPRP. We show that PPRG is the most\ncost-effective mechanism when deployed as an SC. We show that under certain\nmodest assumptions on valuations of the agents, in PPRG, the project is funded\nat equilibrium.",

            "summary": "We investigate a family of bugs in blockchain-based smart contracts, which we\ncall event-ordering (or EO) bugs. These bugs are intimately related to the\ndynamic ordering of contract events, i.e., calls of its functions on the\nblockchain, and enable potential exploits of millions of USD worth of Ether.\nKnown examples of such bugs and prior techniques to detect them have been\nrestricted to a small number of event orderings, typicall 1 or 2. Our work\nprovides a new formulation of this general class of EO bugs as finding\nconcurrency properties arising in long permutations of such events. The\ntechnical challenge in detecting our formulation of EO bugs is the inherent\ncombinatorial blowup in path and state space analysis, even for simple\ncontracts. We propose the first use of partial-order reduction techniques,\nusing happen-before relations extracted automatically for contracts, along with\nseveral other optimizations built on a dynamic symbolic execution technique. We\nbuild an automatic tool called ETHRACER that requires no hints from users and\nruns directly on Ethereum bytecode. It flags 7-11% of over ten thousand\ncontracts analyzed in roughly 18.5 minutes per contract, providing compact\nevent traces that human analysts can run as witnesses. These witnesses are so\ncompact that confirmations require only a few minutes of human effort. Half of\nthe flagged contracts have subtle EO bugs, including in ERC-20 contracts that\ncarry hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether. Thus, ETHRACER is\neffective at detecting a subtle yet dangerous class of bugs which existing\ntools miss.",

Several cross-chain protocols have been\nproposed as ways of connecting these universes of individual blockchains in a\ndistributed and secure manner. In this paper, we present Niji, a new\ncross-chain protocol that allows parties to perform virtual Bitcoin payment\nsecurely on a consortium chain, without any trusted third-party or mediators.\nOur work focuses on the issue that it is difficult for a consortium chain's\ntoken to hold a stable market value, and Niji makes it possible for smart\ncontract services to acquire means of payment in the consortium chain. With the\nBitcoin payment channel built on the consortium chain, the process from payment\nto service provision runs autonomously without any interaction between parties.\nNiji introduces the concept of a transaction template to validate Bitcoin\npayments efficiently on different blockchains, and it allows a service provider\nto delegate all of its tasks for verifying state updates to a smart contract on\nthe consortium chain. We also propose a novel bi-directional payment channel\nadapted for design of the Niji protocol, which can update payments\nnon-interactively between parties. We implemented a prototype of the Niji\nprotocol and conducted an experiment measuring the computational cost and\nlatency that demonstrates the protocol's feasibility on practical platforms.",

However, under the dynamics of the\nprimary channel and the uncertainty of the mempool state of the mining pool, it\nis challenging for the secondary user to determine an optimal transaction\ntransmission policy. In this paper, we propose to use the deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithm to derive an optimal transaction transmission policy for the\nsecondary user.

            "summary": "Distributed consensus is a key enabler for many distributed systems including\ndistributed databases and blockchains. Canopus is a scalable distributed\nconsensus protocol that ensures that live nodes in a system agree on an ordered\nsequence of operations (called transactions). Unlike most prior consensus\nprotocols, Canopus does not rely on a single leader. Instead, it uses a virtual\ntree overlay for message dissemination to limit network traffic across\noversubscribed links. It leverages hardware redundancies, both within a rack\nand inside the network fabric, to reduce both protocol complexity and\ncommunication overhead. These design decisions enable Canopus to support large\ndeployments without significant performance degradation.\n  The existing Canopus protocol is resilient in the face of node and\ncommunication failures, but its focus is primarily on performance, so does not\nrespond well to other types of failures. For example, the failure of a single\nrack of servers causes all live nodes to stall. The protocol is also open to\nattack by Byzantine nodes, which can cause different live nodes to conclude the\nprotocol with different transaction orders. In this paper, we describe RCanopus\n(`resilent Canopus') which extends Canopus to add liveness, that is, allowing\nlive nodes to make progress, when possible, despite many types of failures.\nThis requires RCanopus to accurately detect and recover from failure despite\nusing unreliable failure detectors, and tolerance of Byzantine attacks. Second,\nRCanopus guarantees safety, that is, agreement amongst live nodes of\ntransaction order, in the presence of Byzantine attacks and network\npartitioning.",

Traceability presupposes the integrity\nand transparency of data that is saved and shared. This is a problem for\ncurrent technologies, as there are many examples with tampered data and\ndatabase vulnerabilities that resulted in serious implications and data loss. A\nsolution to this problem can be the decentralization of the system, which will\nremove the central point of failure. To that effect, blockchain or DLT\ntechnologies, an emergent technology that enables the decentralization of a\nnetwork can be used, by implementing a trustless model to achieve it.\nBlockchains are tamperproof and transparent, which means that by exploiting\nblockchain characteristics, traceability can be improved. A model that\ndescribes the decentralization process of the supply chain traceability part\nhas been developed for this paper and is later evaluated and compared with the\ntraditional system.",

Blockchain hashing - or the insertion of\ndata in the blockchain - is one of the potential applications of the blockchain\nin this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their\ndata to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity.\nBlockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on\ncentral governmental databases. The paper starts by analysing possible\nscenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work\nand in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second,\nthe paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using\nPKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain.\nThird, it also addresses issues related to concepts such as distributed ledger\ntechnology and permissioned blockchains. Finally, it raises the question of\nwhether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance,\nand concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PKI\nand other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need\nfirst to identify pain points in governance, and then consider the trade-offs\nof the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives.",

            "summary": "This article surveys blockchain-based approaches for several security\nservices. These services include authentication, confidentiality, privacy, and\naccess control list (ACL), data and resource provenance, and integrity\nassurance. All these services are critical for the current distributed\napplications, especially due to the large amount of data being processed over\nthe networks and the use of cloud computing. Authentication ensures that the\nuser is who he/she claims to be. Confidentiality guarantees that data cannot be\nread by unauthorized users. Privacy provides the users the ability to control\nwho can access their data. Provenance allows an efficient tracking of the data\nand resources along with their ownership and utilization over the network.\nIntegrity helps in verifying that the data has not been modified or altered.\nThese services are currently managed by centralized controllers, for example, a\ncertificate authority. Therefore, the services are prone to attacks on the\ncentralized controller. On the other hand, blockchain is a secured and\ndistributed ledger that can help resolve many of the problems with\ncentralization. The objectives of this paper are to give insights on the use of\nsecurity services for current applications, to highlight the state of the art\ntechniques that are currently used to provide these services, to describe their\nchallenges, and to discuss how the blockchain technology can resolve these\nchallenges. Further, several blockchain-based approaches providing such\nsecurity services are compared thoroughly. Challenges associated with using\nblockchain-based security services are also discussed to spur further research\nin this area.",

Besides, there are multiple parties involved in a lifespan of a\nsmart car ,such as manufacturers, car owners, government agencies, and\nthird-party service providers who also produce data about the vehicle. In\naddition to managing and sharing data amongst these entities in a secure and\nprivacy-friendly way which is a great challenge itself, there exists a trust\ndeficit about some types of data as they remain under the custody of the car\nowner(e.g. satellite navigation and mileage data) and can easily be\nmanipulated. In this paper, we propose a blockchain supported architecture\nenabling the owner of a smart car to create an immutable record of every data,\ncalled the auto biography of a car, generated within its lifespan. We also\nexplain how the trust about this record is guaranteed by the immutability\ncharacteristic of the blockchain.

In this work we introduce Prism, a new proof-of-work\nblockchain protocol, which can achieve 1) security against up to 50%\nadversarial hashing power; 2) optimal throughput up to the capacity C of the\nnetwork; 3) confirmation latency for honest transactions proportional to the\npropagation delay D, with confirmation error probability exponentially small in\nCD ; 4) eventual total ordering of all transactions.

During a series of experiments on\nthe Ethereum blockchain, we achieved $4$ times error reduction with blockchain\ndata than an LSTM approach with trade volume data. By utilizing blockchain\naccount distribution histograms, spatial dataset modeling, and a Convolutional\narchitecture, the error was reduced further by 26\\%. The proposed methodologies\nare implemented in an open source cryptocurrency prediction framework, allowing\nthem to be used in other analysis contexts.",

            "summary": "Growing consumer awareness as well as manufacturers' internal quality\nrequirements lead to novel demands on supply chain traceability. Existing\ncentralized solutions suffer from isolated data storage and lacking trust when\nmultiple parties are involved. Decentralized blockchain-based approaches\nattempt to overcome these shortcomings by creating digital representations of\nphysical goods to facilitate tracking across multiple entities. However, they\ncurrently do not capture the transformation of goods in manufacturing\nprocesses. Therefore, the relation between ingredients and product is lost,\nlimiting the ability to trace a product's provenance. We propose a\nblockchain-based supply chain traceability system using smart contracts. In\nsuch contracts, manufacturers define the composition of products in the form of\nrecipes. Each ingredient of the recipe is a non-fungible token that corresponds\nto a batch of physical goods. When the recipe is applied, its ingredients are\nconsumed and a new token is produced. This mechanism preserves the traceability\nof product transformations. The system is implemented for the Ethereum Virtual\nMachine and is applicable to any blockchain configuration that supports it. Our\nevaluation reveals that the gas costs scale linearly with the number of\nproducts considered in the system. This leads to the conclusion that the\nsolution can handle complex use cases.",

Platforms such as\nthe blockchain-based Steemit employ this type of curation while providing\nmonetary incentives to promote the visibility of high quality posts according\nto the perception of the participants. Despite the wide adoption of the\nplatform very little is known regarding its performance and resilience\ncharacteristics. In this work, we provide a formal model for decentralized\ncontent curation that identifies salient complexity and game-theoretic measures\nof performance and resilience to selfish participants. Armed with our model, we\nprovide a first analysis of Steemit identifying the conditions under which the\nsystem can be expected to correctly converge to curation while we demonstrate\nits susceptibility to selfish participant behaviour. We validate our\ntheoretical results with system simulations in various scenarios.",

            "summary": "Space situation awareness (SSA) includes tracking of active and inactive\nresident space objects (RSOs) and assessing the space environment through\nsensor data collection and processing. To enhance SSA, the dynamic data-driven\napplications systems (DDDAS) framework couples on-line data with off-line\nmodels to enhance system performance. Using feedback control, sensor\nmanagement, and communications reliability. For information management, there\nis a need for identity authentication and access control to ensure the\nintegrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access\nright to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of SSA\nsystems, it is challenging to build an efficient centralized access control\nsystem, which could either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of\nfailure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract technology, this paper\nintroduces BlendCAC, a decentralized authentication and capability-based access\ncontrol mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services and\ninformation in SSA networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the\nBlendCAC leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones and a robust\nidentity-based capability token management strategy is proposed. A\nproof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained\ndevices and more powerful computing devices, and is tested on a private\nEthereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the BlendCAC scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable,\nlightweight and fine-grained access control solution for space system towards\nSSA.",

Smart network systems are intelligent autonomously-operating\nnetworks, a new form of global computational infrastructure that includes\nblockchains, deep learning, and autonomous-strike UAVs. These kinds of\nlarge-scale networks are a contemporary reality with thousands, millions, and\nbillions of constituent elements, and entail a foundational and\ntheoretically-robust model for their design and operation. Hence this work\nproposes smart network field theory, drawing from statistical physics,\neffective field theories, and model systems, for criticality detection and\nfleet-many item orchestration in smart network systems. Smart network field\ntheory falls within the broader concern of technophysics (the application of\nphysics to the study of technology), in which a key objective is deriving\nstandardized methods for assessing system criticality and phase transition, and\ndefining interim system structure between the levels of microscopic noise and\nmacroscopic labels. The farther implications of this work include the\npossibility of recasting the P/NP computational complexity schema as one no\nlonger based on traditional time (concurrency) and space constraints, due to\nthe availability of smart network computational resources.",

In this paper we\nintroduce Tithonus, a framework that builds on the Bitcoin blockchain and\nnetwork to provide censorship-resistant communication mechanisms. In contrast\nto previous approaches, we do not rely solely on the slow and expensive\nblockchain consensus mechanism but instead fully exploit Bitcoin's peer-to-peer\ngossip protocol. We develop adaptive, fast and cost effective data\ncommunication solutions that camouflage client requests into inconspicuous\nBitcoin transactions. We propose solutions to securely request and transfer\ncontent, with unobservability and censorship resistance, and free,\npay-per-access and subscription based payment options. When compared to\nstate-of-the-art Bitcoin writing solutions, Tithonus reduces the cost of\ntransferring data to censored clients by 2 orders of magnitude and increases\nthe goodput by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude. We show that Tithonus client\ninitiated transactions are hard to detect, while server initiated transactions\ncannot be censored without creating split world problems to the Bitcoin\nblockchain.",

            "summary": "In general, a botnet is a collection of compromised internet computers,\ncontrolled by attackers for malicious purposes. To increase attacks' success\nchance and resilience against defence mechanisms, modern botnets have often a\ndecentralized P2P structure. Here, IoT devices are playing a critical role,\nbecoming one of the major tools for malicious parties to perform attacks.\nNotable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security and DYN, which have been\nperformed by IoT devices part of botnets.\n  We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing\nAutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the\nsame botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As\nsuch, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of\nIoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect\nbotnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a permissioned Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)\nblockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of a set of\npre-identified parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and\ndynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network\ntraffic flows as blockchain transactions.\n  In this paper, we focus on the design of the AutoBotCatcher by first defining\nthe blockchain structure underlying AutoBotCatcher, then discussing its\ncomponents.",

            "summary": "Today's blockchain designs suffer from a trilemma claiming that no blockchain\nsystem can simultaneously achieve decentralization, security, and performance\nscalability. For current blockchain systems, as more nodes join the network,\nthe efficiency of the system (computation, communication, and storage) stays\nconstant at best. A leading idea for enabling blockchains to scale efficiency\nis the notion of sharding: different subsets of nodes handle different portions\nof the blockchain, thereby reducing the load for each individual node. However,\nexisting sharding proposals achieve efficiency scaling by compromising on trust\n- corrupting the nodes in a given shard will lead to the permanent loss of the\ncorresponding portion of data. In this paper, we settle the trilemma by\ndemonstrating a new protocol for coded storage and computation in blockchains.\nIn particular, we propose PolyShard: ``polynomially coded sharding'' scheme\nthat achieves information-theoretic upper bounds on the efficiency of the\nstorage, system throughput, as well as on trust, thus enabling a truly scalable\nsystem. We provide simulation results that numerically demonstrate the\nperformance improvement over state of the arts, and the scalability of the\nPolyShard system. Finally, we discuss potential enhancements, and highlight\npractical considerations in building such a system.",

More recently, the Blockchain\nand the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more\nand more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications.\nSome people have come to the point of saying that the \"Blockchain revolution\"\ncan be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a\nresult, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology\nis growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about\nsuch huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried\nsoftware development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis\nwhich does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of\nsoftware engineering are taken into account. This paper tries to cope with this\nissue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement,\nanalyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process\nis based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and\nincremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more\nformal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the\nsystem, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain\ndevelopment. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to\nshow how it works.",

By allowing such clients to receive fraud proofs\ngenerated by fully validating nodes that show that a block violates the\nprotocol rules, and combining this with probabilistic sampling techniques to\nverify that all of the data in a block actually is available to be downloaded,\nwe can eliminate the honest-majority assumption, and instead make much weaker\nassumptions about a minimum number of honest nodes that rebroadcast data.

For\ninstance, the OpenMalaria framework is a computationally-intensive simulation\nused by various non-governmental and governmental agencies to understand\nmalarial disease spread and effectiveness of intervention strategies, and\nsubsequently design healthcare policies. Given that such shared results form\nthe basis of inferences drawn, technological solutions designed, and day-to-day\npolicies drafted, it is essential that the computations are validated and\ntrusted. In particular, in a multi-agent environment involving several\nindependent computing agents, a notion of trust in results generated by peers\nis critical in facilitating transparency, accountability, and collaboration.\nUsing a novel combination of distributed validation of atomic computation\nblocks and a blockchain-based immutable audits mechanism, this work proposes a\nuniversal framework for distributed trust in computations. In particular we\naddress the scalaibility problem by reducing the storage and communication\ncosts using a lossy compression scheme.

To ensure data sharing\nsecurity and traceability, highefficiency Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus\nscheme as a hard security solution is utilized to establish blockchain-enabled\nIoV (BIoV). However, as miners are selected from miner candidates by\nstake-based voting, it is difficult to defend against voting collusion between\nthe candidates and compromised high-stake vehicles, which introduces serious\nsecurity challenges to the BIoV. To address such challenges, we propose a soft\nsecurity enhancement solution including two stages: (i) miner selection and\n(ii) block verification. In the first stage, a reputation-based voting scheme\nfor the blockchain is proposed to ensure secure miner selection. This scheme\nevaluates candidates' reputation by using both historical interactions and\nrecommended opinions from other vehicles. The candidates with high reputation\nare selected to be active miners and standby miners. In the second stage, to\nprevent internal collusion among the active miners, a newly generated block is\nfurther verified and audited by the standby miners. To incentivize the standby\nminers to participate in block verification, we formulate interactions between\nthe active miners and the standby miners by using contract theory, which takes\nblock verification security and delay into consideration. Numerical results\nbased on a real-world dataset indicate that our schemes are secure and\nefficient for data sharing in BIoV.",

A primary concern with PoS systems is the \"rich\ngetting richer\" phenomenon, whereby wealthier nodes are more likely to get\nelected, and hence reap the block reward, making them even wealthier. In this\npaper, we introduce the notion of equitability, which quantifies how much a\nproposer can amplify her stake compared to her initial investment. Even with\neveryone following protocol (i.e., honest behavior), we show that existing\nmethods of allocating block rewards lead to poor equitability, as does\ninitializing systems with small stake pools and/or large rewards relative to\nthe stake pool. We identify a \\emph{geometric} reward function, which we prove\nis maximally equitable over all choices of reward functions under honest\nbehavior and bound the deviation for strategic actions; the proofs involve the\nstudy of optimization problems and stochastic dominances of Polya urn\nprocesses, and are of independent mathematical interest.

            "summary": "Low transaction throughput and poor scalability are significant issues in\npublic blockchain consensus protocols such as Bitcoins. Recent research efforts\nin this direction have proposed shard-based consensus protocols where the key\nidea is to split the transactions among multiple committees (or shards), which\nthen process these shards or set of transactions in parallel. Such a parallel\nprocessing of disjoint sets of transactions or shards by multiple committees\nsignificantly improves the overall scalability and transaction throughout of\nthe system. However, one significant research gap is a lack of understanding of\nthe strategic behavior of rational processors within committees in such\nshard-based consensus protocols. Such an understanding is critical for\ndesigning appropriate incentives that will foster cooperation within committees\nand prevent free-riding. In this paper, we address this research gap by\nanalyzing the behavior of processors using a game-theoretic model, where each\nprocessor aims at maximizing its reward at a minimum cost of participating in\nthe protocol. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in an N-player static game\nmodel of the sharding protocol. We show that depending on the reward sharing\napproach employed, processors can potentially increase their payoff by\nunilaterally behaving in a defective fashion, thus resulting in a social\ndilemma. In order to overcome this social dilemma, we propose a novel\nincentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among\nprocessors. Our numerical results show that achieving a majority of cooperating\nprocessors (required to ensure a healthy state of the blockchain network) is\neasier to achieve with the proposed incentive-compatible reward sharing\nmechanism than with other reward sharing mechanisms.",

In particular, recent trends in\ncryptocurrencies and blockchain have led to a proliferation of peer-to-peer\n(P2P) energy trading schemes, which allow the exchange of energy between the\nneighbors without any intervention of a conventional intermediary in the\ntransactions. Nevertheless, far too little attention has been paid to the\ntechnical constraints of the network under this scenario. A major challenge to\nimplementing P2P energy trading is that of ensuring that network constraints\nare not violated during the energy exchange. This paper proposes a methodology\nbased on sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of P2P transactions on the\nnetwork and to guarantee an exchange of energy that does not violate network\nconstraints. The proposed method is tested on a typical UK low-voltage network.\nThe results show that our method ensures that energy is exchanged between users\nunder the P2P scheme without violating the network constraints, and that users\ncan still capture the economic benefits of the P2P architecture.",

DSDIN is a blockchain based IoT and AI technology platform, and also\nan IoT based intelligent service standard. Due to the intelligent network\nformed by DSDIN, the manufacturing center is no longer a factory, and actually\nthere are no manufacturing centers.

            "summary": "The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart\ncontracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain. Smart\ncontracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in\nlaw, business, commerce, and governance.\n  Smart contracts are commonly written in a high-level language such as\nEthereum's Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for\ndeployment on the blockchain. Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously\nexecuted, usually by a %Turing-complete virtual machine. As with all programs,\nsmart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient\nprogramming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy\ncompilers. At the same time, smart contracts are also high-value targets, often\ncommanding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and auditors need\nsecurity frameworks capable of analysing low-level bytecode to detect potential\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n  In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum\nsmart contracts. Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts\nlow-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations.\nUsers of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion:\na security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the\n\\souffle language. We conduct a large-scale empirical study for a set of common\nsmart contract security vulnerabilities, and show the effectiveness and\nefficiency of Vandal. Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing\nover 95\\% of all 141k unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds;\noutperforming the current state of the art tools---Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and\nRattle---under equivalent conditions.",

            "summary": "We initiate the study of quantum races, games where two or more quantum\ncomputers compete to solve a computational problem. While the problem of\ndueling algorithms has been studied for classical deterministic algorithms, the\nquantum case presents additional sources of uncertainty for the players. The\nforemost among these is that players do not know if they have solved the\nproblem until they measure their quantum state. This question of `when to\nmeasure?' presents a very interesting strategic problem. We develop a\ngame-theoretic model of a multiplayer quantum race, and find an approximate\nNash equilibrium where all players play the same strategy. In the two-party\ncase, we further show that this strategy is nearly optimal in terms of payoff\namong all symmetric Nash equilibria. A key role in our analysis of quantum\nraces is played by a more tractable version of the game where there is no\npayout on a tie; for such races we completely characterize the Nash equilibria\nin the two-party case.\n  One application of our results is to the stability of the Bitcoin protocol\nwhen mining is done by quantum computers. Bitcoin mining is a race to solve a\ncomputational search problem, with the winner gaining the right to create a new\nblock. Our results inform the strategies that eventual quantum miners should\nuse, and also indicate that the collision probability---the probability that\ntwo miners find a new block at the same time---would not be too high in the\ncase of quantum miners. Such collisions are undesirable as they lead to forking\nof the Bitcoin blockchain.",

While blockchain is thought\nprimarily as the basis of Bitcoin, its application has grown far beyond\ncryptocurrencies due to the introduction of smart contracts.

Using blockchain-based smart contracts for secure and transparent\nmanagement to govern interactions (authentication, connection, and transaction)\nin Internet-enabled environments, mostly IoT, is a niche area of research and\npractice. However, writing trustworthy and safe smart contracts can be\ntremendously challenging because of the complicated semantics of underlying\ndomain-specific languages and its testability. There have been high-profile\nincidents that indicate blockchain smart contracts could contain various\ncode-security vulnerabilities, instigating financial harms. When it involves\nsecurity of smart contracts, developers embracing the ability to write the\ncontracts should be capable of testing their code, for diagnosing security\nvulnerabilities, before deploying them to the immutable environments on\nblockchains. However, there are only a handful of security testing tools for\nsmart contracts. This implies that the existing research on automatic smart\ncontracts security testing is not adequate and remains in a very stage of\ninfancy.

The motivation for this position\npaper is to elaborate on strategies to protect privacy as well as to encourage\ndata sharing and support open data without requiring a complex access protocol\nfor researchers. Our main contribution is to outline the design of a\nself-regulated Open Health Archive (OHA) system with focus on quality of life\n(QoL) data.",

            "summary": "Blockchain has received great attention in recent years and motivated\ninnovations in different scenarios. However, many vital issues which affect its\nperformance are still open. For example, it is widely convinced that high level\nof security and scalability and full decentralization are still impossible to\nachieve simultaneously. In this paper, we propose Bicomp, a bilayer scalable\nNakamoto consensus protocol, which is an approach based on high security and\npure decentralized Nakamoto consensus, and with a significant improvement on\nscalability. In Bicomp, two kinds of blocks are generated, i.e., microblocks\nfor concurrent transaction packaging in network, and macroblocks for leadership\ncompetition and chain formation. A leader is elected at beginning of each round\nby using a macroblock header from proof-of-work. An elected leader then\nreceives and packages multiple microblocks mined by different nodes into one\nmacroblock during its tenure, which results in a bilayer block structure. Such\ndesign limits a leader's power and encourages as many nodes as possible to\nparticipate in the process of packaging transactions, which promotes the\nsharding nature of the system. Furthermore, several mechanisms are carefully\ndesigned to reduce transaction overlapping and further limit a leader's power,\namong which a novel transaction diversity based metric is proposed as the\nsecond level criteria besides the longest-chain-first principle on selecting a\nlegitimate chain when fork happens. Security issues and potential attacks to\nBicomp are extensively discussed and experiments for evaluation are performed.\nFrom the experimental results based on 50 nodes all over the world, Bicomp\nachieves significant improvement on scalability than that of Bitcoin and\nEthereum, while the security and decentralization merits are still preserved.",

Later the validators serially re-execute the\nsmart contract transactions of the block to validate it. If validation is\nsuccessful then the block is added to the blockchain using a consensus protocol\nand miner gets the incentive. In the current era of multi-core processors, by\nemploying the serial execution of the transactions, the miners and validators\nfail to utilize the cores properly and as a result, have poor throughput. By\nentitling concurrency to smart contracts execution, we can achieve better\nefficiency and higher throughput. In this proposal, we develop a novel and\nefficient technique to execute the smart contract transactions concurrently by\nminer using optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs). The miner\nproposes a block which consists of the set of transactions, conflict graph,\nhash of previous block and final state of each shared data-objects. Later, we\npropose concurrent validator which re-executes the same smart contracts\nconcurrently and deterministically with the help of conflict graph given by\nminer and verifies the final states. On successful validation, proposed block\nappended into the blockchain and miner gets the incentive. We consider a\nbenchmarks from solidity documentation. We execute the smart contract\ntransactions concurrently using Basic Time stamp Ordering (BTO) and\nMulti-Version Time stamp Ordering (MVTO) protocols as optimistic STMs. BTO and\nMVTO miner achieves 3.6x and 3.7x average speedups over serial miner\nrespectively.

            "summary": "Blockchain is based on a P2P network, supporting decentralized consensus of\ncurrent cryptocurrencies. Since bitcoin and altcoins all utilize an underlying\nblockchain, they are therefore greatly affected by the performance of the P2P\nnetwork. In bitcoin, the miners are engaged in a time-sensitive competition to\nsolve a Proof-of-Work problem to extend the blockchain. This consequently\nraises a critical problem to minimize the time between the propagation of a\nwinning block and the beginning of the next round of the competition. This\npaper proposes a method that selects a node's closest neighbors to make\nmessages propagate in the whole network in time. The method measures the\ndistance from a node to its neighbor using transmission latency; thus, the\nlower the latency, the closer the neighbor. Simulations showed a good rate of\ndecrease in average propagation latency and maximum propagation latency,\ncompared to the classic method. Furthermore, this paper not only proposes the\nprinciple of establishing connections based on latency, but also evaluates the\ninfluence of the number of simultaneously established connections.",

Consequently, they are usually expensive to deploy, have limited\nadaptability to diverse requirements, and face a series of data security and\nprivacy issues. In this paper, we employ permissionless blockchains to\nconstruct a purely decentralized platform for data storage and trading in a\nwireless-powered IoT crowdsensing system. In the system, IoT sensors use power\nwirelessly transferred from RF-energy beacons for data sensing and transmission\nto an access point. The data is then forwarded to the blockchain for\ndistributed ledger services, i.e., data/transaction verification, recording,\nand maintenance. Due to coupled interference of wireless transmission and\ntransaction fee incurred from blockchain's distributed ledger services,\nrational sensors have to decide on their transmission rates to maximize\nindividual utility. Thus, we formulate a noncooperative game model to analyze\nthis competitive situation among the sensors. We provide the analytical\ncondition for the existence of the Nash equilibrium as well as a series of\ninsightful numerical results about the equilibrium strategies in the game.",

            "summary": "The exponential growth of wireless-based solutions, such as those related to\nthe mobile smart devices (e.g., smart-phones and tablets) and Internet of\nThings (IoT) devices, has lead to countless advantages in every area of our\nsociety. Such a scenario has transformed the world a few decades back,\ndominated by latency, into a new world based on an efficient real-time\ninteraction paradigm.Recently, cryptocurrency have contributed to this\ntechnological revolution, the fulcrum of which are a decentralization model and\na certification function offered by the so-called blockchain infrastructure,\nwhich make it possible to certify the financial transactions, anonymously.\nHowever, it should be observed how this challenging scenario has generated new\nsecurity problems directly related to the involved new technologies (e.g.,\ne-commerce frauds, mobile bot-net attacks, blockchain DoS attacks,\ncryptocurrency scams, etc.). In this context, we can acknowledge that the\nscientific community efforts are usually oriented toward specific solutions,\ninstead to exploit all the available technologies, synergistically, in order to\ndefine more efficient security paradigms. This paper aims to indicate a\npossible approach able to improve the security of people and things by\nintroducing a novel paradigm to security defined Internet of Entities (IoE). It\nis a mechanism for the localization of people and things, which exploits both\nthe huge number of existing wireless-based devices and the blockchain-based\ndistributed ledger technology, overcoming the limits of traditional\nlocalization approaches, but without jeopardizing the user privacy. Its\noperation is based on two core elements with interchangeable roles, entities\nand trackers, which can be very common elements such as smart-phones, tablets,\nand IoT devices, and its implementation requires minimal efforts thanks to the\nexisting infrastructures and devices.",

            "summary": "Cryptocurrency is a well-developed blockchain technology application that is\ncurrently a heated topic throughout the world. The public availability of\ntransaction histories offers an opportunity to analyze and compare different\ncryptocurrencies. In this paper, we present a dynamic network analysis of three\nrepresentative blockchain-based cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and\nNamecoin. By analyzing the accumulated network growth, we find that, unlike\nmost other networks, these cryptocurrency networks do not always densify over\ntime, and they are changing all the time with relatively low node and edge\nrepetition ratios. Therefore, we then construct separate networks on a monthly\nbasis, trace the changes of typical network characteristics (including degree\ndistribution, degree assortativity, clustering coefficient, and the largest\nconnected component) over time, and compare the three. We find that the degree\ndistribution of these monthly transaction networks cannot be well fitted by the\nfamous power-law distribution, at the same time, different currency still has\ndifferent network properties, e.g., both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are\nheavy-tailed with disassortative mixing, however, only the former can be\ntreated as a small world. These network properties reflect the evolutionary\ncharacteristics and competitive power of these three cryptocurrencies and\nprovide a foundation for future research.",

A\nspecific FSPVM, denoted as FSPVM-E, was developed in Coq based on a general,\nextensible, and reusable formal memory (GERM) framework, an extensible and\nuniversal formal intermediate programming language, denoted as Lolisa, which is\na large subset of the Solidity programming language that uses generalized\nalgebraic datatypes, and a corresponding formally verified interpreter for\nLolisa, denoted as FEther, which serves as a crucial component of FSPVM-E.\nHowever, our past work has demonstrated that the execution efficiency of the\nstandard development of FEther is extremely low. As a result, FSPVM-E fails to\nachieve its expected verification effect. The present work addresses this issue\nby first identifying three root causes of the low execution efficiency of\nformal interpreters. We then build abstract models of these causes, and present\nrespective optimization schemes for rectifying the identified conditions.\nFinally, we apply these optimization schemes to FEther, and demonstrate that\nits execution efficiency has been improved significantly.",

            "summary": "Permissioned blockchains promise secure decentralized data management in\nbusiness-to-business use-cases. In contrast to Bitcoin and similar public\nblockchains which rely on Proof-of-Work for consensus and are deployed on\nthousands of geo-distributed nodes, business-to-business use-cases (such as\nsupply chain management and banking) require significantly fewer nodes, cheaper\nconsensus, and are often deployed in datacenter-like environments with fast\nnetworking. However, permissioned blockchains often follow the architectural\nthinkining behind their WAN-oriented public relatives, which results in\nend-to-end latencies several orders of magnitude higher than necessary.\n  In this work, we propose StreamChain, a permissioned blockchain design that\neliminates blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion.\nThis results in a drastically lower latency without reducing throughput or\nforfeiting reliability and security guarantees. To demonstrate the wide\napplicability of our design, we prototype StreamChain based on the Hyperledger\nFabric, and show that it delivers latency two orders of magnitude lower than\nFabric, while sustaining similar throughput. This performance makes StreamChain\na potential alternative to traditional databases and, thanks to its streaming\nparadigm, enables further research around reducing latency through relying on\nmodern hardware in datacenters.",

They allow untrusting parties to arrange agreements.\nThese agreements are encoded as a programming language code and deployed on a\nblockchain platform, where all participants execute them and maintain their\nstate. Smart contracts are promising since they are automated and\ndecentralized, thus limiting the involvement of third trusted parties, and can\ncontain monetary transfers. Due to these features, many people believe that\nsmart contracts will revolutionize the way we think of distributed\napplications, information sharing, financial services, and infrastructures.\n  To release the potential of smart contracts, it is necessary to connect the\ncontracts with the outside world, such that they can understand and use\ninformation from other infrastructures. For instance, smart contracts would\ngreatly benefit when they have access to web content. However, there are many\nchallenges associated with realizing such a system, and despite the existence\nof many proposals, no solution is secure, provides easily-parsable data,\nintroduces small overheads, and is easy to deploy.\n  In this paper we propose PDFS, a practical system for data feeds that\ncombines the advantages of the previous schemes and introduces new\nfunctionalities. PDFS extends content providers by including new features for\ndata transparency and consistency validations. This combination provides\nmultiple benefits like content which is easy to parse and efficient\nauthenticity verification without breaking natural trust chains. PDFS keeps\ncontent providers auditable, mitigates their malicious activities (like data\nmodification or censorship), and allows them to create a new business model.

            "summary": "Routing attacks remain practically effective in the Internet today as\nexisting countermeasures either fail to provide protection guarantees or are\nnot easily deployable. Blockchain systems are particularly vulnerable to such\nattacks as they rely on Internet-wide communication to reach consensus. In\nparticular, Bitcoin -the most widely-used cryptocurrency- can be split in half\nby any AS-level adversary using BGP hijacking. In this paper, we present SABRE,\na secure and scalable Bitcoin relay network which relays blocks worldwide\nthrough a set of connections that are resilient to routing attacks. SABRE runs\nalongside the existing peer-to-peer network and is easily deployable. As a\ncritical system, SABRE design is highly resilient and can efficiently handle\nhigh bandwidth loads, including Denial of Service attacks. We built SABRE\naround two key technical insights. First, we leverage fundamental properties of\ninter-domain routing (BGP) policies to host relay nodes: (i) in locations that\nare inherently protected against routing attacks; and (ii) on paths that are\neconomically preferred by the majority of Bitcoin clients. These properties are\ngeneric and can be used to protect other Blockchain-based systems. Second, we\nleverage the fact that relaying blocks is communication-heavy, not\ncomputation-heavy. This enables us to offload most of the relay operations to\nprogrammable network hardware (using the P4 programming language). Thanks to\nthis hardware/software co-design, SABRE nodes operate seamlessly under high\nload while mitigating the effects of malicious clients. We present a complete\nimplementation of SABRE together with an extensive evaluation. Our results\ndemonstrate that SABRE is effective at securing Bitcoin against routing\nattacks, even with deployments as small as 6 nodes.",

Smart contracts, by operating as\nprocesses that are executed on the blockchain, are used to preserve users'\nprivacy and make payments. Furthermore, for the assignment of the crowdsensing\ntasks to the mobile users, we design a truthful, cost-optimal auction that\nminimizes the payments from the crowdsensing providers to the mobile users.\nExtensive experimental results show that the proposed privacy preserving\nauction outperforms state-of-the-art proposals regarding cost by ten times for\nhigh numbers of mobile users and tasks.",

This makes it possible to collaboratively\ndevelop services by sharing various types of resources, such as\ninfrastructures, software and digitalized content. In this work, our home made\nvideo-conferencing (VC) system is used to study resource usage optimisation in\nbusiness context. An application like this, does not provide monetization\npossibilities to all involved stakeholders including end users, cloud\nproviders, software engineers and similar. Blockchain related technologies,\nsuch as Smart Contracts (SC) offer a possibility to address some of these\nneeds. We introduce a novel architecture for monetization of added-value\naccording to preferences of the stakeholders that participate in joint software\nservice offers. The developed architecture facilitates use case scenarios of\nservice and resource offers according to fixed and dynamic pricing schemes,\nfixed usage period, prepaid quota for flexible usage, division of income,\nconsensual decisions among collaborative service providers, and constrained\nbased usage of resources or services. Our container-based VC service, which is\nbased on the Jitsi Meet Open Source software is used to demonstrate the\nproposed architecture and the benefits of the investigated use cases.",

We believe this is a topic\nthat is often overlooked in works about blockchains and cryptocurrencies.\nVulnerabilities and inefficiencies attain a higher significance than ones in a\nregular open source project because of the rather direct financial implications\nof these projects. Barring Bitcoin, a network that has been around for nearly\n10 years, no other project has substantial documentation for its operational\ndetails other than scattered and sparse pages in the source code repositories.\nAlmost all of the content described here has been extracted by studying the\nsource code of the reference implementations of these projects.\n  We evaluate the use of Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables and the Graphene\nprotocol to decrease block propagation times and bandwidth usage of certain\nmessages. We perform realistic simulations that show significant improvements.\nWe provide a complete implementation of Graphene in Geth, Ethereum's main node\nsoftware and test this implementation against the main Ethereum blockchain.\n  We also crawled the chosen cryptocurrency networks for publicly visible nodes\nand provide an Autonomous System-level breakdown of these nodes with the end\ngoal of estimating the ease of performing attacks such as BGP hijacks and their\nimpact.\n  Code written for implementing Graphene in Geth, performing various\nsimulations and for other miscellaneous tasks has been uploaded to Github at\nhttps://github.com/sunfinite/masters-thesis.",

The main idea is to manage all data access via a\ncluster of autonomous computation agents running inside Intel SGX enclaves.\nThese EConfidante agents share a secret data key which is unknown to any\nexternal entity, including the data service administrators, thus eliminating\nmany opportunities for data exposure. In this paper we describe a detailed\ndesign of the EConfidante system, its flow and how it is managed and\nimplemented.

EGES selects a distinct group\nof stealth committee for each block and confirms the same sequence of blocks\namong all nodes with overwhelming probability.

Not only may blockchain be regarded as a by-product\nof Bitcoin cryptocurrency systems, but also it is a type of distributed ledger\ntechnology through using a trustworthy, decentralized log of totally ordered\ntransactions. By summarizing the literature of blockchain, it is found that\nmore papers focus on engineering implementation and realization, while little\nwork has been done on basic theory, for example, mathematical models (Markov\nprocesses, queueing theory and game models), performance analysis and\noptimization of blockchain systems. In this paper, we develop queueing theory\nof blockchain systems and provide system performance evaluation. To do this, we\ndesign a Markovian batch-service queueing system with two different service\nstages, while the two stages are suitable to well express the mining process in\nthe miners pool and the building of a new blockchain. By using the\nmatrix-geometric solution, we obtain a system stable condition and express\nthree key performance measures: (a) The number of transactions in the queue,\n(b) the number of transactions in a block, and (c) the transaction-confirmation\ntime. Finally, We use numerical examples to verify computability of our\ntheoretical results. Although our queueing model is simple under exponential or\nPoisson assumptions, our analytic method will open a series of potentially\npromising research in queueing theory of blockchain systems.",

The on-chain\ntransaction processing capacity of the bitcoin network is limited by the\naverage block creation time of 10 minutes and the block size limit. These\njointly constrain the network's throughput. The transaction processing capacity\nmaximum is estimated between 3.3 and 7 transactions per second (TPS). A Layer2\nNetwork, named Lightning Network, is proposed and activated solutions to\naddress this problem. LN operates on top of the bitcoin network as a cache to\nallow payments to be affected that are not immediately put on the blockchain.\nHowever, it also brings some drawbacks. In this paper, we observe a specific\npayment issue among current LN, which requires additional claims to blockchain\nand is time-consuming. We call the issue as shares issue. Therefore, we propose\nRapido to explicitly address the shares issue. Furthermore, a new smart\ncontract, D-HTLC, is equipped with Rapido as the payment protocol. We finally\nprovide a proof of concept implementation and simulation for both Rapido and\nLN, in which Rapdio not only mitigates the shares issue but also mitigates the\nskewness issue thus is proved to be more applicable for various transactions\nthan LN.",

            "summary": "We present an example where a distributed coordinated protocol supported by a\nblockchain-enabled monetary mechanism leads to achieving optimal information\ntheoretic degrees of freedom gains. The considered setting is that of a linear\ninterference network, where cooperative transmission is allowed, but at no cost\nin terms of the overall backhaul load. In other words, the average number of\nmessages assigned to a transmitter is one. We show that a simple monetary\nmechanism that consists only of one coin type can enable the achievability of\nthe optimal centralized solution. The proposed greedy distributed algorithm\nrelies on incentivizing the users to share their resources in one channel use,\nin return of credit they receive for maximizing their rate gains in future\nchannel uses. This example is the first in its class and it opens the door for\nconstructing a unified framework for blockchain-enabled monetary mechanisms for\noptimal interference management and spectrum sharing.",

In\nparticular, we propose a simple but accurate analytical model to analyze the\ndistributed network split probability. At a given time, we explicitly present\nthe network split probability as a function of the network size, the packet\nloss rate, and the election timeout period. To validate our analysis, we\nimplement a Raft simulator and the simulation results coincide with the\nanalytical results.

            "summary": "Ethereum smart contracts are an innovation built on top of the blockchain\ntechnology, which provides a platform for automatically executing contracts in\nan anonymous, distributed, and trusted way. The problem is magnified by the\nfact that smart contracts, unlike ordinary programs, cannot be patched easily\nonce deployed. It is important for smart contracts to be checked against\npotential vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to\nautomatically identify critical program paths (with multiple function calls\nincluding inter-contract function calls) in a smart contract, rank the paths\naccording to their criticalness, discard them if they are infeasible or\notherwise present them with user friendly warnings for user inspection. We\nidentify paths which involve monetary transaction as critical paths, and\nprioritize those which potentially violate important properties. For\nscalability, symbolic execution techniques are only applied to top ranked\ncritical paths. Our approach has been implemented in a tool called sCompile,\nwhich has been applied to 36,099 smart contracts. The experiment results show\nthat sCompile is efficient, i.e., 5 seconds on average for one smart contract.\nFurthermore, we show that many known vulnerabilities can be captured if user\ninspects as few as 10 program paths generated by sCompile. Lastly, sCompile\ndiscovered 224 unknown vulnerabilities with a false positive rate of 15.4%\nbefore user inspection.",

            "summary": "The public blockchain was originally conceived to process monetary\ntransactions in a peer-to-peer network while preventing double-spending. It has\nsince been extended to numerous other applications including execution of\nprograms that exist on the blockchain called \"smart contracts.\" Smart contracts\nhave a major limitation, namely they only operate on data that is on the\nblockchain. Trusted entities called oracles attest to external data in order to\nbring it onto the blockchain but they do so without the robust security\nguarantees that blockchains generally provide. This has the potential to turn\noracles into centralized points-of-failure. To address this concern, this paper\nintroduces Astraea, a decentralized oracle based on a voting game that decides\nthe truth or falsity of propositions. Players fall into two roles: voters and\ncertifiers. Voters play a low-risk/low-reward role that is resistant to\nadversarial manipulation while certifiers play a high-risk/high-reward role so\nthey are required to play with a high degree of accuracy. This paper also\npresents a formal analysis of the parameters behind the system to measure the\nprobability of an adversary with bounded funds being able to successfully\nmanipulate the oracle's decision, that shows that the same parameters can be\nset to make manipulation arbitrarily difficult---a desirable feature for the\nsystem. Further, this analysis demonstrates that under those conditions a Nash\nequilibrium exists where all rational players are forced to behave honestly.",

Off-blockchain platforms are afflicted by drawbacks due to their\ndependence on single trusted third parties. We argue that in several\napplication areas, hybrid platforms composed from the integration of on- and\noff-blockchain platforms are more able to support smart contracts that deliver\nthe desired quality of service (QoS). Hybrid architectures are largely\nunexplored. To help cover the gap, in this paper we discuss the implementation\nof smart contracts on hybrid architectures.

            "summary": "For preserving privacy, blockchains can be equipped with dedicated mechanisms\nto anonymize participants. However, these mechanism often take only the\nabstraction layer of blockchains into account whereas observations of the\nunderlying network traffic can reveal the originator of a transaction request.\nPrevious solutions either provide topological privacy that can be broken by\nattackers controlling a large number of nodes, or offer strong and\ncryptographic privacy but are inefficient up to practical unusability. Further,\nthere is no flexible way to trade privacy against efficiency to adjust to\npractical needs. We propose a novel approach that combines existing mechanisms\nto have quantifiable and adjustable cryptographic privacy which is further\nimproved by augmented statistical measures that prevent frequent attacks with\nlower resources. This approach achieves flexibility for privacy and efficency\nrequirements of different blockchain use cases.",

Our mechanisms are parameterized by a target value for the desired\nnumber of pools. We show that by properly incentivizing participants, the\ndesired number of stake pools is a Nash equilibrium arising from rational play.\nOur equilibria also exhibit an efficiency / security tradeoff via a parameter\nthat calibrates between including pools with the smallest cost and providing\nprotection against Sybil attacks, the setting where a single stakeholder\ncreates a large number of pools in the hopes to dominate the collaborative\nproject. We then describe how RSS can be deployed in the PoS setting,\nmitigating a number of potential deployment attacks and protocol deviations\nthat include censoring transactions, performing Sybil attacks with the\nobjective to control the majority of stake, lying about the actual cost and\nothers. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate fast convergence to equilibria\nin dynamic environments where players react to each other's strategic moves\nover an indefinite period of interactive play. We also show how simple reward\nsharing schemes that are seemingly more \"fair\", perhaps counterintuitively,\nconverge to centralized equilibria.",

            "summary": "Blockchain is increasingly being used to provide a distributed, secure,\ntrusted, and private framework for energy trading in smart grids. However,\nexisting solutions suffer from lack of privacy, processing and packet\noverheads, and reliance on Trusted Third Parties (TTP). To address these\nchallenges, we propose a Secure Private Blockchain-based (SPB) framework. SPB\nenables the energy producers and consumers to directly negotiate the energy\nprice. To reduce the associated packet overhead, we propose a routing method\nwhich routes packets based on the destination Public Key (PK). SPB eliminates\nthe need for TTP by introducing atomic meta-transactions. The two transactions\nthat form a meta-transaction are visible to the blockchain participants only\nafter both of them are generated. Thus, if one of the participants does not\ncommit to its tasks in a pre-defined time, then the energy trade expires and\nthe corresponding transaction is treated as invalid. The smart meter of the\nconsumer confirms receipt of energy by generating an Energy Receipt\nConfirmation (ERC). To verify that the ERC is generated by a genuine smart\nmeter, SPB supports authentication of anonymous smart meters which in turn\nenhances the privacy of the meter owner. Qualitative security analysis shows\nthe resilience of SPB against a range of attacks.",

            "summary": "The current system to manage the global pool of IP addresses is centralized\nin five transnational organizations, the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).\nEach of these RIRs manage the address pool for a large number of countries.\nBecause the RIRs are private organizations, they are subject to the legal\nframework of the country where they are based. This configuration results in a\njurisdictional overflow from the legal framework of the countries where the RIR\nis based to all the countries that the RIRs are serving (the countries served\nby the RIRs de facto become subjects of the legal system of the country where\nthe RIR is hosted). The situation is aggravated by the deployment of new\nsecurity techniques such as the RPKI and BGPsec, that enable enforcement of\nallocations by the RIRs. In this paper we present InBlock, a blockchain-based\ndistributed governance body aimed to provide de-centralized management of IP\naddresses. InBlock also aims to fulfil the same objectives as the current IP\naddress allocation system, namely, uniqueness, fairness, conservation,\naggregation, registration and minimized overhead. InBlock is implemented as a\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization, i.e., as a set of blockchain's smart\ncontracts in Ethereum. Any entity may request an allocation of addresses to the\nInBlock registry by solely performing a (crypto)currency transfer to the\nInBlock. The fee required, along with the annual renewal fee, serves as a\nmechanism to deter stockpiling and other wasteful practices. As with any novel\ntechnology, there are many open questions about the usage of blockchains to\nbuild an IP address registry. For this reason, we believe that practical\nexperimentation is required in order to have hands-on experiences about such a\nsystem. We propose to conduct an experiment on distributed address management\nusing InBlock as a starting point to inform future directions in this area.",

            "summary": "Smart contracts are programs that manage digital assets according to a\ncertain protocol, expressing for instance the rules of an auction.\nUnderstanding the possible behaviors of a smart contract is difficult, which\ncomplicates development, auditing, and the post-mortem analysis of attacks.\n  This paper presents the first specification mining technique for smart\ncontracts. Our technique extracts the possible behaviors of smart contracts\nfrom contract executions recorded on a blockchain and expresses them as finite\nautomata. A novel dependency analysis allows us to separate independent\ninteractions with a contract. Our technique tunes the abstractions for the\nautomata construction automatically based on configurable metrics, for\ninstance, to maximize readability or precision. We implemented our technique\nfor the Ethereum blockchain and evaluated its usability on several real-world\ncontracts.",

            "summary": "While the smart surveillance system enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT)\ntechnology becomes an essential part of Smart Cities, it also brings new\nconcerns in security of the data. Compared to the traditional surveillance\nsystems that is built following a monolithic architecture to carry out lower\nlevel operations, such as monitoring and recording, the modern surveillance\nsystems are expected to support more scalable and decentralized solutions for\nadvanced video stream analysis at the large volumes of distributed edge\ndevices. In addition, the centralized architecture of the conventional\nsurveillance systems is vulnerable to single point of failure and privacy\nbreach owning to the lack of protection to the surveillance feed. This position\npaper introduces a novel secure smart surveillance system based on\nmicroservices architecture and blockchain technology. Encapsulating the video\nanalysis algorithms as various independent microservices not only isolates the\nvideo feed from different sectors, but also improve the system availability and\nrobustness by decentralizing the operations. The blockchain technology securely\nsynchronizes the video analysis databases among microservices across\nsurveillance domains, and provides tamper proof of data in the trustless\nnetwork environment. Smart contract enabled access authorization strategy\nprevents any unauthorized user from accessing the microservices and offers a\nscalable, decentralized and fine-grained access control solution for smart\nsurveillance systems.",

However,\nkeeping a local copy of the blockchain ledger is infeasible for low-power and\nmemory-constrained devices. For this reason, they are equipped with lightweight\nsoftware implementations that only download the useful data structures, e.g.\nstate of accounts, from the blockchain network, when they are updated. In this\npaper, we consider and analyze a novel scheme, implemented by the nodes of the\nblockchain network, which aggregates the blockchain data in periodic updates\nand further reduces the communication cost of the connected IoT devices. We\nshow that the aggregation period should be selected based on the channel\nquality, the offered rate, and the statistics of updates of the useful data\nstructures. The results, obtained for the Ethereum protocol, illustrate the\nbenefits of the aggregation scheme in terms of a reduced duty cycle of the\ndevice, particularly for low signal-to-noise ratios, and the overall reduction\nof the amount of information transmitted in downlink (e.g., from the wireless\nbase station to the IoT device). A potential application of the proposed scheme\nis to let the IoT device request more information than actually needed, hence\nincreasing its privacy, while keeping the communication cost constant.

We start off by giving a simple overview of blockchain based\nSSI, introducing an architecture overview as well as relevant actors in such a\nsystem. We further distinguish two major approaches, namely the Identifier\nRegistry Model and its extension the Claim Registry Model. Subsequently we\ndiscuss identifiers in such a system, presenting past research in the area and\ncurrent approaches in SSI in the context of Zooko's Triangle. As the user of an\nSSI has to be linked with his digital identifier we also discuss authentication\nsolutions. Most central to the concept of an SSI are the verifiable claims that\nare presented to relying parties. Resources in the field are only losely\nconnected. We will provide a more coherent view of verifiable claims in regards\nto blockchain based SSI and clarify differences in the used terminology.\nStorage solutions for the verifiable claims, both on- and off-chain, are\npresented with their advantages and disadvantages.",

Nowadays, a prohibitively large amount of surveillance data is being\ngenerated continuously by ubiquitously distributed video sensors. It is very\nchallenging to immediately identify the objects of interest or zoom in\nsuspicious actions from thousands of video frames. Making the big data\nindexable is critical to tackle this problem. It is ideal to generate pattern\nindexes in a real-time, on-site manner on the video streaming instead of\ndepending on the batch processing at the cloud centers. The modern\nedge-fog-cloud computing paradigm allows implementation of time sensitive tasks\nat the edge of the network. The on-site edge devices collect the information\nsensed in format of frames and extracts useful features. The near-site fog\nnodes conduct the contextualization and classification of the features. The\nremote cloud center is in charge of more data intensive and computing intensive\ntasks. However, exchanging the index information among devices in different\nlayers raises security concerns where an adversary can capture or tamper with\nfeatures to mislead the surveillance system. In this paper, a blockchain\nenabled scheme is proposed to protect the index data through an encrypted\nsecure channel between the edge and fog nodes. It reduces the chance of attacks\non the small edge and fog devices. The feasibility of the proposal is validated\nthrough intensive experimental analysis.",

            "summary": "We consider fault-tolerant boolean formulas in which the output of a faulty\ngate is short-circuited to one of the gate's inputs. A recent result by Kalai\net al. (FOCS 2012) converts any boolean formula into a resilient formula of\npolynomial size that works correctly if less than a fraction $1/6$ of the gates\n(on every input-to-output path) are faulty. We improve the result of Kalai et\nal., and show how to efficiently fortify any boolean formula against a fraction\n$1/5$ of short-circuit gates per path, with only a polynomial blowup in size.\nWe additionally show that it is impossible to obtain formulas with higher\nresilience and sub-exponential growth in size.\n  Towards our results, we consider interactive coding schemes when noiseless\nfeedback is present; these produce resilient boolean formulas via a\nKarchmer-Wigderson relation. We develop a coding scheme that resists up to a\nfraction $1/5$ of corrupted transmissions in each direction of the interactive\nchannel. We further show that such a level of noise is maximal for coding\nschemes with sub-exponential blowup in communication. Our coding scheme takes a\nsurprising inspiration from Blockchain technology.",

Smart contracts are\nprograms running on top of the blockchain consensus protocol to enable people\nmake agreements while minimizing trusts.

The security vulnerabilities\nwithin those smart contracts pose significant threats to their applications.\nIndeed, many critical security vulnerabilities within smart contracts on\nEthereum platform have caused huge financial losses to their users. In this\nwork, we present ContractFuzzer, a novel fuzzer to test Ethereum smart\ncontracts for security vulnerabilities. ContractFuzzer generates fuzzing inputs\nbased on the ABI specifications of smart contracts, defines test oracles to\ndetect security vulnerabilities, instruments the EVM to log smart contracts\nruntime behaviors, and analyzes these logs to report security vulnerabilities.\nOur fuzzing of 6991 smart contracts has flagged more than 459 vulnerabilities\nwith high precision. In particular, our fuzzing tool successfully detects the\nvulnerability of the DAO contract that leads to USD 60 million loss and the\nvulnerabilities of Parity Wallet that have led to the loss of $30 million and\nthe freezing of USD 150 million worth of Ether.",

To improve the\nvisibility of data quality and analysis, we developed TrialChain, a\nblockchain-based platform that can be used to validate data integrity from\nlarge, biomedical research studies. We implemented a private blockchain using\nthe MultiChain platform and integrated it with a data science platform deployed\nwithin a large research center. An administrative web application was built\nwith Python to manage the platform, which was built with a microservice\narchitecture using Docker. The TrialChain platform was integrated during data\nacquisition into our existing data science platform. Using NiFi, data were\nhashed and logged within the local blockchain infrastructure. To provide public\nvalidation, the local blockchain state was periodically synchronized to the\npublic Ethereum network. The use of a combined private/public blockchain\nplatform allows for both public validation of results while maintaining\nadditional security and lower cost for blockchain transactions. Original data\nand modifications due to downstream analysis can be logged within TrialChain\nand data assets or results can be rapidly validated when needed using API calls\nto the platform. The TrialChain platform provides a data governance solution to\naudit the acquisition and analysis of biomedical research data. The platform\nprovides cryptographic assurance of data authenticity and can also be used to\ndocument data analysis.",

These features can be used as basic building blocks for\nexecuting collaborative business processes between mutually untrusting parties.\nHowever, implementing business processes using the low-level primitives\nprovided by blockchain platforms is cumbersome and error-prone. In contrast,\nestablished business process management systems, such as those based on the\nstandard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), provide convenient\nabstractions for rapid development of process-oriented applications. This\narticle demonstrates how to combine the advantages of a business process\nmanagement system with those of a blockchain platform. The article introduces a\nblockchain-based BPMN execution engine, namely Caterpillar. Like any BPMN\nexecution engine, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process\nmodel and allows users to monitor the state of process instances and to execute\ntasks thereof. The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process\ninstance is maintained on the (Ethereum) blockchain and the workflow routing is\nperformed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The\nCaterpillar compiler supports a large array of BPMN constructs, including\nsubprocesses, multi-instances activities and event handlers. The paper\ndescribes the architecture of Caterpillar, and the interfaces it provides to\nsupport the monitoring of process instances, the allocation and execution of\nwork items, and the execution of service tasks.",

            "summary": "Thanks to the advances in machine learning, data-driven analysis tools have\nbecome valuable solutions for various applications. However, there still remain\nessential challenges to develop effective data-driven methods because of the\nneed to acquire a large amount of data and to have sufficient computing power\nto handle the data. In many instances these challenges are addressed by relying\non a dominant cloud computing vendor, but, although commercial cloud vendors\nprovide valuable platforms for data analytics, they can suffer from a lack of\ntransparency, security, and privacy-perservation. Furthermore, reliance on\ncloud servers prevents applying big data analytics in environments where the\ncomputing power is scattered. To address these challenges, a decentralize,\nsecure, and privacy-preserving computing paradigm is proposed to enable an\nasynchronized cooperative computing process amongst scattered and untrustworthy\ncomputing nodes that may have limited computing power and computing\nintelligence. This paradigm is designed by exploring blockchain, decentralized\nlearning, homomorphic encryption, and software defined networking(SDN)\ntechniques. The performance of the proposed paradigm is evaluated via different\nscenarios in the simulation section.",

Vehicles can use smart city data for\ndecision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic conditions. Moreover,\nthe multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich\ndata set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of\nservices. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private\narchitecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called\nSpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to\nshare their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience and\nnon-repudiation in a decentralized, and tamper-resistant manner. Differently\nfrom traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed\nframework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the\ntransactions from the block header, thus allowing for fast addition of data to\nthe blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block to avoid large sized\nblocks is proposed. This paper also presents an evaluation of the proposed\nframework in a network emulator to demonstrate its benefits.",

This\nsignificantly improves previous results, which either incurs quadratic\ncommunication complexity, or only satisfies safety in a probabilistic sense.\nLinBFT is based on the popular PBFT protocol, and cuts down its $O(n^4)$\ncomplexity with three tricks, each by $O(n)$: linear view change, threshold\nsignatures, and verifiable random functions. All three are known, i.e., the\nsolutions are right in front of our eyes, and yet LinBFT is the first $O(n)$\nsolution with deterministic security guarantees.\n  Further, LinBFT also addresses issues that are specific to permission-less,\npublic blockchain systems, such as anonymous participants without a public-key\ninfrastructure, proof-of-stake with slashing, rotating leader, and a dynamic\nparticipant set.

In order to keep track\nof a faithful and accurate list of transactions, the ledger is broadcast and\nreplicated across machines in a peer-to-peer network. To enforce validity of\ntransactions in the ledger (i.e., no negative balance or double spending), the\nnetwork as a whole coordinates to accept or reject new transactions based on a\nset of rules aiming to detect and block operations of malicious agents (i.e.,\nByzantine attacks). Consensus protocols are particularly important to\ncoordinate operation of the network, since they are used to reconcile\npotentially conflicting versions of the ledger. Regardless of architecture and\nconsensus mechanism used, resulting economic networks remain largely similar,\nwith economic agents driven by incentives under a set of rules. Due to the\nintense activity in this area, proper mathematical frameworks to model and\nanalyze behavior of blockchain-enabled systems are essential. In this paper, we\naddress this need and provide the following contributions: (i) we establish a\nformal framework, with tools from dynamical systems theory, to mathematically\ndescribe core concepts in blockchain-enabled networks, (ii) we apply this\nframework to the Bitcoin network and recover its key properties, and (iii) we\nconnect our modeling framework with powerful tools from control engineering,\nsuch as Lyapunov-like functions, to properly engineer economic systems with\nprovable properties. Apart from the aforementioned contributions, the\nmathematical framework herein proposed lays a foundation for engineering more\ngeneral economic systems built on emerging Turing complete networks, such as\nthe Ethereum network, through which complex alternative economic models are\nexplored.",

Due\nto the distributed nature of ledger technology, there is a strong recent trend\ntowards using ledgers to implement novel decentralized applications for a wide\nrange of use cases, e.g., in the financial sector and sharing economy. While\nthere can be several arguments for the use of a ledger, the key question is\nwhether it can fully replace any single trusted party in the system as\notherwise a (potentially simpler) solution can be built around the trusted\nparty. In this paper, we introduce an abstract view on ledger use cases and\npresent two fundamental criteria that must be met for any use case to be\nimplemented using a ledger-based approach without having to rely on any\nparticular party in the system. Moreover, we evaluate several ledger use cases\nthat have recently received considerable attention according to these criteria,\nrevealing that often participants need to trust each other despite using a\ndistributed ledger. Consequently, the potential of using a ledger as a\nreplacement for a trusted party is limited for these use cases.",

These differing\napproaches has led to different strengths and weaknesses which has resulted in\neach client not complying with one or more key requirement.

            "summary": "Staying abroad during their studies is increasingly popular for students.\nHowever, there are various challenges for both students and universities. One\nimportant question for students is whether or not achievements performed at\ndifferent universities can be taken into account for either enrolling at a\nforeign university or for completing the studies at their home university. In\naddition to university achievements, an increasing proportion of the 195\nmillion students worldwide increasingly receive certificates from MOOCs or\nother social media services. The integration of such services into university\nteaching is still in the initial stages and presents some challenges. In this\npaper we describe the idea to manage all these study achievements worldwide in\na blockchain, which might solve the national and international challenges\nregarding the recognition of student achievements. The aim of this paper is to\nencourage discussion in the global community instead of presenting a finished\nconcept. Some of the open research questions are: How to ensure student data\nprotection, how to deal with fraud and how to deal with the possibility that\nstudents can analytically calculate the easiest way through their studies?",

Despite the rise of blockchain protocols\nas a way to send payments without trusted third parties, the important problem\nof exchanging a digital good for payment without trusted third parties has been\npaid much less attention. We refer to this problem as the Buyer and Seller's\nDilemma and present for it a dual-deposit escrow trade protocol which uses\ndouble-sided payment deposits in conjunction with simple cryptographic\nprimitives, and that can be implemented using a blockchain-based smart\ncontract. We analyze our protocol as an extensive-form game and prove that the\nSub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium for this game is for both the buyer and\nseller to cooperate and behave honestly.

Extending decentralization to the human identity\nconcept, we can think of using blockchain for creating a list of verified human\nidentities with a one-person-one-ID property. UniqueID is a Decentralized\nAutonomous Organization(DAO) for maintaining human identities such that every\nphysical human entity can have no more that one account. One part of this\nidentity is simply the user's claim on one of his unique, permanent, and\nmeasurable characteristics -biometrics. Blockchain has proved its integrity as\na platform for storing and performing computations on such claims. The biggest\nchallenge here is to ensure that the user has submitted his own valid biometric\ndata. Human verifiers can check if there is any inconsistency in other users'\ndata, by peer-to-peer checks. For preventing bad behavior and centralization in\nthe verification process, UniqueID benefits from novel governance mechanisms to\nchoose verifiers and punish unjust ones. Also, there are incentives for honest\nverifiers and users by newly generated tokens. We show how the users' privacy\ncan be preserved by using state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques, and so\nthey can use their identity without any concerns for votings, financial and\nbanking purposes, social media accounts, reputation systems etc.",

            "summary": "Abrupt changes in the miner hash rate applied to a proof-of-work (PoW)\nblockchain can adversely affect user experience and security. Because different\nPoW blockchains often share hashing algorithms, miners face a complex choice in\ndeciding how to allocate their hash power among chains. We present an economic\nmodel that leverages Modern Portfolio Theory to predict a miner's allocation\nover time using price data and inferred risk tolerance. The model matches\nactual allocations with mean absolute error within 20% for four out of the top\nfive miners active on both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchains. A\nmodel of aggregate allocation across those four miners shows excellent\nagreement in magnitude with the actual aggregate as well a correlation\ncoefficient of 0.649. The accuracy of the aggregate allocation model is also\nsufficient to explain major historical changes in inter-block time (IBT) for\nBCH. Because estimates of miner risk are not time-dependent and our model is\notherwise price-driven, we are able to use it to anticipate the effect of a\nmajor price shock on hash allocation and IBT in the BCH blockchain. Using a\nMonte Carlo simulation, we show that, despite mitigation by the new difficulty\nadjustment algorithm, a price drop of 50% could increase the IBT by 50% for at\nleast a day, with a peak delay of 100%.",

To address this fundamental shortcoming, we introduce\nCharlotte, a system for maintaining decentralized, authenticated data\nstructures, including transaction logs. Each data structurestructure -- indeed,\neach block -- specifies its own availability and integrity properties, allowing\nCharlotte applications to retain the full benefits of permissioned or\npermissionless blockchains. In Charlotte, a block can be atomically appended to\nmultiple logs, allowing applications to be interoperable when they want to,\nwithout inefficiently forcing all applications to share one big log. We call\nthis open graph of interconnected blocks a blockweb. We allow new kinds of\nblockweb applications that operate beyond traditional chains. We demonstrate\nthe viability of Charlotte applications with proof-of-concept servers running\ninteroperable blockchains.

The contributions include: (i) a method\nfor automated management of contracts with hierarchical conditionality\nstructures through an hierarchy of intelligent agents and the use of\nhierarchical cryptographic key-pairs; (ii) a method for efficient and secure\nmatching and transfer of smart- contract underlyings (entities) among disparate\nsmart contracts/subcontracts; (iii) a method for producing an hierarchy of\ncommon secrets to facilitate hierarchical communication channels of increased\nsecurity in the context of smart contracts/subcontracts/underlyings; and (iv) a\nmethod for building secure and optimized repositories through distributed hash\ntables in the context of contracts/ subcontracts/underlyings. These methods\nhelp providing services that allow both narrower and worldwide reach and\ndistribution of resources. The longevity of the blockchain technology is\nachieved through continuous innovation. Blockchain-enabled services are\npotentially an efficient, secure, automated, and cost-effective alternative or\ncomplement to current service infrastructures in a range of domains (legal,\nmedical, financial, government, IoT).",

            "summary": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is facing significant scalability and\nsecurity challenges. On the one hand, IoT devices are \"weak\" and need external\nassistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the\ndeficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices.\nOn the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively \"vulnerable\" facing\nmalicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and\nsmart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT\nand edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and\nprototype an edge-IoT framework named \"EdgeChain\" based on blockchain and smart\ncontracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the\ninternal currency or \"coin\" system to link the edge cloud resource pool with\neach IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT\ndevices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control\nhow much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on\npre-defined rules on priority, application types and past behaviors. Smart\ncontracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device\nbehavior in a non-deniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and\ntransactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing.\nWe implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits\nof blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain\nis within a reasonable and acceptable range.",

Contemporary IoT deployments widely\nuse the publish-subscribe messaging model because of its resource-efficiency.\nHowever, the systems with publish-subscribe messaging model employ a\ncentralized architecture, wherein the data from all the devices in the\napplication network flows via a central broker to the subscribers. Such a\ncentralized architecture make publish-subscribe messaging model susceptible to\na central point of failure. Besides, it provides an opportunity for the\norganization that owns the broker to tamper with the data. In this work, we\ncontribute Trinity, a novel distributed publish-subscribe broker with\nblockchain-based immutability. Trinity distributes the data published to one of\nthe brokers in the network to all the brokers in the network. The distributed\ndata is stored in an immutable ledger through the use of the blockchain\ntechnology. Furthermore, Trinity executes smart contracts to validate the data\nbefore saving the data on the blockchain. Through the use of a blockchain\nnetwork, Trinity can guarantee persistence, ordering, and immutability across\ntrust boundaries. Our evaluation results show that Trinity consumes minimal\nresources, and the use of smart contracts enable the stakeholders to automate\nthe data management processes. To the best of our knowledge, Trinity is the\nfirst framework that combines the components of the blockchain technology with\nthe publish-subscribe messaging model.",

However, in\npractice, CAs' absolute responsibility for providing trustworthiness caused\nmajor security and privacy issues. To prevent such issues, Google introduced\nthe concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI\nmodels (e.g., AKI, ARPKI, and DTKI) are proposed to reduce the level of trust\nto the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world\nattacks if the adversary is capable of showing different views of the log to\nthe targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with\ncertificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to\neliminate the split-world attacks and to provide an ideal\ncertificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates, their revocation\nstatus, entire revocation process, and trusted CA management are conducted in\nthe CertLedger. CertLedger provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy\ncertificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and\nincompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software\nvendors. TLS clients in the CertLedger also do not require to make certificate\nvalidation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore. We analyze the\nsecurity and performance of the CertLedger and provide a comparison with the\nprevious proposals.",

Companies are exploring implementation of use\ncases in hope of significant gains in efficiencies. However, to achieve the\nimpact hoped for, it is not sufficient to merely replace existing technologies.\nThe current business processes must also be redesigned and innovated to enable\nrealization of hoped for benefits. This conceptual paper provides a theoretical\ncontribution on how blockchain technology and smart contracts potentially can,\nwithin the framework of the seven principles of business process re-engineering\n(BPR), enable process innovations. In this paper, we analyze the BPR principles\nin light of their applicability to blockchain-based solutions. We find these\nprinciples to be applicable and helpful in understanding how blockchain\ntechnology could enable transformational redesign of current processes.\nHowever, the viewpoint taken, should be expanded from intra- to\ninter-organizational processes operating within an ecosystem of separate\norganizational entities. In such a blockchain powered ecosystem, smart\ncontracts take on a pivotal role, both as repositories of data and executioner\nof activities.",

In this paper,\nwe propose DKSAP-IoT, a faster dual-key stealth address protocol for\nblockchain-based IoT systems. DKSAP-IoT utilizes a technique similar to the TLS\nsession resumption to improve the performance and reduce the transaction size\nat the same time between two communication peers. Our theoretical analysis as\nwell as the extensive experiments on an embedded computing platform demonstrate\nthat DKSAP-IoT is able to reduce the computational overhead by at least 50%\nwhen compared to the state-of-the-art scheme, thereby paving the way for its\napplication to blockchain-based IoT systems.",

Hyperledger Fabric is one such permissioned blockchain platform\nand one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation. The Fabric\ncomprises various components such as smart-contracts, endorsers, committers,\nvalidators, and orderers. As the performance of blockchain platform is a major\nconcern for enterprise applications, in this work, we perform a comprehensive\nempirical study to characterize the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and\nidentify potential performance bottlenecks to gain a better understanding of\nthe system. We follow a two-phased approach. In the first phase, our goal is to\nunderstand the impact of various configuration parameters such as block size,\nendorsement policy, channels, resource allocation, state database choice on the\ntransaction throughput & latency to provide various guidelines on configuring\nthese parameters. In addition, we also aim to identify performance bottlenecks\nand hotspots. We observed that (1) endorsement policy verification, (2)\nsequential policy validation of transactions in a block, and (3) state\nvalidation and commit (with CouchDB) were the three major bottlenecks. In the\nsecond phase, we focus on optimizing Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 based on our\nobservations. We introduced and studied various simple optimizations such as\naggressive caching for endorsement policy verification in the cryptography\ncomponent (3x improvement in the performance) and parallelizing endorsement\npolicy verification (7x improvement). Further, we enhanced and measured the\neffect of an existing bulk read/write optimization for CouchDB during state\nvalidation & commit phase (2.5x improvement). By combining all three\noptimizations1, we improved the overall throughput by 16x (i.e., from 140 tps\nto 2250 tps).",

            "summary": "The efficiency of decentralized book systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum has\nalways been a challenge. It is usually measured by three major factors:\nscalability, throughput, and latency. Scalability refers to how the system\ncapacity is increased by adding more physical resources. Throughput measures\nthe volume of transactions for a given period of time, where most current\nsolutions attempt to improve such as NEO, EOS, etc. Latency measures the\nprocessing time of any single transaction. In current blockchain based systems,\nthe block generation rate is the main latency bottleneck. Off-chain processes\nsuch as state channels are the most recent work that can integrate partial\ninbound transactions, reducing latency. Unfortunately, the state channel\nintroduces more issues at the same time, such as cross-channel synchronization,\nwhich makes the state channel unavailable for full adoption of current\nblockchain solutions.\n  In order to solve the efficiency problem, we proposed an end-to-end solution\ncalled ALZA, which links the dedicated high-throughput blockchain with\nself-organizing payment fields. This mechanism allows arbitrary set of users to\ncreate payment fields that process extremely low latency transactions within\neach field. Therefore, users can make transactions almost immediately. Since\nall transactions are conducted within fields, transaction costs will be reduced\nby several orders of magnitude. In addition, ALZA distributes main ledger to\neach client through an innovative replication mechanism. Therefore, the system\nwill be significantly more robust to blockchain system failures. In theory,\nALZA can complete millions of transactions in one second, which naturally\nsupports high-frequency trading.",

Designing\na 24hour globally connected architecture enables ease of access to a variety of\nresources and services. Furthermore, technology like Internet has been a\nfertile ground for innovation and creativity. One of such disruptive innovation\nis blockchain -- a keystone of cryptocurrencies. The blockchain technology is\npresented as a game changer for many of the existing and emerging\ntechnologies/services. With its immutability property and decentralised\narchitecture, it is taking centre stage in many services as an equalisation\nfactor to the current parity between consumers and large\ncorporations/governments. One of such potential applications of the blockchain\nis in e-voting schemes. The objective of such a scheme would be to provide a\ndecentralised architecture to run and support a voting scheme that is open,\nfair and independently verifiable. In this paper, we propose potentially a new\ne-voting protocol that utilises the blockchain as a transparent ballot box. The\nprotocol has been designed with adhering to the fundamental e-voting properties\nin mind as well as offering a degree of decentralisation and allowing for the\nvoter to change/update their vote (within the permissible voting period).

            "summary": "Many of today's crypto currencies use blockchains as decentralized ledgers\nand secure them with proof of work. In case of a fork of the chain, Bitcoin's\nrule for achieving consensus is selecting the longest chain and discarding the\nother chain as stale. It has been demonstrated that this consensus rule has a\nweakness against selfish mining in which the selfish miner exploits the\nvariance in block generation by partially withholding blocks. In Ethereum,\nhowever, under certain conditions stale blocks don't have to be discarded but\ncan be referenced from the main chain as uncle blocks yielding a partial\nreward. This concept limits the impact of network delays on the expected\nrevenue for miners. But the concept also reduces the risk for a selfish miner\nto gain no rewards from withholding a freshly minted block. This paper uses a\nMonte Carlo simulation to quantify the effect of uncle blocks both to the\nprofitability of selfish mining and the blockchain's security in Ethereum\n(ETH). A brief outlook about a recent Ethereum Classic (ETC) improvement\nproposal that weighs uncle blocks during the selection of the main chain will\nbe given.",

            "summary": "A smart contract on a blockchain cannot keep a secret because its data is\nreplicated on all nodes in a network. To remedy this problem, it has been\nsuggested to combine blockchains with trusted execution environments (TEEs),\nsuch as Intel SGX, for executing applications that demand privacy. Untrusted\nblockchain nodes cannot get access to the data and computations inside the TEE.\n  This paper first explores some pitfalls that arise from the combination of\nTEEs with blockchains. Since TEEs are, in principle, stateless they are\nsusceptible to rollback attacks, which should be prevented to maintain privacy\nfor the application. However, in blockchains with non-final consensus\nprotocols, such as the proof-of-work in Ethereum and others, the contract\nexecution must handle rollbacks by design. This implies that TEEs for securing\nblockchain execution cannot be directly used for such blockchains; this\napproach works only when the consensus decisions are final.\n  Second, this work introduces an architecture and a prototype for\nsmart-contract execution within Intel SGX technology for Hyperledger Fabric, a\nprominent platform for enterprise blockchain applications. Our system resolves\ndifficulties posed by the execute-order-validate architecture of Fabric and\nprevents rollback attacks on TEE-based execution as far as possible. For\nincreasing security, our design encapsulates each application on the blockchain\nwithin its own enclave that shields it from the host system. An evaluation\nshows that the overhead moving execution into SGX is within 10%-20% for a\nsealed-bid auction application.",

            "summary": "Tendermint-core blockchains (e.g. Cosmos) are considered today one of the\nmost viable alternatives for the highly energy consuming proof-of-work\nblockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their particularity is that they aim\nat offering strong consistency (no forks) in an open system combining two\ningredients (i) a set of validators that generate blocks via a variant of\nPractical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus protocol and (ii) a\nselection strategy that dynamically selects nodes to be validators for the next\nblock via a proof-of-stake mechanism. However,the exact assumptions on the\nsystem model under which Tendermint underlying algorithms are correct and the\nexact properties Tendermint verifies have never been formally analyzed. The\ncontribution of this paper is two-fold. First, while formalizing Tendermint\nalgorithms we precisely characterize the system model and the exact problem\nsolved by Tendermint. We prove that in eventual synchronous systems a modified\nversion of Tendermint solves (i) under additional assumptions, a variant of\none-shot consensus for the validation of one single block and (ii) a variant of\nthe repeated consensus problem for multiple blocks. These results hold even if\nthe set of validators is hit by Byzantine failures, provided that for each\none-shot consensus instance less than one third of the validators is Byzantine.\nOur second contribution relates to the fairness of the rewarding mechanism. It\nis common knowledge that in permisionless blockchain systems the main threat is\nthe tragedy of commons that may yield the system to collapse if the rewarding\nmechanism is not adequate. Ad minimum the rewarding mechanism must be fair,\ni.e.distributing the rewards in proportion to the merit of participants. We\nprove, for the first time in blockchain systems, that in repeated-consensus\nbased blockchains there exists an (eventual) fair rewarding mechanism if and\nonly if the system is (eventual) synchronous. We also show that the original\nTendermint rewarding is not fair, however, a modification of the original\nprotocol makes it eventually fair.",

The efficiency\nis improved by using a new quantum honest-success Byzantine agreement protocol\nto replace the classical Byzantine agreement protocol, while the power is\nimproved by incorporating quantum protection and quantum certificate into the\nsyntax of transactions. Our quantum-secured logic-based blockchain can already\nbe implemented by the current technology. The cryptocurrency created and\ntransferred in our blockchain is called qulogicoin. Incorporating quantum\nprotection and quantum certificates into blockchain makes it possible to use\nblockchain to overcome the limitations of some quantum cryptographic protocols.\nAs an illustration, we show that a significant shortcoming of cheat-sensitive\nquantum bit commitment protocols can be overcome with the help of our\nblockchain and qulogicoin.",

In this paper, we propose a secure leader election protocol,\nCaucus; we next fit this protocol into a broader blockchain-based consensus\nprotocol, Fantomette, that provides game-theoretic guarantees in addition to\ntraditional blockchain security properties.

            "summary": "Society is in constant transition to keep up with technological advancement,\nwe are seeing traditional paradigms being increasingly challenged. The\nfundamentals of governance are one such paradigm. As society's values have\nshifted, so have expectations of government shifted from the traditional model\nto something commonly referred to as 'open governance'. Though a disputed term,\nwe take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates\nopenness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of\nopen governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet,\nthat are crucial. These technologies enable access to both the data and to\nengagement activities between citizens and government. There are also other\ntechnologies, like blockchain and smart contacts, which could be utilised to\nassist open governance. A sound starting point would be moving from a system\nwhere information is tediously released by a government, on an 'as they please'\nbasis, to an infrastructure where critical actions are captured with strong\nintegrity, non-repudiation and evidential guarantees. With an added dimension\nthat facilitates these actions record be accessible to public scrutiny in near\nreal-time. One candidate technology for capturing such actions is blockchain.\nThe blockchains utility is being recognised through smart contracts -\npotentially a vital building block to realising open and transparent government\nactivities. In this paper, we employ the concept of smart contracts to\ngovernment tendering activities. The proposed scheme is based on smart\ncontracts, enabling a fair, transparent and independently verifiable\n(auditable) government tendering scheme. The scheme is then implemented on the\nEthereum platform to evaluate the performance and financial cost implications,\nalong with an evaluation of the potential security and auditability challenges.",

            "summary": "Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies secure a decentralized consensus protocol\nby incentives. The protocol participants, called miners, generate (mine) a\nseries of blocks, each containing monetary transactions created by system\nusers. As incentive for participation, miners receive newly minted currency and\ntransaction fees paid by transaction creators. Blockchain bandwidth limits lead\nusers to pay increasing fees in order to prioritize their transactions.\nHowever, most prior work focused on models where fees are negligible. In a\nnotable exception, Carlsten et al. postulated in CCS'16 that if incentives come\nonly from fees then a mining gap would form~--- miners would avoid mining when\nthe available fees are insufficient.\n  In this work, we analyze cryptocurrency security in realistic settings,\ntaking into account all elements of expenses and rewards. To study when gaps\nform, we analyze the system as a game we call \\emph{the gap game}. We analyze\nthe game with a combination of symbolic and numeric analysis tools in a wide\nrange of scenarios.\n  Our analysis confirms Carlsten et al.'s postulate; indeed, we show that gaps\nform well before fees are the only incentive, and analyze the implications on\nsecurity. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that different miners choose different\ngap sizes to optimize their utility, even when their operating costs are\nidentical. Alarmingly, we see that the system incentivizes large miner\ncoalitions, reducing system decentralization. We describe the required\nconditions to avoid the incentive misalignment, providing guidelines for future\ncryptocurrency design.",

In this paper, we study the\npublic Ethereum blockchain as well as a consortium and private blockchains and\nquantify the feasibility of man-in-the-middle and double spending attacks\nagainst them. To this end, we list important properties of the Ethereum public\nblockchain topology, we deploy VMs with constrained CPU quantum to mimic the\ntop-10 mining pools of Ethereum and we develop full-fledged attacks, that first\npartition the network through BGP hijacking or ARP spoofing before issuing a\nBalance Attack to steal coins. Our results demonstrate that attacking Ethereum\nis remarkably devastating in a consortium or private context as the adversary\ncan multiply her digital assets by 200, 000x in 10 hours through BGP hijacking\nwhereas it would be almost impossible in a public context.",

Cloud computing relies\nmainly on a conceptually centralized service provisioning model, while\nblockchain technologies originate from a peer-to-peer and a completely\ndistributed approach. Still, noteworthy commonalities between both approaches\nare often overlooked by researchers. Therefore, to the best of the authors\nknowledge, this paper reviews both domains in parallel for the first time. We\nconclude that both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages\nof centralized service provisioning approaches are often the disadvantages of\ndistributed ledger approaches and vice versa. It is obviously an interesting\nquestion whether both approaches could be combined in a way that the advantages\ncan be added while the disadvantages could be avoided.

            "summary": "The DFINITY blockchain computer provides a secure, performant and flexible\nconsensus mechanism. At its core, DFINITY contains a decentralized randomness\nbeacon which acts as a verifiable random function (VRF) that produces a stream\nof outputs over time. The novel technique behind the beacon relies on the\nexistence of a unique-deterministic, non-interactive, DKG-friendly threshold\nsignatures scheme. The only known examples of such a scheme are pairing-based\nand derived from BLS.\n  The DFINITY blockchain is layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the\nbeacon as its source of randomness for leader selection and leader ranking. A\n\"weight\" is attributed to a chain based on the ranks of the leaders who propose\nthe blocks in the chain, and that weight is used to select between competing\nchains. The DFINITY blockchain is layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses\nthe beacon as its source of randomness for leader selection and leader ranking\nblockchain is further hardened by a notarization process which dramatically\nimproves the time to finality and eliminates the nothing-at-stake and selfish\nmining attacks.\n  DFINITY consensus algorithm is made to scale through continuous quorum\nselections driven by the random beacon. In practice, DFINITY achieves block\ntimes of a few seconds and transaction finality after only two confirmations.\nThe system gracefully handles temporary losses of network synchrony including\nnetwork splits, while it is provably secure under synchrony.",

            "summary": "The prevalence of IoT devices makes them an ideal target for attackers. To\nreduce the risk of attacks vendors routinely deliver security updates (patches)\nfor their devices. The delivery of security updates becomes challenging due to\nthe issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than\nvendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless\nand decentralized blockchain-based network in which nodes can host and deliver\nsecurity updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network.\nHowever, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the\nnetwork, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space,\nbandwidth, and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndecentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes\nreferred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency\nfor delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a\nvendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that\ndeliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart\ncontracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart\ncontract promises compensation to any distributor that provides\nproof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was\ndelivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution\nby exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge\nContingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the\nneed for trust between the security update distributor and the security\nconsumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly\nincrease the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.",

Reliability of a\nservice provider is usually determined by a reputation model.

From\nthe other hand a blockchain consensus protocol can additionally include a\nvalidation procedure that detects incorrect liability executions in order to\nsuspend payment transactions to questionable service providers. The paper\npresents the validation methodology of a liability execution for agent-based\nservice providers in a decentralized trading market, using the Model Checking\nmethod based on the mathematical model of finite state automata and Temporal\nLogic properties of interest.

In particular, the plausible characteristics of\ndecentralization, immutability and self-organization are primarily owing to the\nunique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks.\nThis survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on\nthe development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks.\nIn this survey, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of\nblockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivized\nconsensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art\nconsensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus\nsystem design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a\ngame-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review on the strategy\nadoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain\nbackbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on the\nemerging applications of the blockchain networks in a wide range of areas.

This limits the reliability and availability of\nthe client in the event of changes in the platform, and makes the platform more\ndifficult to use. In this work we address and bridge the gap by describing the\ndesign and implementation of \\emph{Service Discovery}.\n  \\emph{Service Discovery} provides APIs which allow dynamic discovery of the\nconfiguration required for the client SDK to interact with the platform,\nalleviating the client from the burden of maintaining it. This enables the\nclient to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus significantly\nimproving the reliability of the application layer. It also makes the HLF\nplatform more consumable, simplifying the job of creating blockchain\napplications.",

Our consensus design enjoys the same consistency, liveness,\ntransaction finality and security guarantee, a de-facto with the Hybrid\nConsensus. We go on to propose the idea of a new virtual machine on top of\nEthereum which adds permissioned-chain based transaction processing\ncapabilities in a permissionless setting.

The central component in a Blockchain is a\nshared distributed ledger. A ledger comprises series of blocks, which in turns\ncontains a series of transactions. An identical copy of the ledger is stored on\nall nodes in a blockchain network. Maintaining ledger integrity and security is\none of the crucial design aspects of any blockchain platform. Thus, there are\ntypically built-in validation mechanisms leveraging cryptography to ensure the\nvalidity of incoming blocks before committing them into the ledger. However, a\nblockchain node may run over an extended period of time, during which the\nblocks on the disk can may become corrupted due to software or hardware\nfailures, or due to malicious activity. This paper proposes LedgerGuard, a tool\nto maintain ledger integrity by detecting corrupted blocks and recovering these\nblocks by synchronizing with rest of the network. The experimental\nimplementation of LedgerGuard is based on Hyperledger Fabric, which is a\npopular open source permissioned blockchain platform.",

            "summary": "The concept of a decentralized ledger usually implies that each node of a\nblockchain network stores the entire blockchain. However, in the case of\npopular blockchains, which each weigh several hundreds of GB, the large amount\nof data to be stored can incite new or low-capacity nodes to run lightweight\nclients. Such nodes do not participate to the global storage effort and can\nresult in a centralization of the blockchain by very few nodes, which is\ncontrary to the basic concepts of a blockchain.\n  To avoid this problem, we propose new low storage nodes that store a reduced\namount of data generated from the blockchain by using erasure codes. The\nproperties of this technique ensure that any block of the chain can be easily\nrebuild from a small number of such nodes. This system should encourage low\nstorage nodes to contribute to the storage of the blockchain and to maintain\ndecentralization despite of a globally increasing size of the blockchain. This\nsystem paves the way to new types of blockchains which would only be managed by\nlow capacity nodes.",

In many cases, these data sharing agreements are hard to\ntrack, manage or enforce. In this work, we propose a novel alternative for\ntracking, managing and especially enforcing such data sharing agreements using\nsmart contracts and blockchain technology. We design a framework that generates\nsmart contracts from parameters based on legal data sharing agreements. The\nterms in these agreements are automatically enforced by the system.

In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. In particular,\nwe adopt the cyber-insurance as an economic tool for neutralizing cyber risks\ndue to attacks in blockchain networks. We consider a blockchain service market,\nwhich is composed of the infrastructure provider, the blockchain provider, the\ncyber-insurer, and the users. The blockchain provider purchases from the\ninfrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the\nblockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The\nblockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the\nservice price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the\nblockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider\nalso purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer to protect itself from\nthe potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts\nthe insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain\nservice. Based on the assumption of rationality for the market entities, we\nmodel the interaction among the blockchain provider, the users, and the\ncyber-insurer as a two-level Stackelberg game. Namely, the blockchain provider\nand the cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies, and then\nthe users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service.\nSpecifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a\nseries of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market\ngame.",

Besides blockchain technology, a new paradigm is gaining\nmomentum: directed acyclic graphs. The contribution presented in this paper is\ntwofold. Firstly, the paper analyzes distributed ledger technology with an\nemphasis on the features relevant to distributed systems. Secondly, the paper\nanalyses the usage of directed acyclic graph paradigm in the context of\ndistributed ledgers, and compares it with the blockchain-based solutions. The\ntwo paradigms are compared using representative implementations: Bitcoin,\nEthereum and Nano. We examine representative solutions in terms of the applied\ndata structures for maintaining the ledger, consensus mechanisms, transaction\nconfirmation confidence, ledger size, and scalability.",

            "summary": "As an emerging decentralized secure data management platform, blockchain has\ngained much popularity recently. To maintain a canonical state of blockchain\ndata record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes,\nreferred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block\nof transactions through a process of \"block mining\" by solving a cryptographic\npuzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g.,\nmobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to\noffload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing\nservers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing\nservice provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for\nefficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a\nproof-of-work based blockchain network. Due to the competition among miners in\nthe blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken\ninto account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider\ntwo bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a\nfixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can\nsubmit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding\nscheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare.\nIn the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is\nNP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the\ntruthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through\nextensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the\ntwo bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the\nblockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing\nservice provider.",

            "summary": "The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoTs) allows heterogeneous embedded\nsmart devices to collaboratively provide smart services with or without human\nintervention. While leveraging the large scale IoT based applications like\nSmart Gird or Smart Cities, IoTs also incur more concerns on privacy and\nsecurity. Among the top security challenges that IoTs face, access\nauthorization is critical in resource sharing and information protection. One\nof the weaknesses in today's access control (AC) is the centralized\nauthorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck or the single\npoint of failure. In this paper, BlendCAC, a blockchain enabled decentralized\ncapability based AC is proposed for the security of IoTs. The BlendCAC aims at\nan effective access control processes to devices, services and information in\nlarge scale IoT systems. Based on the blockchain network, a capability\ndelegation mechanism is suggested for access permission propagation. A robust\nidentity based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes\nadvantage of smart contract for registering, propagation and revocation of the\naccess authorization. In the proposed BlendCAC scheme, IoT devices are their\nown master to control their resources instead of being supervised by a\ncentralized authority. Implemented and tested on a Raspberry Pi device and on a\nlocal private blockchain network, our experimental results demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the proposed BlendCAC approach to offer a decentralized,\nscalable, lightweight and fine grained AC solution to IoT systems.",

Moreover, the recent advancements in autonomous cars also encourage\nthe enabling technologies to integrate and provide holistic applications. To\nthis end, one key requirement for electric vehicles is to have an efficient,\nsecure, and scalable infrastructure and framework for charging, billing, and\nauditing. However, the current manual charging systems for EVs may not be\napplicable to the autonomous cars that demand new, automatic, secure,\nefficient, and scalable billing and auditing mechanism. Owing to the\ndistributed systems such as blockchain technology, in this paper, we propose a\nnew charging and billing mechanism for electric vehicles that charge their\nbatteries in a charging-on-the-move fashion. To meet the requirements of\nbilling in electric vehicles, we leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT),\na distributed peer-to-peer technology for micro-transactions. Our\nproof-of-concept implementation of the billing framework demonstrates the\nfeasibility of such system in electric vehicles. It is also worth noting that\nthe solution can easily be extended to the electric autonomous cars (EACs).",

Such users can behave as consumer or producer (hence,\nwe denote them as prosumers) at different time instances. A prosumer may sell\nthe energy to other prosumers in exchange of money. We consider a demand\nresponse model, where the price of conventional energy depends on the total\ndemand of all the prosumers at a certain time. A prosumer depending on its own\nutility has to select the amount of energy it wants to buy either from the grid\nor from other prosumers, or the amount of excess energy it wants to sell to\nother prosumers. However, the strategy, and the payoff of a prosumer inherently\ndepends on the strategy of other prosumers as a prosumer can only buy if the\nother prosumers are willing to sell. We formulate the problem as a coupled\nconstrained game, and seek to obtain the generalized Nash equilibrium. We show\nthat the game is a concave potential game and show that there exists a unique\ngeneralized Nash equilibrium. We consider that a platform will set the price\nfor distributed interchange of energy among the prosumers in order to minimize\nthe consumption of the conventional energy. We propose a distributed algorithm\nwhere the platform sets a price to each prosumer, and then each prosumer at a\ncertain time only optimizes its own payoff. The prosumer then updates the price\ndepending on the supply and demand for each prosumer. We show that the\nalgorithm converges to an optimal generalized Nash equilibrium. The distributed\nalgorithm also provides an optimal price for the exchange market.",

Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the\nbanking system, thus facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees\nsuch as remittances, with a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities\ntogether with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and\nmade its price skyrocket during 2017. However, while the Bitcoin blockchain\nattracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this\nattention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and\nconsequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to\ncharacterize the adoption of the bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first\npart of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software\nclient downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and\nthe Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the\nsystem evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for\nuser adoption, we identified several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per\ncapita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables\ncorrelated with the degree of user adoption. In the second part of the work, we\nbuild a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP\naddresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of\nthe gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked\nto the flow of bitcoins between countries.

Today they\nmanage billions of dollars in value and motivate visionary plans for pervasive\nblockchain deployment. While smart contracts inherit the availability and other\nsecurity assurances of blockchains, however, they are impeded by blockchains'\nlack of confidentiality and poor performance.\n  We present Ekiden, a system that addresses these critical gaps by combining\nblockchains with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Ekiden leverages a\nnovel architecture that separates consensus from execution, enabling efficient\nTEE-backed confidentiality-preserving smart-contracts and high scalability. Our\nprototype (with Tendermint as the consensus layer) achieves example performance\nof 600x more throughput and 400x less latency at 1000x less cost than the\nEthereum mainnet.\n  Another contribution of this paper is that we systematically identify and\ntreat the pitfalls arising from harmonizing TEEs and blockchains. Treated\nseparately, both TEEs and blockchains provide powerful guarantees, but\nhybridized, though, they engender new attacks. For example, in naive designs,\nprivacy in TEE-backed contracts can be jeopardized by forgery of blocks, a\nseemingly unrelated attack vector. We believe the insights learned from Ekiden\nwill prove to be of broad importance in hybridized TEE-blockchain systems.",

These applications inherently have a strong\nconnection to the physical world. Hence, IT security threats cannot only cause\nproblems like data leaks but also safety issues which might harm people.\nAttacks on IT systems are not only performed by outside attackers but also\ninsiders like administrators. For this reason, we present ongoing work on a\nconfiguration management system (CMS) that provides control over\nadministrators, restrains their rights, and enforces separation of concerns. We\nreach this goal by conducting a configuration management process that requires\nmulti-party authorization for critical configurations to achieve Byzantine\nfault tolerance against attacks and faults by administrators. Only after a\nconfiguration has been authorized by multiple experts, it is applied to the\ntargeted devices. For the whole configuration management process, our CMS\nguarantees accountability and traceability. Lastly, our system is\ntamper-resistant as we leverage Hyperledger Fabric, which provides a\ndistributed execution environment for our CMS and a blockchain-based\ndistributed ledger that we use to store the configurations. A beneficial side\neffect of this approach is that our CMS is also suitable to manage\nconfigurations for infrastructure shared across different organizations that do\nnot need to trust each other.",

However, a more\ncomprehensive, evidence-based picture on the global direct financial impact of\nransomware attacks is still missing. In this paper, we present a data-driven\nmethod for identifying and gathering information on Bitcoin transactions\nrelated to illicit activity based on footprints left on the public Bitcoin\nblockchain. We implement this method on-top-of the GraphSense open-source\nplatform and apply it to empirically analyze transactions related to 35\nransomware families. We estimate the lower bound direct financial impact of\neach ransomware family and find that, from 2013 to mid-2017, the market for\nransomware payments has a minimum worth of USD 12,768,536 (22,967.54 BTC). We\nalso find that the market is highly skewed with only a few number of players\nresponsible for the majority of the payments.

Enabling blockchain technology into IoT can help to achieve a\nproper distributed consensus based IoT system that overcomes those\ndisadvantages. While this is an ideal match, it is still a challenging\nendeavor. In this paper we take a first step towards that goal by designing\nHybrid-IoT, a hybrid blockchain architecture for IoT. In Hybrid-IoT, subgroups\nof IoT devices form PoW blockchains, referred to as PoW sub-blockchains. Then,\nthe connection among the PoW sub-blockchains employs a BFT inter-connector\nframework, such as Polkadot or Cosmos.

We present a testbed platform through a combination of\nmanufacturing machines, system-on-chip platforms and computing nodes to\ndemonstrate mechanisms through which a consortium of disparate organizations\ncan communicate through a decentralized network. Our prototype testbed\ndemonstrates the value of computer code residing on a decentralized network for\nverification of information on the blockchain and ways in which actions can be\nautonomously initiated in the physical world.

Its security can be diminished by\na variety of attacks that leverage on weaknesses in its design and\nimplementations. An example of a major weakness is the public-key\ninfrastructure (PKI) that TLS deploys, which is a weakest-link system and\nintroduces hundreds of links (i.e., trusted entities). Consequently, an\nadversary compromising a single trusted entity can impersonate any website.\n  Notary systems, based on multi-path probing, were early and promising\nproposals to detect and prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, despite their\nbenefits, they are not widely deployed, mainly due to their long-standing\nunresolved problems. In this paper, we present Persistent and Accountable\nDomain Validation (PADVA), which is a next-generation TLS notary service. PADVA\ncombines the advantages of previous proposals, enhancing them, introducing\nnovel mechanisms, and leveraging a blockchain platform which provides new\nfeatures. PADVA keeps notaries auditable and accountable, introduces\nservice-level agreements and mechanisms to enforce them, relaxes availability\nrequirements for notaries, and works with the legacy TLS ecosystem. We\nimplemented and evaluated PADVA, and our experiments indicate its efficiency\nand deployability.",

            "summary": "Existing blockchain systems scale poorly because of their distributed\nconsensus protocols. Current attempts at improving blockchain scalability are\nlimited to cryptocurrency. Scaling blockchain systems under general workloads\n(i.e., non-cryptocurrency applications) remains an open question. In this work,\nwe take a principled approach to apply sharding, which is a well-studied and\nproven technique to scale out databases, to blockchain systems in order to\nimprove their transaction throughput at scale. This is challenging, however,\ndue to the fundamental difference in failure models between databases and\nblockchain. To achieve our goal, we first enhance the performance of Byzantine\nconsensus protocols, by doing so we improve individual shards' throughput.\nNext, we design an efficient shard formation protocol that leverages a trusted\nrandom beacon to securely assign nodes into shards. We rely on trusted\nhardware, namely Intel SGX, to achieve high performance for both consensus and\nshard formation protocol. Third, we design a general distributed transaction\nprotocol that ensures safety and liveness even when transaction coordinators\nare malicious. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of our design both\non a local cluster and on Google Cloud Platform. The results show that our\nconsensus and shard formation protocols outperform state-of-the-art solutions\nat scale. More importantly, our sharded blockchain reaches a high throughput\nthat can handle Visa-level workloads, and is the largest ever reported in a\nrealistic environment.",

As of August 2017, the Bitcoin\nblockchain is about 120 GiB big while it was only 75 GiB in August 2016. To\nbenefit from Bitcoin full security model, a bootstrapping node has to download\nand verify the entirety of the 120 GiB. This poses a challenge for low-resource\ndevices such as smartphones. Thankfully, an alternative exists for such devices\nwhich consists of downloading and verifying just the header of each block. This\npartial block verification enables devices to reduce their bandwidth\nrequirements from 120 GiB to 35 MiB. However, this drastic decrease comes with\na safety cost implied by a partial block verification. In this work, we enable\nlow-resource devices to fully verify subchains of blocks without having to pay\nthe onerous price of a full chain download and verification; a few additional\nMiB of bandwidth suffice. To do so, we propose the design of diet nodes that\ncan securely query full nodes for shards of the UTXO set, which is needed to\nperform full block verification and can otherwise only be built by sequentially\nparsing the chain.",

Therefore, the\ninherent compatibility of Lolisa allows Solidity programs to be directly\ntranslated into Lolisa with a line-by-line correspondence without rebuilding or\nabstracting, and, in addition, the inherent generality of Lolisa allows it to\nbe extended to express other programming languages as well.

Before such a container may enter a trade bloc, the customs agency of the\ngoods' destination country must ensure that it does not contain illegal or\nmislabeled goods.

Customs\nagencies perform risk analysis using data sourced from a centralized system\nthat is potentially vulnerable to manipulation and malpractice. Therefore we\npropose an alternative: DEFenD, a decentralized system that stores data about\ngoods and containers in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. In our system,\neconomic operators make claims to the network about goods they insert into or\nremove from containers, and encrypt these claims so that they can only be read\nby the destination country's customs agency. Economic operators also make\nunencrypted claims about containers with which they interact. Unencrypted\nclaims can be validated by the entire network of customs agencies. Our key\ncontribution is a data partitioning scheme and several protocols that enable\nsuch a system to utilize blockchain and its powerful validation principle,\nwhile also preserving the privacy of the involved economic operators. Using our\nprotocol, customs agencies can improve their risk analysis and economic\noperators can get through customs with less delay. We also present a reference\nimplementation built with Hyperledger Fabric and analyze to what extent our\nimplementation meets the requirements in terms of privacy-preservation,\nsecurity, scalability, and decentralization.",

They can\nbe used to store and share information without a trusted central party. There\nhas been much effort to develop blockchain systems for a myriad of uses,\nranging from cryptocurrencies to identity control, supply chain management,\netc. None of this work has directly studied the fundamental database issues\nthat arise when using blockchains as the underlying infrastructure to manage\ndata.\n  The key difference between using blockchains to store data and centrally\ncontrolled databases is that transactions are accepted to a blockchain via a\nconsensus mechanism. Hence, once a user has issued a transaction, she cannot be\ncertain if it will be accepted. Moreover, a yet unaccepted transaction cannot\nbe retracted by the user, and may be appended to the blockchain in the future.\nThis causes difficulties as the user may wish to reissue a transaction, if it\nwas not accepted. Yet this data may then become appended twice to the\nblockchain.\n  In this paper we present a database perspective on blockchains by introducing\nformal foundations for blockchains as a storage layer that underlies a\ndatabase. The main issue that we tackle is uncertainty in transaction appending\nthat is a result of the consensus mechanism. We study two flavors of\ntransaction appending problems: (1) the complexity of determining whether it is\npossible for a denial constraint to be contradicted, given the state of the\nblockchain, pending transactions, and integrity constraints and (2) the\ncomplexity of generating transactions that are mutually (in)consistent with\ngiven subsets of pending transactions. Solving these problems is critical to\nensure that users can issue transactions consistent with their intentions.\nFinally, we chart important directions for future work.",

            "summary": "Blockchain-driven technologies are considered disruptive because of the\navailability of dis-intermediated, censorship-resistant and tamper-proof\ndigital platforms of distributed trust. Among these technologies, smart\ncontract platforms have the potential to take over functions usually done by\nintermediaries like banks, escrow or legal services. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel protocol aiming to execute smart contracts as part of a\nblockchain transaction validation. We enable extensions in the execution of\nsmart contracts while guaranteeing their privacy, correctness and\nverifiability. Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented, since no communication\nbetween participants is requested, and contract validations do not imply the\nre-execution of the code by all the nodes in the network. However, proofs of\ncorrect execution are stored on the blockchain and can be verified by multiple\nparties. Our solution is based on programming tools which optimize the time\nexecution and the required memory while preserving the embedded functionality.",

            "summary": "Due to their rapid growth and deployment, Internet of things (IoT) devices\nhave become a central aspect of our daily lives. However, they tend to have\nmany vulnerabilities which can be exploited by an attacker. Unsupervised\ntechniques, such as anomaly detection, can help us secure the IoT devices.\nHowever, an anomaly detection model must be trained for a long time in order to\ncapture all benign behaviors. This approach is vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks since all observations are assumed to be benign while training the\nanomaly detection model.\n  In this paper, we propose CIoTA, a lightweight framework that utilizes the\nblockchain concept to perform distributed and collaborative anomaly detection\nfor devices with limited resources. CIoTA uses blockchain to incrementally\nupdate a trusted anomaly detection model via self-attestation and consensus\namong IoT devices. We evaluate CIoTA on our own distributed IoT simulation\nplatform, which consists of 48 Raspberry Pis, to demonstrate CIoTA's ability to\nenhance the security of each device and the security of the network as a whole.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we examine the recent trend towards in-browser mining of\ncryptocurrencies; in particular, the mining of Monero through Coinhive and\nsimilar code- bases. In this model, a user visiting a website will download a\nJavaScript code that executes client-side in her browser, mines a\ncryptocurrency, typically without her consent or knowledge, and pays out the\nseigniorage to the website. Websites may consciously employ this as an\nalternative or to supplement advertisement revenue, may offer premium content\nin exchange for mining, or may be unwittingly serving the code as a result of a\nbreach (in which case the seigniorage is collected by the attacker). The\ncryptocurrency Monero is preferred seemingly for its unfriendliness to\nlarge-scale ASIC mining that would drive browser-based efforts out of the\nmarket, as well as for its purported privacy features. In this paper, we survey\nthis landscape, conduct some measurements to establish its prevalence and\nprofitability, outline an ethical framework for considering whether it should\nbe classified as an attack or business opportunity, and make suggestions for\nthe detection, mitigation and/or prevention of browser-based mining for non-\nconsenting users.",

In the worst case, operators\ncan exclude users from submitting reviews, modify existing reviews, and\nintroduce fake reviews by fictional consumers. This paper presents ReviewChain,\na decentralized review approach. Our approach avoids central authorities by\nusing blockchain technologies, decentralized apps and storage. Thereby, we\nenable users to submit and retrieve untampered reviews. We highlight the\nimplementation challenges encountered when realizing our approach on the public\nEthereum blockchain. For each implementation challange, we discuss possible\ndesign alternatives and their trade-offs regarding costs, security, and\ntrustworthiness.

Second, the\ntransparency of blockchain allows one to infer private information about\nworkers and requesters through their participation history. Simply enabling\nanonymity is seemingly attempting but will allow malicious workers to submit\nmultiple times to reap rewards. ZebraLancer also overcomes this problem by\nallowing anonymous requests/submissions without sacrificing accountability. The\nidea behind is a subtle linkability: if a worker submits twice to a task,\nanyone can link the submissions, or else he stays anonymous and unlinkable\nacross tasks. To realize this delicate linkability, we put forward a novel\ncryptographic concept, i.e., the common-prefix-linkable anonymous\nauthentication. We remark the new anonymous authentication scheme might be of\nindependent interest. Finally, we implement our protocol for a common image\nannotation task and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum.

Despite being illegal in many\ncountries, Ponzi schemes are now proliferating on Bitcoin, and they keep\nalluring new victims, who are plundered of millions of dollars. We apply data\nmining techniques to detect Bitcoin addresses related to Ponzi schemes. Our\nstarting point is a dataset of features of real-world Ponzi schemes, that we\nconstruct by analysing, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transactions used to\nperform the scams. We use this dataset to experiment with various machine\nlearning algorithms, and we assess their effectiveness through standard\nvalidation protocols and performance metrics.

            "summary": "In an economy with asymmetric information, the smart contract in the\nblockchain protocol mitigates uncertainty. Since, as a new trading platform,\nthe blockchain triggers segmentation of market and differentiation of agents in\nboth the sell and buy sides of the market, it recomposes the asymmetric\ninformation and generates spreads in asset price and quality between itself and\na traditional platform. We show that marginal innovation and sophistication of\nthe smart contract have non-monotonic effects on the trading value in the\nblockchain platform, its fundamental value, the price of cryptocurrency, and\nconsumers' welfare. Moreover, a blockchain manager who controls the level of\nthe innovation of the smart contract has an incentive to keep it lower than the\nfirst best when the underlying information asymmetry is not severe, leading to\nwelfare loss for consumers.",

We reconsider the basis of blockchain encryption and\nsuggest to move from currently used proof-of-work schemes to the proof-of-work\nperformed by analog Hamiltonian optimisers. This approach has a potential to\nsignificantly increase decentralisation of the existing blockchains and to help\nachieve faster transaction times, therefore, removing the main obstacles for\nblockchain implementation.

Unfortunately, programming smart contracts is a\ndelicate task that requires strong expertise: Ethereum smart contracts are\nwritten in Solidity, a dedicated language resembling JavaScript, and shipped\nover the blockchain in the EVM bytecode format. In order to rigorously verify\nthe security of smart contracts, it is of paramount importance to formalize\ntheir semantics as well as the security properties of interest, in particular\nat the level of the bytecode being executed.\n  In this paper, we present the first complete small-step semantics of EVM\nbytecode, which we formalize in the F* proof assistant, obtaining executable\ncode that we successfully validate against the official Ethereum test suite.\nFurthermore, we formally define for the first time a number of central security\nproperties for smart contracts, such as call integrity, atomicity, and\nindependence from miner controlled parameters. This formalization relies on a\ncombination of hyper- and safety properties.

Higher-order logic theorem proving is one of\nthe most reliable technologies for verifying the properties of programs.\nHowever, programs may be developed by different high-level programming\nlanguages, and a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory (GERM)\nframework that can simultaneously support different formal verification\nspecifications, particularly at the code level, is presently unavailable for\nverifying the properties of programs. Therefore, the present work proposes a\nGERM framework to fill this gap. The framework simulates physical memory\nhardware structure, including a low-level formal memory space, and provides a\nset of simple, nonintrusive application programming interfaces and assistant\ntools using Coq that can support different formal verification specifications\nsimultaneously. The proposed GERM framework is independent and customizable,\nand was verified entirely in Coq. We also present an extension of Curry-Howard\nisomorphism, denoted as execution-verification isomorphism (EVI), which\ncombines symbolic execution and theorem proving for increasing the degree of\nautomation in higher-order logic theorem proving assistant tools. We also\nimplement a toy functional programming language in a generalized algebraic\ndatatypes style and a formal interpreter in Coq based on the GERM framework.\nThese implementations are then employed to demonstrate the application of EVI\nto a simple code segment.",

To face this issue, in this\npaper we provide a proper formulation of a distributed ledger object. In brief,\nwe define a ledger object as a sequence of records, and we provide the\noperations and the properties that such an object should support.\nImplementation of a ledger object on top of multiple (possibly geographically\ndispersed) computing devices gives rise to the distributed ledger object. In\ncontrast to the centralized object, distribution allows operations to be\napplied concurrently on the ledger, introducing challenges on the consistency\nof the ledger in each participant. We provide the definitions of three well\nknown consistency guarantees in terms of the operations supported by the ledger\nobject: (1) atomic consistency (linearizability), (2) sequential consistency,\nand (3) eventual consistency. We then provide implementations of distributed\nledgers on asynchronous message passing crash-prone systems using an Atomic\nBroadcast service, and show that they provide eventual, sequential or atomic\nconsistency semantics. We conclude with a variation of the ledger - the\nvalidated ledger - which requires that each record in the ledger satisfies a\nparticular validation rule.",

In this article, by translating the\ncumbersome binary data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain into a high fidelity\ngraph model, we demonstrate through various analyses the often overlooked\nsocial and econometric benefits of employing such a novel open data\narchitecture. Specifically we show (a) how repeated patterns of transaction\nbehaviours can be revealed to link user activity across the blockchain; (b) how\nnewly mined bitcoin can be associated to demonstrate individual accumulations\nof wealth; (c) through application of the naive quantity theory of money that\nBitcoin's disinflationary properties can be revealed and measured; and (d) how\nthe user community can develop coordinated defences against repeated denial of\nservice attacks on the network.

People rely on the Internet to inform themselves on current news\nevents, as well as to verify facts. We, as a community, are quickly approaching\nan 'electronic information age' where the majority of information will be\ndistributed electronically and tools to preserve this information will become\nessential. While archiving online digital information is a good way to preserve\nonline information for future generations, it has many disadvantages including\nthe easy manipulation of archived information, e.g. by the archiving authority.\nOnline information is also prone to getting hacked or being taken offline.\nTherefore, it is necessary that archived online news information is securely\ntime-stamped with the date and time when it was first archived in a way that\ncannot be manipulated. The process of 'trusted timestamping' is an established\napproach for claiming that particular digital information existed at a\nparticular 'point in time' in the past. However, traditional approaches for\ntrusted timestamping depend on the time-stamping authority's fidelity. Directly\nembedding the hash of a digital file into the blockchain of a cryptocurrency is\na more recent method that allows for secure time-stamping, since digital\ninformation is stored as part of the transaction information in, e.g.\nBitcoin's, blockchain, and not stored at a centralized time-stamping authority.\nHowever, there is no system yet available, which uses this approach for\narchiving and time-stamping online news articles. Therefore, the aim of this\nthesis is to develop a system that 1) enables decentralized trusted\ntime-stamping of web and news articles as a means of making future manipulation\nof online information identifiable, and 2) allows users to determine the\nauthenticity of articles by checking different versions of the same article\nonline.",

While the\ndata collected from vehicular sensors and vehicular communications is an\nintegral part of the evidence for arbitrating liability in the event of an\naccident,there is also a need to record all interactions between the\naforementioned entities to identify potential instances of negligence that may\nhave played a role in the accident.In this paper,we propose a BlockChain(BC)\nbased framework that integrates the concerned entities in the liability model\nand provides untampered evidence for liability attribution and adjudication.We\nfirst describe the liability attribution model, identify key requirements and\ndescribe the adversarial capabilities of entities. Also,we present a detailed\ndescription of data contributing to evidence.Our framework uses permissioned BC\nand partitions the BC to tailor data access to relevant BC\nparticipants.Finally,we conduct a security analysis to verify that the\nidentified requirements are met and resilience of our proposed framework to\nidentified attacks.",

They present new opportunities for storage systems to efficiently\nsupport such applications by embedding the above requirements into the storage.\n  In this paper, we present ForkBase, a storage engine specifically designed to\nprovide efficient support for blockchain and forkable applications. By\nintegrating the core application properties into the storage, ForkBase not only\ndelivers high performance but also reduces development effort. Data in ForkBase\nis multi-versioned, and each version uniquely identifies the data content and\nits history. Two variants of fork semantics are supported in ForkBase to\nfacilitate any collaboration workflows. A novel index structure is introduced\nto efficiently identify and eliminate duplicate content across data objects.\nConsequently, ForkBase is not only efficient in performance, but also in space\nrequirement. We demonstrate the performance of ForkBase using three\napplications: a blockchain platform, a wiki engine and a collaborative\nanalytics application. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation of these\napplications against respective state-of-the-art system.

            "summary": "Cross-institutional healthcare predictive modeling can accelerate research\nand facilitate quality improvement initiatives, and thus is important for\nnational healthcare delivery priorities. For example, a model that predicts\nrisk of re-admission for a particular set of patients will be more\ngeneralizable if developed with data from multiple institutions. While\nprivacy-protecting methods to build predictive models exist, most are based on\na centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness\nvulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure (and single-point-of-breach)\nand accidental or malicious modification of records. In this article, we\ndescribe a new framework, ModelChain, to adapt Blockchain technology for\nprivacy-preserving machine learning. Each participating site contributes to\nmodel parameter estimation without revealing any patient health information\n(i.e., only model data, no observation-level data, are exchanged across\ninstitutions). We integrate privacy-preserving online machine learning with a\nprivate Blockchain network, apply transaction metadata to disseminate partial\nmodels, and design a new proof-of-information algorithm to determine the order\nof the online learning process. We also discuss the benefits and potential\nissues of applying Blockchain technology to solve the privacy-preserving\nhealthcare predictive modeling task and to increase interoperability between\ninstitutions, to support the Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap and national\nhealthcare delivery priorities such as Patient-Centered Outcomes Research\n(PCOR).",

            "summary": "Smart contracts (SC) are software codes which reside and run over a\nblockchain. The code can be written in different languages with the common\npurpose of implementing various kinds of transactions onto the hosting\nblockchain, They are ruled by the blockchain infrastructure and work in order\nto satisfy conditions typical of traditional contracts. The software code must\nsatisfy constrains strongly context dependent which are quite different from\ntraditional software code. In particular, since the bytecode is uploaded in the\nhosting blockchain, size, computational resources, interaction between\ndifferent parts of software are all limited and even if the specific software\nlanguages implement more or less the same constructs of traditional languages\nthere is not the same freedom as in normal software development. SC software is\nexpected to reflect these constrains on SC software metrics which should\ndisplay metric values characteristic of the domain and different from more\ntraditional software metrics. We tested this hypothesis on the code of more\nthan twelve thousands SC written in Solidity and uploaded on the Ethereum\nblockchain. We downloaded the SC from a public repository and computed the\nstatistics of a set of software metrics related to SC and compared them to the\nmetrics extracted from more traditional software projects. Our results show\nthat generally Smart Contracts metrics have ranges more restricted than the\ncorresponding metrics in traditional software systems. Some of the stylized\nfacts, like power law in the tail of the distribution of some metrics, are only\napproximate but the lines of code follow a log normal distribution which\nreminds of the same behavior already found in traditional software systems.",

We present a new BFT protocol, Gosig, that combines\ncrypto-based secret leader selection and multi-round voting in the protocol\nlayer with implementation layer optimizations such as gossip-based message\npropagation. In particular, Gosig guarantees safety even in a network fully\ncontrolled by adversaries, while providing provable liveness with\neasy-to-achieve network connectivity assumption. On a wide area testbed\nconsisting of 140 Amazon EC2 servers spanning 14 cities on five continents, we\nshow that Gosig can achieve over 4,000 transactions per second with less than 1\nminute transaction confirmation time.",

One such application that is\nbecoming crucial with the introduction of self-driving cars is the forensic\nanalysis for traffic accidents. The utilization of vehicle-related data can be\ninstrumental in post-accident scenarios to find out the faulty party,\nparticularly for self-driving vehicles. With the opportunity of being able to\naccess various information on the cars, we propose a permissioned blockchain\nframework among the various elements involved to manage the collected\nvehicle-related data. Specifically, we first integrate Vehicular Public Key\nManagement (VPKI) to the proposed blockchain to provide membership\nestablishment and privacy. Next, we design a fragmented ledger that will store\ndetailed data related to vehicle such as maintenance information/history, car\ndiagnosis reports, etc. The proposed forensic framework enables trustless,\ntraceable and privacy-aware post-accident analysis with minimal storage and\nprocessing overhead.",

Global level\ncryptocurrencies enable low-cost, secure and pervasive money transferring among\ndistributed peers, but are still limited in their ability to reach more people\nin remote communities.\n  We proposed to take advantage of the delay-tolerant nature of blockchains to\ndeliver banking services to remote communities that only connect to the broader\nInternet intermittently. Using a base station that offers connectivity within\nthe local area, regular transaction processing is solely handled by blockchain\nminers. The bank only joins to process currency exchange requests, reward\nminers and track user balances when the connection is available. By\ndistributing the verification and storage tasks among peers, our system design\nsaves on the overall deployment and operational costs without sacrificing the\nreliability and trustwor- thiness.

It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows\nthe system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is\nalso the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in\nstandard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on\na native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain\nplatforms that require \"smart-contracts\" to be written in domain-specific\nlanguages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model\nusing a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with\nindustry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric\nintroduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains\ncope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.\n  This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various\ndesign decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its\ndistributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by\nimplementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that\nFabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second\nin certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling\nwell to over 100 peers.",

Using that knowledge, we introduce a new\ncryptographic primitive called uncentralisable ledger and study its properties.\nWe use those properties to analyse what an uncentralisable ledger may offer to\nclassic electronic voting systems and how it opens up the realm of\npossibilities for completely new voting mechanisms. We review a list of\nselected projects that implement voting systems using blockchain technol- ogy.\nWe then conclude that the true revolutionary feature enabled by uncentralisable\nledgers is a self-sovereign and distributed identity provider.",

            "summary": "Consensus protocols inherently rely on the notion of leader election, in\nwhich one or a subset of participants are temporarily elected to authorize and\nannounce the network's latest state. While leader election is a well studied\nproblem, the rise of distributed ledgers (i.e., blockchains) has led to a new\nperspective on how to perform large-scale leader elections via solving a\ncomputationally difficult puzzle (i.e., proof of work). In this paper, we\npresent Caucus, a large-scale leader election protocol with minimal\ncoordination costs that does not require the computational cost of\nproof-of-work. We evaluate Caucus in terms of its security, using a new model\nfor blockchain-focused leader election, before testing an implementation of\nCaucus on an Ethereum private network. Our experiments highlight that one\nvariant of Caucus costs only $0.10 per leader election if deployed on Ethereum.",

            "summary": "While cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications continue to gain\npopularity, their energy cost is evidently becoming unsustainable. In most\ninstances, the main cost comes from the required amount of energy for the\nProof-of-Work, and this cost is inherent to the design. In addition, useless\ncosts from discarded work (e.g., the so-called Forks) and lack of scalability\n(in number of users and in rapid transactions) limit their practical\neffectiveness.\n  In this paper, we present an innovative scheme which eliminates the nonce and\nthus the burden of the Proof-of-Work which is the main cause of the energy\nwaste in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We prove that our scheme guarantees\na tunable and bounded average number of simultaneous mining whatever the size\nof the population in competition, thus by making the use of nonce-based\ntechniques unnecessary, achieves scalability without the cost of consuming a\nlarge volume of energy. The technique used in the proof of our scheme is based\non the analogy of the analysis of a green leader election. The additional\ndifference with Proof-of-Work schemes (beyond the suppression of the nonce\nfield that is triggering most of the waste), is the introduction of (what we\ndenote as) \"empty blocks\" which aim are to call regular blocks following a\nstaircase set of values. Our scheme reduces the risk of Forks and provides\ntunable scalability for the number of users and the speed of block generation.\nWe also prove using game theoretical analysis that our scheme is resilient to\nunfair competitive investments (e.g., \"51 percent\" attack) and block nursing.",

In the market, the cache helpers are able to autonomously adapt their\ncaching strategies according to the market statistics obtained from the\nblockchain, and the truthfulness of trustless nodes are financially enforced by\nsmart contract terms. Further, we propose an incentive-compatible consensus\nmechanism based on proof-of-stake to financially encourage the cache helpers to\nstay active in service. We model the interaction between the cache helpers and\nthe content providers as a Chinese restaurant game.

            "summary": "With the rapid increase of threats on the Internet, people are continuously\nseeking privacy and anonymity. Services such as Bitcoin and Tor were introduced\nto provide anonymity for online transactions and Web browsing. Due to its\npseudonymity model, Bitcoin lacks retroactive operational security, which means\nhistorical pieces of information could be used to identify a certain user. We\ninvestigate the feasibility of deanonymizing users of Tor hidden services who\nrely on Bitcoin as a payment method by exploiting public information leaked\nfrom online social networks, the Blockchain, and onion websites. This, for\nexample, allows an adversary to link a user with @alice Twitter address to a\nTor hidden service with private.onion address by finding at least one past\ntransaction in the Blockchain that involves their publicly declared Bitcoin\naddresses.\n  To demonstrate the feasibility of this deanonymization attack, we carried out\na real-world experiment simulating a passive, limited adversary. We crawled\n1.5K hidden services and collected 88 unique Bitcoin addresses. We then crawled\n5B tweets and 1M BitcoinTalk forum pages and collected 4.2K and 41K unique\nBitcoin addresses, respectively. Each user address was associated with an\nonline identity along with its public profile information. By analyzing the\ntransactions in the Blockchain, we were able to link 125 unique users to 20 Tor\nhidden services, including sensitive ones, such as The Pirate Bay and Silk\nRoad. We also analyzed two case studies in detail to demonstrate the\nimplications of the resulting information leakage on user anonymity. In\nparticular, we confirm that Bitcoin addresses should always be considered\nexploitable, as they can be used to deanonymize users retroactively. This is\nespecially important for Tor hidden service users who actively seek and expect\nprivacy and anonymity.",

The difficulty of the computational problem is updated every 2,016\nblocks in order to control the rate at which blocks are generated. In the\noriginal Bitcoin paper, it was suggested that the blockchain arrivals occur\naccording to a homogeneous Poisson process. Based on blockchain block arrival\ndata and stochastic analysis of the block arrival process, we demonstrate that\nthis is not the case.

            "summary": "Bitcoin and other similar digital currencies on blockchains are not ideal\nmeans for payment, because their prices tend to go up in the long term (thus\npeople are incentivized to hoard those currencies), and to fluctuate widely in\nthe short term (thus people would want to avoid risks of losing values). The\nreason why those blockchain currencies based on proof of work are unstable may\nbe found in their designs that the supplies of currencies do not respond to\ntheir positive and negative demand shocks, as the authors have formulated in\nour past work. Continuing from our past work, this paper proposes minimal\nchanges to the design of blockchain currencies so that their market prices are\nautomatically stabilized, absorbing both positive and negative demand shocks of\nthe currencies by autonomously controlling their supplies. Those changes are:\n1) limiting re-adjustment of proof-of-work targets, 2) making mining rewards\nvariable according to the observed over-threshold changes of block intervals,\nand 3) enforcing negative interests to remove old coins in circulation. We have\nmade basic design checks and evaluations of these measures through simple\nsimulations. In addition to stabilization of prices, the proposed measures may\nhave effects of making those currencies preferred means for payment by\ndisincentivizing hoarding, and improving sustainability of the currency systems\nby making rewards to miners perpetual.",

            "summary": "BlockChain (BC) immutability ensures BC resilience against modification or\nremoval of the stored data. In large scale networks like the Internet of Things\n(IoT), however, this feature significantly increases BC storage size and raises\nprivacy challenges. In this paper, we propose a Memory Optimized and Flexible\nBC (MOF-BC) that enables the IoT users and service providers to remove or\nsummarize their transactions and age their data and to exercise the \"right to\nbe forgotten\". To increase privacy, a user may employ multiple keys for\ndifferent transactions. To allow for the removal of stored transactions, all\nkeys would need to be stored which complicates key management and storage.\nMOF-BC introduces the notion of a Generator Verifier (GV) which is a signed\nhash of a Generator Verifier Secret (GVS). The GV changes for each transaction\nto provide privacy yet is signed by a unique key, thus minimizing the\ninformation that needs to be stored. A flexible transaction fee model and a\nreward mechanism is proposed to incentivize users to participate in optimizing\nmemory consumption. Qualitative security and privacy analysis demonstrates that\nMOF-BC is resilient against several security attacks. Evaluation results show\nthat MOF-BC decreases BC memory consumption by up to 25\\% and the user cost by\nmore than two orders of magnitude compared to conventional BC instantiations.",

While resource\nsharing across multiple service providers can be a way to maximize the\nutilization of limited resources at the network edge, it requires a centralized\nrepository maintained by all parties for service providers to share status.\nMoreover, service providers have to trust each other for resource allocation\nfairness, which is difficult because of potential conflicts of interest. We\npropose EdgeChain, a blockchain-based architecture to make mobile edge\napplication placement decisions for multiple service providers. We first\nformulate a stochastic programming problem minimizing the placement cost for\nmobile edge application placement scenarios. Based on our model, we present a\nheuristic mobile edge application placement algorithm. As a decentralized\npublic ledger, the blockchain then takes the logic of our algorithm as the\nsmart contract, with the consideration of resources from all mobile edge hosts\nparticipating in the system. The algorithm is agreed by all parties and the\nresults will only be accepted by majority of the mining nodes on the\nblockchain. When a placement decision is made, an edge host meeting the\nconsumer's latency and budget requirements will be selected at the lowest cost.\nAll placement transactions are stored on the blockchain and are traceable by\nevery mobile edge service provider and application vendor who consumes\nresources at the mobile edge.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin, as well as many of its successors, require the whole transaction\nrecord to be reliably acquired by all nodes to prevent double-spending.\nRecently, many blockchains have been proposed to achieve scale-out throughput\nby letting nodes only acquire a fraction of the whole transaction set. However,\nthese schemes, e.g., sharding and off-chain techniques, suffer from a\ndegradation in decentralization or the capacity of fault tolerance.\n  In this paper, we show that the complete set of transactions is not a\nnecessity for the prevention of double-spending if the properties of value\ntransfers is fully explored. In other words, we show that a value-transfer\nledger like Bitcoin has the potential to scale-out by its nature without\nsacrificing security or decentralization. Firstly, we give a formal definition\nfor the value-transfer ledger and its distinct features from a generic\ndatabase. Then, we introduce an off-chain based scheme with a shared main chain\nfor consensus and an individual chain for each node for recording transactions.\nA locally executable validation scheme is proposed with uncompromising validity\nand consistency. A beneficial consequence of our design is that nodes will\nspontaneously try to reduce their transmission cost by only providing the\ntransactions needed to show that their transactions are double-spending-proof.\nAs a result, the network is sharded as each node only acquires part of the\ntransaction record and a scale-out throughput could be achieved, which we call\n\"spontaneous sharding\".",

However, its use may very well also lead to increased\ncomplexity resulting from having to subsume work that displaced intermediary\ninstitutions had performed. We present our perspective that smart contracts may\nbe used to mitigate this increased complexity. We further posit that smart\ncontracts can be delineated according to complexity: Smart contracts that can\nbe verified objectively without much uncertainty belong in an\ninter-organizational context; those that cannot be objectively verified belong\nin an intra-organizational context. We state that smart contracts that\nimplement a formal (e.g. mathematical or simulation) model are especially\nbeneficial for both contexts: They can be used to express and enforce\ninter-organizational agreements, and their basis in a common formalism may\nensure effective evaluation and comparison between different\nintra-organizational contracts. Finally, we present a case study of our\nperspective by describing Intellichain, which implements formal, agent-based\nsimulation model as a smart contract to provide epidemiological decision\nsupport.",

            "summary": "Many applications require the immutable and consistent sharing of data across\norganizational boundaries. Because conventional datastores cannot provide this\nfunctionality, blockchains have been proposed as one possible solution. Yet\npublic blockchains are energy inefficient, hard to scale and suffer from\nlimited throughput and high latencies, while permissioned blockchains depend on\nspecially designated nodes, potentially leak meta-information, and also suffer\nfrom scale and performance bottlenecks.\n  This paper presents CreDB, a datastore that provides blockchain-like\nguarantees of integrity using trusted execution environments. CreDB employs\nfour novel mechanisms to support a new class of applications. First, it creates\na permanent record of every transaction, known as a witness, that clients can\nthen use not only to audit the database but to prove to third parties that\ndesired actions took place. Second, it associates with every object an\ninseparable and inviolable policy, which not only performs access control but\nenables the datastore to implement state machines whose behavior is amenable to\nanalysis. Third, timeline inspection allows authorized parties to inspect and\nreason about the history of changes made to the data. Finally, CreDB provides a\nprotected function evaluation mechanism that allows integrity-protected\ncomputation over private data. The paper describes these mechanisms, and the\napplications they collectively enable, in detail. We have fully implemented a\nprototype of CreDB on Intel SGX. Evaluation shows that CreDB can serve as a\ndrop-in replacement for other NoSQL stores, such as MongoDB while providing\nstronger integrity guarantees.",

However, the economic\neffect of transaction channels on the system has not been explored much until\nnow.\n  We study the economics of Bitcoin transaction channels, and present a\nframework for an economic analysis of the lightning network and its effect on\ntransaction fees on the blockchain. Our framework allows us to reason about\ndifferent patterns of demand for transactions and different topologies of the\nlightning network, and to derive the resulting fees for transacting both on and\noff the blockchain.\n  Our initial results indicate that while the lightning network does allow for\na substantially higher number of transactions to pass through the system, it\ndoes not necessarily provide higher fees to miners, and as a result may in fact\nlead to lower participation in mining within the system.",

In this work we shift to a new setting, the distribution of\nsoftware package binaries, and present a system for so-called \"binary\ntransparency.\" Our solution, Contour, uses proactive methods for providing\ntransparency, privacy, and availability, even in the face of persistent\nman-in-the-middle attacks.

Unfortunately, there is no explicit incentive for such\ntransaction propagation. Therefore, existing propagation mechanisms will not be\nsustainable in a fully decentralized blockchain with rational nodes. In this\nwork, we formally define the problem of incentivizing nodes for transaction\npropagation. We propose an incentive mechanism where each node involved in the\npropagation of a transaction receives a share of the transaction fee. We also\nshow that our proposal is Sybil-proof. Furthermore, we combine the incentive\nmechanism with smart routing to reduce the communication and storage costs at\nthe same time. The proposed routing mechanism reduces the redundant transaction\npropagation from the size of the network to a factor of average shortest path\nlength. The routing mechanism is built upon a specific type of consensus\nprotocol where the round leader who creates the transaction block is known in\nadvance. Note that our routing mechanism is a generic one and can be adopted\nindependently from the incentive mechanism.",

In order to properly integrate\ndemand-side flexibility, DSOs need new energy management architectures, capable\nof fostering collaboration with wholesale market actors and pro-sumers. We\npropose the creation of Virtual Distribution Grids (VDG) over a common physical\ninfrastructure , to cope with heterogeneity of resources and actors, and with\nthe increasing complexity of distribution grid management and related resources\nallocation problems. Focusing on residential VDG, we propose an agent-based\nhierarchical architecture for providing Demand-Side Management services through\na market-based approach, where households transact their surplus/lack of energy\nand their flexibility with neighbours, aggregators, utilities and DSOs. For\nimplementing the overall solution, we consider fine-grained control of smart\nhomes based on Inter-net of Things technology.

We propose a tiered Lightweight Scalable BC (LSB) that is optimized\nfor IoT requirements. We explore LSB in a smart home setting as a\nrepresentative example for broader IoT applications. Low resource devices in a\nsmart home benefit from a centralized manager that establishes shared keys for\ncommunication and processes all incoming and outgoing requests. LSB achieves\ndecentralization by forming an overlay network where high resource devices\njointly manage a public BC that ensures end-to-end privacy and security. The\noverlay is organized as distinct clusters to reduce overheads and the cluster\nheads are responsible for managing the public BC. LSB incorporates several\noptimizations which include algorithms for lightweight consensus, distributed\ntrust and throughput management. Qualitative arguments demonstrate that LSB is\nresilient to several security attacks. Extensive simulations show that LSB\ndecreases packet overhead and delay and increases BC scalability compared to\nrelevant baselines.",

The block miners have to devote their\ncomputation power measured in hash rate in a crypto-puzzle solving competition\nto win the reward of publishing (a.k.a., mining) new blocks. Due to the\nexponentially increasing difficulty of the crypto-puzzle, individual block\nminers tends to join mining pools, i.e., the coalitions of miners, in order to\nreduce the income variance and earn stable profits. In this paper, we study the\ndynamics of mining pool selection in a blockchain network, where mining pools\nmay choose arbitrary block mining strategies. We identify the hash rate and the\nblock propagation delay as two major factors determining the outcomes of mining\ncompetition, and then model the strategy evolution of the individual miners as\nan evolutionary game. We provide the theoretical analysis of the evolutionary\nstability for the pool selection dynamics in a case study of two mining pools.\nThe numerical simulations provide the evidence to support our theoretical\ndiscoveries as well as demonstrating the stability in the evolution of miners'\nstrategies in a general case.",

            "summary": "Witnet is a decentralized oracle network (DON) that connects smart contracts\nto the outer world. Generally speaking, it allows any piece of software to\nretrieve the contents published at any web address at a certain point in time,\nwith complete and verifiable proof of its integrity and without blindly\ntrusting any third party. Witnet runs on a blockchain with a native protocol\ntoken (called Wit), which miners-called witnesses-earn by retrieving, attesting\nand delivering web contents for clients. On the other hand, clients spend Wit\nto pay witnesses for their Retrieve-Attest-Deliver (RAD) work. Witnesses also\ncompete to mine blocks with considerable rewards, but Witnet mining power is\nproportional to their previous performance in terms of honesty and\ntrustworthiness-this is, their reputation as witnesses. This creates a powerful\nincentive for witnesses to do their work honestly, protect their reputation and\nnot to deceive the network. The Witnet protocol is designed to assign the RAD\ntasks to witnesses in a way that mitigates most attack vectors to the greatest\nextent. At the same time, it includes a novel 'sharding' feature that (1)\nguarantees the efficiency and scalability of the network, (2) keeps the price\nof RAD tasks within reasonable bounds and (3) gives clients the freedom to\nadjust certainty and price by letting them choose how many witnesses will work\non their RAD tasks. When coupled with a Decentralized Storage Network (DSN),\nWitnet also gives us the possibility to build the Digital Knowledge Ark: a\ndecentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant and eternal archive of\nhumanity's most relevant digital data. A truth vault aimed to ensure that\nknowledge will remain democratic and verifiable forever and to prevent history\nfrom being written by the victors.",

            "summary": "Future electricity distribution grids will host a considerable share of\nvariable renewable energy sources and local storage resources. Moreover, they\nwill face new load structures due for example to the growth of the electric\nvehicle market. These trends raise the need for new paradigms for distribution\ngrids operation, in which Distribution System Operators will increasingly rely\non demand side flexibility and households will progressively become prosumers\nplaying an active role on smart grid energy management. However, in present\nenergy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits\nthe capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends. In this paper we\ntackle this problem by proposing an architecture that enables households to\nautonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors,\noperators and market actors. The solution is based on a blockchain transactive\nplatform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy\nwith their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production.\nWe propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an\nincentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that\nresponds to both pro-sumer and operator needs. We evaluate the impact of such\nmarkets through comprehensive simulations using power flow analysis and\nrealistic load profiles, providing valuable insight for the design of\nappropriate mechanisms and incentives.",

Temporary workers play therefore\nan important role in many companies, but this kind of activity is subject to a\nspecial form of legal protections and many aspects and risks must be taken into\naccount both employers and employees. In this work we propose a\nblockchain-based system that aims to ensure respect for the rights for all\nactors involved in a temporary employment, in order to provide employees with\nthe fair and legal remuneration (including taxes) of work performances and a\nprotection in the case employer becomes insolvent. At the same time, our system\nwants to assist the employer in processing contracts with a fully automated and\nfast procedure. To resolve these problems we propose the D-ES (Decentralized\nEmployment System). We first model the employment relationship as a state\nsystem. Then we describe the enabling technology that makes us able to realize\nthe D-ES. In facts, we propose the implementation of a DLT (Decentralized\nLedger Technology) based system, consisting in a blockchain system and of a\nweb-based environment. Thanks the decentralized application platforms that\nmakes us able to develop smart contracts, we define a discrete event control\nsystem that works inside the blockchain.

In this work we use the\nideas of secret key sharing, private key encryption, and distributed storage to\ndesign a coding scheme such that each node stores only a part of the entire\ntransaction thereby reducing the storage cost to a fraction of its original\ncost. When further using dynamic zone allocation, we show the coding scheme can\nalso improve the integrity of the transaction data in the network over current\nschemes.

In recent years, blockchain technology has been\nintroduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of\nauthentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.In this work, we\ninvestigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the\none implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for\nauthentication.

After formal argumentation, we conclude\nthat in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain\ntechnology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to\nprevious approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nto formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for\nauthentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we\nfirst provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we\nshow how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing\nit as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent\nattacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can\nbe beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely\nnegating such attacks.",

What distinguishes\nblockchains from traditional distributed databases is the ability to operate in\na decentralized setting without relying on a trusted third party. As such their\ncore technical component is consensus: how to reach agreement among a group of\nnodes. This has been extensively studied already in the distributed systems\ncommunity for closed systems, but its application to open blockchains has\nrevitalized the field and led to a plethora of new designs.\n  The inherent complexity of consensus protocols and their rapid and dramatic\nevolution makes it hard to contextualize the design landscape. We address this\nchallenge by conducting a systematic and comprehensive study of blockchain\nconsensus protocols. After first discussing key themes in classical consensus\nprotocols, we describe: first protocols based on proof-of-work (PoW), second\nproof-of-X (PoX) protocols that replace PoW with more energy-efficient\nalternatives, and third hybrid protocols that are compositions or variations of\nclassical consensus protocols. We develop a framework to evaluate their\nperformance, security and design properties, and use it to systematize key\nthemes in the protocol categories described above. This evaluation leads us to\nidentify research gaps and challenges for the community to consider in future\nresearch endeavours.",

Edge computing offered by the Edge Computing Service Provider can be\nadopted as a viable solution for offloading the mining tasks from the mobile\ndevices, i.e., miners, in the mobile blockchain environment. However, a\nmechanism needs to be designed for edge resource allocation to maximize the\nrevenue for the Edge Computing Service Provider and to ensure incentive\ncompatibility and individual rationality is still open. In this paper, we\ndevelop an optimal auction based on deep learning for the edge resource\nallocation. Specifically, we construct a multi-layer neural network\narchitecture based on an analytical solution of the optimal auction. The neural\nnetworks first perform monotone transformations of the miners' bids. Then, they\ncalculate allocation and conditional payment rules for the miners. We use\nvaluations of the miners as the data training to adjust parameters of the\nneural networks so as to optimize the loss function which is the expected,\nnegated revenue of the Edge Computing Service Provider.

Thus, the development of blockchain in mobile\napplications is restricted. In this paper, we consider the edge computing as\nthe network enabler for mobile blockchain. In particular, we study optimal\npricing-based edge computing resource management to support mobile blockchain\napplications where the mining process can be offloaded to an Edge computing\nService Provider (ESP). We adopt a two-stage Stackelberg game to jointly\nmaximize the profit of the ESP and the individual utilities of different\nminers. In Stage I, the ESP sets the price of edge computing services. In Stage\nII, the miners decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed\nprices. We apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect\nequilibrium in each stage for uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes.\nFurther, the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg game are validated for\nboth pricing schemes. At last, the performance evaluation shows that the ESP\nintends to set the maximum possible value as the optimal price for profit\nmaximization under uniform pricing. In addition, the discriminatory pricing\nhelps the ESP encourage higher total service demand from miners and achieve\ngreater profit correspondingly.",

            "summary": "The key cryptographic protocols used to secure the internet and financial\ntransactions of today are all susceptible to attack by the development of a\nsufficiently large quantum computer. One particular area at risk are\ncryptocurrencies, a market currently worth over 150 billion USD. We investigate\nthe risk of Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, to attacks by quantum\ncomputers. We find that the proof-of-work used by Bitcoin is relatively\nresistant to substantial speedup by quantum computers in the next 10 years,\nmainly because specialized ASIC miners are extremely fast compared to the\nestimated clock speed of near-term quantum computers. On the other hand, the\nelliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could\nbe completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most\noptimistic estimates. We analyze an alternative proof-of-work called Momentum,\nbased on finding collisions in a hash function, that is even more resistant to\nspeedup by a quantum computer. We also review the available post-quantum\nsignature schemes to see which one would best meet the security and efficiency\nrequirements of blockchain applications.",

Any transaction ever completed is recorded in a public ledger in\na verifiable and permanent way. Based on blockchain technology, we propose a\nglobal higher education credit platform, named EduCTX. This platform is based\non the concept of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).\nIt constitutes a globally trusted, decentralized higher education credit and\ngrading system that can offer a globally unified viewpoint for students and\nhigher education institutions (HEIs), as well as for other potential\nstakeholders such as companies, institutions, and organizations. As a proof of\nconcept, we present a prototype implementation of the environment, based on the\nopen-source Ark Blockchain Platform. Based on a globally distributed\npeer-to-peer network, EduCTX will process, manage and control ECTX tokens,\nwhich represent credits that students gain for completed courses such as ECTS.\nHEIs are the peers of the blockchain network. The platform is a first step\ntowards a more transparent and technologically advanced form of higher\neducation systems. The EduCTX platform represents the basis of the EduCTX\ninitiative which anticipates that various HEIs would join forces in order to\ncreate a globally efficient, simplified and ubiquitous environment in order to\navoid language and administrative barriers. Therefore we invite and encourage\nHEIs to join the EduCTX initiative and the EduCTX blockchain network.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we propose a new Blockchain-based message and revocation\naccountability system called Blackchain. Combining a distributed ledger with\nexisting mechanisms for security in V2X communication systems, we design a\ndistributed event data recorder (EDR) that satisfies traditional accountability\nrequirements by providing a compressed global state. Unlike previous\napproaches, our distributed ledger solution provides an accountable revocation\nmechanism without requiring trust in a single misbehavior authority, instead\nallowing a collaborative and transparent decision making process through\nBlackchain. This makes Blackchain an attractive alternative to existing\nsolutions for revocation in a Security Credential Management System (SCMS),\nwhich suffer from the traditional disadvantages of PKIs, notably including\ncentralized trust. Our proposal becomes scalable through the use of\nhierarchical consensus: individual vehicles dynamically create clusters, which\nthen provide their consensus decisions as input for road-side units (RSUs),\nwhich in turn publish their results to misbehavior authorities. This authority,\nwhich is traditionally a single entity in the SCMS, responsible for the\nintegrity of the entire V2X network, is now a set of authorities that\ntransparently perform a revocation, whose result is then published in a global\nBlackchain state. This state can be used to prevent the issuance of\ncertificates to previously malicious users, and also prevents the authority\nfrom misbehaving through the transparency implied by a global system state.",

We have also validated this framework by implementing a\nworking system LinkShare. In this paper, we describe our framework on detail\nalong with the LinkShare system.

This paper concentrates on whether Bitcoin/blockchain can be\nconsidered a complex system and, if so, whether it is a chaotic one. Beyond\nmere academic curiosity, a positive response would raise concerns about the\nlikelihood of Bitcoin/blockchain entering a 2010-Flash-Crash-type of chaotic\nregime, with catastrophic consequences for financial systems based on it. The\npaper starts by highlighting the relevant details of the Bitcoin/blockchain\necosystem formed by the blockchain itself, bitcoin end users (payers and\npayees), capital gains seekers, miners, full nodes maintainers, and developers,\nand their interactions. Then the Information Theory of Complex Systems is\nbriefly discussed for later use. Finally, the blockchain is investigated with\nthe help of Crutchfield's Statistical Complexity measure. The low non-null\nstatistical complexity value obtained suggests that the blockchain may be\nconsidered algorithmically complicated but hardly a complex system and unlikely\nto enter a chaotic regime.",

While\nefforts are ongoing to avoid newly launched objects becoming debris, the number\nof debris would still continue to grow because of collisions. ADR (Active\nDebris Removal) is an effective measure, but building a sustainable economic\nmodel for ADR remains as a difficult problem. We propose that the cost of\nremoval can be paid by circulating digital currency tokens on a blockchain\nplatform whose values may decrease and/or increase over time, issued by global\ncooperation (a consortium) of parties interested in space development, in\nexchange with proofs of ADR. The tokens pay their cost by themselves through\ncontributions by the token holders, who are likely to be benefited by removal\nof debris. This scheme imposes virtually no cost to the consortium. We have\ngeneralized this concept as POD (Proof of Disposal), which, we believe,\nprovides a more accountable foundation for solving social problems with digital\ncurrency than many ICO (Initial Coin or Cryptoasset Offering) in practice\ntoday. We evaluated the feasibility of our proposal through a simulation. We\nconclude that dynamic estimation of the economic values of each ADR and\nautomated pricing of tokens that represent the orbital debris being removed are\nindeed possible. Actual prototyping of the proposed digital currency system is\nongoing.",

            "summary": "The most fundamental purpose of blockchain technology is to enable\npersistent, consistent, distributed storage of information. Increasingly common\nare authentication systems that leverage this property to allow users to carry\ntheir personal data on a device while a hash of this data is signed by a\ntrusted authority and then put on a blockchain to be compared against. For\ninstance, in 2015, MIT introduced a schema for the publication of their\nacademic certificates based on this principle. In this work, we propose a way\nfor users to obtain assured identities based on face-to-face proofing that can\nthen be validated against a record on a blockchain. Moreover, in order to\nprovide anonymity, instead of storing a hash, we make use of a scheme of Brands\nto store a commitment against which one can perform zero-knowledge proofs of\nidentity. We also enforce the confidentiality of the underlying data by letting\nusers control a secret of their own. We show how our schema can be implemented\non Bitcoin's blockchain and how to save bandwidth by grouping commitments using\nMerkle trees to minimize the number of Bitcoin transactions that need to be\nsent. Finally, we describe a system in which users can gain access to services\nthanks to the identity records of our proposal.",

In this paper, we, for the first time,\nconsider edge computing as an enabler for mobile blockchain. In particular, we\nstudy edge computing resource management and pricing to support mobile\nblockchain applications in which the mining process of miners can be offloaded\nto an edge computing service provider. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg\ngame to jointly maximize the profit of the edge computing service provider and\nthe individual utilities of the miners. In the first stage, the service\nprovider sets the price of edge computing nodes. In the second stage, the\nminers decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed prices.\nWe apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in\neach stage for both uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. For the uniform\npricing where the same price is applied to all miners, the existence and\nuniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium are validated by identifying the best\nresponse strategies of the miners. For the discriminatory pricing where the\ndifferent prices are applied to different miners, the Stackelberg equilibrium\nis proved to exist and be unique by capitalizing on the Variational Inequality\ntheory. Further, the real experimental results are employed to justify our\nproposed model.",

While these changes\nenhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management\nchallenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these\nchallenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging,\nwhich arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within a\ntransactive microgrid, \"prosumers\" (i.e., consumers with energy generation and\nstorage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the\nload on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide\nsecurity, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system.\nOn the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from their\ntrade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be\nprotected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the\nentire grid. This paper describes Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions\n(PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that\nenables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy.

            "summary": "Blockchain systems are designed to produce blocks at a constant average rate.\nThe most popular systems currently employ a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm as a\nmeans of creating these blocks. Bitcoin produces, on average, one block every\n10 minutes. An unfortunate limitation of all deployed PoW blockchain systems is\nthat the time between blocks has high variance. For example, 5% of the time,\nBitcoin's inter-block time is at least 40 minutes. This variance impedes the\nconsistent flow of validated transactions through the system. We propose an\nalternative process for PoW-based block discovery that results in an\ninter-block time with significantly lower variance. Our algorithm, called\nBobtail, generalizes the current algorithm by comparing the mean of the k\nlowest order statistics to a target. We show that the variance of inter-block\ntimes decreases as k increases. If our approach were applied to Bitcoin, about\n80% of blocks would be found within 7 to 12 minutes, and nearly every block\nwould be found within 5 to 18 minutes; the average inter-block time would\nremain at 10 minutes. Further, we show that low-variance mining significantly\nthwarts doublespend and selfish mining attacks. For Bitcoin and Ethereum\ncurrently (k=1), an attacker with 40% of the mining power will succeed with 30%\nprobability when the merchant sets up an embargo of 8 blocks; however, when\nk>=20, the probability of success falls to less than 1%. Similarly, for Bitcoin\nand Ethereum currently, a selfish miner with 40% of the mining power will claim\nabout 66% of blocks; however, when k>=5, the same miner will find that selfish\nmining is less successful than honest mining. The cost of our approach is a\nlarger block header.",

The proposed model allows us to quickly collect information\nabout identities owning Bitcoin addresses and to recover measures and\nstatistics on the Bitcoin network. By exploiting algebraic formalism, we\nreconstructed an Entities network associated to Blockchain transactions\ngathering together Bitcoin addresses into the single entity holding permits to\nmanage Bitcoins held by those addresses. The model allows also to identify a\nset of behaviours typical of Bitcoin owners, like that of using an address only\nonce, and to reconstruct chains for this behaviour together with the rate of\nfiring. Our model is highly flexible and can easily be adapted to include\ndifferent features of the Bitcoin crypto-currency system.",

A key property of HLF is its\nextensibility, and in particular the support for multiple ordering services for\nbuilding the blockchain. Nonetheless, the version 1.0 was launched in early\n2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering\nservice. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a\nBFT ordering service for HLF on top of the BFT-SMaRt state machine\nreplication/consensus library, implementing also optimizations for wide-area\ndeployment. Our results show that HLF with our ordering service can achieve up\nto ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in\nthe blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread in different\ncontinents.",

            "summary": "Path-based transaction (PBT) networks, which settle payments from one user to\nanother via a path of intermediaries, are a growing area of research. They\novercome the scalability and privacy issues in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin\nand Ethereum by replacing expensive and slow on-chain blockchain operations\nwith inexpensive and fast off-chain transfers. In the form of credit networks\nsuch as Ripple and Stellar, they also enable low-price real-time gross\nsettlements across different currencies. For example, SilentWhsipers is a\nrecently proposed fully distributed credit network relying on path-based\ntransactions for secure and in particular private payments without a public\nledger. At the core of a decentralized PBT network is a routing algorithm that\ndiscovers transaction paths between payer and payee. During the last year, a\nnumber of routing algorithms have been proposed. However, the existing ad hoc\nefforts lack either efficiency or privacy. In this work, we first identify\nseveral efficiency concerns in SilentWhsipers. Armed with this knowledge, we\ndesign and evaluate SpeedyMurmurs, a novel routing algorithm for decentralized\nPBT networks using efficient and flexible embedding-based path discovery and\non-demand efficient stabilization to handle the dynamics of a PBT network. Our\nsimulation study, based on real-world data from the currently deployed Ripple\ncredit network, indicates that SpeedyMurmurs reduces the overhead of\nstabilization by up to two orders of magnitude and the overhead of routing a\ntransaction by more than a factor of two. Furthermore, using SpeedyMurmurs\nmaintains at least the same success ratio as decentralized landmark routing,\nwhile providing lower delays. Finally, SpeedyMurmurs achieves key privacy goals\nfor routing in PBT networks.",

As such, they are critically important in ensuring\nthat adequate privacy protections are built in. However, current methods to\nquantify privacy risk rely heavily on experienced analysts picking the\n\"correct\" risk level on e.g. a five-point scale. In this paper, we argue that a\nmore scientific quantification of privacy risk increases accuracy and\nreliability and can thus make it easier to build privacy-friendly systems. We\ndiscuss how the impact and likelihood of privacy violations can be decomposed\nand quantified, and stress the importance of meaningful metrics and units of\nmeasurement. We suggest a method of quantifying and representing privacy risk\nthat considers a collection of factors as well as a variety of contexts and\nattacker models.

We then present\nBLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private\nblockchains against data processing workloads. We conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely\nEthereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate several\ntrade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between\nblockchain and database systems.

            "summary": "We show how third-party web trackers can deanonymize users of\ncryptocurrencies. We present two distinct but complementary attacks. On most\nshopping websites, third party trackers receive information about user\npurchases for purposes of advertising and analytics. We show that, if the user\npays using a cryptocurrency, trackers typically possess enough information\nabout the purchase to uniquely identify the transaction on the blockchain, link\nit to the user's cookie, and further to the user's real identity. Our second\nattack shows that if the tracker is able to link two purchases of the same user\nto the blockchain in this manner, it can identify the user's entire cluster of\naddresses and transactions on the blockchain, even if the user employs\nblockchain anonymity techniques such as CoinJoin. The attacks are passive and\nhence can be retroactively applied to past purchases. We discuss several\nmitigations, but none are perfect.",

            "summary": "A decentralized online quantum cash system, called qBitcoin, is given. We\ndesign the system which has great benefits of quantization in the following\nsense. Firstly, quantum teleportation technology is used for coin transaction,\nwhich prevents from the owner of the coin keeping the original coin data even\nafter sending the coin to another. This was a main problem in a classical\ncircuit and a blockchain was introduced to solve this issue. In qBitcoin, the\ndouble-spending problem never happens and its security is guaranteed\ntheoretically by virtue of quantum information theory. Making a block is time\nconsuming and the system of qBitcoin is based on a quantum chain, instead of\nblocks. Therefore a payment can be completed much faster than Bitcoin. Moreover\nwe employ quantum digital signature so that it naturally inherits properties of\npeer-to-peer (P2P) cash system as originally proposed in Bitcoin.",

When executing off-chain\ntransactions in current payment networks, parties must access the blockchain\nwithin bounded time to detect misbehaving parties that deviate from the\nprotocol. This opens a window for attacks in which a malicious party can steal\nfunds by deliberately delaying other parties' blockchain access and prevents\nparties from using payment networks when disconnected from the blockchain.\n  We present Teechain, the first layer-two payment network that executes\noff-chain transactions asynchronously with respect to the underlying\nblockchain. To prevent parties from misbehaving, Teechain uses treasuries,\nprotected by hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs), to establish\noff-chain payment channels between parties. Treasuries maintain collateral\nfunds and can exchange transactions efficiently and securely, without\ninteracting with the underlying blockchain. To mitigate against treasury\nfailures and to avoid having to trust all TEEs, Teechain replicates the state\nof treasuries using committee chains, a new variant of chain replication with\nthreshold secret sharing. Teechain achieves at least a 33x higher transaction\nthroughput than the state-of-the-art Lightning payment network. A 30-machine\nTeechain deployment can handle over 1 million Bitcoin transactions per second.",

Bitcoin uses\nproof-of-work (PoW). It is a cryptographic puzzle that is difficult to solve\nbut easy to verify. However, because of significant latency of proof-of-work\nfor transactions confirmation, this consensus mechanism is vulnerable against\ndouble-spending. On the other hand, PoW consumes a significant amount of energy\nthat by growing the network, it becomes a major problematic of this consensus\nmechanism. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to PoW, because of all\nits major problems and security issues that may lead to collapsing\ndecentralization of the blockchain, while a full decentralized system is the\nmain purpose of using blockchain technology. The approach we introduce is based\non a distributed voting process and called \"RDV: Register, Deposit, Vote\".\nSince in RDV algorithm, there is no mining process, so it is appropriate for\nlow-level energy devices and Internet of Things (IoT).",

The\ncommunication between nodes is achieved through executable choreographies,\nwhich are capable of preventing information leakage when executing across\ndifferent organizations with different regulations in place. The user has full\ncontrol over his private data and is able to share and revoke access to\norganizations at any time. Even more, the updates are propagated instantly to\nall the parties which have access to the data thanks to the system design.\nSpecifically, the processing organizations may retrieve and process the shared\ninformation, but are not allowed under any circumstances to store it on long\nterm. PDS offers an alternative to systems that aim to ensure self-sovereignty\nof specific types of data through blockchain inspired techniques but face\nvarious problems, such as low performance.

Our Android open source solution explores the capability of\ncurrent smartphones to acquire, process and match fingerprints using only its\nbuilt-in hardware. Our architecture is specifically designed to run completely\nlocally and autonomously, not requiring any cloud service, server, or\npermissioned access to fingerprint reader hardware. It involves three main\nstages, starting with the fingerprint acquisition using the smartphone camera,\nfollowed by a processing pipeline to obtain minutiae features and a final step\nfor matching against other locally stored fingerprints, based on Oriented FAST\nand Rotated BRIEF (ORB) descriptors. We obtained a mean matching accuracy of\n55%, with the highest value of 67% for thumb fingers. Our ability to capture\nand process a finger fingerprint in mere seconds using a smartphone makes this\nwork usable in a wide range of scenarios, for instance, offline remote regions.\nThis work is specifically designed to be a key building block for a\nself-sovereign identity solution and integrate with our permissionless\nblockchain for identity and key attestation.",

            "summary": "The Ripple credit network has emerged as a payment backbone with key\nadvantages for financial institutions and the remittance industry. Its\npath-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies\nconceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies, and\nmakes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the\nremittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond.\n  This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its\ninception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect\nthe credit of linnet users' wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in\nthe current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling\nflag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across\nthose links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly\nconnected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the network's core and provide\nhigh liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base\nof around 112,000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10\nhighly connected gateway wallets. Indeed, today about 4.9M USD cannot be\nwithdrawn by their owners from the Ripple network due to PayRoutes, a gateway\ntagged as faulty by the Ripple community. Finally, we observe that stale\nexchange offers pose a real problem, and exchanges (market makers) have not\nalways been vigilant about periodically updating their exchange offers\naccording to current real-world exchange rates. For example, stale offers were\nused by 84 Ripple wallets to gain more than 4.5M USD from mid-July to\nmid-August 2017. Our findings should prompt the Ripple community to improve the\nhealth of the network by educating its users on increasing their connectivity,\nand by appropriately maintaining the credit limits, rippling flags, and\nexchange offers on their credit links.",

These properties make\nblockchains suitable for apps that require disintermediation through trustless\nexchange, consistent and incorruptible transaction records, and operational\nmodels beyond cryptocurrency. In particular, blockchain and its smart contract\ncapabilities have the potential to address healthcare interoperability issues,\nsuch as enabling effective interactions between users and medical applications,\ndelivering patient data securely to a variety of organizations and devices, and\nimproving the overall efficiency of medical practice workflow. Despite the\ninterest in using blockchain for healthcare interoperability, however, little\ninformation is available on the concrete architectural styles and patterns for\napplying blockchain to healthcare apps. This paper provides an initial step in\nfilling this gap by showing: (1) the features and implementation challenges in\nhealthcare interoperability, (2) an end-to-end case study of a blockchain-based\nhealthcare app we are developing, and (3) how applying foundational software\npatterns can help address common interoperability challenges faced by\nblockchain-based healthcare apps.",

MHFs have interesting cryptographic\napplications, most notably to password hashing and securing blockchains.\n  Alwen and Serbinenko [STOC'15] define the cumulative memory complexity (cmc)\nof a function as the sum (over all time-steps) of the amount of memory required\nto compute the function. They advocate that a good MHF must have high cmc.\nUnlike previous notions, cmc takes into account that dedicated hardware might\nexploit amortization and parallelism. Still, cmc has been critizised as\ninsufficient, as it fails to capture possible time-memory trade-offs, as memory\ncost doesn't scale linearly, functions with the same cmc could still have very\ndifferent actual hardware cost.\n  In this work we address this problem, and introduce the notion of\nsustained-memory complexity, which requires that any algorithm evaluating the\nfunction must use a large amount of memory for many steps. We construct\nfunctions (in the parallel random oracle model) whose sustained-memory\ncomplexity is almost optimal: our function can be evaluated using $n$ steps and\n$O(n/\\log(n))$ memory, in each step making one query to the (fixed-input\nlength) random oracle, while any algorithm that can make arbitrary many\nparallel queries to the random oracle, still needs $\\Omega(n/\\log(n))$ memory\nfor $\\Omega(n)$ steps.\n  Our main technical contribution is the construction is a family of DAGs on\n$n$ nodes with constant indegree with high \"sustained-space complexity\",\nmeaning that any parallel black-pebbling strategy requires $\\Omega(n/\\log(n))$\npebbles for at least $\\Omega(n)$ steps.",

We address the issue of trustworthy online\nvoting protocols and recall therefore their security concepts with its trust\nassumptions. Inspired by the Bitcoin protocol, the prospects of distributed\nonline voting protocols are analysed. No trusted authority is assumed to ensure\nballot secrecy. Further, the integrity of the voting is enforced by all voters\nthemselves and without a weakest link, the protocol becomes more robust. We\nintroduce a taxonomy of notions of distribution in online voting protocols that\nwe apply on selected online voting protocols.

In this paper, we empirically evaluate two weaknesses in\nMonero's mixin sampling strategy. First, about 62% of transaction inputs with\none or more mixins are vulnerable to \"chain-reaction\" analysis -- that is, the\nreal input can be deduced by elimination. Second, Monero mixins are sampled in\nsuch a way that they can be easily distinguished from the real coins by their\nage distribution; in short, the real input is usually the \"newest\" input. We\nestimate that this heuristic can be used to guess the real input with 80%\naccuracy over all transactions with 1 or more mixins. Next, we turn to the\nMonero ecosystem and study the importance of mining pools and the former\nanonymous marketplace AlphaBay on the transaction volume. We find that after\nremoving mining pool activity, there remains a large amount of potentially\nprivacy-sensitive transactions that are affected by these weaknesses. We\npropose and evaluate two countermeasures that can improve the privacy of future\ntransactions.",

This\npaper explores the use of sensing and signalling devices that are commonly\nintegrated into modern vehicles for side-channel communication purposes.\nVisible light (using a CMOS camera) and acoustic (ultrasonic audio)\nside-channel encoding techniques are proposed, developed and evaluated in this\ncontext. The side-channels are examined both theoretically and experimentally\nand an upper bound on the line code modulation rate that is achievable with\nthese side channel schemes in the vehicular networking context is established.\nA novel inter-vehicle session key establishment protocol, leveraging both\nside-channels and a blockchain public key infrastructure, is then presented. In\nlight of the limited channel capacity and the interoperability/security\nrequirements for vehicular communications, techniques for constraining the\nthroughput requirement, providing device independence and validating the\nlocation of the intended recipient vehicle, are presented. These reduce the\nnecessary device handshake throughput to 176 bits for creating symmetric\nencryption and message authentication keys and in verifying a vehicle's\ncertificate with a recognised certification authority.",

            "summary": "Stratum, the de-facto mining communication protocol used by blockchain based\ncryptocurrency systems, enables miners to reliably and efficiently fetch jobs\nfrom mining pool servers. In this paper we exploit Stratum's lack of encryption\nto develop passive and active attacks on Bitcoin's mining protocol, with\nimportant implications on the privacy, security and even safety of mining\nequipment owners. We introduce StraTap and ISP Log attacks, that infer miner\nearnings if given access to miner communications, or even their logs. We\ndevelop BiteCoin, an active attack that hijacks shares submitted by miners, and\ntheir associated payouts. We build BiteCoin on WireGhost, a tool we developed\nto hijack and surreptitiously maintain Stratum connections. Our attacks reveal\nthat securing Stratum through pervasive encryption is not only undesirable (due\nto large overheads), but also ineffective: an adversary can predict miner\nearnings even when given access to only packet timestamps. Instead, we devise\nBedrock, a minimalistic Stratum extension that protects the privacy and\nsecurity of mining participants. We introduce and leverage the mining cookie\nconcept, a secret that each miner shares with the pool and includes in its\npuzzle computations, and that prevents attackers from reconstructing or\nhijacking the puzzles. We have implemented our attacks and collected 138MB of\nStratum protocol traffic from mining equipment in the US and Venezuela. We show\nthat Bedrock is resilient to active attacks even when an adversary breaks the\ncrypto constructs it uses. Bedrock imposes a daily overhead of 12.03s on a\nsingle pool server that handles mining traffic from 16,000 miners.",

Public blockchains,\nsuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like\ncrypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well\nstudied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with\nstronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems\ntarget and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on\ntop of database systems, for example banking, finance applications. Multiple\nplatforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned.\nHowever, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different\nsystems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can\nbe used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing\nplatform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly\nimprove their platforms.\n  In this paper, we first describe BlockBench, the first evaluation framework\nfor analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for\ndifferent platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design\nchoices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BlockBench via simple APIs\nand benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart\ncontracts. BlockBench measures overall and component-wise performance in terms\nof throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use\nBlockBench to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private\nblockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate\nthat these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in\ntraditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in\nperformance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices\nat different layers of the software stack.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, as deployed\ntoday, cannot scale for wide-spread use. A leading approach for cryptocurrency\nscaling is a smart contract mechanism called a payment channel which enables\ntwo mutually distrustful parties to transact efficiently (and only requires a\nsingle transaction in the blockchain to set-up). Payment channels can be linked\ntogether to form a payment network, such that payments between any two parties\ncan (usually) be routed through the network along a path that connects them.\nCrucially, both parties can transact without trusting hops along the route.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel variant of payment channels, called\nSprites, that reduces the worst-case \"collateral cost\" that each hop along the\nroute may incur. The benefits of Sprites are two-fold. 1) In Lightning Network,\na payment across a path of $\\ell$ channels requires locking up collateral for\n$\\Theta(\\ell\\Delta)$ time, where $\\Delta$ is the time to commit an on-chain\ntransaction. Sprites reduces this cost to $O(\\ell + \\Delta)$. 2) Unlike prior\nwork, Sprites supports partial withdrawals and deposits, during which the\nchannel can continue to operate without interruption.\n  In evaluating Sprites we make several additional contributions. First, our\nsimulation-based security model is the first formalism to model timing\nguarantees in payment channels. Our construction is also modular, making use of\na generic abstraction from folklore, called the \"state channel,\" which we are\nthe first to formalize. We also provide a simulation framework for payment\nnetwork protocols, which we use to confirm that the Sprites construction\nmitigates against throughput-reducing attacks.",

            "summary": "Modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, permit complex financial\ntransactions through scripts called smart contracts. These smart contracts are\nexecuted many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart\ncontracts are serially executed by miners before appending them to the\nblockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by validators to\nverify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners.\n  Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's\nconcurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution\nappears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming\nlanguages have a serial semantics.\n  This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute\nsmart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software\ntransactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel,\nallowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and \"discovering\" a\nserializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is\ncaptured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to\nre-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently.\n  Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show that a speedup of\nof 1.33x can be obtained for miners and 1.69x for validators with just three\nconcurrent threads.",

            "summary": "This paper introduces a deterministic Byzantine consensus algorithm that\nrelies on a new weak coordinator. As opposed to previous algorithms that cannot\nterminate in the presence of a faulty or slow coordinator, our algorithm can\nterminate even when its coordinator is faulty, hence the name weak coordinator.\nThe key idea is to allow processes to complete asynchronous rounds as soon as\nthey receive a threshold of messages, instead of having to wait for a message\nfrom a coordinator that may be slow.\n  The resulting algorithm assumes partial synchrony, is resilience optimal,\ntime optimal and does not need signatures. Our presentation is didactic: we\nfirst present a simple safe binary Byzantine consensus algorithm, modify it to\nensure termination, and finally present an optimized reduction from multivalue\nconsensus to binary consensus that may terminate in 4 message delays. To\nevaluate our algorithm, we deployed it on 100 machines distributed in 5\ndatacenters across different continents and compared its performance against\nthe randomized solution from Mostefaoui, Moumem and Raynal [PODC14] that\nterminates in O(1) rounds in expectation. Our algorithm always outperforms the\nlatter even in the presence of Byzantine behaviors. Our algorithm has a\nsubsecond average latency in most of our geo-distributed experiments, even when\nattacked by a well-engineered coalition of Byzantine processes.",

            "summary": "Today's storage systems expose abstractions which are either too low-level\n(e.g., key-value store, raw-block store) that they require developers to\nre-invent the wheels, or too high-level (e.g., relational databases, Git) that\nthey lack generality to support many classes of applications. In this work, we\npropose and implement a general distributed data storage system, called UStore,\nwhich has rich semantics. UStore delivers three key properties, namely\nimmutability, sharing and security, which unify and add values to many classes\nof today's applications, and which also open the door for new applications. By\nkeeping the core properties within the storage, UStore helps reduce application\ndevelopment efforts while offering high performance at hand. The storage\nembraces current hardware trends as key enablers. It is built around a\ndata-structure similar to that of Git, a popular source code versioning system,\nbut it also synthesizes many designs from distributed systems and databases.\nOur current implementation of UStore has better performance than general\nin-memory key-value storage systems, especially for version scan operations. We\nport and evaluate four applications on top of UStore: a Git-like application, a\ncollaborative data science application, a transaction management application,\nand a blockchain application. We demonstrate that UStore enables faster\ndevelopment and the UStore-backed applications can have better performance than\nthe existing implementations.",

            "summary": "Blockchain protocols are inherently limited in transaction throughput and\nlatency. Recent efforts to address performance and scale blockchains have\nfocused on off-chain payment channels. While such channels can achieve low\nlatency and high throughput, deploying them securely on top of the Bitcoin\nblockchain has been difficult, partly because building a secure implementation\nrequires changes to the underlying protocol and the ecosystem.\n  We present Teechan, a full-duplex payment channel framework that exploits\ntrusted execution environments. Teechan can be deployed securely on the\nexisting Bitcoin blockchain without having to modify the protocol. It: (i)\nachieves a higher transaction throughput and lower transaction latency than\nprior solutions; (ii) enables unlimited full-duplex payments as long as the\nbalance does not exceed the channel's credit; (iii) requires only a single\nmessage to be sent per payment in any direction; and (iv) places at most two\ntransactions on the blockchain under any execution scenario.\n  We have built and deployed the Teechan framework using Intel SGX on the\nBitcoin network. Our experiments show that, not counting network latencies,\nTeechan can achieve 2,480 transactions per second on a single channel, with\nsub-millisecond latencies.",

            "summary": "The registration, transfer, clearing and settlement of equities represents a\nsignificant part of economic activity currently underserved by modern\ntechnological innovation. In addition, recent events have revealed problems of\ntransparency, inviting public criticism and scrutiny from regulatory\nauthorities. A peer-to-peer platform facilitating the creation and exchange of\ndirectly registered shares represents a shift in equity markets towards more\nefficient, transparent operations as well as greater accessibility to the\ninvesting public and issuing companies. Blockchain technology solves the\nproblem of transaction processing and clearing but the fungibility of their\nunits pose a challenge in identifying the issuers and holders of specific\nequities. Furthermore, as the issuers are in a constant state of flux the\nbenefits of a decentralized network are lost if a central manager is required\nto cancel equities from companies that no longer exist. We propose a solution\nto these problems using digital signatures, based on blockchain technology.",

            "summary": "Bitcoin is a digital currency and electronic payment system operating over a\npeer-to-peer network on the Internet. One of its most important properties is\nthe high level of anonymity it provides for its users. The users are identified\nby their Bitcoin addresses, which are random strings in the public records of\ntransactions, the blockchain. When a user initiates a Bitcoin-transaction, his\nBitcoin client program relays messages to other clients through the Bitcoin\nnetwork. Monitoring the propagation of these messages and analyzing them\ncarefully reveal hidden relations. In this paper, we develop a mathematical\nmodel using a probabilistic approach to link Bitcoin addresses and transactions\nto the originator IP address. To utilize our model, we carried out experiments\nby installing more than a hundred modified Bitcoin clients distributed in the\nnetwork to observe as many messages as possible. During a two month observation\nperiod we were able to identify several thousand Bitcoin clients and bind their\ntransactions to geographical locations.",

As in Bitcoin, execution\nfidelity is cryptographically enforced; however, \\emph{Strong Federations}\nsignificantly lower capital requirements for market participants by reducing\ntransaction latency and improving interoperability.

            "summary": "The surging interest in blockchain technology has revitalized the search for\neffective Byzantine consensus schemes. In particular, the blockchain community\nhas been looking for ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine\nfault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing\nvarious financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions.\nHowever, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their\n$O(n^2)$ message complexity.\n  In this paper, we propose FastBFT, a fast and scalable BFT protocol. At the\nheart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines\nhardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret\nsharing primitives. Combining this technique with several other optimizations\n(i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT\nachieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks. Via\nsystematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that FastBFT has better\nscalability and performance than previous BFT protocols.",
