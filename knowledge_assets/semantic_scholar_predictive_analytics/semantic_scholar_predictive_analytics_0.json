Artifact-centric processes) are implementations of a paradigm where an instance of one process is not executed in isolation but interacts with other instances of the same or other processes. Interactions take place through bridging events where instances exchange data. Object-centric processes are recently gaining popularity in academia and industry, because their nature is observed in many application scenarios. This poses significant challenges in predictive analytics due to the complex intricacy of the process instances that relate to each other via many-to-many associations. Existing research is unable to directly exploit the benefits of these interactions, thus limiting the prediction quality. This paper proposes an approach to incorporate the information about the object interactions into the predictive models. The approach is assessed on real-life object-centric process event data, using different KPIs. The results are compared with a naive approach that overlooks the object interactions, thus illustrating the benefits of their use on the prediction quality.",

C-factor Computing has the same vision of empowering their existing products through data analysis and forecasting to better suit the need of customers and decision making of stakeholders. The project involves 5 key aspects in Analytics - Data Acquisition, Big data or data Storage, Data Transformation (Unstructured to Structured), Data Wrangling, Predictive Modeling / Visualization. Data Acquisition involves gathering existing transactional and search data of customers and travel aggregators who use the product. This data is used to create powerful dashboards capable of predictive analytics which help the company make informed choices. The key aspects mentioned can be achieved through various tools available but requires testing at every stage in order to realize the appropriate software for the data present in the company. Hence the project deals with studying and implementing selected tools in order to provide the right framework to achieve an interactive dashboard capable of predictive analytics which can also be integrated into the existing products of the company.",

To apply standard machine learning techniques, these categorical predictors are always converted to a set of binary features via one-hot encoding, making the resultant feature vector highly sparse. To learn from such sparse data effectively, it is crucial to account for the interactions between features. Factorization Machines (FMs) are a popular solution for efficiently using the second-order feature interactions. However, FM models feature interactions in a linear way, which can be insufficient for capturing the non-linear and complex inherent structure of real-world data. While deep neural networks have recently been applied to learn non-linear feature interactions in industry, such as the Wide&Deep by Google and DeepCross by Microsoft, the deep structure meanwhile makes them difficult to train. In this paper, we propose a novel model Neural Factorization Machine (NFM) for prediction under sparse settings. NFM seamlessly combines the linearity of FM in modelling second-order feature interactions and the non-linearity of neural network in modelling higher-order feature interactions. Conceptually, NFM is more expressive than FM since FM can be seen as a special case of NFM without hidden layers. Empirical results on two regression tasks show that with one hidden layer only, NFM significantly outperforms FM with a 7.3% relative improvement. Compared to the recent deep learning methods Wide&Deep and DeepCross, our NFM uses a shallower structure but offers better performance, being much easier to train and tune in practice.",

            "abstract": "The recent advances in information management systems coupled with machine learning algorithms paved the way for a significant revolution in animal healthcare industries. However, the data in such systems suffer from various challenges such as security, reliability, and convenience, to name a few. Traditional systems are not useful to meet these critical issues because these systems have not a consistent structure for data security and reliability policies. Therefore, a new solution is required to enhance data accessibility and should regulate government security policies to ensure the accountability of the usage of the medical records system. Moreover, it is also required to analyze historical data of veterinary clinic using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the future appointments scheduling requests, which is essential for veterinary management to drive better future decisions, for instance, future demands of medical supplies and to plan veterinary medical staff, etc. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel blockchain-based reliable and intelligent veterinary information management system (RIVIMS) using smart contract and machine learning techniques. The proposed RIVIMS consists of two main modules; blockchain-based secured veterinary information management, data and predictive analytics modules. First, a blockchain-based secure and reliable veterinary clinic information management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric. Second, a smart contract enabled data, and predictive analytics modules are developed using permissioned blockchain framework. The data and predictive modules aim to analyze veterinary clinic patients appointments data in order to discover underlying patterns and build a robust prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The data and predictive helps veterinary management to drive better future business decisions to provide better healthcare services to veterinary patients. Hyperledger Caliper is used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the performance of the developed blockchain-based system in terms of transaction per second, transaction success rate, transaction throughput, and transaction latency. Furthermore, machine learning performance measures have utilized, such as MAE, RMSE, and R2 score to evaluate the overall performance of the prediction model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed RIVIMS.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we explore how the development and affordances of predictive analytics may impact how teachers and other educational actors think about and teach students and, more broadly, how society understands education. Our particular focus is on the data dashboards of learning support systems which are based on Machine Learning (ML). While previous research has focused on how these systems produce credible knowledge, we explore here how they also produce compelling, persuasive and convincing narratives. Our main argument is that particular kinds of stories are written by predictive analytics and written into their data dashboards. Based on a case study of a leading predictive analytics system, we explore how data dashboards imply causality between the \u2018facts\u2019 they are visualising. To do so, we analyse the stories they tell according to their spatial and temporal dimensions, characters and events, sequentiality as well as tellability. In the stories we identify, teachers are managers, students are at greater or lesser risk, and students\u2019 sociality is reduced to machine-readable interactions. Overall, only data marked as individual behaviours becomes relevant to the system, rendering structural inequalities invisible. Reflecting on the implications of these systems, we suggest ways in which the uptake of these systems can interrupt such stories and reshape them in other directions.",

            "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has questioned the way healthcare operations take place globally as the healthcare professionals face an unprecedented task of controlling and treating the COVID-19 infected patients with a highly straining and draining facility due to the erratic admissions of infected patients. However, COVID-19 is considered as a white swan event. Yet, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare operations is highly uncertain and disruptive making it as a black swan event. Therefore, the study explores the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare operations and develops machine learning-based forecasting models using time series data to foresee the progression of COVID-19 and further using predictive analytics to better manage healthcare operations. The prediction error of the proposed model is found to be 0.039 for new cases and 0.006 for active COVID-19 cases with respect to mean absolute percentage error. The proposed simulated model further could generate predictive analytics and yielded future recovery rate, resource management ratios, and average cycle time of a patient tested COVID-19 positive. Further, the study will help healthcare professionals to devise better resilience and decision-making for managing uncertainty and disruption in healthcare operations.",

The literature has reported the influence of big data and predictive analytics for improved supply chain and operational performance, but there has been a paucity of literature regarding the role of external institutional pressures on the resources of the organization to build big data capability. To address this gap, this paper draws on the resource\u2010based view of the firm, institutional theory and organizational culture to develop and test a model that describes the importance of resources for building capabilities, skills and big data culture and subsequently improving cost and operational performance. We test our research hypotheses using 195 surveys, gathered using a pre\u2010tested questionnaire. Our contribution lies in providing insights regarding the role of external pressures on the selection of resources under the moderating effect of big data culture and their utilization for capability building, and how this capability affects cost and operational performance.",

Most of the predictive analytic applications in higher education are proprietary, with private companies offering little transparency about their underlying models. We address this lack of transparency by systematically comparing two important dimensions: (1) different approaches to sample and variable construction and how these affect model accuracy and (2) how the selection of predictive modeling approaches, ranging from methods many institutional researchers would be familiar with to more complex machine learning methods, affects model performance and the stability of predicted scores. The relative ranking of students\u2019 predicted probability of completing college varies substantially across modeling approaches. While we observe substantial gains in performance from models trained on a sample structured to represent the typical enrollment spells of students and with a robust set of predictors, we observe similar performance between the simplest and the most complex models.",

In this context, proactive strategies can be adopted, as enabled by predictive analytics. Predictive analytics in turn can make a shift in traditional maintenance approaches to more effective optimising their cost and transforming maintenance from a necessary evil to a strategic business factor. Empowered by the aforementioned points, this paper discusses a novel methodology for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation enabling predictive maintenance of industrial equipment using partial knowledge over its degradation function and the parameters that are affecting it. Moreover, the design and prototype implementation of a plug-n-play end-to-end cloud architecture, supporting predictive maintenance of industrial equipment is presented integrating the aforementioned concept as a service. This is achieved by integrating edge gateways, data stores at both the edge and the cloud, and various applications, such as predictive analytics, visualization and scheduling, integrated as services in the cloud system. The proposed approach has been implemented into a prototype and tested in an industrial use case related to the maintenance of a robotic arm. Obtained results show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methodology in supporting predictive analytics in the era of Industry 4.0.",

Artificial intelligence predictive analytics can potentially facilitate targeted interventions to improve efficiency. We describe a quality improvement project that uses machine learning techniques to predict and reduce outpatient MRI appointment no-shows. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Anonymized records from 32,957 outpatient MRI appointments between 2016 and 2018 were acquired for model training and validation along with a holdout test set of 1080 records from January 2019. The overall no-show rate was 17.4%. A predictive model developed with XGBoost, a decision tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework, was deployed after various machine learning algorithms were evaluated. The simple intervention measure of using telephone call reminders for patients with the top 25% highest risk of an appointment no-show as predicted by the model was implemented over 6 months. RESULTS. The ROC AUC for the predictive model was 0.746 with an optimized F1 score of 0.708; at this threshold, the precision and recall were 0.606 and 0.852, respectively. The AUC for the holdout test set was 0.738 with an optimized F1 score of 0.721; at this threshold, the precision and recall were 0.605 and 0.893, respectively. The no-show rate 6 months after deployment of the predictive model was 15.9% compared with 19.3% in the preceding 12-month preintervention period, corresponding to a 17.2% improvement from the baseline no-show rate (p < 0.0001). The no-show rates of contactable and noncontactable patients in the group at high risk of appointment no-shows as predicted by the model were 17.5% and 40.3%, respectively (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION. Machine learning predictive analytics perform moderately well in predicting complex problems involving human behavior using a modest amount of data with basic feature engineering, and they can be incorporated into routine workflow to improve health care delivery.",

Our objective was to identify facilitators, challenges, and recommendations for implementing a novel predictive algorithm which aims to prospectively identify patients with high preventable utilization to proactively involve them in preventative interventions.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nIn preparation for implementing the predictive algorithm in 3 organizations, we interviewed 3 stakeholder groups: health systems operations (eg, chief medical officers, department chairs), informatics personnel, and potential end users (eg, physicians, nurses, social workers). We applied thematic analysis to derive key themes and categorize them into the dimensions of Sittig and Singh's original sociotechnical model for studying health information technology in complex adaptive healthcare systems. Recruiting and analysis were conducted iteratively until thematic saturation was achieved.\n\n\nRESULTS\nForty-nine interviews were conducted in 3 healthcare organizations. Technical components of the implementation (hardware and software) raised fewer concerns than alignment with sociotechnical factors. Stakeholders wanted decision support based on the algorithm to be clear and actionable and incorporated into current workflows. However, how to make this disease-independent classification tool actionable was perceived as a challenge, and appropriate patient interventions informed by the algorithm appeared likely to require substantial external and institutional resources. Stakeholders also described the criticality of trust, credibility, and interpretability of the predictive algorithm.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough predictive analytics can classify patients with high accuracy, they cannot advance healthcare processes and outcomes without careful implementation that takes into account the sociotechnical system. Key stakeholders have strong perceptions about facilitators and challenges to shape successful implementation.",

Hence, the limitations of prediction models can highly impact prioritizing maintenance tasks and allocating budget. This study aims to investigate the potential of different predictive models in reaching an effective and efficient maintenance plan. This paper reviews the literature on predictive analytics for a set of highway assets. It also highlights the gaps and limitations of the current methodologies, such as subjective assumptions and simplifications applied in deterministic and probabilistic approaches. This article additionally discusses how these shortcomings impact the application and accuracy of the methods, and how advanced predictive analytics can mitigate the challenges. In this review, we discuss how advancements in technologies coupled with ever-increasing computing power are creating opportunities for a paradigm shift in predictive analytics. We also propose new research directions including the application of advanced machine learning to develop extensible and scalable prediction models and leveraging emerging sensing technologies for collecting, storing and analyzing the data. Finally, we addressed future directions of predictive analysis associated with the data-rich era that will potentially help transportation agencies to become information-rich.",

Now, use of predictive analytics and AI in medicine, though with fits and starts, is transitioning from hype to reality: Several commercial algorithms have received regulatory approval for broad clinical use. But the barrier for entry of new advanced algorithms has been low. To unlock the potential of advanced analytics while protecting patient safety, regulatory and professional bodies should ensure that advanced algorithms meet accepted standards of clinical benefit, just as they do for clinical therapeutics and predictive biomarkers. External validation and prospective testing of advanced algorithms are clearly needed (2), but recent regulatory clearances raise concerns over the rigor of this process. Given these concerns, we propose five standards to guide regulation of devices based on predictive analytics and AI. Although well-established research standards, such as the TRIPOD Checklist, exist for developing and validating multivariable prediction models in medicine (3), our standards provide regulatory guidance for such algorithms prior to implementation in clinical settings.",

Due to its high cost and prevalence, sepsis is a major focus area across institutions and many studies have emerged over the past years with different models or novel machine learning techniques in early detection of sepsis or potential mortality associated with sepsis. Objective\u2003To understand predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients, either in early detection of onset or mortality. Methods and Results\u2003We performed a systematized narrative review and identified common and unique characteristics between their approaches and results in studies that used predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients. After reviewing 148 retrieved papers, a total of 31 qualifying papers were analyzed with variances in model, including linear regression (n\u2009=\u20092), logistic regression (n\u2009=\u20095), support vector machines (n\u2009=\u20094), and Markov models (n\u2009=\u20094), as well as population (range: 24\u2013198,833) and feature size (range: 2\u2013285). Many of the studies used local data sets of varying sizes and locations while others used the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care data. Additionally, vital signs or laboratory test results were commonly used as features for training and testing purposes; however, a few used more unique features including gene expression data from blood plasma and unstructured text and data from clinician notes. Conclusion\u2003Overall, we found variation in the domain of predictive analytics tools for septic patients, from feature and population size to choice of method or algorithm. There are still limitations in transferability and generalizability of the algorithms or methods used. However, it is evident that implementing predictive analytics tools are beneficial in the early detection of sepsis or death related to sepsis. Since most of these studies were retrospective, the translational value in the real-world setting in different wards should be further investigated.",

Considering the recent epidemic in China, modeling of COVID-19 epidemic for cumulative number of infected cases using data available in early phase was big challenge. Being COVID-19 pandemic during very short time span, it is very important to analyze the trend of these spread and infected cases. This predictive analytics can be empowered using Information, Communication and Technologies (ICT) services, tools and applications. This paper presents medical perspective of COVID-19 towards epidemiological triad and the study of state-of-the-art. The main aim this paper is to present different predictive analytics techniques available for trend analysis, different models and algorithms and their comparison. Finally, this paper concludes with prediction of COVID-19 using Prophet algorithm indicating more faster spread in short term. These predictions will be useful to government and healthcare communities to initiate appropriate measures to control this outbreak in time.",

For instance, big data are very important in predicting the trends on what will happen in the future. Many researchers have generated or gathered data to further enhance their research and to apply them to numerous real-life applications. Examples of big data include healthcare patient data. To improve the detection of illnesses and diseases, researchers have gathered healthcare patient data, examined the diagnosis on healthcare patient data (e.g., cells, blood count, antibodies count), and compared with previous data to determine if a specific illness or disease exist. Having an automatic predictive method for healthcare and disease analytics would be desirable. In this paper, we focus on healthcare mining, which aims to computationally discover knowledge from healthcare data. In particular, we present a data science framework with two predictive analytic algorithms for accurate prediction on the trends of cancer cases. The algorithms predict cancerous cells based on the information of the cell data from some data samples. Evaluation results on several real-life datasets related to the breast cancer demosntrate the effectiveness of our data science framework and predictive algorithms in healthcare data analytics.",

While the majority of the patients positively respond to the existing anti-epilepsy drugs, others who developed the refractory type of epilepsy show resistance against drug therapy and need to undergo advance treatments such as surgery. Given that identifying such patients is not a straightforward process and requires long courses of trial and error with anti-epilepsy drugs, this study aims at predicting those at-risk patients using clinical and demographic data obtained from electronic medical records. Specifically, the study employs several predictive analytics machine-learning methods, equipped with a novel approach for data balancing, to identify drug-resistant patients using their comorbidities and demographic information along with the initial epilepsy-related diagnosis made by their physician. The promising results we obtained highlight the potential use of machine-learning techniques in facilitating medical decisions and suggest the possibility of extending the proposed approach for developing a clinical decision support system for medical professionals.",

To demonstrate the usefulness of our machine learning algorithm as a solution to this problem, we use it on heterogeneous data\u2014namely, transit data and weather data\u2014to predict the expected delay of streetcars (aka trolley cars) in the Canadian city of Toronto. To make accurate prediction, our algorithm takes into account multiple factors such us rain, snow, temperature, time of day, and season. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and usefulness of our fuzzy logic based machine learning algorithm for predictive analytics on big transportation data, which is promising toward development of a predictive intelligent transport system (ITS).",

            "abstract": "Predictive analytics play an important role in clinical research. An accurate predictive model can help clinicians stratify risk thereby allowing the identification of a target population which might benefit from a certain intervention. Conventionally, predictive analytics is performed using parametric modeling which comes with a number of assumptions. For example, generalized linear regression models require linearity and additivity to hold for the underlying data. However, these assumptions may not hold in practice. Especially in the era of big data, a large number of covariates or features can be extracted from an electronic database which might have complex interactions and higher-order terms among the covariates. Conventional modeling methods have trouble capturing such high-dimensional relationships. However, some sophisticated machine learning techniques have been invented to handle this situation. Gradient boosting is one of these techniques which is able to recursively fit a weak learner to the residual so as to improve model performance with a gradually increasing number of iterations. It can automatically discover complex data structure, including nonlinearity and high-order interactions, even in the context of hundreds, thousands, or tens-of-thousands of potential predictors. This paper aims to introduce how gradient boosting works. The principles behind this learning machine are explained with a small example in a step-by-step manner. The formal implementation of gradient tree boosting is then illustrated with the caret package. In the simulated example complexity of data structure is created by generating certain interactions between the covariates. This example shows that gradient boosting can better capture these complex relationships than a generalized linear model-based approach.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this article is to study the impact of weather on the damage caused by fire incidents across the United States. The article uses two sets of big data\u2014\u2010fire incidents data from the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\u2014to obtain a single comprehensive data set for prediction and analysis of fire risk. In the article, the loss is referred to as \u201cTotal Percent Loss,\u201d a metric that is calculated based on the content and property loss incurred by an owner over the total value of content and property. Gradient boosting tree (GBT), a machine learning algorithm, is implemented on the processed data to predict the losses due to fire incidents. An R2 value of 0.933 and mean squared error (MSE) of 124.641 out of 10,000 signify the extent of high predictive accuracy obtained by implementing the GBT model. In addition to this, an excellent predictive performance demonstrated by the GBT model is further validated by a strong fitting between the predicted loss and the actual loss for the test data set, with an R2 value of 0.97. While analyzing the influence of each input variable on the output, it is observed that the state in which a fire incident takes place plays a major role in determining fire risk. This article provides useful insights to fire managers and researchers in the form of a detailed framework of big data and predictive analytics for effective management of fire risk.",

The model was further tested using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) following Peng and Lai (2012) arguments. The authors gathered 205 responses using survey-based instrument for PLS-SEM.,The statistical results suggest that out of four research hypotheses, the authors found support for three hypotheses (H1-H3) and the authors did not find support for H4. Although the authors did not find support for H4 (moderating role of supply base complexity (SBC)), however, in future the relationship between BDPA, SBC and sustainable supply chain performance measures remain interesting research questions for further studies.,This study makes some original contribution to the operations and supply chain management literature. The authors provide theory-driven and empirically proven results which extend previous studies which have focused on single performance measures (i.e. economic or environmental). Hence, by studying the impact of BDPA on three performance measures the authors have attempted to answer some of the unresolved questions. The authors also offer numerous guidance to the practitioners and policy makers, based on empirical results.",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to tremendous reduction in the sequencing time and given rise to the production and collection of high volumes of genomic datasets. Predicting protein-coding genes from these copious genomic datasets is significant for the synthesis of protein and the understating of the regulatory function of the non-coding region. Methods have been developed to find protein-coding genes from the genome of organisms. Notwithstanding, the recent data explosion in genomics accentuates the need for more efficient algorithms for gene prediction. In this paper, we explore predictive analytics on genomic data. In particular, we present a scalable na\u00efve Bayes-based algorithm that is deployed over a cluster of Apache Spark framework for efficient prediction of genes in the genome of eukaryotic organisms. Evaluation results on the human genome chromosome GRCh37 and GRCh38 show that effectiveness of our algorithm for predictive analytics on genomic data with high-performance computing. high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.",

Machine-learning methods allow large amounts of data for development of robust predictive analytics. The authors hypothesized that machine-learning methods can provide prediction for the risk of postinduction hypotension. Methods: Data was extracted from the electronic health record of a single quaternary care center from November 2015 to May 2016 for patients over age 12 that underwent general anesthesia, without procedure exclusions. Multiple supervised machine-learning classification techniques were attempted, with postinduction hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 55 mmHg within 10 min of induction by any measurement) as primary outcome, and preoperative medications, medical comorbidities, induction medications, and intraoperative vital signs as features. Discrimination was assessed using cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The best performing model was tuned and final performance assessed using split-set validation. Results: Out of 13,323 cases, 1,185 (8.9%) experienced postinduction hypotension. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using logistic regression was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.72), support vector machines was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.60), naive Bayes was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.69), k-nearest neighbor was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.65), linear discriminant analysis was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.73), random forest was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.75), neural nets 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.71), and gradient boosting machine 0.76 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.77). Test set area for the gradient boosting machine was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.77). Conclusions: The success of this technique in predicting postinduction hypotension demonstrates feasibility of machine-learning models for predictive analytics in the field of anesthesiology, with performance dependent on model selection and appropriate tuning.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to understand how big data and predictive analytics (BDPA), as an organizational capability, can improve both visibility and coordination in humanitarian supply chains.,The authors conceptualize a research model grounded in contingent resource-based view where the authors propose that BDPA capabilities affect visibility and coordination under the moderating effect of swift trust. Using ordinary least squares regression, the authors test the hypotheses using survey data collected from informants at 205 international non-government organizations.,The results indicate that BDPA has a significant influence on visibility and coordination. Further, the results suggest that swift trust does not have an amplifying effect on the relationships between BDPA and visibility and coordination. However, the mediation test suggests that swift trust acts as a mediating construct. Hence, the authors argue that swift trust is not the condition for improving coordination among the actors in humanitarian supply chains.,The major limitation of the study is that the authors have used cross-sectional survey data to test the research hypotheses. Following Guide and Ketokivi (2015), the authors present arguments on how to address the limitations of cross-sectional data or use of longitudinal data that can address common method bias or endogeneity-related problems.,Managers can use this framework to understand: first, how organizational resources can be used to create BDPA, and second, how BDPA can help build swift trust and be used to improve visibility and coordination in the humanitarian supply chain.,This is the first research that has empirically tested the anecdotal and conceptual evidence. The findings make notable contributions to existing humanitarian supply chain literature and may be useful to managers who are contemplating the use of BDPA to improve disaster-relief-related activities.",

This includes studies using artificial intelligence to develop predictive algorithms that make individualized diagnostic or prognostic risk predictions. We argue that it is paramount to make the algorithm behind any prediction publicly available. This allows independent external validation, assessment of performance heterogeneity across settings and over time, and algorithm refinement or updating. Online calculators and apps may aid uptake if accompanied with sufficient information. For algorithms based on \u201cblack box\u201d machine learning methods, software for algorithm implementation is a must. Hiding algorithms for commercial exploitation is unethical, because there is no possibility to assess whether algorithms work as advertised or to monitor when and how algorithms are updated. Journals and funders should demand maximal transparency for publications on predictive algorithms, and clinical guidelines should only recommend publicly available algorithms.",

            "abstract": "In various web applications like targeted advertising and recommender systems, the available categorical features (e.g., product type) are often of great importance but sparse. As a widely adopted solution, models based on Factorization Machines (FMs) are capable of modelling high-order interactions among features for effective sparse predictive analytics. As the volume of web-scale data grows exponentially over time, sparse predictive analytics inevitably involves dynamic and sequential features. However, existing FM-based models assume no temporal orders in the data, and are unable to capture the sequential dependencies or patterns within the dynamic features, impeding the performance and adaptivity of these methods. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel Sequence-Aware Factorization Machine (SeqFM) for temporal predictive analytics, which models feature interactions by fully investigating the effect of sequential dependencies. As static features (e.g., user gender) and dynamic features (e.g., user interacted items) express different semantics, we innovatively devise a multi-view self-attention scheme that separately models the effect of static features, dynamic features and the mutual interactions between static and dynamic features in three different views. In SeqFM, we further map the learned representations of feature interactions to the desired output with a shared residual network. To showcase the versatility and generalizability of SeqFM, we test SeqFM in three popular application scenarios for FM-based models, namely ranking, classification and regression tasks. Extensive experimental results on six large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of SeqFM.",

However, current knowledge on BDPA regarding how it might link organizational capabilities and organizational performance (OP) remains unclear. Drawing from the resource-based view, the purpose of this paper is to propose a model to examine how information technology (IT) deployment (i.e. strategic IT flexibility, business\u2013BDPA partnership and business\u2013BDPA alignment) and HR capabilities affect OP through BDPA.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nTo test the proposed hypotheses, structural equation modeling is applied on survey data collected from 159 Indian firms.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results show that BDPA diffusion mediates the influence of IT deployment and HR capabilities on OP. In addition, there is a direct effect of IT deployment and HR capabilities on BDPA diffusion, which also has a direct relationship with OP.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThrough this study, authors demonstrate that IT deployment and HR capabilities have an indirect impact on OP through BDPA diffusion.\n",

Early prediction and proper treatments can possibly stop, or slow the progression of this chronic disease to end-stage, where dialysis or kidney transplantation is the only way to save patient's life. In this study, we examine the ability of several machine-learning methods for early prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease. This matter has been studied widely; however, we are supporting our methodology by the use of predictive analytics, in which we examine the relationship in between data parameters as well as with the target class attribute. Predictive analytics enables us to introduce the optimal subset of parameters to feed machine learning to build a set of predictive models. This study starts with 24 parameters in addition to the class attribute, and ends up by 30 % of them as ideal sub set to predict Chronic Kidney Disease. A total of 4 machine learning based classifiers have been evaluated within a supervised learning setting, achieving highest performance outcomes of AUC 0.995, sensitivity 0.9897, and specificity 1. The experimental procedure concludes that advances in machine learning, with assist of predictive analytics, represent a promising setting by which to recognize intelligent solutions, which in turn prove the ability of predication in the kidney disease domain and beyond.",

            "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore the social process of Big Data and predictive analytics (BDPA) use for logistics and supply chain management (LSCM), focusing on interactions among technology, human behavior and organizational context that occur at the technology\u2019s post-adoption phases in retail supply chain (RSC) organizations.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe authors follow a grounded theory approach for theory building based on interviews with senior managers of 15 organizations positioned across multiple echelons in the RSC.\n\n\nFindings\nFindings reveal how user involvement shapes BDPA to fit organizational structures and how changes made to the technology retroactively affect its design and institutional properties. Findings also reveal previously unreported aspects of BDPA use for LSCM. These include the presence of temporal and spatial discontinuities in the technology use across RSC organizations.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThis study unveils that it is impossible to design a BDPA technology ready for immediate use. The emergent process framework shows that institutional and social factors require BDPA use specific to the organization, as the technology comes to reflect the properties of the organization and the wider social environment for which its designers originally intended. BDPA is, thus, not easily transferrable among collaborating RSC organizations and requires managerial attention to the institutional context within which its usage takes place.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe literature describes why organizations will use BDPA but fails to provide adequate insight into how BDPA use occurs. The authors address the \u201chow\u201d and bring a social perspective into a technology-centric area.\n",

We show that these terms are not only becoming popular but are also relevant to supply chain research and education. Data science requires both domain knowledge and a broad set of quantitative skills, but there is a dearth of literature on the topic and many questions. We call for research on skills that are needed by SCM data scientists and discuss how such skills and domain knowledge affect the effectiveness of a SCM data scientist. Such knowledge is crucial to developing future supply chain leaders. We propose definitions of data science and predictive analytics as applied to supply chain management. We examine possible applications of DPB in practice and provide examples of research questions from these applications, as well as examples of research questions employing DPB that stem from management theories. Finally, we propose specific steps interested researchers can take to respond to our call for research on the intersection of supply chain management and DPB.",

However, estimating the benefit of applying any single model to a specific clinical problem remains challenging today. Developing a shared framework for estimating model value is therefore critical to facilitate the effective, safe, and sustainable use of predictive tools into the future. We highlight key concepts within the prediction-action dyad that together are expected to impact model benefit. These include factors relevant to model prediction (including the number needed to screen) as well as those relevant to the subsequent action (number needed to treat). In the simplest terms, a number needed to benefit contextualizes the numbers needed to screen and treat, offering an opportunity to estimate the value of a clinical predictive model in action.",

In addition to the structured data in EHRs, new methods such as natural language processing can derive meaning from unstructured data, permitting the capture of substantial clinical information embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, the growth in the availability of registries and claims data and the linkages between all these data sources have created a big data platform in health care, vast in both size and scope. Concurrently, new computational machine learning approaches promise ever-more-accurate prediction. The marvel of Google and of Watson, the inexorability of Moore\u2019s law (ie, computing power doubles every 2 years for the same cost), suggest a future in which medicine will be transformed into an information science, and each clinical decision may be optimized based on a forecasting of outcomes under alternative treatment options, beyond the knowledge and understanding of the individual physician. Yet despite these innovations and those to come, quantitative risk prediction in medicine has been available for several decades, based on more classical",

Recent technological advancements [including, radio frequency identification (RFID) in combination with big data predictive analytics (BDPA)] have been able to significantly leverage SCP. In this respect, there is an urgent need for acceptance of RFID technology as well as BDPA to be empirically investigated in order to better understand the enhancement of SCP. Therefore, this paper aims at establishing and empirically investigating the relationship between BDPA acceptance, RFID acceptance, and SCP, respectively. The population of this paper comprises the pharmaceutical logistics industry in China. The sample was obtained from employees through the use of a simple random sampling method. Data were collected through an adapted questionnaire. SmartPLS 3.0 software was used for structural equation modeling analysis. Partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS\u2013SEM), the value of path coefficient, was found to be 0.700. This showed a direct positive effect of BDPA acceptance on SCP. Moreover, RFID acceptance was also tested through the \u201cvariance accounted for\u201d method of mediation. Results showed a partial mediation of 57% between BDPA and SCP. Theoretically, this paper fills the knowledge gap by finding relationships between BDPA and SCP via a mediation role of RFID technology. Practically, it would be beneficial for supply chain managers in the pharmaceutical industry to adopt and implement BDPA and RFID technology so as to enhance SCP.",

Accuracy and precision of predictive analytics have significantly increased over the past few years and are evolving at an exponential pace. There have been significant breakthroughs in using Predictive Analytics in healthcare where it is held as the foundation of precision medicine. Yet, although the research in the field is expanding with the profuse volume of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Regardless of the status of its current contribution, the field of predictive analytics is expected to fundamentally change the way we diagnose and treat diseases, as well as the conduct of biomedical science research. In this review, we describe the main tools and techniques in predictive analytics and will analyze the trends in application of these techniques over the recent years. We will also provide examples of its application in medicine and more specifically in stroke and neurovascular research and outline current limitations.",

This article outlines the current state of the field, providing a review of forecasting tools that have been successfully applied by police to the task of crime prediction. We then discuss options for structured design and evaluation of a predictive policing program so that the benefits of proactive intervention efforts are maximized given fixed resource constraints. We highlight examples of predictive policing programs that have been implemented and evaluated by police agencies in the field. Finally, we discuss ethical issues related to predictive analytics in policing and suggest approaches for minimizing potential harm to vulnerable communities while providing an equitable distribution of the benefits of crime prevention across populations within police jurisdiction.",

The Gartner Analytics Ascendancy Model requires the use of four types of data analytics to be considered comprehensive: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive data analytics. This paper presents the outcomes of a research and development project at Bradley University (Peoria, IL, USA) aimed at the setup and benchmarking of eight ML algorithms for predictive learning analytics, specifically, a prediction of student academic performance in a course. The analyzed and tested ML algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, k- nearest neighbor classification, na\u00efve Bayes classification, artificial neural network regression and classification, decision tree classification, random forest classification, and support vector machine classification. Based on the obtained accuracy of the analyzed and tested ML algorithms, we have formulated a set of recommendations for faculty and practitioners in terms of selection, setup and utilization of ML algorithms in predictive analytics in STEM education. We also performed formative and summative surveys of undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems courses to understand their opinion about utilization of ML-based predictive analytics in education; a summary of obtained student feedback is presented in this paper.",

We characterized evidence-based use cases of predictive analytics in oncology into three distinct fields: (1) population health management, (2) radiomics, and (3) pathology. We then highlight promising future use cases of predictive analytics in clinical decision support and genomic risk stratification. We conclude by describing challenges in the future applications of big data in oncology, namely (1) difficulties in acquisition of comprehensive data and endpoints, (2) the lack of prospective validation of predictive tools, and (3) the risk of automating bias in observational datasets. If such challenges can be overcome, computational techniques for clinical risk stratification will in short order improve clinical risk stratification for patients with cancer.",

            "abstract": "A revolution in computational methods and statistics to process and analyse data into insight and knowledge is along with the growth of data. The paradigm of data analytic is changed from explicit to implicit raises the way to extract knowledge from data through a prospective approach to determine the value of new observations based on the structure of the relationship between input and output (predictive analytics). In the cycle of predictive analytics, data preparation is a very important stage. The main challenge faced is that raw data cannot be directly used for analysis and related to the quality of the data. Completeness is arising related to data quality. Missing data is one that often causes data to become incomplete. As a result, predictive analytics generated from these data becomes inaccurate. In this paper, the issues related to the missing data in predictive analytics will be discussed through a literature study from related research. Also, the challenges and direction that might occur in the predictive analytics domain with problems related to missing data will be presented.",

Digital data in large numbers leaves traces of what customers see, what they read, their involvement and behavior, judgment, about their interests and preferences so as to provide a large amount of data that can be mined for learning experiences. The big data value lies in the results of analysis and predictions or actions taken from the results of the analysis and prediction. Predictive analytics is data utilization, statistical algorithms, and machine-learning techniques to identify possible trends, events, and behaviors in the future based on historical data. This paper tries to propose predictive analytics to predict customer behavior by using behavior informatics and analytics approach so that deeper insight into customer behavior can be obtained to support predictive analysis in order to improve business decision making.",

However, this requires a scalable system for constant streaming processing, also provided with the ability of decision-making and action taking based on the performed predictions. This paper aims at proposing a scalable architecture to provide real-time context-aware actions based on predictive streaming processing of data as an evolution of a previously provided event-driven service-oriented architecture which already permitted the context-aware detection and notification of relevant data. For this purpose, we have defined and implemented a microservice-based architecture which provides real-time context-aware actions based on predictive streaming processing of data. As a result, our architecture has been enhanced twofold: on the one hand, the architecture has been supplied with reliable predictions through the use of predictive analytics and complex event processing techniques, which permit the notification of relevant context-aware information ahead of time. On the other, it has been refactored towards a microservice architecture pattern, highly improving its maintenance and evolution. The architecture performance has been evaluated with an air quality case study.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVEPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) following decompression surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) demonstrate considerable heterogeneity. Individualized prediction tools can provide valuable insights for shared decision-making. The authors aim to evaluate the feasibility of predicting short- and long-term PROMs, reoperations, and perioperative parameters by machine learning (ML) methods.METHODSData were derived from a prospective registry. All patients had undergone single- or multilevel mini-open facet-sparing decompression for LSS. The prediction models were trained using various ML-based algorithms to predict the endpoints of interest. Models were selected by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The endpoints were dichotomized by minimum clinically important difference (MCID) and included 6-week and 12-month numeric rating scales for back pain (NRS-BP) and leg pain (NRS-LP) severity and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), as well as prolonged surgery (> 45 minutes), extended length of hospital stay (> 28 hours), and reoperations.RESULTSA total of 635 patients were included. The average age was 62 \u00b1 10 years, and 333 patients (52%) were male. At 6 weeks, MCID was seen in 63%, 76%, and 61% of patients for ODI, NRS-LP, and NRS-BP, respectively. At internal validation, the models predicted MCID in these variables with accuracies of 69%, 76%, and 85%, and with AUCs of 0.75, 0.79, and 0.92. At 12 months, 66%, 63%, and 51% of patients reported MCID; the observed accuracies were 62%, 74%, and 66%, with AUCs of 0.68, 0.72, and 0.79. Reoperations occurred in 60 patients (9.5%), of which 27 (4.3%) occurred at the index level. Overall and index-level reoperations were predicted with 69% and 63% accuracy, respectively, and with AUCs of 0.66 and 0.61. In 15%, a length of surgery greater than 45 minutes was observed and predicted with 78% accuracy and AUC of 0.54. Only 15% of patients were admitted to the hospital for longer than 28 hours. The developed ML-based model enabled prediction of extended hospital stay with an accuracy of 77% and AUC of 0.58.CONCLUSIONSPreoperative prediction of a range of clinically relevant endpoints in decompression surgery for LSS using ML is feasible, and may enable enhanced informed patient consent and personalized shared decision-making. Access to individualized preoperative predictive analytics for outcome and treatment risks may represent a further step in the evolution of surgical care for patients with LSS.",

This term is drawn from statistics, machine learning, database techniques and optimization techniques. It has roots in classical statistics. It predicts the future by analyzing current and historical data. The future events and behavior of variables can be predicted using the models of predictive analytics. A score is given by mostly predictive analytics models. A higher score indicates the higher likelihood of occurrence of an event and a lower score indicates the lower likelihood of occurrence of the event. Historical and transactional data patterns are exploited by these models to find out the solution for many business and science problems. These models are helpful in identifying the risk and opportunities for every individual customer, employee or manager of an organization. With the increase in attention towards decision support solutions, the predictive analytics models have dominated in this field. In this paper, we will present a review of process, techniques and applications of predictive analytics.",

Healthcare predictive analytics using electronic health records offers a promising direction to address the challenging tasks of risk profiling. Patients with chronic diseases often face risks of not just one, but an array of adverse health events. However, existing risk models typically focus on one specific event and do not predict multiple outcomes. To attain enhanced risk profiling, we adopt the design science paradigm and propose a principled approach called Bayesian multitask learning (BMTL). Considering the model development for an event as a single task, our BMTL approach is to coordinate a set of baseline models\u2014one for each event\u2014and communicate training information across the models. The BMTL approach allows healthcare providers to achieve multifaceted risk profiling and model an arbitrary number of events simultaneously. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BMTL approach attains an improved predictive performance when compared with the alternatives that model multiple events separately. We also find that, in most cases, the BMTL approach significantly outperforms existing multitask learning techniques. More importantly, our analysis shows that the BMTL approach can create significant potential impacts on clinical practice in reducing the failures and delays in preventive interventions. We discuss several implications of this study for health IT, big data and predictive analytics, and design science research.",

Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection Attack (SQLIA) remains an intruder's exploit of choice on vulnerable web applications to pilfer confidential data from the database with potentially damaging consequences. The existing solutions of mostly signature approaches were all before the recent challenges of big data mining and at such lacks the functionality and ability to cope with new signatures concealed in web requests. An alternative Machine Learning (ML) predictive analytics provides a functional and scalable mining to big data in detection and prevention of SQLIA. Unfortunately, lack of availability of readymade robust corpus or data set with patterns and historical data items to train a classifier are issues well known in SQLIA research. In this paper, we explore the generation of data set containing extraction from known attack patterns including SQL tokens and symbols present at injection points. Also, as a test case, we build a web application that expects dictionary word list as vector variables to demonstrate massive quantities of learning data. The data set is pre-processed, labelled and feature hashing for supervised learning. The trained classifier to be deployed as a web service that is consumed in a custom dot NET application implementing a web proxy Application Programming Interface (API) to intercept and accurately predict SQLIA in web requests thereby preventing malicious web requests from reaching the protected back-end database. This paper demonstrates a full proof of concept implementation of an ML predictive analytics and deployment of resultant web service that accurately predicts and prevents SQLIA with empirical evaluations presented in Confusion Matrix (CM) and Receiver Operating Curve (ROC).",

The goal of this paper is to highlight the advantages of tree-based machine learning algorithms over classic (logistic) regression methods for data-informed decision making in higher education problems, and stress the success of random forest in circumstances where the regression assumptions are often violated in big data applications. Random forest is a model averaging procedure where each tree is constructed based on a bootstrap sample of the data set. In particular, we emphasize the ease of application, low computational cost, high predictive accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability of random forest machinery. Our overall recommendation is that institutional researchers look beyond classical regression and single decision tree analytics tools, and consider random forest as the predominant method for prediction tasks. The proposed points of view are detailed and illustrated through a simulation experiment and analyses of data from real institutional research projects.",

In this article, we explore different approaches to clinical judgement articulated in the literature, focusing in particular on data-driven, mathematical approaches which we contrast with narrative, virtue-based approaches to clinical reasoning. We discuss the tension between these different clinical epistemologies and further explore the implications of big data and machine learning for a philosophy of clinical judgement. We argue for a pluralistic, integrative approach, and demonstrate how narrative, virtue-based clinical reasoning will remain indispensable in an era of big data and predictive analytics.",

            "abstract": "Background Improving the accuracy and precision of predictive analytics for temporal trends in crime necessitates a good understanding of the how exogenous variables, such as weather and holidays, impact crime. Methods We examine 5.7 million reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago between 2001 to 2014. Using linear regression methods, we examine the temporal relationship of the crime incidents to weather, holidays, school vacations, day-of-week, and paydays. We correct the data for dominant sources of auto-correlation, and we then employ bootstrap methods for model selection. Importantly for the aspect of predictive analytics, we validate the predictive capabilities of our model on an independent data set; model validation has been almost universally overlooked in the literature on this subject. Results We find significant dependence of crime on time of year, holidays, and weekdays. We find that dependence of aggressive crime on temperature depends on the hour of the day, and whether it takes place outside or inside. In addition, unusually hot/cold days are associated with unusual fluctuations upwards/downwards in crimes of aggression, respectively, regardless of the time of year. Conclusions Including holidays, festivals, and school holiday periods in crime predictive analytics software can improve the accuracy and precision of temporal predictions. We also find that including forecasts for temperature may significantly improve short term crime forecasts for the temporal trends in many types of crime, particularly aggressive crime.",

            "abstract": "Background Despite the availability of free routine immunizations in low- and middle-income countries, many children are not completely vaccinated, vaccinated late for age, or drop out from the course of the immunization schedule. Without the technology to model and visualize risk of large datasets, vaccinators and policy makers are unable to identify target groups and individuals at high risk of dropping out; thus default rates remain high, preventing universal immunization coverage. Predictive analytics algorithm leverages artificial intelligence and uses statistical modeling, machine learning, and multidimensional data mining to accurately identify children who are most likely to delay or miss their follow-up immunization visits. Objective This study aimed to conduct feasibility testing and validation of a predictive analytics algorithm to identify the children who are likely to default on subsequent immunization visits for any vaccine included in the routine immunization schedule. Methods The algorithm was developed using 47,554 longitudinal immunization records, which were classified into the training and validation cohorts. Four machine learning models (random forest; recursive partitioning; support vector machines, SVMs; and C-forest) were used to generate the algorithm that predicts the likelihood of each child defaulting from the follow-up immunization visit. The following variables were used in the models as predictors of defaulting: gender of the child, language spoken at the child\u2019s house, place of residence of the child (town or city), enrollment vaccine, timeliness of vaccination, enrolling staff (vaccinator or others), date of birth (accurate or estimated), and age group of the child. The models were encapsulated in the predictive engine, which identified the most appropriate method to use in a given case. Each of the models was assessed in terms of accuracy, precision (positive predictive value), sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value, and area under the curve (AUC). Results Out of 11,889 cases in the validation dataset, the random forest model correctly predicted 8994 cases, yielding 94.9% sensitivity and 54.9% specificity. The C-forest model, SVMs, and recursive partitioning models improved prediction by achieving 352, 376, and 389 correctly predicted cases, respectively, above the predictions made by the random forest model. All models had a C-statistic of 0.750 or above, whereas the highest statistic (AUC 0.791, 95% CI 0.784-0.798) was observed in the recursive partitioning algorithm. Conclusions This feasibility study demonstrates that predictive analytics can accurately identify children who are at a higher risk for defaulting on follow-up immunization visits. Correct identification of potential defaulters opens a window for evidence-based targeted interventions in resource limited settings to achieve optimal immunization coverage and timeliness.",

The likelihood of TdP is higher in patients with risk factors that include female sex, older age, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, concomitant administration of two or more QTc interval\u2010prolonging medications, among others. Assessment and quantification of risk factors may facilitate prediction of patients at highest risk for developing QTc interval prolongation and TdP. Investigators have utilized the field of predictive analytics, which generates predictions using techniques including data mining, modeling, machine learning, and others, to develop methods of risk quantification and prediction of QTc interval prolongation. Predictive analytics have also been incorporated into clinical decision support (CDS) tools to alert clinicians regarding patients at increased risk of developing QTc interval prolongation. The objectives of this article are to assess the effectiveness of predictive analytics for identification of patients at risk of drug\u2010induced QTc interval prolongation and to discuss the efficacy of incorporation of predictive analytics into CDS tools in clinical practice. A systematic review of English\u2010language articles (human subjects only) was performed, yielding 57 articles, with an additional 4 articles identified from other sources; a total of 10 articles were included in this review. Risk scores for QTc interval prolongation have been developed in various patient populations including those in cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) and in broader populations of hospitalized or health system patients. One group developed a risk score that includes information regarding genetic polymorphisms; this score significantly predicted TdP. Development of QTc interval prolongation risk prediction models and incorporation of these models into CDS tools reduce the risk of QTc interval prolongation in cardiac ICUs and identify health system patients at increased risk for mortality. The impact of these QTc interval prolongation predictive analytics on overall patient safety outcomes, such as TdP and sudden cardiac death relative to the cost of development and implementation, requires further study.",

Since buildings of the same type show similar power consumption patterns, it should be considered for accurate electric load forecast. In particular, university buildings show various electric loads depending on time and other external factors. In this paper, we propose a short-term load forecast model for educational buildings using 2-stage predictive analytics for the effective operation of their power system. To do that, we collect the electric load data of five years from a university campus. Next, we consider the electric load pattern by using the moving average method according to the day of the week. Next, we predict the daily electric load using the random forest method and finally evaluate its performance using the time series cross-validation. The experimental results show that our forecasting model outperforms other competing methods in terms of prediction accuracy.",

The growing exploitation of novel inventions and social media leads to the generation of huge quantities of data called Big data which can bring remarkable information if analysed properly. Organizations may undergo for analysis of big data to having better decisions, thus big data analytics is being paid attention in recent times. For finding the concealed values from big data, society requires new schemes or strategies. Predictive analytics comprises of several statistical and analytical techniques for developing novel strategies for the future possibilities of prediction. Therefore, Predictive analytics becomes vital when an essential quantity of highly sensitive data has to be handled. Based on the perceived events, future probabilities and measures are predicted. With the aid of available data mining techniques, predictive analytics predicts the events in future and can make recommendations called prescriptive analytics. This review paper gives clear idea to apply data mining techniques and predictive analytics on different medical dataset to predict various diseases with accuracy levels, pros and cons, that concludes about the issues of those algorithms and futuristic approaches on big data.",

            "abstract": "Management in America has become significantly more data-intensive, yet the economic, organizational, and strategic implications of this shift are poorly understood. Working with the U.S. Census Bureau, we developed measures of how manufacturing firms have used data to guide decision making over the past decade. In our large and representative sample, data-driven decision making (DDD) is strongly associated with increased productivity. The benefits attributable to DDD are distinct from those associated with other structured management practices or investment in IT, though the latter is an important complement. Moreover, instrumental variables estimates and timing falsification tests suggest a causal relationship. Implications for firm strategy, however, are nuanced; we find evidence of significant advantages for early adopters of DDD, particularly in the 2005-2010 window, when adoption rates in the sector were lower. Yet we also observe timing-dependent complementarities. The frontier of data-centric practices shifts during our study period, with increased use of predictive analytics becoming the key driver of productivity gains from 2010 to 2015.",

            "abstract": "\nPurpose\nResearch questions that this paper attempts to answer are \u2013 do the features in general email communication have any significance to a teaching faculty member leaving the business school? Do the sentiments expressed in email communication have any significance to a teaching faculty member leaving the business school? Do the stages mentioned in the transtheoretical model have any relevance to the email behaviour of an individual when he or she goes through the decision process leading to the decision to quit? The purpose of this paper is to study email patterns and use predictive analytics to correlate with the real-world situation of leaving the business school.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe email repository (2010\u20132017) of 126 teaching faculty members who were associated with a business school as full-time faculty members is the data set that was used for the research. Of the 126 teaching faculty members, 42 had left the business school during this time frame. Correlation analysis, word count analysis and sentiment analysis were executed using \u201cR\u201d programming, and sentiment \u201cR\u201d package was used to understand the sentiment and its association in leaving the business school. From the email repository, a rich feature set of data was extracted for correlation analysis to discover the features which had strong correlation with the faculty member leaving the business school. The research also used data-logging tools to extract aggregated statistics for word frequency counts and sentiment features.\n\n\nFindings\nThose faculty members who decide to leave are involved more in external communication and less in internal communications. Also, those who decide to leave initiate fewer email conversations and opt to forward emails to colleagues. Correlation analysis shows that negative sentiment goes down, as faculty members leave the organisation and this is in contrary to the existing review of literature. The research also shows that the triggering point or the intention to leave is positively correlated to the downward swing of the emotional valence (positive sentiment). A number of email features have shown change in patterns which are correlated to a faculty member quitting the business school.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nFaculty members of only one business school have been considered and this is primary due to cost, privacy and complexities involved in procuring and handling the data. Also, the reasons for exhibiting the sentiments and their root cause have not been studied. Also the designation, roles and responsibilities of faculty members have not been taken into consideration.\n\n\nPractical implications\nBusiness schools all over India always have a challenge to recruit good faculty members who can take up research activities, teach and also shoulder administrative responsibilities. Retaining faculty members and keeping attrition levels low will help business schools to maintain the standards of excellence that they aspire. This research is immensely useful for business school, which can use email analytics in predicting the intention of the faculty members leaving their business school.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nAlthough past studies have studied attrition, this study uses predictive analytics and maps it to the intention to quit. This study helps business schools to predict the chance of faculty members leaving the business school which is of immense value, as appropriate measures can be taken to retain and restrict attrition.\n",

This article surveys and maps the landscape of digital policy instrumentation in education and provides two detailed case studies of new digital data systems. The Learning Curve is a massive online data bank, produced by Pearson Education, which deploys highly sophisticated digital interactive data visualizations to construct knowledge about education systems. The second case considers \u2018learning analytics\u2019 platforms that enable the tracking and predicting of students\u2019 performances through their digital data traces. These digital policy instruments are evidence of how digital database instruments and infrastructures are now at the centre of efforts to know, govern and manage education both nationally and globally. The governing of education, augmented by techniques of digital education governance, is being distributed and displaced to new digitized \u2018centres of calculation\u2019, such as Pearson and Knewton, with the technical expertise to calculate and visualize the data, plus the predictive analytics capacities to anticipate and pre-empt educational futures. As part of a data-driven style of governing, these emerging digital policy instruments prefigure the emergence of \u2018real-time\u2019 and \u2018future-tense\u2019 techniques of digital education governance.",

Despite the hype over \"big data,\" and the success of predictive analytics, only a few organizations have incorporated such finegrained data in a non-aggregated manner into their predictive analytics. This paper examines the use of massive, fine-grained data on consumer behavior\u2014specifically payments to a very large set of particular merchants\u2014to improve predictive models for targeted marketing. The paper details how using this different sort of data can substantially improve predictive performance, even in an application for which predictive analytics has been applied for years. One of the most striking results has important implications for managers considering the value of big data. Using a real-life data set of 21 million transactions by 1.2 million customers, as well as 289 other variables describing these customers, the results show that there is no appreciable improvement from moving to big data when using traditional structured data. However, in contrast, when using fine-grained behavior data, there continues to be substantial value to increasing the data size across the entire range of the analyses. This suggests that larger firms may have substantially more valuable data assets than smaller firms, when using their transaction data for targeted marketing.",

To date, most applications of predictive analytics focus on single turbine systems. In contrast, this paper provides a seamless integration of the predictive analytics with decision making for a fleet of wind turbines. Operational decisions identify the dispatch profiles. Maintenance decisions consider the tradeoff between sensor-driven optimal maintenance schedule, and the significant cost reductions arising from grouping the wind turbine maintenances together\u2014a concept called opportunistic maintenance. We focus on two types of wind turbines. For the operational wind turbines, we find an optimal fleet-level condition-based maintenance schedule driven by the sensor data. For the failed wind turbines, we identify the optimal time to conduct corrective maintenance to start producing electricity. The economic and stochastic dependence between operations and maintenance decisions are also considered. Experiments conducted on i) a 100-turbine wind farm case, and ii) a 200-turbine multiple wind farms case demonstrate the advantages of our proposal over traditional policies.",

Based on interview data from college staff members at nine public twoand four-year institutions at different stages of implementation of predictive analytics software, we provide a broad look at the positive and negative reactions to this potentially influential educational innovation. Our findings indicate that, overall, advisors and other end users of predictive analytics tools were more critical of them than either administrators or college personnel who helped develop their use as part of a campus-wide advising reform. Our findings also show that, compared with personnel at colleges in the early stages of planning and implementing predictive analytics tools, personnel at colleges that had been actively using the tools for some time reported more concerns. While the use of predictive analytics holds substantial promise in helping to target student services, results of the study suggest that a greater examination of concerns about validity, interpretation, and ethics is warranted.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Statistical predictive models play an important role in learning analytics. In this work, we seek to harness the power of predictive modeling methodology for the development of an analytics framework in STEM student success efficacy studies. We develop novel predictive analytics tools to provide stakeholders automated and timely information to assess student performance toward a student success outcome, and to inform pedagogical decisions or intervention strategies. In particular, we take advantage of the random forest machine learning algorithm, proposing a number of innovations to identify key input thresholds, quantify the impact of inputs on student success, evaluate student success at benchmarks in a program of study, and obtain a student success score. The proposed machinery can also tailor information for advisers to identify the risk levels of individual students in efforts to enhance STEM persistence and STEM graduation success. We additionally present our predictive analytics pipeline, motivated by and illustrated in a particular STEM student success study at San Diego State University. We highlight the process of designing, implementing, validating, and deploying analytical tools or dashboards, and emphasize the advantage of leveraging the utilities of both statistical analyses and business intelligence tools in order to maximize functionality and computational capacity.",
