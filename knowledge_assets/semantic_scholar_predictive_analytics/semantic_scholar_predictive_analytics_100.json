            "abstract": "Predictive process monitoring has recently become one of the main enablers of data-driven insights in process mining. As an application of predictive analytics, process prediction is mainly concerned with predicting the evolution of running traces based on models extracted from historical event logs. This paper presents a process mining approach, which uses convolutional neural networks to equip the execution scenario of a business process with a means to predict the next activity in a running trace. The basic idea is to convert the temporal data enclosed in the historical event log of a business process into spatial data so as to treat them as images. To this purpose, every trace of the event log is first transformed into the set of its prefix traces (i.e. sequences of events that represent the prefix of a trace). These prefix traces are mapped into 2D image-like data structures. Created spatial data are finally used to train a Convolutional Neural Network, in order to learn a deep learning model capable to predict the next activity (i.e. the activity associated to the event occurring after the last event in the considered prefix trace). This predictive deep model can be employed as a powerful service to support participants in performing business processes since it guarantees a higher utilization by acting proactively in anticipation. Preliminary tests with two benchmark logs are carried out to investigate the viability of the proposed approach.",

As such, we effectively provide an assessment of the current state of the field via a large-scale survey, and offer insight into its future potential via the discussion of how a research university is training next-generation data scientists. Specifically, we report on the current use of predictive analytics in SCM and the underlying motivations, as well as perceived benefits and barriers. In addition, we highlight skills desired for successful data scientists, and provide illustrations of how predictive analytics can be implemented in the curriculum. Relying on one of the largest data sets of predictive analytics users in SCM collected to date and our experiences with one of the first master's degree programs in predictive analytics, it is our intent to provide a timely assessment of the field, illustrate its future potential, and motivate additional research and pedagogical advancements in this domain.",

Although CEP provides a scalable and distributed solution for analyzing complex data streams on the fly, it is designed for reactive applications as CEP acts on near real-time data and does not exploit historical data. In this regard, we propose a proactive architecture which exploits historical data using machine learning for prediction in conjunction with CEP. We propose an adaptive prediction algorithm called adaptive moving window regression for dynamic IoT data and evaluated it using a real-world use case with an accuracy of over 96%. It can perform accurate predictions in near real-time due to reduced complexity and can work along CEP in our architecture. We implemented our proposed architecture using open source components which are optimized for big data applications and validated it on a use-case from intelligent transportation systems. Our proposed architecture is reliable and can be used across different fields in order to predict complex events.",

OUA is a predictive system that uses machine learning methods for the early identification of students at risk of not submitting (or failing) their next assignment. Teachers have access, via interactive dashboards, to weekly predictions of risk of failing for each of their students. In this study, we examined how the degree of OUA usage by 559 teachers, of which 189 were given access to OUA, related to student learning outcomes of more than 14 000 students in 15 undergraduate courses. Teachers who made \u201caverage\u201d use of OUA, that is accessed OUA throughout the life cycle of a course presentation, and in particular between 10% and 40% of the weeks a course was running, and intervened with students flagged as at risk were found to benefit their students the most; after controlling for differences in academic performance, these students were found to have significantly better performance than their peers in the previous year's course presentation during which the same teachers made no use of predictive learning analytics. Predictive learning analytics is an innovative student's support approach in online pedagogy that, as shown in this study, can empower online teachers in effectively monitoring and intervening with their students, over and above other approaches, and result in improved learning outcomes.",

The model involves deep learning in the form of a deep neural network which helps to apply predictive analytics on the diabetes data set to obtain optimal results. The existing predictive models is used to predict the severity and the risk factor of the diabetics based on the data which is processed. In our case Firstly, a feature selection algorithm is run for the selection process. Secondly, the deep learning model has a deep neural network which employs a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) as a basic unit to analyse the data by assigning weights to the each branch of the neural network. This deep neural network, coded on python, will help to obtain numeric results on the severity and the risk factor of the diabetics in the data set. At the end, a comparative study is done between the implementation of this model on type 1 diabetes mellitus, Pima Indians diabetes and the Rough set theory model. The results add value to additional reports because the number of studies done on diabetes using a deep learning model is few to none. This will help to predict diabetes with much more precision as shown by the results obtained. characteristic",

            "abstract": "Fundamental to many predictive analytics tasks is the ability to estimate the cardinality (number of data items) of multi-dimensional data subspaces, defined by query selections over datasets. This is crucial for data analysts dealing with, e.g., interactive data subspace explorations, data subspace visualizations, and in query processing optimization. However, in many modern data systems, predictive analytics may be (i) too costly money-wise, e.g., in clouds, (ii) unreliable, e.g., in modern Big Data query engines, where accurate statistics are difficult to obtain/maintain, or (iii) infeasible, e.g., for privacy issues. We contribute a novel, query-driven, function estimation model of analyst-defined data subspace cardinality. The proposed estimation model is highly accurate in terms of prediction and accommodating the well-known selection queries: multi-dimensional range and distance-nearest neighbors (radius) queries. Our function estimation model: (i) quantizes the vectorial query space, by learning the analysts\u2019 access patterns over a data space, (ii) associates query vectors with their corresponding cardinalities of the analyst-defined data subspaces, (iii) abstracts and employs query vectorial similarity to predict the cardinality of an unseen/unexplored data subspace, and (iv) identifies and adapts to possible changes of the query subspaces based on the theory of optimal stopping. The proposed model is decentralized, facilitating the scaling-out of such predictive analytics queries. The research significance of the model lies in that (i) it is an attractive solution when data-driven statistical techniques are undesirable or infeasible, (ii) it offers a scale-out, decentralized training solution, (iii) it is applicable to different selection query types, and (iv) it offers a performance that is superior to that of data-driven approaches.",

In this regard, this paper proposes a predictive analytics solution for detecting the failure of a sensor that measures surface temperature from an urban sewer. The proposed approach incorporates a forecasting technique based on the past time series of sparse data using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Based on the 95% forecast interval and continuity of faulty data, a criterion was set to detect anomalies and to issue a warning for sensor failure. The forecasted and faulty data were assumed Gaussian distributed. By using the probability density of the distribution, the mean and variance were computed for faulty data to examine the abnormality in the variance value of each day to detect the sensor failure. The experimental results on the sewer temperature data are appealing.",

But what exactly is trust? Even though trust is considered a critical requirement for the successful deployment of precision medicine initiatives, nonetheless, there is a need for further conceptualization with regard to what qualifies as trust, and what factors might establish and sustain trust in precision medicine, predictive analytics, and large-scale biology. These new fields of 21st century medicine and health often deal with the \u201cfutures\u201d and hence, trust gains a temporal and ever-present quality for both the present and the futures anticipated by new technologies and predictive analytics. We address these conceptual gaps that have important practical implications in the way we govern risk and unknowns associated with emerging technologies in biology, medicine, and health broadly. We provide an in-depth conceptual analysis and an operative definition of trust dynamics in precision medicine. In addition, we identify three main types of \u201ctrust facilitators\u201d: (1) technical, (2) ethical, and (3) institutional. This three-dimensional framework on trust is necessary to building and maintaining trust in 21st century knowledge-based innovations that governments and publics invest for progressive societal change, development, and sustainable prosperity. Importantly, we analyze, identify, and deliberate on the dimensions of precision medicine and large-scale biology that have carved out trust as a pertinent tool to its success. Moving forward, we propose a \u201cpoints to consider\u201d on how best to enhance trust in precision medicine and predictive analytics.",

Predictive analytics using big data have been applied successfully in several areas of medication management, such as in the identification of complex patients or those at highest risk for medication noncompliance or adverse effects. Because predictive analytics can be used in predicting different outcomes, they can provide pharmacists with a better understanding of the risks for specific medication-related problems that each patient faces. This information will enable pharmacists to deliver interventions tailored to patients' needs. In order to take full advantage of these benefits, however, clinicians will have to understand the basics of big data and predictive analytics.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPredictive analytics that leverage big data will become an indispensable tool for clinicians in mapping interventions and improving patient outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Mitigating preventable readmissions, where patients are readmitted for the same primary diagnosis within 30 days, poses a significant challenge to the delivery of high-quality healthcare. Toward this end, we develop a novel, predictive analytics model, termed as the beta geometric Erlang-2 BG/EG hurdle model, which predicts the propensity, frequency, and timing of readmissions of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure CHF. This unified model enables us to answer three key questions related to the use of predictive analytics methods for patient readmissions: whether a readmission will occur, how often readmissions will occur, and when a readmission will occur. We test our model using a unique data set that tracks patient demographic, clinical, and administrative data across 67 hospitals in North Texas over a four-year period. We show that our model provides superior predictive performance compared to extant models such as the logit, BG/NBD hurdle, and EG hurdle models. Our model also allows us to study the association between hospital usage of health information technologies IT and readmission risk. We find that health IT usage, patient demographics, visit characteristics, payer type, and hospital characteristics, are significantly associated with patient readmission risk. We also observe that implementation of cardiology information systems is associated with a reduction in the propensity and frequency of future readmissions, whereas administrative IT systems are correlated with a lower frequency of future readmissions. Our results indicate that patient profiles derived from our model can serve as building blocks for a predictive analytics system to identify CHF patients with high readmission risk.",

Filtering of these messages is merely another line of defence and does not prevent spam messages from circulating in email systems. This problem causes users to distrust email systems, suspect even legitimate emails and leads to substantial investment in technologies to counter the spam problem. Spammers threaten users by abusing the lack of accountability and verification features of communicating entities. To contribute to the fight against spamming, a cloud-based system that analyses the email server logs and uses predictive analytics with machine learning to build trust identities that model the email messaging behavior of spamming and legitimate servers has been designed. The system constructs trust models for servers, updating them regularly to tune the models. This study proposed that this approach will not only minimize the circulation of spam in email messaging systems, but will also be a novel step in the direction of trust identities and accountability in email infrastructure.",

There have been multiple theories on how to model learning transparency but none of them aims to understand the internal and often complicated modeling processes. In this paper we adopt a contemporary philosophical concept called \"constructivism\", which is a theory regarding how human learns. We hypothesize that a critical aspect of transparent machine learning is to \"reveal\" model construction with two key process: (1) the assimilation process where we enhance our existing learning models and (2) the accommodation process where we create new learning models. With this intuition we propose a new learning paradigm, constructivism learning, using a Bayesian nonparametric model to dynamically handle the creation of new learning tasks. Our empirical study on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that the new learning algorithm is capable of delivering higher quality models (as compared to base lines and state-of-the-art) and at the same time increasing the transparency of the learning process.",

Maintenance policy is set to provide the guidance for selecting the most cost-effective maintenance approach and system to achieve operational safety. For example, predictive maintenance is most recommended for crucial components whose failure will cause severe function loss and safety risk. Recent utilization of big data and related techniques in predictive maintenance greatly improves the transparency for system health condition and boosts the speed and accuracy in the maintenance decision making. In this chapter, a Maintenance Policies Management framework under Big Data Platform is designed and the process of maintenance decision support system is simulated for a sensor-monitored semiconductor manufacturing plant. Artificial Intelligence is applied to classify the likely failure patterns and estimate the machine condition for the faulty component.",

We propose a quality-aware, time-optimized edge analytics model that supports communication efficient predictive modeling within the edge network. Our idea rests on the capability of edge nodes to intelligently decide when and which data to deliver and process in light of minimizing the communication overhead and maximizing the quality of analytics results.

            "abstract": "At the heart of Air Traffic Management (ATM) lies the Decision Support Systems (DST) that rely upon accurate trajectory prediction to determine how the airspace will look like in the future to make better decisions and advisories. Dealing with airspace that is prone to congestion due to environmental factors still remains the challenge especially when a deterministic approach is used in the trajectory prediction process. In this paper, we describe a novel stochastic trajectory prediction approach for ATM that can be used for more efficient and realistic flight planning and to assist airspace flow management, potentially resulting in higher safety, capacity, and efficiency commensurate with fuel savings thereby reducing emissions for a better environment. Our approach considers airspace as a 3D grid network, where each grid point is a location of a weather observation. We hypothetically build cubes around these grid points, so the entire airspace can be considered as a set of cubes. Each cube is defined by its centroid, the original grid point, and associated weather parameters that remain homogeneous within the cube during a period of time. Then, we align raw trajectories to a set of cube centroids which are basically fixed 3D positions independent of trajectory data. This creates a new form of trajectories which are 4D joint cubes, where each cube is a segment that is associated with not only spatio-temporal attributes but also with weather parameters. Next, we exploit machine learning techniques to train inference models from historical data and apply a stochastic model, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to predict trajectories taking environmental uncertainties into account. During the process, we apply time series clustering to generate input observations from an excessive set of weather parameters to feed into the Viterbi algorithm. Our experiments use a real trajectory dataset with pertaining weather observations and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to the trajectory prediction process for ATM.",

This method aims to improve the current Predictive Analytics solution of Quintiq, which had only options for manual feature selection and no options for feature generation. We have discovered that the proposed method does not decrease performance. In most cases, however, it does also not improve the performance. For the data sets where the performance increased, the improvement is significant. Automatic feature generation and selection in predictive analytics solutions iii",

The mobile navigation apps (often called \"Maps\"), use a variety of available data sources to calculate and predict the travel time for different modes. This paper evaluates the pedestrian mode of Maps apps in three major smartphone operating systems (Android, iOS and Windows Phone). We will demonstrate that the Maps apps on iOS, Android and Windows Phone in pedestrian mode, predict travel time without learning from the individual's movement profile. Then, we will exemplify that those apps suffer from a specific data quality issue (the absence of information about location and type of pedestrian crossings). Finally, we will illustrate learning from movement profile of individuals using predictive analytics models to improve the accuracy of travel time estimation for each user (personalization).",

The exponential growth of data is fuelled by the exponential growth of various internet and digital devices. Advancement in technology has made it economically feasible to store and analyse huge amounts of data. Big data is a juxtaposition of structured, semi-structured and unstructured real time data originating from a variety of sources. Predictive analytics provides the methodology in tapping intelligence from large data sets. Many visionary companies such as Google, Amazon, etc. have realised the potential of big data and analytics in gaining competitive advantage. These techniques provide several opportunities like discovering patterns or better optimisation algorithms. Managing and analysing big data also constitutes a few challenges - namely size, quality, reliability and completeness of data. This paper provides an extensive review of literature on big data and predictive analytics. It gives the reader details of the fundamental concepts in this emerging field. Finally, we conclude with the findings of our study and have outlined future research directions in this field.",

However, this opportunity raises policy, ethical, and legal challenges. In this article we analyze the major challenges to implementing predictive analytics in health care settings and make broad recommendations for overcoming challenges raised in the four phases of the life cycle of a predictive analytics model: acquiring data to build the model, building and validating it, testing it in real-world settings, and disseminating and using it more broadly. For instance, we recommend that model developers implement governance structures that include patients and other stakeholders starting in the earliest phases of development. In addition, developers should be allowed to use already collected patient data without explicit consent, provided that they comply with federal regulations regarding research on human subjects and the privacy of health information.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Healthcare has been transformed by the introduction of the electronicmedical record. The era of big data has provided an endless source of valuable data for exploration. Knowledge is doubling every 12 months in the current electronic world, and in the future, that will be as dynamic as every 12 hours. The human brain cannot synthesize all available data that will be required to predict a patient\u2019s medical future and potentially change the treatment cascade for the patient based on the integration of that data. The future of big data will require a paradigm shift because of its complexity and scale. The enormous amount of streaming data will demand new techniques, algorithms, and analytics so that knowledge gainedwill bemeaningful to the clinician. Predictive analytics is the use of electronic algorithms that predict the probability of future events. Predictive analytics allows for the use of big data to improve the health of patients and potentially lowering the cost of healthcare. Developing and implementing predictive analytics, however, requires a team of experts who are also aware of the challenges relating to policy and ethical and legal aspects. Before the electronic medical record, an evaluation of a patient\u2019s risk of a preventable serious adverse event would have taken minutes to hours and would have had limited accuracy and discrimination. With the current technology available including early warning systems, a patient\u2019s risk score can be calculated continuously andwith lead times of as little as 12 hours. The opportunity to predict adverse serious events using big data to develop algorithmsbased on real-time data andpastmedical history raises ethical and legal challenges for organizations developing their own predictive analytics systems based on their patient populations and for medical device companies developing commercial algorithims.",

The toolkit is an easy-to-use desktop application with a user-friendly interface for querying and producing output results on GIS. The inputs to the toolkit are the sewer network geometry, monitored factors, and hydraulic information; the outputs of the toolkit are spatiotemporal estimates of H2S gas concentration and concrete corrosion levels on the entire sewer network with uncertainties of the predictions. The toolkit is also able to integrate experts\u2019 domain knowledge or existing physical model\u2019s results as prior knowledge into the analytics model. The final outcomes of the toolkit can be used to prioritise high risk areas, recommend chemical dosing locations, and suggest deployment of sensors. A simulation of H2S and corrosion level prediction on a subsystem of the sewer network in the greater Sydney area is reported to demonstrate the capability of the toolkit.",

Complex Event Processing (CEP) is the technology to analyze resulting event streams as fast as possible. But classic CEP is not able to consider events that did not happen yet. It is not clear how to transform CEP from a technology, which reacts on past events, to one, which anticipates near future events. Conditional density estimation allows to combine both estimation and expected uncertainty about the next occurrence of a given event in one mathematical object. Moreover, it allows to calculate the probability of event patterns, which are the basis for CEP. Hence, we are introducing the concept of Conditional Event Occurrence Density Estimation (CEODE) to CEP. We present a reference architecture for combining CEP engines with predictive analytics using CEODEs. On basis of concrete guidelines for transforming classical event processing rules to proactive ones, we are demonstrating how CEP evolves from being reactive to becoming both predictive and prescriptive.",

The predictive analytics on IoT not only helps us in achieving the goal of smart IoT devices but also reduces the time required to configure the IOT appliances. The branch of predictive analytics came into existence very recently after extensive research in the field of Data Analytics. Although the IOT process generates enormous amount of data it is of no use until properly analyses and reviewed. After the analysis process the next step in the process is to implement the result in achieving higher efficiency. The process involves use of proper classification and clustering tool which helps us in managing big dataset generated by the IoT appliances. In this paper we have covered value points and challenges faced while applying predictive analytics on IoT so that the huge dataset generated by the IoT devices can be utilized to make life easier and accomplish the goal of smart automation.",

In this Big-data era, Organizations require value out of big data. For this they need not have to deploy complex infrastructure, but can use services that provide value. As such there is a need for a flexible and scalable service called Predictive Analytics as a Service (PAaaS). Predictive analytics can forecast trends, determines statistical probabilities and to act upon fraud and security threats for big data applications such as business trading, fraud detection, crime investigation, banking, insurance, enterprise security, government, healthcare, e-commerce, and telecommunications Prediction algorithms can be supervised or unsupervised with different configurations, and the optimal one may be different for each kind of data. This paper summarizes existing service frameworks for big data and proposes PAaaS framework that can be used by business to deal with prediction in big data. This proposed framework is based upon ensemble model that uses best out of prediction algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Auto Regression algorithm(ARX) and Gaussian process(GP).",

The development and validation of predictive models for clinical practice is only the initial step in the journey toward mainstream implementation of real-time point-of-care predictions. Integrating electronic health care predictive analytics (e-HPA) into the clinical work flow, testing e-HPA in a patient population, and subsequently disseminating e-HPA across US health care systems on a broad scale require thoughtful planning. Input is needed from policy makers, health care executives, researchers, and practitioners as the field evolves. This article describes some of the considerations and challenges of implementing e-HPA, including the need to ensure patients' privacy, establish a health system monitoring team to oversee implementation, incorporate predictive analytics into medical education, and make sure that electronic systems do not replace or crowd out decision making by physicians and patients.",

The chapter follows by the practical advice on how organizations can establish a new culture in order to truly transform their business in the new era. The wave of data frenzy did not happen overnight. Rather, it is a crescendo of events happening since the early 1980s where the fields of business intelligence and predictive analytics were known as 'data mining', a preexisting discipline with another closely related term known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), which is the aim of performing data mining. Analytics has a spectrum of methodologies, techniques, and approaches from descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analytics. Most data mining projects today follow the cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP\u2010DM) which was conceived in 1996.",

To reduce financial loss and reputational risks, credit card companies and financial institutions in Canada have adopted fraud monitoring solutions such as Predictive Analytics Technologies (PAT) as part of fraud prevention programs to mitigate credit card fraud. This research paper focuses on the creation of a scorecard from relevant evaluation criteria, features, and capabilities of predictive analytics vendor solutions currently being used to detect credit card fraud. The scorecard provides a side-by-side comparison of five credit card predictive analytics vendor solutions adopted in Canada. From the ensuing research findings, a list of credit card fraud PAT vendor solution challenges, risks, and limitations was outlined.",

The current work is the first attempt to develop a generalized model for forecasting bulk moduli of various types of crystalline materials, based on ensemble predictive learning using a unique set of attributes. The attributes used are a combination of experimentally measured structural details of the material and chemical/physical properties of atoms. The model was trained on a data set of stoichiometric compounds calculated using density functional theory (DFT). It showed good predictive performance when tested against external DFT-calculated and experimentally measured stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric materials. The generalized model found correlations between bulk modulus and features defining bulk modulus in specific families of materials. The web application (ThermoEl) deploying the developed predictive model is available for public use.",

In this paper, effective mechanisms have been used for chronic disease prediction by mining the data containing historical health records. Here, we used Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) classifiers for the diagnosis of diabetes and heart disease. In this study, we also present comparative study of different classifiers to measure the performance based on accuracy rate.",

            "abstract": "Context: The recent explosion in available electronic health record (EHR) data is motivating a rapid expansion of electronic health care predictive analytic (e-HPA) applications, defined as the use of electronic algorithms that forecast clinical events in real time with the intent to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. There is an urgent need for a systematic framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA to ensure that the field develops in a scientifically sound, ethical, and efficient manner. Objectives: Building upon earlier frameworks of model development and utilization, we identify the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA, propose a framework that enables us to realize these opportunities, address these challenges, and motivate e-HPA stakeholders to both adopt and continuously refine the framework as the applications of e-HPA emerge. Methods: To achieve these objectives, 17 experts with diverse expertise including methodology, ethics, legal, regulation, and health care delivery systems were assembled to identify emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA and to propose a framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA. Findings: The framework proposed by the panel includes three key domains where e-HPA differs qualitatively from earlier generations of models and algorithms (Data Barriers, Transparency, and Ethics) and areas where current frameworks are insufficient to address the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA (Regulation and Certification; and Education and Training). The following list of recommendations summarizes the key points of the framework: Data Barriers: Establish mechanisms within the scientific community to support data sharing for predictive model development and testing. Transparency: Set standards around e-HPA validation based on principles of scientific transparency and reproducibility. Ethics: Develop both individual-centered and society-centered risk-benefit approaches to evaluate e-HPA. Regulation and Certification: Construct a self-regulation and certification framework within e-HPA. Education and Training: Make significant changes to medical, nursing, and paraprofessional curricula by including training for understanding, evaluating, and utilizing predictive models.",

In advanced analytics, Predictive analytics is the one of the branch which is mainly used to make predictions about future events which are unknown. Predictive analytics which uses various techniques from machine learning, statistics, data mining, modeling, and artificial intelligence for analyzing the current data and to make predictions about future. The two main objectives of predictive analytics are Regression and Classification. It is composed of various analytical and statistical techniques used for developing models which predicts the future occurrence, probabilities or events. Predictive analytics deals with both continuous changes and discontinuous changes. It provides a predictive score for each individual (healthcare patient, product SKU, customer, component, machine, or other organizational unit, etc.) to determine, or influence the organizational processes which pertain across huge numbers of individuals, like in fraud detection, manufacturing, credit risk assessment, marketing, and government operations including law enforcement.",

Predictive analytics incorporate this information into prognostic models that estimate the likelihood of this event for an individual patient. The Framingham Heart Study pioneered this approach1 and such estimates have become core elements of clinical care and guideline recommendations, such as the recent ACC/AHA guidelines for managing blood cholesterol for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease risk.2 Advances in predictive analytics and precision medicine have and will continue to change the practice of medicine. However, to apply these risk estimates wisely, a physician must understand that the concept of risk is more subtle and complex than is generally appreciated. Specifically, it is important to distinguish between 2 meanings of risk: risk in the epidemiological sense (the risk of a group of individuals) vs risk in the clinical sense (the risk for individual members of the group). But how accurately does the overall risk for the group reflect the risk of each of the individuals who make up the group? This distinction is critical to appreciate because it underlies the essential role that physicians need to play in the era of predictive analytics. In this Viewpoint, cardiovascular risk will be used as an example, but the same concepts can be applied to risk prediction in any context.",

These models are used in predictive data analytics applications including price prediction, risk assessment, predicting customer behavior, and document classification. This introductory textbook offers a detailed and focused treatment of the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Technical and mathematical material is augmented with explanatory worked examples, and case studies illustrate the application of these models in the broader business context. After discussing the trajectory from data to insight to decision, the book describes four approaches to machine learning: information-based learning, similarity-based learning, probability-based learning, and error-based learning. Each of these approaches is introduced by a nontechnical explanation of the underlying concept, followed by mathematical models and algorithms illustrated by detailed worked examples. Finally, the book considers techniques for evaluating prediction models and offers two case studies that describe specific data analytics projects through each phase of development, from formulating the business problem to implementation of the analytics solution. The book, informed by the authors' many years of teaching machine learning, and working on predictive data analytics projects, is suitable for use by undergraduates in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics; by graduate students in disciplines with applications for predictive data analytics; and as a reference for professionals.",

It demonstrates the use of predictive analytics to generate a model of the probabilities of success and retention at different points, or milestones, in a student journey. A core set of explanatory variables has been established and their varying relative importance at different milestones identified. The explanatory variables, milestones and reference points when the model is run will be different at other institutions but the approach may be generalised to distance learning institutions and, more broadly, to any HE institution. Institutions, and especially distance education institutions which do not have the advantages of frequently seeing students, need to make full use of any recorded information they hold to try and identify students who are, or become, at potential risk of leaving. The importance of different factors, at different milestones, may help tailor student support to individual students and therefore improve low retention in open access distance education.",

It's now a priority in many organizations because it can suggest the most favorable future planning by letting decision makers combine data about the four W's--that is, what, who, where, and when--to analyze why and how. Apart from business, it plays a vital role in higher education planning. Higher education plays an important role in a nation's socioeconomic development. As an educational management tool, predictive analytics can help improve education quality by letting us analyze critical issues in education such as enrollment management and curriculum development. This article presents an analytical study of the prospects of predictive analytics in education planning, focusing on technical education. As a case study, the authors discuss an All India Council for Technical Education-sponsored project at Delhi Technical University, India.",

Data mining itself relies upon big data, which is \u201cbig\u201d not solely because of its size but also because its analytical potential is qualitatively different. \u201cBig data\u201d analysis allows organizations, including government and businesses, to combine diverse digital datasets and then use statistics and other data mining techniques to extract from them both hidden information and surprising correlations. These data are not necessarily tracking transactional records of atomized behavior, such as the purchasing history of customers, but keeping track of communication dynamics and social interactions.Employers have long used various tools to monitor workers, whether to track productivity or guard against improper behavior in the workplace. But as individuals communicate and socialize more and more online, a whole new array of data is becoming available to employers to evaluate job candidates and monitor workers through predictive analytics. Current U.S. privacy law provides almost no protection from the type of \u201cprofile\u201d that can be generated through predictive analytics, no matter how personal. It considers any information that is potentially publicly available to not be private \u2014 regardless of how that \u201cpublic\u201d information is collected and used. There is, however, one developing privacy theory that could potentially provide privacy protection from predictive analytics: the \u201cmosaic\u201d theory recognizes that continuous monitoring of publicly available information can reveal an intimate picture of an individual\u2019s life.Predictive analytics have existed for some time, but have only recently \u201ccome of age\u201d in employment situations. This article examines the use of predictive analytics in the workplace, threats to worker privacy arising from predictive analytics, and whether the mosaic theory offers a viable and needed method of privacy protection. This article concludes, however, that unless a new theory of privacy protection is adopted \u2014 and soon \u2014 everyone faces serious threats to their privacy.",

This paper introduces a predictive supply chain performance management model which combines process modelling, performance measurement, data mining models, and web portal technologies into a unique model. It presents the supply chain modelling approach based on the specialized metamodel which allows modelling of any supply chain configuration and at different level of details. The paper also presents the supply chain semantic business intelligence (BI) model which encapsulates data sources and business rules and includes the data warehouse model with specific supply chain dimensions, measures, and KPIs (key performance indicators). Next, the paper describes two generic approaches for designing the KPI predictive data mining models based on the BI semantic model. KPI predictive models were trained and tested with a real-world data set. Finally, a specialized analytical web portal which offers collaborative performance monitoring and decision making is presented. The results show that these models give very accurate KPI projections and provide valuable insights into newly emerging trends, opportunities, and problems. This should lead to more intelligent, predictive, and responsive supply chains capable of adapting to future business environment.",

It is an open source predictive analytics platform (released under the GNU General Public License v3) suited to process a variety of data formats, from basic csv or xlsx files, to more complex data structures such as xml, url and relational databases (e.g., db2, Oracle, MySQL). Surprisingly, it has not seen wide application in the earth sciences. A number of case studies providing examples of geoscience data processing will benefit both the academia and industry, very few geoscience applications are currently reported and these are dominantly in geoinformatics. In particular, the Energy and Mineral Exploration sectors, which make extensive use of Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) software for data classification, pattern recognition and predictive modelling, will benefit significantly from KNIME. In contrast to other predictive analytics platforms (e.g., Orange, R, Rapid- Miner, Scikit-learn), what makes KNIME particularly appealing to geoscience applications is its ability to integrate different programming languages in the same workflow environment, some of them like the statistical software R or Matlab are well known in the geoscience community. KNIME is supported by an extensive community of users and developers. Since KNIME is built on top of Eclipse it shares the benefit of a plugin architecture that makes it easily extensible, many custom-built nodes are available and easily accessible through the Community Contributions area.",

Predictive analytics (using advanced machine learning) is particularly valuable in manufacturing, as it leads to production improvement with respect to the cost, quantity, quality and sustainability of manufactured products by anticipating changes to the manufacturing system states. Many small and medium manufacturers do not have the infrastructure, technical capability or financial means to take advantage of predictive analytics. A domain-specific language and framework for performing predictive analytics for manufacturing and production frameworks can counter this deficiency. In this paper, we survey some of the applications of predictive analytics in manufacturing and we discuss the challenges that need to be addressed. Then, we propose a core set of abstractions and a domain-specific framework for applying predictive analytics on manufacturing applications. Such a framework will allow manufacturers to take advantage of predictive analytics to improve their production.",

            "abstract": "Predictive analytics embraces an extensive range of techniques including statistical modeling, machine learning, and data mining and is applied in business intelligence, public health, disaster management and response, and many other fields. To date, visualization has been broadly used to support tasks in the predictive analytics pipeline. Primary uses have been in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and diagnostics. For example, scatterplots and bar charts are used to illustrate class distributions and responses. More recently, extensive visual analytics systems for feature selection, incremental learning, and various prediction tasks have been proposed to support the growing use of complex models, agent\u2010specific optimization, and comprehensive model comparison and result exploration. Such work is being driven by advances in interactive machine learning and the desire of end\u2010users to understand and engage with the modeling process. In this state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art report, we catalogue recent advances in the visualization community for supporting predictive analytics. First, we define the scope of predictive analytics discussed in this article and describe how visual analytics can support predictive analytics tasks in a predictive visual analytics (PVA) pipeline. We then survey the literature and categorize the research with respect to the proposed PVA pipeline. Systems and techniques are evaluated in terms of their supported interactions, and interactions specific to predictive analytics are discussed. We end this report with a discussion of challenges and opportunities for future research in predictive visual analytics.",

            "abstract": "The chances of winning highly valued Information Technology (IT) service contracts are influenced by various factors. Identifying key factors driving the competition and the early prediction of the outcome (either winning or losing such sales opportunities) can have significant business benefits. Given the complexity of IT services, range of potential attributes, and scarcity of comparable data sets, the straightforward approach of developing predictive analytical models that works well in other industries, such as consumer products, tends to achieve lower accuracy in this context. In this paper, we develop an approach that uses business insights and domain knowledge in the classification of several of the attributes influencing the outcome. We show how using this approach in a nai\u0308ve Bayes predictive analytics framework can vastly improve the prediction accuracy. Further, we discuss two applications of our model, early prioritization of newly validated sales opportunities and optimization of sales force allocation and planning.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Phishing websites continue to successfully exploit user vulnerabilities in household and enterprise settings. Existing anti-phishing tools lack the accuracy and generalizability needed to protect Internet users and organizations from the myriad of attacks encountered daily. Consequently, users often disregard these tools\u2019 warnings. In this study, using a design science approach, we propose a novel method for detecting phishing websites. By adopting a genre theoretic perspective, the proposed genre tree kernel method utilizes fraud cues that are associated with differences in purpose between legitimate and phishing websites, manifested through genre composition and design structure, resulting in enhanced anti-phishing capabilities. To evaluate the genre tree kernel method, a series of experiments were conducted on a testbed encompassing thousands of legitimate and phishing websites. The results revealed that the proposed method provided significantly better detection capabilities than state-of-the-art anti-phishing methods. An additional experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of the genre tree kernel technique in user settings; users utilizing the method were able to better identify and avoid phishing websites, and were consequently less likely to transact with them. Given the extensive monetary and social ramifications associated with phishing, the results have important implications for future anti-phishing strategies. More broadly, the results underscore the importance of considering intention/purpose as a critical dimension for automated credibility assessment: focusing not only on the \u201cwhat\u201d but rather on operationalizing the \u201cwhy\u201d into salient detection cues.",

However, the ability of these systems to influence patient outcomes is currently unknown. Even though nurses are the largest profession within the healthcare workforce, little research has been performed to explore the impact of clinical decision support on their decisions and the patient outcomes associated with them. A scoping literature review explored the impact clinical decision support systems containing healthcare predictive analytics have on four nursing-sensitive patient outcomes (pressure ulcers, failure to rescue, falls, and infections). While many articles discussed variable selection and predictive model development/validation, only four articles examined the impact on patient outcomes. The novelty of predictive analytics and the inherent methodological challenges in studying clinical decision support impact are likely responsible for this paucity of literature. Major methodological challenges include (1) multilevel nature of intervention, (2) treatment fidelity, and (3) adequacy of clinicians\u2019 subsequent behavior. There is currently insufficient evidence to demonstrate efficacy of healthcare predictive analytics\u2013enhanced clinical decision support systems on nursing-sensitive patient outcomes. Innovative research methods and a greater emphasis on studying this phenomenon are needed.",

            "abstract": "Higher education institutions have multiple technologic subsystems for administrative, pedagogical management, and quality purposes, which gather an immense volume of data from various sources and which do not analyzed. The domain of the analytic performances in education emerges from the need to aggregate multiple sources of data, which the selected information will make it possible to understand reality and optimize management actions. Using predictive analytics has several key benefits, including better future business performance, more insight into business dynamics, and optimum use of available data. Higher education has access to realms of data which can be used to improve decision making. Predictive analytics is \"an area of statistical analysis that deals with extracting information using various technologies to uncover relationships and patterns within large volumes of data that can be used to predict behaviour and events.\" Analytics is the process of discovering, analyzing, and interpreting meaningful patterns from large amounts of data. The importance of predictive analytics lies in its ability to suggest the most favourable planning for the future by combining data (1). Higher education is a relatively late adopter of predictive analytics as a management tool. Predictive analytics has been used in other industries for many years, especially in the area of assessing consumer behavior (7). For instance, automobile manufacturers and dealers use predictive analytics to assess the likelihood of a customer who leases a car to either purchase the vehicle or choose to lease a new vehicle at the end of the lease. Using predictive analytics, BMW might extend an offer for a no-penalty early lease termination to select customers who the data suggests are likely to move to Mercedes Benz or Audi, if they agree to a new BMW lease. In this scenario, offers would not be made to customers who the data suggest are predisposed to continue with BMW; instead, they are designed to generate repeat business from those most likely to defect. In a similar way, colleges and universities can deploy predictive analytics to determine which students are most at risk for attrition and - armed with deep, historical data - craft segment- specific retention strategies designed to compel them to persist toward degree completion. Believes that predictive analytics, while by no means a \"silver bullet\" to solve all of higher education's problems, is an important tool that can positively impact efficiency and effectiveness across the academy. To better understand predictive analytics, the researcher includes interviews with practitioners from a variety of institutions, including public and private four-year universities and a community college. Who are analytics thought-leaders or who at least had experience in its implementation? (9)(10). This paper is designed to explain predictive analytics, followed by a look at how it can impact activity at the highest levels of institutional management. We provide examples of how predictive analytics has been used at a variety of institutions, including a review of its potential pitfalls and benefits. This paper provides concrete examples of how predictive analytics has led to measurable performance improvements. Finally, recommends to all colleges and universities to consider building predictive analytics into their toolbox of techniques that inform and enable evidence-based decision-making.",

Due to its high input dimensionality, time requirements, and resource constraints, simulating over the entire parameter space is unfeasible. One solution is to take a granular sampling of the input space and use simpler predictive models (emulators) in between. The quality of the implemented emulator depends on many factors: robustness, sophistication, configuration, and suitability to the input data. Visual analytics can be leveraged to provide guidance and understanding of these things to the user. In this paper, we have implemented a novel interface and workflow for emulator building and use. We introduce a workflow to build emulators, make predictions, and then analyze the results. Our prediction process first predicts temporal time series, and uses these to derive predicted spatial densities. Integrated into the EpiSimS framework, we target users who are non-experts at statistical modeling. This approach allows for a high level of analysis into the state of the built emulators and their resultant predictions. We present our workflow, models, the associated system, and evaluate the overall utility with feedback from EpiSimS scientists.",

In this scenario, ERP systems are increasingly exposed to big data wherein the combined analysis of larger amounts of structured and unstructured data from disparate systems takes place in a short amount of time. Big data analytics requires greater use of predictive analytics to uncover hidden patterns and their relationships to visualize and explore data.

The Internet of Things (IoT) and Open Data are particularly promising in real time predictive data analytics for effective decision support. The main challenge in this context is the dynamic selection of open data and IoT sources to support predictive analytics. This issue is widely discussed in various domains including economics, market analysis, energy usage, etc. Our case study is the prediction of energy usage of a building using open data and IoT. We propose a two-step solution: (1) data management: collection, filtering and warehousing and (2) data analytics: source selection and prediction. This work has been evaluated in real settings using IoT sensors and open weather data.",

            "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | With our new norms in Operations Management, including globalization of our supply chains, increasing demand and supply uncertainty, and supply chain network complexity, product proliferation, process risk, changes in environmental rules and regulations, extreme weather, big risks and Big Data, our supply chain dynamics have changed significantly. At the same time, there is substantial growth in data to deal with. The most current estimates are that more than 15 petabytes of information (1 petabyte = 15 million gigabytes) of new data are collected every day. That's more than eight times the combined information located in all U.S. libraries! This article discusses how companies are leveraging Big Data and Predictive Analytics to mitigate and manage supply chain risks.Before we begin our dialogue, I feel it is appropriate to get grounded on this new, exciting, and exploding data environment operating within and around our supply chains. Presently, more than 90% of all data that exists in the world was created just two years ago. We are operating our supply chains in a world that creates more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day! What's a quintillion? It's equal to 1 billion gigabytes of data or 260th. Kevin O'Marah, former AMR Research VP and presently Chief Content Officer of Supply Chain Management World (http://www. scmworld.com), talks about Big Data in his 2014 SCM World Report as follows:There are presently about 6 billion people on the face of the planet. Almost all are equipped with mobile devices, cameras, recording devices, geo-location technology and more; all are creating, requesting, and remixing digital information. Since this human mass represents the ultimate aggregate demand, finding ways to mine it makes a ton of sense. The Internet-of-Things (loT) adds another 20 billion to 40 billion bits of data into the mix. Processing power continues its march onward and upward, culminating in mega-computin power such as IBM's Watson, which can actually handle simulations and queries simultaneously. And at the same time, accelerated learning among mathematicians, operations research scientists, and specialists are getting much better at solving complex problems. Therefore, it is an exciting time to manage supply chain and supply chain risk.PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS DEFINEDAccording to Edmund Schuster, Big Data got its start around 2003 with the advent of MIT's Data Center Program. Before this, according to Schuster, most of the early research in the late 1900s used the term \"data analytics\" as a key descriptor. The Leadership Council of Information Advantage states that \"Big Data\" is not a precise term. It sees it as data sets that are growing exponentially and that are too large, too raw, and too unstructured for analysis using classic relational database techniques. The New York Times states that the amount of raw data, which is doubling every two years, is emanating not only from traditional sources, but also from sources such as industrial equipment, automobiles, electrical meters, and shipping crates, to name just a few.According to APICS (the Association for Operations and Supply Chain Professionals), Predictive Analytics encompasses a variety of techniques from statistics, data mining, and game theory to analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about the future. In business, predictive models exploit patterns found in historical and transactional data to identify risks and opportunities. Models capture relationships among factors to allow assessment of risk or potential associated with a particular set of conditions guiding decision making for a specific action. It is used in actuarial science, financial services, insurance, telecommunications, retail, travel, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and other fields. Yet, until now, it was seldom utilized in manufacturing or in supply chain management. With our new normal operating environment, we feel very comfortable saying that Big Data and Predictive Analytics will be new levers for supply chain risk managers to identify, assess, mitigate, and manage global risk going forward. \u2026",

Accurate predictive analytics of big sensor data can be used to estimate missed values, or to replace incorrect readings due malfunctioning sensors or broken communication channel.

As there is a huge data generated by different sources such as business people, marketing, education, engineering, medicine, social media, on-line transactions, call centers, sensors, web logs and telecommunication. There is a need to manage the risk associated with the collection, storage, retrieval and analysis of such enormous data. Big data analytics is emerged as a core business practice that firms use to understand their business. Business intelligence and analytics are in high demand as organizations seek to use information assets to improve business outcomes. To meet the demand of the Business intelligence (BI) vendors are looking at predictive analytics to understand customer behavior in new ways. E \u2013Business merchants are collecting and analyzing data to discover shopping patterns that will predict value and understand consumer experiences in digital context. In this paper we described the evolution of different analytics and the impact of big data on business intelligence and also the future scope of predictive analytic with the existing business which will yield a better and cost reduced outcomes.",

Part I introduces predictive analytics and illustrates its potential uses in e-commerce. Predictive analytics helps merchants operate efficiently and maximize profits, but also risks denying consumers important commercial benefits. Part II examines how predictive analytics harms consumer privacy. The prevailing theoretical accounts define privacy as the ability to control what others know about you and recognize privacy\u2019s role in promoting personal autonomy and dignity. Predictive analytics harms privacy as control because individuals cannot know what the data they share will ultimately predict. In addition, predictive analytics harms consumer autonomy and dignity because it deprives them of significant commercial benefits based on secret formulas, and risks automating societal discrimination. Finally, Part III examines potential regulatory responses to the harms of predictive surveillance. Any regulatory response must be measured to avoid diminishing real commercial benefits and stifling innovation. In addition, regulation must be tailored to the type and degree of privacy harm posed by the varying uses of predictive analytics.",

            "abstract": "The recent explosion of social media services like Twitter, Google+ and Facebook has led to an interest in social media predictive analytics \u2013 automatically inferring hidden information from the large amounts of freely available content. It has a number of applications, including: online targeted advertising, personalized marketing, large-scale passive polling and real-time live polling, personalized recommendation systems and search, and real-time healthcare analytics etc. In this tutorial, we will describe how to build a variety of social media predictive analytics for inferring latent user properties from a Twitter network including demographic traits, personality, interests, emotions and opinions etc. Our methods will address several important aspects of social media such as: dynamic, streaming nature of the data, multi-relationality in social networks, data collection and annotation biases, data and model sharing, generalization of the existing models, data drift, and scalability to other languages. We will start with an overview of the existing approaches for social media predictive analytics. We will describe the state-of-the-art static (batch) models and features. We will then present models for streaming (online) inference from single and multiple data streams; and formulate a latent attribute prediction task as a sequence-labeling problem. Finally, we present several techniques for dynamic (iterative) learning and prediction using active learning setup with rationale annotation and filtering. The tutorial will conclude with a practice session focusing on walk-through examples for predicting latent user properties e.g., political preferences, income, education level, life satisfaction and emotions emanating from user communications on Twitter.",

Manufacturers, retailers, software companies, and consultants are creatively discovering new applications of big data using predictive analytics in supply chain management and logistics. In practice, predictive analytics is generally atheoretical, however, we develop a 2 X 2 model to explain the role of predictive analytics in the theory development process. This 2 X 2 model shows that in our discipline we have traditionally taken one path to theory development but that predictive analytics can be a salient component of a comprehensive theory development process. The model points to a number of research questions that need to be addressed by our research community. These questions are not just highly relevant to the academic community but also in urgent need of answers to help practitioners execute the right strategies with greater precision and efficiency. We also discuss how one disruptive trend, the maker movement (MM), changes the nature of who the producers are in the supply chain, making big data even more valuable. As we engage in higher levels of dialogue we will be able to make meaningful progress addressing these vital research topics.",

Data is collected, parsed and analyzed for relationships, and features are selected and mapped to estimate the response of a system under exploration. As social media data has grown more abundant, data can be captured that may potentially represent behavioral patterns in society. In turn, this unstructured social media data can be parsed and integrated as a key factor for predictive intelligence. In this paper, we present a framework for the development of predictive models utilizing social media data. We combine feature selection mechanisms, similarity comparisons and model cross-validation through a variety of interactive visualizations to support analysts in model building and prediction. In order to explore how predictions might be performed in such a framework, we present results from a user study focusing on social media data as a predictor for movie box-office success.",

The aim of the study was to illuminate teachers' uses and practices of predictive data, in particular identify how predictive data was used to support students at risk of not completing or failing a module. Data were collected from statistical analysis of 17,033 students' performance by the end of the intervention, teacher usage statistics, and five individual semi-structured interviews with teachers. Findings revealed that teachers endorse the use of predictive data to support their practice yet in diverse ways and raised the need for devising appropriate intervention strategies to support students at risk.",
