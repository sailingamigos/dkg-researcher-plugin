If not, you may be missing out on a potent competitive tool. In \"Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning\" , Thomas H. Davenport and Jeanne G. Harris argue that the frontier for using data to make decisions has shifted dramatically. Certain high-performing enterprises are now building their competitive strategies around data-driven insights that in turn generate impressive business results. Their secret weapon: Analytics: sophisticated quantitative and statistical analysis and predictive modeling. Exemplars of analytics are using new tools to identify their most profitable customers and offer them the right price, to accelerate product innovation, to optimize supply chains, and to identify the true drivers of financial performance. A wealth of examples - from organizations as diverse as Amazon, Barclay's, Capital One, Harrah's, Procter & Gamble, Wachovia, and the Boston Red Sox - illuminate how to leverage the power of analytics.",

Using advanced analytics methods and emerging technologies--such as business intelligence systems, business activity monitoring, predictive analytics, behavioral pattern recognition, and \"type simulations\"--can help business users continuously improve their processes. However, the high volumes of event data produced by the execution of processes during the business lifetime prevent business users from efficiently accessing timely analytics data. This article presents a technological solution using a big data approach to provide business analysts with visibility on distributed process and business performance. The proposed architecture lets users analyze business performance in highly distributed environments with a short time response.

Accurate predictions of performance could lead to improved learning outcomes and increased goal achievement. In this paper we explore the predictive capabilities of student's time-spent on answering (in-)correctly each question of a multiple-choice assessment quiz, along with student's final quiz-score, in the context of computer-based testing. We also explore the correlation between the time-spent factor (as defined here) and goal-expectancy. We present a case study and investigate the value of using this parameter as a learning analytics factor for improving prediction of performance during computer-based testing. Our initial results are encouraging and indicate that the temporal dimension of learning analytics should be further explored.",

In this tutorial, we introduce the characteristics and related mining challenges on dealing with big medical data. Many of those insights come from medical informatics community, which is highly related to data mining but focuses on biomedical specifics. We survey various related papers from data mining venues as well as medical informatics venues to share with the audiences key problems and trends in healthcare analytics research, with different applications ranging from clinical text mining, predictive modeling, survival analysis, patient similarity, genetic data analysis, and public health. The tutorial will include several case studies dealing with some of the important healthcare applications.",

            "abstract": "The early stages of the internet and world wide web drew attention to the communication and connective capacities of global networks. The ability to collaborate and interact with colleagues from around the world provided academics with new models of teaching and learning. Today, online education is a fast growing segment of the education sector. A side effect, to date not well explored, of digital learning is the collection of data and analytics in order to understand and inform teaching and learning. As learners engage in online or mobile learning, data trails are created. These data trails indicate social networks, learning dispositions, and how different learners come to understand core course concepts. Aggregate and large-scale data can also provide predictive value about the types of learning patterns and activity that might indicate risk of failure or drop out. The Society for Learning Analytics Research defines learning analytics as the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs (http://www.solaresearch.org/mission/about/). As numerous papers in this issue reference, data analytics has drawn the attention of academics and academic leaders. High expectations exist for learning analytics to provide new insights into educational practices and ways to improve teaching, learning, and decision-making. The appropriateness of these expectations is the subject of researchers in the young but rapidly growing learning analytics field. Learning analytics currently sits at a crossroads between technical and social learning theory fields. On the one hand, the algorithms that form recommender systems, personalization models, and network analysis require deep technical expertise. The impact of these algorithms, however, is felt in the social system of learning. As a consequence, researchers in learning analytics have devoted significant attention to bridging these gaps and bringing these communities in contact with each other through conversations and conferences. The LAK12 conference in Vancouver, for example, included invited panels and presentations from the educational data mining community. The SoLAR steering committee also includes representation from the International Educational Data mining Society (http://www.educationaldatamining.org). This issue reflects the rapid maturation of learning analytics as a domain of research. The papers in this issue indicate LA as a field with potential for improving teaching and learning. Less clear, currently, is the long-term trajectory of LA as a discipline. LA borrows from numerous fields including computer science, sociology, learning sciences, machine learning, statistics, and \"big data\". Coalescing as a field will require leadership, openness, collaboration, and a willingness for researchers to approach learning analytics as a holistic process that includes both technical and social domains. This issue includes ten articles: Buckingham Shum and Fergusson describe social learning analytics (SLA) as a subset of learning analytics. SLA is concerned with the process of learning, instead of heavily favoring summative assessment. SLA emphasizes that \"new skills and ideas are not solely individual achievements, but are developed, carried forward, and passed on through interaction and collaboration\". As a consequence, analytics in social systems must account for connected and distributed interaction activity. Hung, Hsu, and Rice explore the role of data mining in K-12 online education program reviews, providing educators with institutional decision-making support, in addition to identifying the characteristics of successful and at-risk students. Greller and Drachsler propose a generic framework for learning analytics, intended to serve as a guide in setting up LA services within an educational institution. \u2026",

This paper discusses a predictive analytic model that was created for the University of Phoenix. The purpose of the model is to identify students who are in danger of failing the course in which they are currently enrolled. Within the model's architecture, data from the learning management system (LMS), financial aid system, and student system are combined to calculate a likelihood of any given student failing the current course. The output can be used to prioritize students for intervention and referral to additional resources. The paper includes a discussion of the predictor and statistical tests used, validation procedures, and plans for implementation.",

Our technique utilizes the Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and factors in the lead or lag between different datasets to detect trends and periodic patterns amongst them.",

This has also prompted increasing interests in the generation of analytical, data driven models based on machine learning in health informatics. Deep learning, a technique with its foundation in artificial neural networks, is emerging in recent years as a powerful tool for machine learning, promising to reshape the future of artificial intelligence. Rapid improvements in computational power, fast data storage, and parallelization have also contributed to the rapid uptake of the technology in addition to its predictive power and ability to generate automatically optimized high-level features and semantic interpretation from the input data. This article presents a comprehensive up-to-date review of research employing deep learning in health informatics, providing a critical analysis of the relative merit, and potential pitfalls of the technique as well as its future outlook. The paper mainly focuses on key applications of deep learning in the fields of translational bioinformatics, medical imaging, pervasive sensing, medical informatics, and public health.",

            "abstract": "The importance of student success (commonly measured as degree completion) continues to rise, as does the demand for institutional accountability. Academic analytics can help institutions address student success and accountability while better fulfilling their academic missions. Academic systems generate a wide array of data that can predict retention and graduation. Academic analytics marries that data with statistical techniques and predictive modeling to help faculty and advisors determine which students may face academic difficulty, allowing interventions to help them succeed. This paper highlights what IT and institutional leaders need to understand about academic analytics, including changes it may require in data standards, systems, processes, policies, and institutional culture.",

Here s is a complexity parameter; that is, the smaller s, the lower dimensional/smoother the models in U s . If L is the data used to derive the sequence {\u03bc(., s)}, the procedure is called unstable if a small change in L can cause large changes in {\u03bc(., s)}. With a crystal ball, one could pick the predictor in {\u03bc(.,s)} having minimum prediction error. Without prescience, one uses test sets, cross-validation and so forth. The difference in prediction error between the crystal ball selection and the statistician's choice we call predictive loss. For an unstable procedure the predictive loss is large. This is shown by some analytics in a simple case and by simulation results in a more complex comparison of four different linear regression methods. Unstable procedures can be stabilized by perturbing the data, getting a new predictor sequence {\u03bc(., s)} and then averaging over many such predictor sequences.",

Unfortunately, it can be challenging to understand the results of such models and explain them to management. Partial dependence plots offer a simple solution. Partial dependence plots are low-dimensional graphical renderings of the prediction function so that the relationship between the outcome and predictors of interest can be more easily understood. These plots are especially useful in explaining the output from black box models. In this paper, we introduce pdp , a general R package for constructing partial dependence plots.",

This paper contributes to filling this gap by addressing how the Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing (CC) and predictive analytics (PA) facilitate service transformation in industrial companies. Through the Data\u2013Information\u2013Knowledge\u2013Wisdom (DIKW) model, we discuss how the abovementioned technologies transform low-level entities such as data into information and knowledge to support the service transformation of manufacturers. We propose a set of digital capabilities, based on the extant literature and the findings from four case studies. Then, we discuss how these capabilities support the service transformation trajectories of manufacturers. We find that IoT is foundational to any service transformation, although it is mostly needed to become an availability provider. PA is essential for moving to the performance provider profile. Besides providing scalability in all profiles, CC is specifically used to implement an industrialiser strategy, therefore leading to standardised, repeatable and productised offerings.",

A scarcity of deceptive news, available as corpora for predictive modeling, is a major stumbling block in this field of natural language processing (NLP) and deception detection. This paper discusses three types of fake news, each in contrast to genuine serious reporting, and weighs their pros and cons as a corpus for text analytics and predictive modeling. Filtering, vetting, and verifying online information continues to be essential in library and information science (LIS), as the lines between traditional news and online information are blurring.",

By providing interactive partial dependence diagnostics, data scientists can understand how features affect the prediction overall. In addition, our support for localized inspection allows data scientists to understand how and why specific datapoints are predicted as they are, as well as support for tweaking feature values and seeing how the prediction responds.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nPredictive analytics in emergency care has mostly been limited to the use of clinical decision rules (CDRs) in the form of simple heuristics and scoring systems. In the development of CDRs, limitations in analytic methods and concerns with usability have generally constrained models to a preselected small set of variables judged to be clinically relevant and to rules that are easily calculated. Furthermore, CDRs frequently suffer from questions of generalizability, take years to develop, and lack the ability to be updated as new information becomes available. Newer analytic and machine learning techniques capable of harnessing the large number of variables that are already available through electronic health records (EHRs) may better predict patient outcomes and facilitate automation and deployment within clinical decision support systems. In this proof-of-concept study, a local, big data-driven, machine learning approach is compared to existing CDRs and traditional analytic methods using the prediction of sepsis in-hospital mortality as the use case.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a retrospective study of adult ED visits admitted to the hospital meeting criteria for sepsis from October 2013 to October 2014. Sepsis was defined as meeting criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome with an infectious admitting diagnosis in the ED. ED visits were randomly partitioned into an 80%/20% split for training and validation. A random forest model (machine learning approach) was constructed using over 500 clinical variables from data available within the EHRs of four hospitals to predict in-hospital mortality. The machine learning prediction model was then compared to a classification and regression tree (CART) model, logistic regression model, and previously developed prediction tools on the validation data set using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and chi-square statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 5,278 visits among 4,676 unique patients who met criteria for sepsis. Of the 4,222 patients in the training group, 210 (5.0%) died during hospitalization, and of the 1,056 patients in the validation group, 50 (4.7%) died during hospitalization. The AUCs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the different models were as follows: random forest model, 0.86 (95% CI = 0.82 to 0.90); CART model, 0.69 (95% CI = 0.62 to 0.77); logistic regression model, 0.76 (95% CI = 0.69 to 0.82); CURB-65, 0.73 (95% CI = 0.67 to 0.80); MEDS, 0.71 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.77); and mREMS, 0.72 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.79). The random forest model AUC was statistically different from all other models (p \u2264 0.003 for all comparisons).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this proof-of-concept study, a local big data-driven, machine learning approach outperformed existing CDRs as well as traditional analytic techniques for predicting in-hospital mortality of ED patients with sepsis. Future research should prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of this approach and whether it translates into improved clinical outcomes for high-risk sepsis patients. The methods developed serve as an example of a new model for predictive analytics in emergency care that can be automated, applied to other clinical outcomes of interest, and deployed in EHRs to enable locally relevant clinical predictions.",

            "abstract": "With the adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) in educational institutions, a lot of data has become available describing students\u2019 online behavior. Many researchers have used these data to predict student performance. This has led to a rather diverse set of findings, possibly related to the diversity in courses and predictor variables extracted from the LMS, which makes it hard to draw general conclusions about the mechanisms underlying student performance. We first provide an overview of the theoretical arguments used in learning analytics research and the typical predictors that have been used in recent studies. We then analyze 17 blended courses with 4,989 students in a single institution using Moodle LMS, in which we predict student performance from LMS predictor variables as used in the literature and from in-between assessment grades, using both multi-level and standard regressions. Our analyses show that the results of predictive modeling, notwithstanding the fact that they are collected within a single institution, strongly vary across courses. Thus, the portability of the prediction models across courses is low. In addition, we show that for the purpose of early intervention or when in-between assessment grades are taken into account, LMS data are of little (additional) value. We outline the implications of our findings and emphasize the need to include more specific theoretical argumentation and additional data sources other than just the LMS data.",

At the same time, the use of big data has spread across a range of fields, including finance, politics, health, and marketing. While law enforcement\u2019s use of big data is hotly contested, very little is known about how the police actually use it in daily operations and with what consequences. This book offers an inside look at how police use big data and new surveillance technologies, leveraging on-the-ground fieldwork with one of the most technologically advanced law enforcement agencies in the world\u2014the Los Angeles Police Department. Drawing on original interviews and ethnographic observations from over two years of fieldwork with the LAPD, the text examines the causes and consequences of big data and algorithmic control. It reveals how the police use predictive analytics and new surveillance technologies to deploy resources, identify criminal suspects, and conduct investigations; how the adoption of big data analytics transforms police organizational practices; and how the police themselves respond to these new data-driven practices. While big data analytics has the potential to reduce bias, increase efficiency, and improve prediction accuracy, the book argues that it also reproduces and deepens existing patterns of inequality, threatens privacy, and challenges civil liberties.",

Particularly, a wealth of student activity data is available from learning management systems (LMSs) in most academic institutions. However, previous investigations into predictive analytics in higher education using LMS activity data did not adequately accommodate student behaviours in the form of time series. In this study, we have applied a deep learning approach \u2014 long short-term memory (LSTM) networks \u2014 to analyze student online temporal behaviours using their LMS data for the early prediction of course performance. To reveal the potential of the deep learning approach in predictive analytics, we compared LSTM networks with eight conventional machine learning classifiers in terms of the prediction performance as measured by the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) scores. Results indicate that using the deep learning approach, time series information about click frequencies successfully provided early detection of at-risk students with moderate prediction accuracy. In addition, the deep learning approach showed higher prediction performance and stronger generalizability than the machine learning classifiers.",

This paper focuses on work conducted at the Open University (OU) into predicting students who are at risk of failing their module. The Open University is one of the worlds largest distance learning institutions. Since tutors do not interact face to face with students, it can be difficult for tutors to identify and respond to students who are struggling in time to try to resolve the difficulty. Predictive models have been developed and tested using historic Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) activity data combined with other data sources, for three OU modules. This has revealed that it is possible to predict student failure by looking for changes in user's activity in the VLE, when compared against their own previous behaviour, or that of students who can be categorised as having similar learning behaviour. More focused analysis of these modules applying the GUHA (General Unary Hypothesis Automaton) method of data analysis has also yielded some early promising results for creating accurate hypothesis about students who fail.",

KEY FINDINGS \u27a0 Most respondents rely on a transaction processing system as the primary platform to support their needs for information and analysis. \u27a0 The use of academic analytics varies by functional area. The most sophisticated and active users are central finance, institutional research, admissions, and central planning and budgeting. \u27a0 Most respondents use academic analytics primarily to support transactional and operational reporting. Few have extensively adopted advanced applications such as what-if analysis, predictive modeling, scenario building, or automated alerts. \u27a0 Responding institutions are using advanced applications of academic analytics most frequently in student services and least frequently in grants management. \u27a0 Respondents report benefiting the most from their use of academic analytics to improve student recruitment and retention. \u27a0 Success with academic analytics is strongly associated with leadership commitment to evidence-based decision making, training effectiveness, and staff analytical skill. \u27a0 The majority of respondents anticipate expanding their capacity to perform academic analytics in the next two years.",

Some have even predicted the end of theory\u2014where the question why is replaced by what\u2014and an enduring challenge to disciplinary expertise.

Learning design establishes the objectives and pedagogical plans which can be evaluated against the outcomes captured through learning analytics. However, no empirical study is available linking learning designs of a substantial number of courses with usage of Learning Management Systems (LMS) and learning performance. Using cluster- and correlation analyses, in this study we compared how 87 modules were designed, and how this impacted (static and dynamic) LMS behavior and learning performance. Our findings indicate that academics seem to design modules with an \"invisible\" blueprint in their mind. Our cluster analyses yielded four distinctive learning design patterns: constructivist, assessment-driven, balanced-variety and social constructivist modules. More importantly, learning design activities strongly influenced how students were engaging online. Finally, learning design activities seem to have an impact on learning performance, in particular when modules rely on assimilative activities. Our findings indicate that learning analytics researchers need to be aware of the impact of learning design on LMS data over time, and subsequent academic performance.",

The goal of this paper is to highlight the advantages of tree-based machine learning algorithms over classic (logistic) regression methods for data-informed decision making in higher education problems, and stress the success of random forest in circumstances where the regression assumptions are often violated in big data applications. Random forest is a model averaging procedure where each tree is constructed based on a bootstrap sample of the data set. In particular, we emphasize the ease of application, low computational cost, high predictive accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability of random forest machinery. Our overall recommendation is that institutional researchers look beyond classical regression and single decision tree analytics tools, and consider random forest as the predominant method for prediction tasks. The proposed points of view are detailed and illustrated through a simulation experiment and analyses of data from real institutional research projects.",

Hence, a comprehensive review of educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) in higher education was conducted. This review covered the most relevant studies related to four main dimensions: computer-supported learning analytics (CSLA), computer-supported predictive analytics (CSPA), computer-supported beha- vioral analytics (CSBA), and computer-supported visualization analytics (CSVA) from 2000 till 2017. The relevant EDM and LA techniques were identified and compared across these dimen- sions. Based on the results of 402 studies, it was found that specific EDM and LA techniques could offer the best means of solving certain learning problems. Applying EDM and LA in higher education can be useful in developing a student-focused strategy and providing the required tools that institutions will be able to use for the purposes of continuous improvement.",

Background: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in reducing rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the efficacy of noninvasive approaches has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. Methods: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. Results: One hundred subjects aged 68.4\u00b110.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2\u201313.7) days. Conclusions: Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be further tested. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

            "abstract": "A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity to create learning experiences that are both effective and engaging. Recent advances in sensor-based technologies such as facial expression analysis and gaze tracking have introduced the opportunity to leverage multimodal data streams for learning analytics. Learning analytics informed by multimodal data captured during students? interactions with game-based learning environments hold significant promise for developing a deeper understanding of game-based learning, designing game-based learning environments to detect maladaptive behaviors and informing adaptive scaffolding to support individualized learning. This paper introduces a multimodal learning analytics approach that incorporates student gameplay, eye tracking and facial expression data to predict student posttest performance and interest after interacting with a game-based learning environment, Crystal Island. We investigated the degree to which separate and combined modalities (ie, gameplay, facial expressions of emotions and eye gaze) captured from students (n = 65) were predictive of student posttest performance and interest after interacting with Crystal Island. Results indicate that when predicting student posttest performance and interest, models utilizing multimodal data either perform equally well or outperform models utilizing unimodal data. We discuss the synergistic effects of combining modalities for predicting both student interest and posttest performance. The findings suggest that multimodal learning analytics can accurately predict students? posttest performance and interest during game-based learning and hold significant potential for guiding real-time adaptive scaffolding.",

            "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), an enormous amount of sensing devices collect and/or generate various sensory data over time for a wide range of fields and applications. Based on the nature of the application, these devices will result in big or fast/real-time data streams. Applying analytics over such data streams to discover new information, predict future insights, and make control decisions is a crucial process that makes IoT a worthy paradigm for businesses and a quality-of-life improving technology. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on using a class of advanced machine learning techniques, namely deep learning (DL), to facilitate the analytics and learning in the IoT domain. We start by articulating IoT data characteristics and identifying two major treatments for IoT data from a machine learning perspective, namely IoT big data analytics and IoT streaming data analytics. We also discuss why DL is a promising approach to achieve the desired analytics in these types of data and applications. The potential of using emerging DL techniques for IoT data analytics are then discussed, and its promises and challenges are introduced. We present a comprehensive background on different DL architectures and algorithms. We also analyze and summarize major reported research attempts that leveraged DL in the IoT domain. The smart IoT devices that have incorporated DL in their intelligence background are also discussed. DL implementation approaches on the fog and cloud centers in support of IoT applications are also surveyed. Finally, we shed light on some challenges and potential directions for future research. At the end of each section, we highlight the lessons learned based on our experiments and review of the recent literature.",

            "abstract": "The growing capability and accessibility of machine learning has led to its application to many real-world domains and data about people. Despite the benefits algorithmic systems may bring, models can reflect, inject, or exacerbate implicit and explicit societal biases into their outputs, disadvantaging certain demographic subgroups. Discovering which biases a machine learning model has introduced is a great challenge, due to the numerous definitions of fairness and the large number of potentially impacted subgroups. We present FAIRVIS, a mixed-initiative visual analytics system that integrates a novel subgroup discovery technique for users to audit the fairness of machine learning models. Through FAIRVIS, users can apply domain knowledge to generate and investigate known subgroups, and explore suggested and similar subgroups. FAIRVIS's coordinated views enable users to explore a high-level overview of subgroup performance and subsequently drill down into detailed investigation of specific subgroups. We show how FAIRVIS helps to discover biases in two real datasets used in predicting income and recidivism. As a visual analytics system devoted to discovering bias in machine learning, FAIRVIS demonstrates how interactive visualization may help data scientists and the general public understand and create more equitable algorithmic systems.",

            "abstract": "Recent workload trends indicate rapid growth in the deployment of machine learning, genomics and scientific workloads on cloud computing infrastructure. However, efficiently running these applications on shared infrastructure is challenging and we find that choosing the right hardware configuration can significantly improve performance and cost. The key to address the above challenge is having the ability to predict performance of applications under various resource configurations so that we can automatically choose the optimal configuration. \n \nOur insight is that a number of jobs have predictable structure in terms of computation and communication. Thus we can build performance models based on the behavior of the job on small samples of data and then predict its performance on larger datasets and cluster sizes. To minimize the time and resources spent in building a model, we use optimal experiment design, a statistical technique that allows us to collect as few training points as required. We have built Ernest, a performance prediction framework for large scale analytics and our evaluation on Amazon EC2 using several workloads shows that our prediction error is low while having a training overhead of less than 5% for long-running jobs.",

This study applied learning analytics and educational big data approaches for the early prediction of students\u2019 final academic performance in a blended Calculus course. Real data with 21 variables were collected from the proposed course, consisting of video-viewing behaviors, out-of-class practice behaviors, homework and quiz scores, and after-school tutoring. This study applied principal component regression to predict students\u2019 final academic performance. The experimental results show that students\u2019 final academic performance could be predicted when only one-third of the semester had elapsed. In addition, we identified seven critical factors that affect students\u2019 academic performance, consisting of four online factors and three traditional factors. The results showed that the blended data set combining online and traditional critical factors had the highest predictive performance.",

            "abstract": "Abstract As more firms adopt big data analytics to better understand their customers and differentiate their offerings from competitors, it becomes increasingly difficult to generate strategic value from isolated and unfocused ad hoc initiatives. To attain sustainable competitive advantage from big data, firms must achieve agility in combining rich data across the organization to deploy analytics that sense and respond to customers in a dynamic environment. A key challenge in achieving this agility lies in the identification, collection, and integration of data across functional silos both within and outside the organization. Because it is infeasible to systematically integrate all available data, managers need guidance in finding which data can provide valuable and actionable insights about customers. Leveraging relationship marketing theory, we develop a framework for identifying and evaluating various sources of big data in order to create a value-justified data infrastructure that enables focused and agile deployment of advanced customer analytics. Such analytics move beyond siloed transactional customer analytics approaches of the past and incorporate a variety of rich, relationship-oriented constructs to provide actionable and valuable insights. We develop a customized kernel-based learning method to take advantage of these rich constructs and instantiate the framework in a novel prototype system that accurately predicts a variety of customer behaviors in a challenging environment, demonstrating the framework\u2019s ability to drive significant value.",

The ability to predict a student's performance can be beneficial for actions in modern educational systems. Existing methods have used features which are mostly related to academic performance, family income and family assets; while features belonging to family expenditures and students' personal information are usually ignored. In this paper, an effort is made to investigate aforementioned feature sets by collecting the scholarship holding students' data from different universities of Pakistan. Learning analytics, discriminative and generative classification models are applied to predict whether a student will be able to complete his degree or not. Experimental results show that proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods due to exploitation of family expenditures and students' personal information feature sets. Outcomes of this EDM/LA research can serve as policy improvement method in higher education.",

            "abstract": "We present our work with an online retailer, Rue La La, as an example of how a retailer can use its wealth of data to optimize pricing decisions on a daily basis. Rue La La is in the online fashion sample sales industry, where they offer extremely limited-time discounts on designer apparel and accessories. One of the retailer's main challenges is pricing and predicting demand for products that it has never sold before, which account for the majority of sales and revenue. To tackle this challenge, we use machine learning techniques to estimate historical lost sales and predict future demand of new products. The nonparametric structure of our demand prediction model, along with the dependence of a product's demand on the price of competing products, pose new challenges on translating the demand forecasts into a pricing policy. We develop an algorithm to efficiently solve the subsequent multiproduct price optimization that incorporates reference price effects, and we create and implement this algorithm into a pricing decision support tool for Rue La La's daily use. We conduct a field experiment and find that sales does not decrease because of implementing tool recommended price increases for medium and high price point products. Finally, we estimate an increase in revenue of the test group by approximately 9.7% with an associated 90% confidence interval of [2.3%, 17.8%].",

This leads to large overprovisioning in statically managed virtual network topologies (VNTs), which are designed to cope with the traffic forecast. To reduce expenses while ensuring the required grade of service, in this paper we propose a VNT reconfiguration approach based on data analytics for traffic prediction (VENTURE). It regularly reconfigures the VNT based on the predicted traffic, thus adapting the topology to both the current and the predicted traffic volume and direction. A machine learning algorithm based on an artificial neural network is used to provide robust and adaptive traffic models. The reconfiguration problem that takes as its input the traffic prediction is modeled mathematically, and a heuristic is proposed to solve it in practical times. To support VENTURE, we propose an architecture that allows collecting and storing data from monitoring at the routers and that is used to train predictive models for every origin-destination pair. Exhaustive simulation results of the algorithm, together with the experimental assessment of the proposed architecture, are finally presented.",

At the same time, supply chain risk management is important for practitioners to consider because it outlines ways through which firms can allay internal and external threats. Predicting and addressing the risks that social issues cause in the supply chain is of paramount importance to the sustainable enterprise. The aim of this research is to explore the application of big data analytics in mitigating supply chain social risk and to demonstrate how such mitigation can help in achieving environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The method involves an expert panel and survey identifying and validating social issues in the supply chain. A case study was used to illustrate the application of big data analytics in identifying and mitigating social issues in the supply chain. Our results show that companies can predict various social problems including workforce safety, fuel consumptions monitoring, workforce health, security, physical condition of vehicles, unethical behavior, theft, speeding and traffic violations through big data analytics, thereby demonstrating how information management actions can mitigate social risks. This paper contributes to the literature by integrating big data analytics with sustainability to explain how to mitigate supply chain risk.",

            "abstract": "Historical information is always relevant for clinical trial design. Additionally, if incorporated in the analysis of a new trial, historical data allow to reduce the number of subjects. This decreases costs and trial duration, facilitates recruitment, and may be more ethical. Yet, under prior\u2010data conflict, a too optimistic use of historical data may be inappropriate. We address this challenge by deriving a Bayesian meta\u2010analytic\u2010predictive prior from historical data, which is then combined with the new data. This prospective approach is equivalent to a meta\u2010analytic\u2010combined analysis of historical and new data if parameters are exchangeable across trials. The prospective Bayesian version requires a good approximation of the meta\u2010analytic\u2010predictive prior, which is not available analytically. We propose two\u2010 or three\u2010component mixtures of standard priors, which allow for good approximations and, for the one\u2010parameter exponential family, straightforward posterior calculations. Moreover, since one of the mixture components is usually vague, mixture priors will often be heavy\u2010tailed and therefore robust. Further robustness and a more rapid reaction to prior\u2010data conflicts can be achieved by adding an extra weakly\u2010informative mixture component. Use of historical prior information is particularly attractive for adaptive trials, as the randomization ratio can then be changed in case of prior\u2010data conflict. Both frequentist operating characteristics and posterior summaries for various data scenarios show that these designs have desirable properties. We illustrate the methodology for a phase II proof\u2010of\u2010concept trial with historical controls from four studies. Robust meta\u2010analytic\u2010predictive priors alleviate prior\u2010data conflicts ' they should encourage better and more frequent use of historical data in clinical trials.",

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has three decades of experience collecting data about the veterans it serves nationwide through locally developed information systems that use a common electronic health record. In 2006 the VHA began to build its Corporate Data Warehouse, a repository for patient-level data aggregated from across the VHA's national health system. This article provides a high-level overview of the VHA's evolution toward \"big data,\" defined as the rapid evolution of applying advanced tools and approaches to large, complex, and rapidly changing data sets. It illustrates how advanced analysis is already supporting the VHA's activities, which range from routine clinical care of individual patients--for example, monitoring medication administration and predicting risk of adverse outcomes--to evaluating a systemwide initiative to bring the principles of the patient-centered medical home to all veterans. The article also shares some of the challenges, concerns, insights, and responses that have emerged along the way, such as the need to smoothly integrate new functions into clinical workflow. While the VHA is unique in many ways, its experience may offer important insights for other health care systems nationwide as they venture into the realm of big data.",

Much of the software analytics and prediction work has proposed metrics, models and novel approaches that can predict quality with high levels of accuracy. However, adoption of such techniques remain low; one of the reasons for this low adoption of the current analytics and prediction technique is the lack of actionable and publicly available tools. We present Commit Guru, a language agnostic analytics and prediction tool that identifies and predicts risky software commits. Commit Guru is publicly available and is able to mine any GIT SCM repository. Analytics are generated at both, the project and commit levels. In addition, Commit Guru automatically identifies risky (i.e., bug-inducing) commits and builds a prediction model that assess the likelihood of a recent commit introducing a bug in the future. Finally, to facilitate future research in the area, users of Commit Guru can download the data for any project that is processed by Commit Guru with a single click. Several large open source projects have been successfully processed using Commit Guru. Commit Guru is available online at commit.guru. Our source code is also released freely under the MIT license.",

            "abstract": "The industrial production of complex biopharmaceuticals using recombinant mammalian cell lines is still mainly built on a quality by testing approach, which is represented by fixed process conditions and extensive testing of the end-product. In 2004 the FDA launched the process analytical technology initiative, aiming to guide the industry towards advanced process monitoring and better understanding of how critical process parameters affect the critical quality attributes. Implementation of process analytical technology into the bio-production process enables moving from the quality by testing to a more flexible quality by design approach. The application of advanced sensor systems in combination with mathematical modelling techniques offers enhanced process understanding, allows on-line prediction of critical quality attributes and subsequently real-time product quality control. In this review opportunities and unsolved issues on the road to a successful quality by design and dynamic control implementation are discussed. A major focus is directed on the preconditions for the application of model predictive control for mammalian cell culture bioprocesses. Design of experiments providing information about the process dynamics upon parameter change, dynamic process models, on-line process state predictions and powerful software environments seem to be a prerequisite for quality by control realization.",

Important potential moderators were examined including ethnicity, gender, LS scale variant, geographic region, and type of recidivism used to measure outcome. Results supported the predictive accuracy of the LS scales and their criminogenic need domains for general and violent recidivism overall, and among broad subgroups of interest, including females and ethnic minorities. Although results indicated that gender and ethnicity were not substantive sources of effect size variability, significant differences in effect size magnitude were found when analyses were conducted by geographic region. Canadian samples consistently demonstrated the largest effect sizes, followed by studies conducted outside North America, and then studies conducted in the United States. This pattern was observed irrespective of gender, ethnicity, LS domain, LS variant, or type of recidivism outcome, suggesting geographic region may be an important source of effect size variation. We discuss possible factors underlying this pattern of results and identify areas for future research.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, an early intervention solution for collegiate faculty called Course Signals is discussed. Course Signals was developed to allow instructors the opportunity to employ the power of learner analytics to provide real-time feedback to a student. Course Signals relies not only on grades to predict students' performance, but also demographic characteristics, past academic history, and students' effort as measured by interaction with Blackboard Vista, Purdue's learning management system. The outcome is delivered to the students via a personalized email from the faculty member to each student, as well as a specific color on a stoplight -- traffic signal -- to indicate how each student is doing. The system itself is explained in detail, along with retention and performance outcomes realized since its implementation. In addition, faculty and student perceptions will be shared.",

Similar to many new systems that involve accounting information, data analytics has fundamentally changed task processes, particularly those tasks that provide inference, prediction, and assurance to decision-makers. Thus, accounting researchers and practitioners must consider data analytics and its impact on accounting practice in their work. This paper uses the organizing principles from Mauldin and Ruchala's (1999) meta-theory of accounting information systems (AIS) to identify current data analytics use, examine how data analytics impacts the accounting environment, and discuss challenges and research opportunities.",

For this, statistical, and hybrid methods such as frequency ratio (FR), evidential belief function (EBF), weight of evidence (WoE), index of entropy (IoE), fuzzy logic (FL), principal component analysis (PCA), analytical hierarchy process (AHP), technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), and VlseKriterijumska optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) were adapted. Values at both 70% and 30% of inventory data from the generated maps were extracted to validate the training and testing processes by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and seed cell area index (SCAI). Sensitivity, speci\ufb01city, accuracy, and kappa index were calculated from ROC analysis, and SCAI was computed from the classi\ufb01cation of map by natural break method and \ufb02ood pixels in that classi\ufb01cation. Since the predicted results of the methods applied did not point out the same model for each criterion, a simple method was selected to determine the most preferable method. Analysis showed that, IoE model was found to be the best model considering the ROC parameters, while PCA and AHP methods gave more reliable results considering SCAI. This study may be considered as a comprehensive contribution to the hybridization methods in predicting accurate \ufb02ood hazards susceptibility maps.",

Although these large-scale issues are worthy of consideration, faculty might also be interested in how they can use learning analytics in their own courses to help their students succeed. In this paper, we define learning analytics, how it has been used in educational institutions, what learning analytics tools are available, and how faculty can make use of data in their courses to monitor and predict student performance. Finally, we discuss several issues and concerns with the use of learning analytics in higher education.",

These approaches should be particularly useful because the need for scalable project-based and student-centered learning is growing considerably. In this article, we present studies focused on how students learn computer programming, based on data drawn from 154,000 code snapshots of computer programs under development by approximately 370 students enrolled in an introductory undergraduate programming course. We use methods from machine learning to discover patterns in the data and try to predict final exam grades. We begin with a set of exploratory experiments that use fully automated techniques to investigate how much students change their programming behavior throughout all assignments in the course. The results show that students\u2019 change in programming patterns is only weakly predictive of course performance. We subsequently hone in on 1 single assignment, trying to map students\u2019 learning process and trajectories and automatically identify productive and unproductive (sink) states within these trajectories. Results show that our process-based metric has better predictive power for final exams than the midterm grades. We conclude with recommendations about the use of such methods for assessment, real-time feedback, and course improvement.",

Multiple linear regression analysis is conducted to determine which factors influence student's academic achievement. 84 undergraduate students in a women's university in South Korea participated in this study. The six-predictor model was able to account for 33.5% of the variance in final grade, F(6, 77) = 6.457, p < .001, R2 = .335. Total studying time in LMS, interaction with peers, regularity of learning interval in LMS, and number of downloads were determined to be significant factors for students' academic achievement in online learning environment. These four controllable variables not only predict learning outcomes significantly but also can be changed if learners put more effort to improve their academic performance. The results provide a rationale for the treatment for student time management effort.",

In our study, the nonlinearity of the guided waves is generated by interaction with a nonlinear breathing crack. Two nonlinear finite element method techniques are used to simulate the breathing crack: (a) element activation/deactivation method and (b) contact analysis. Both techniques are available in ANSYS software package. The solutions obtained by these two finite element method techniques compare quite well. A parametric analytical predictive model is built to simulate guided waves interacting with linear/nonlinear structural damage. This model is coded into MATLAB, and the WaveFormRevealer graphical user interface is developed to obtain fast predictive waveform solutions for arbitrary combinations of sensor, structural properties, and damage. The predictive model is found capable of describing the nonlinear wave propagation phenomenon. This article finishes with summary and conclusions followed by recommendations for further work.",

Issues such as plant optimization and constrained control which are critical to industrial engineers are naturally embedded in its designs. Model Predictive Control System Design and Implementation Using MATLAB proposes methods for design and implementation of MPC systems using basis functions that confer the following advantages: continuous- and discrete-time MPC problems solved in similar design frameworks; a parsimonious parametric representation of the control trajectory gives rise to computationally efficient algorithms and better on-line performance; and a more general discrete-time representation of MPC design that becomes identical to the traditional approach for an appropriate choice of parameters. After the theoretical presentation, detailed coverage is given to three industrial applications: a food extruder, a motor and a magnetic bearing system. The subject of quadratic programming, often associated with the core optimization algorithms of MPC is also introduced and explained. The technical contents of this book, mainly based on advances in MPC using state-space models and basis functions to which the author is a major contributor, will be of interest to control researchers and practitioners, especially of process control. From a pedagogical standpoint, this volume includes numerous simple analytical examples and every chapter contains problems and MATLAB programs and exercises to assist the student.",

Based upon previous research, three values were selected from a data set. According to the result of empirical validation, an (ir)regularity of the learning interval was proven to be correlative with and predict learning performance. As indicated in previous research, regularity of learning is a strong indicator to explain learners' consistent endeavors. This study demonstrates the possibility of using learning analytics to address a learner's specific competence on the basis of a theoretical background. Implications for the learning analytics field seeking a pedagogical theory-driven approach are discussed.",

In addition, the study will discuss its applications, goals, examples, and why instructors want to make use of academic analytics. Finally, this paper will propose an intelligent recommendation intervention to improve students' achievement that will be based on two outcomes; performance as measured by final grade, and students' information data such as attendance, prerequisite subject, English and Mathematics marks, and suggests the use of Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree for predictive modeling.",

The solar wind is capable of generating time- and charge-dependent effects on the spectrum and intensity of low-energy (\u227210 GeV) cosmic rays reaching Earth. Previous analytic treatments of solar modulation have utilized the force-field approximation, in which a simple potential is adopted whose amplitude is selected to best fit the cosmic-ray data taken over a given period of time. Making use of recently available cosmic-ray data from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, along with measurements of the heliospheric magnetic field and solar wind, we construct a time-, charge- and rigidity-dependent model of solar modulation that can be directly compared to data from a variety of cosmic-ray experiments. Here, we provide a simple analytic formula that can be easily utilized in a variety of applications, allowing us to better predict the effects of solar modulation and reduce the number of free parameters involved in cosmic-ray propagation models.",

These experts provided constructive guidance and comments for this issue brief. The TWG comprised Ryan S. In data mining and data analytics, tools and techniques once confined to research laboratories are being adopted by forward-looking industries to generate business intelligence for improving decision making. Higher education institutions are beginning to use analytics for improving the services they provide and for increasing student grades and retention. The U.S. Department of Education's National Education Technology Plan, as one part of its model for 21st-century learning powered by technology, envisions ways of using data from online learning systems to improve instruction. With analytics and data mining experiments in education starting to proliferate, sorting out fact from fiction and identifying research possibilities and practical applications are not easy. This issue brief is intended to help policymakers and administrators understand how analytics and data mining have been\u2014and can be\u2014applied for educational improvement. At present, educational data mining tends to focus on developing new tools for discovering patterns in data. These patterns are generally about the microconcepts involved in learning: one-digit multiplication, subtraction with carries, and so on. Learning analytics\u2014at least as it is currently contrasted with data mining\u2014focuses on applying tools and techniques at larger scales, such as in courses and at schools and postsecondary institutions. But both disciplines work with patterns and prediction: If we can discern the pattern in the data and make sense of what is happening, we can predict what should come next and take the appropriate action. Educational data mining and learning analytics are used to research and build models in several areas that can influence online learning systems. One area is user modeling, which encompasses what a learner knows, what a learner's behavior and motivation are, what the user experience is like, and how satisfied users are with online learning. At the simplest level, analytics can detect when a student in an online course is going astray and nudge him or her on to a course correction. At the most complex, they hold promise of detecting boredom from patterns of key clicks and redirecting the student's attention. Because these data are gathered in real time, there is a real possibility of continuous improvement via multiple feedback loops that operate at different time scales\u2014immediate to the student \u2026",

Meta-analytic techniques were used to correct the correlations between the TRA/TPB constructs for statistical artifacts across 72 studies, and path analyses were conducted to examine the pattern of relationships among the variables. Results demonstrated that the TRA and TPB both exhibited good fit with the corrected correlation matrices, but the TPB accounted for more variance in physical activity intentions and behavior. In addition, self-efficacy explained unique variance in intention, and the inclusion of past behavior in the model resulted in the attenuation of the intention-behavior, attitude-intention, self-efficacy-intention, and self-efficacy-behavior relationships.

            "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms are widely used today for analytical tasks such as data cleaning, data categorization, or data filtering. At the same time, the rise of social media motivates recent uptake in large scale graph processing. Both categories of algorithms are dominated by iterative subtasks, i.e., processing steps which are executed repetitively until a convergence condition is met. Optimizing cluster resource allocations among multiple workloads of iterative algorithms motivates the need for estimating their runtime, which in turn requires: i) predicting the number of iterations, and ii) predicting the processing time of each iteration. As both parameters depend on the characteristics of the dataset and on the convergence function, estimating their values before execution is difficult. \n \nThis paper proposes PREDIcT, an experimental methodology for predicting the runtime of iterative algorithms. PREDIcT uses sample runs for capturing the algorithm's convergence trend and per-iteration key input features that are well correlated with the actual processing requirements of the complete input dataset. Using this combination of characteristics we predict the runtime of iterative algorithms, including algorithms with very different runtime patterns among subsequent iterations. Our experimental evaluation of multiple algorithms on scale-free graphs shows a relative prediction error of 10%-30% for predicting runtime, including algorithms with up to 100\u00d7 runtime variability among consecutive iterations.",

This cycle conceptualises successful learning analytics work as four linked steps: learners (1) generating data (2) that is used to produce metrics, analytics or visualisations (3). The key step is 'closing the loop' by feeding back this product to learners through one or more interventions (4). This paper seeks to begin to place learning analytics practice on a base of established learning theory, and draws several implications from this theory for the improvement of learning analytics projects. These include speeding up or shortening the cycle so feedback happens more quickly, and widening the audience for feedback (in particular, considering learners and teachers as audiences for analytics) so that it can have a larger impact.",

However, collecting personality ratings from other-raters, such as family, friends, and even strangers, is a dramatically underutilized method that allows better explanation and prediction of personality's role in many domains of psychology. Drawing hypotheses from D. C. Funder's (1995) realistic accuracy model about trait and information moderators of accuracy, we offer 3 meta-analyses to help researchers and applied psychologists understand and interpret both consistencies and unique insights afforded by other-ratings of personality. These meta-analyses integrate findings based on 44,178 target individuals rated across 263 independent samples. Each meta-analysis assessed the accuracy of observer ratings, as indexed by interrater consensus/reliability (Study 1), self-other correlations (Study 2), and predictions of behavior (Study 3). The results show that although increased frequency of interacting with targets does improve accuracy in rating personality, informants' interpersonal intimacy with the target is necessary for substantial increases in other-rating accuracy. Interpersonal intimacy improved accuracy especially for traits low in visibility (e.g., Emotional Stability) but only minimally for traits high in evaluativeness (e.g., Agreeableness). In addition, observer ratings were strong predictors of behaviors. When the criterion was academic achievement or job performance, other-ratings yielded predictive validities substantially greater than and incremental to self-ratings. These findings indicate that extraordinary value can gained by using other-reports to measure personality, and these findings provide guidelines toward enriching personality theory. Various subfields of psychology in which personality variables are systematically assessed and utilized in research and practice can benefit tremendously from use of others' ratings to measure personality variables.",

We propose a refined system for biomarker study design, conduct, analysis, and evaluation that incorporates a hierarchal level of evidence scale for tumor marker studies, including those using archived specimens. Although fully prospective randomized clinical trials to evaluate the medical utility of a prognostic or predictive biomarker are the gold standard, such trials are costly, so we discuss more efficient indirect \"prospective-retrospective\" designs using archived specimens. In particular, we propose new guidelines that stipulate that 1) adequate amounts of archived tissue must be available from enough patients from a prospective trial (which for predictive factors should generally be a randomized design) for analyses to have adequate statistical power and for the patients included in the evaluation to be clearly representative of the patients in the trial; 2) the test should be analytically and preanalytically validated for use with archived tissue; 3) the plan for biomarker evaluation should be completely specified in writing before the performance of biomarker assays on archived tissue and should be focused on evaluation of a single completely defined classifier; and 4) the results from archived specimens should be validated using specimens from one or more similar, but separate, studies.",

Drawing on 65 independent samples (N = 42,907), we found that on-the-job and off-the-job embeddedness negatively related to turnover intentions and actual turnover, after controlling for job satisfaction, affective commitment, and job alternatives. In addition, the negative relationships between on-the-job embeddedness (off-the-job embeddedness) and turnover criteria were stronger in female-dominated samples and public organizations (collectivistic countries). Finally, turnover intentions, job search behavior, and job performance fully (partially) mediated the effect of on-the-job embeddedness (off-the-job embeddedness) on actual turnover. The research and practical implications of our findings are noted, in light of study limitations and future research needs.",

            "abstract": "Introduction Learning Management Systems (LMS) or Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) are widely used and have become part of the common toolkits of educators (Schroeder, 2009). One of the main goals of the integration of traditional teaching methods with technology enhancements is the improvement of teaching and learning quality in large university courses with many students. But does utilizing a VLE automatically improve teaching and learning? In our experience, many teachers just upload existing files, like lecture slides, handouts and exercises, when starting to use a VLE. Thereby availability of learning resources is improved. For improving teaching and learning it could be helpful to create more motivating, challenging, and engaging learning materials and e.g., collaborative scenarios to improve learning among large groups of students. Teachers could e.g., use audio and video recordings of their lectures or provide interactive, demonstrative multimedia examples and quizzes. If they put effort in the design of such online learning activities, they need tools that help them observe the consequences of their actions and evaluate their teaching interventions. They need to have appropriate access to data to assess changing behaviors and performances of their students to estimate the level of improvement that has been achieved in the learning environment. With the establishment of TEL, a new research field, called Learning Analytics, is emerging (Elias, 2011). This research field borrows and synthesizes techniques from different related fields, such as Educational Data Mining (EDM), Academic Analytics, Social Network Analysis or Business Intelligence (BI), to harness them for converting educational data into useful information and thereon to motivate actions, like self-reflecting ones previous teaching or learning activities, to foster improved teaching and learning. The main goal of BI is to turn enterprise data into useful information for management decision support. However, Learning Analytics, Academic Analytics, as well as EDM more specifically focus on tools and methods for exploring data coming from educational contexts. While Academic Analytics take a university-wide perspective, including also e.g., organizational and financial issues (Campbell & Oblinger, 2007), Learning Analytics as well as EDM focus specifically on data about teaching and learning. Siemens (2010) defines Learning Analytics as \"the use of intelligent data, learner-produced data, and analysis models to discover information and social connections, and to predict and advise on learning.\" It can support teachers and students to take action based on the evaluation of educational data. However, the technology to deliver this potential is still very young and research on understanding the pedagogical usefulness of Learning Analytics is still in its infancy (Johnson et al., 2011b; Johnson et al., 2012). It is a current goal at RWTH Aachen University to enhance its VLE--the learning and teaching portal L2P (Gebhardt et al., 2007)--with user-friendly tools for Learning Analytics, in order to equip their teachers and tutors with means to evaluate the effectiveness of TEL within their instructional design and courses offered. These teachers still face difficulties, deterring them from integrating cyclical reflective research activities, comparable to Action Research, into everyday practice. Action Research is characterized by a continuing effort to closely interlink, relate and confront action and reflection, to reflect upon one's conscious and unconscious doings in order to develop one's actions, and to act reflectively in order to develop one's knowledge.\" (Altrichter et al., 2005, p. 6). A pre-eminent barrier is the additional workload, originating from tasks of collecting, integrating, and analyzing raw data from log files of their VLE (Altenbernd-Giani et al., 2009). To tackle these issues, we have developed the \"exploratory Learning Analytics Toolkit\" (eLAT). \u2026",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough bullying and delinquency share similar risk factors, no previous systematic review has ever been conducted to examine possible links between school bullying and criminal offending later in life.\n\n\nAIMS\nTo investigate the extent to which bullying perpetration at school predicts offending later in life, and whether this relation holds after controlling for other major childhood risk factors.\n\n\nMETHOD\nResults are based on a thorough systematic review and meta-analysis of studies measuring school bullying and later offending. Effect sizes are based on both published and unpublished studies; longitudinal investigators of 28 studies have conducted specific analyses for our review.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe probability of offending up to 11 years later was much higher for school bullies than for non-involved students [odds ratio (OR) = 2.50; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.03-3.08]. Bullying perpetration was a significant risk factor for later offending, even after controlling for major childhood risk factors (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.55-2.14). Effect sizes were smaller when the follow-up period was longer and larger when bullying was assessed in older children. The age of participants when outcome measures were taken was negatively related with effect sizes. Finally, the summary effect size did not decrease much as the number of controlled risk factors increased.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSchool bullying is a strong and specific risk factor for later offending. Effective anti-bullying programmes should be promoted, and could be viewed as a form of early crime prevention. Such programmes would have a high benefit : cost ratio.",

            "abstract": "Abstract In microducts deviation from continuum flow behaviour of a gas increases with rarefaction. When using Navier\u2013Stokes equations to calculate a flow under slightly and moderately rarefied conditions, slip boundary conditions are used which in turn refer to the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC). Here we demonstrate that, in the so-called slip and transition regime, the flow in microducts can be reliably described by a consistently non-empirical model without considering the TMAC. We obtain this equation by superposition of convective transport and Fickian diffusion using two-dimensional solutions of Navier\u2013Stokes equations and a description for the Knudsen diffusion coefficient as derived from kinetic theory respectively. For a wide variety of measurement series found in the literature the calculation predicts the data accurately. Surprisingly only size of the duct, temperature, gas properties and inlet and outlet pressure are necessary to calculate the resulting mass flow by means of a single algebraic equation. From this, and taking the discrepancies of the TMAC concerning surface roughness and nature of the gases into account, we could conclude that neither the diffusive proportions nor the total mass flow rates are influenced by surface topology and chemistry at Knudsen numbers below unity. Compared to the tube geometry, the model slightly underestimates the flow rate in rectangular channels when rarefaction increases. Likewise, the dimensionless mass flow rate and the diffusive proportion of the total flow are distinctly higher in a tube. Thus the cross-sectional geometry has a significant influence on the transport mechanisms under rarefied conditions.",

One of the major advantages is the possibility to control several system variables with a single control law, by including them with appropriate weighting factors. However, at the present state of the art, these coefficients are determined empirically. There is no analytical or numerical method proposed yet to obtain an optimal solution. In addition, the empirical method is not always straightforward, and no procedures have been reported. This paper presents a first approach to a set of guidelines that reduce the uncertainty of this process. First a classification of different types of cost functions and weighting factors is presented. Then the different steps of the empirical process are explained. Finally, results for several power converters and drives applications are analyzed, which show the effectiveness of the proposed guidelines to reach appropriate weighting factors and control performance.",

User generated content in the form of blog posts, comments, and tweets establishes a connection between the producers and the consumers of information. Tracking the pulse of the social media outlets, enables companies to gain feedback and insight in how to improve and market products better. For consumers, the abundance of information and opinions from diverse sources helps them tap into the wisdom of crowds, to aid in making more informed decisions. The present tutorial investigates techniques for social media modeling, analytics and optimization. First we present methods for collecting large scale social media data and then discuss techniques for coping with and correcting for the effects arising from missing and incomplete data. We proceed by discussing methods for extracting and tracking information as it spreads among the users. Then we examine methods for extracting temporal patterns by which information popularity grows and fades over time. We show how to quantify and maximize the influence of media outlets on the popularity and attention given to particular piece of content, and how to build predictive models of information diffusion and adoption.
