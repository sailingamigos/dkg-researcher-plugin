            "abstract": "Online social media represent a fundamental shift of how information is being produced, transferred and consumed. User generated content in the form of blog posts, comments, and tweets establishes a connection between the producers and the consumers of information. Tracking the pulse of the social media outlets, enables companies to gain feedback and insight in how to improve and market products better. For consumers, the abundance of information and opinions from diverse sources helps them tap into the wisdom of crowds, to aid in making more informed decisions. The present tutorial investigates techniques for social media modeling, analytics and optimization. First we present methods for collecting large scale social media data and then discuss techniques for coping with and correcting for the effects arising from missing and incomplete data. We proceed by discussing methods for extracting and tracking information as it spreads among the users. Then we examine methods for extracting temporal patterns by which information popularity grows and fades over time. We show how to quantify and maximize the influence of media outlets on the popularity and attention given to particular piece of content, and how to build predictive models of information diffusion and adoption. As the information often spreads through implicit social and information networks we present methods for inferring networks of influence and diffusion. Last, we discuss methods for tracking the flow of sentiment through networks and emergence of polarization.",

While recent work has focused on accurately modeling disease spread, less work has been performed in developing interactive decision support tools for analyzing the future course of the outbreak and evaluating potential disease mitigation strategies. The absence of such tools makes it difficult for researchers, analysts and public health officials to evaluate response measures within outbreak scenarios. As such, our research focuses on the development of an interactive decision support environment in which users can explore epidemic models and their impact. This environment provides a spatiotemporal view where users can interactively utilize mitigative response measures and observe the impact of their decision over time. Our system also provides users with a linked decision history visualization and navigation tool that support the simultaneous comparison of mortality and infection rates corresponding to different response measures at different points in time.",

COMPAS's automated scoring provides decision support for correctional agencies for placement decisions, offender management, and treatment planning. The article describes the basic features of COMPAS and then examines the predictive validity of the COMPAS risk scales by fitting Cox proportional hazards models to recidivism outcomes in a sample of presentence investigation and probation intake cases (N = 2,328). Results indicate that the predictive validities for the COMPAS recidivism risk model, as assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), equal or exceed similar 4G instruments. The AUCs ranged from .66 to .80 for diverse offender subpopulations across three outcome criteria, with a majority of these exceeding .70.",

Instead of the constant velocity fluid-flow or the random-walk mobility model, a more realistic Gauss-Markov model is introduced, where a mobile's velocity is correlated in time to a various degree. Based on the Gauss-Markov model, a mobile's future location is predicted by the network based on the information gathered from the mobile's last report of location and velocity. When a call is made, the network pages the destination mobile at and around the predicted location of the mobile and in the order of descending probability until the mobile is found. A mobile shares the same prediction information with the network and reports its new location whenever it reaches some threshold distance away from the predicted location. We describe an analytical framework to evaluate the cost of mobility management for the proposed predictive distance-based scheme. We then compare this cost against that of the regular, non-predictive distance-based scheme, which is obtained through simulations. Performance advantage of the proposed scheme is demonstrated under various mobility and call patterns, update cost, page cost, and frequencies of mobile location inspections.",

This paper provides a meta-analytic review of the grit literature with a particular focus on the structure of grit and the relation between grit and performance, retention, conscientiousness, cognitive ability, and demographic variables. Our results based on 584 effect sizes from 88 independent samples representing 66,807 individuals indicate that the higher order structure of grit is not confirmed, that grit is only moderately correlated with performance and retention, and that grit is very strongly correlated with conscientiousness. We also find that the perseverance of effort facet has significantly stronger criterion validities than the consistency of interest facet and that perseverance of effort explains variance in academic performance even after controlling for conscientiousness. In aggregate our results suggest that interventions designed to enhance grit may only have weak effects on performance and success, that the construct validity of grit is in question, and that the primary utility of the grit construct may lie in the perseverance facet.",

            "abstract": "More than 4 decades of research and 9 meta-analyses have focused on the undermining effect: namely, the debate over whether the provision of extrinsic incentives erodes intrinsic motivation. This review and meta-analysis builds on such previous reviews by focusing on the interrelationship among intrinsic motivation, extrinsic incentives, and performance, with reference to 2 moderators: performance type (quality vs. quantity) and incentive contingency (directly performance-salient vs. indirectly performance-salient), which have not been systematically reviewed to date. Based on random-effects meta-analytic methods, findings from school, work, and physical domains (k = 183, N = 212,468) indicate that intrinsic motivation is a medium to strong predictor of performance (\u03c1 = .21-45). The importance of intrinsic motivation to performance remained in place whether incentives were presented. In addition, incentive salience influenced the predictive validity of intrinsic motivation for performance: In a \"crowding out\" fashion, intrinsic motivation was less important to performance when incentives were directly tied to performance and was more important when incentives were indirectly tied to performance. Considered simultaneously through meta-analytic regression, intrinsic motivation predicted more unique variance in quality of performance, whereas incentives were a better predictor of quantity of performance. With respect to performance, incentives and intrinsic motivation are not necessarily antagonistic and are best considered simultaneously. Future research should consider using nonperformance criteria (e.g., well-being, job satisfaction) as well as applying the percent-of-maximum-possible (POMP) method in meta-analyses.",

Predicting the stability of the perovskite structure remains a long-standing challenge for the discovery of new functional materials for many applications including photovoltaics and electrocatalysts. We developed an accurate, physically interpretable, and one-dimensional tolerance factor, \u03c4, that correctly predicts 92% of compounds as perovskite or nonperovskite for an experimental dataset of 576 ABX3 materials (X = O2\u2212, F\u2212, Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, I\u2212) using a novel data analytics approach based on SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator). \u03c4 is shown to generalize outside the training set for 1034 experimentally realized single and double perovskites (91% accuracy) and is applied to identify 23,314 new double perovskites (A2BB\u2032X6) ranked by their probability of being stable as perovskite. This work guides experimentalists and theorists toward which perovskites are most likely to be successfully synthesized and demonstrates an approach to descriptor identification that can be extended to arbitrary applications beyond perovskite stability predictions.",

Data from 1,753 independent samples were included in the meta-analysis, yielding 6,589 correlations for 8 different criteria and 82,659 graduate students. The results indicated that the GRE and UGPA are generalizably valid predictors of graduate grade point average, 1st-year graduate grade point average, comprehensive examination scores, publication citation counts, and faculty ratings. GRE correlations with degree attainment and research productivity were consistently positive; however, some lower 90% credibility intervals included 0. Subject Tests tended to be better predictors than the Verbal, Quantitative, and Analytical tests.",

Model extrapolation was considered if only in hypothetical sense in terms of potential modifications of known biologically active chemicals that could improve compounds' activity. This critical review re-examines the strategy and the output of the modern QSAR modeling approaches. We provide examples and arguments suggesting that current methodologies may afford robust and validated models capable of accurate prediction of compound properties for molecules not included in the training sets. We discuss a data-analytical modeling workflow developed in our laboratory that incorporates modules for combinatorial QSAR model development (i.e., using all possible binary combinations of available descriptor sets and statistical data modeling techniques), rigorous model validation, and virtual screening of available chemical databases to identify novel biologically active compounds. Our approach places particular emphasis on model validation as well as the need to define model applicability domains in the chemistry space. We present examples of studies where the application of rigorously validated QSAR models to virtual screening identified computational hits that were confirmed by subsequent experimental investigations. The emerging focus of QSAR modeling on target property forecasting brings it forward as predictive, as opposed to evaluative, modeling approach.",

This article presents a meta-analysis of 89 empirical studies that explore the impact of predictive factors (e.g., trainee characteristics, work environment, training interventions) on the transfer of training to different tasks and contexts. We also examine moderator effects of the relationships between these predictors and transfer. Results confirmed positive relationships between transfer and predictors such as cognitive ability, conscientiousness, motivation, and a supportive work environment. Several moderators had significant effects on transfer relationships, including the nature of the training objectives. Specifically, most predictor variables examined (e.g., motivation, work environment) had stronger relationships to transfer when the focus of training was on open (e.g., leadership development) as opposed to closed (e.g., computer software) skills. Other moderators related to the measurement of transfer also influenced transfer relationships, including situations in which transfer outcomes were obtained by the same source in the same measurement context\u2014 which consistently inflated transfer relationships. Findings are discussed in terms of their relevance for future research and training practice.",

The chemical and physical processes associated with SOA formation are complex and varied, and, despite considerable progress in recent years, a quantitative and predictive understanding of SOA formation does not exist and therefore represents a major research challenge in atmospheric science. This review begins with an update on the current state of knowledge on the global SOA budget and is followed by an overview of the atmospheric degradation mechanisms for SOA precursors, gas-particle partitioning theory and the analytical techniques used to determine the chemical composition of SOA. A survey of recent laboratory, field and modeling studies is also presented. The following topical and emerging issues are highlighted and discussed in detail: molecular characterization of biogenic SOA constituents, condensed phase reactions and oligomerization, the interaction of atmospheric organic components with sulfuric acid, the chemical and photochemical processing of organics in the atmospheric aqueous phase, aerosol formation from real plant emissions, interaction of atmospheric organic components with water, thermodynamics and mixtures in atmospheric models. Finally, the major challenges ahead in laboratory, field and modeling studies of SOA are discussed and recommendations for future research directions are proposed.",

Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. The authors sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. Method. The authors describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. They start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the \u201cdecision curve.\u201d The authors apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal. Conclusion. Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.",

            "abstract": "A new and relatively simple equation for the soil-water content-pressure head curve, 8(h), is described in this paper. The particular form of the equation enables one to derive closedform analytical expressions for the relative hydraulic conductivity, Kr, when substituted in the predictive conductivity models of N.T. Burdine or Y. Mualem. The resulting expressions for Kr(h) contain three independent parameters which may be obtained by fitting the proposed soil-water retention model to experimental data. Results obtained with the closed-form analytical expressions based on the Mualem theory are compared with observed hydraulic conductivity data for five soils with a wide range of hydraulic properties. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is predicted well in four out of five cases. It is found that a reasonable description of the soil-water retention curve at low water contents is important for an accurate prediction of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.

Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 44:892-898. T USE OF NUMERICAL MODELS for simulating fluid flow and mass transport in the unsaturated zone has become increasingly popular the last few years. Recent literature indeed demonstrates that much effort is put into the development of such models (Reeves and Duguid, 1975; Segol, 1976; Vauclin et al., 1979). Unfortunately, it appears that the ability to fully characterize the simulated system has not kept pace with the numerical and modeling expertise. Probably the single most important factor limiting the successful application of unsaturated flow theory to actual field problems is the lack of information regarding the parameters entering the governing transfer equations. Reliable estimates of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are especially difficult to obtain, partly because of its extensive variability in the field, and partly because measuring this parameter is time-consuming and expensive. Several investigators have, for these reasons, used models for calculating the unsaturated conductivity from the more easily measured soil-water retention curve. Very popular among these models has been the Millington-Quirk method (Millington and Quirk, 1961), various forms of which have been applied with some success in a number of studies (cf. Jackson et al., 1965; Jackson, 1972; Green and Corey, 1971; Bruce, 1972). Unfortunately, this method has the disadvantage of producing tabular results which, for example when applied to nonhomogeneous soils in multidimensional unsaturated flow models, are quite tedious to use. Closed-form analytical expressions for predicting 1 Contribution from the U. S. Salinity Laboratory, AR-SEA, USDA, Riverside, CA 92501. Received 29 June 1979. Approved 19 May I960.

Salinity Lab., 4500 Glenwood Dr., Riverside, CA 92502. the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity have also been developed. For example, Brooks and Corey (1964) and Jeppson (1974) each used an analytical expression for the conductivity based on the Burdine theory (Burdine, 1953). Brooks and Corey (1964, 1966) obtained fairly accurate predictions with their equations, even though a discontinuity is present in the slope of both the soil-water retention curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve at some negative value of the pressure head (this point is often referred to as the bubbling pressure). Such a discontinuity sometimes prevents rapid convergence in numerical saturated-unsaturated flow problems. It also appears that predictions based on the Brooks and Corey equations are somewhat less accurate than those obtained with various forms of the (modified) Millington-Quirk method. Recently Mualem (1976a) derived a new model for predicting the hydraulic conductivity from knowledge of the soil-water retention curve and the conductivity at saturation. Mualem's derivation leads to a simple integral formula for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which enables one to derive closed-form analytical expressions, provided suitable equations for the soil-water retention curves are available. It is the purpose of this paper to derive such expressions using an equation for the soil-water retention curve which is both continuous and has a continuous slope. The resulting conductivity models generally contain three independent parameters which may be obtained by matching the proposed soil-water retention curve to experimental data. Results obtained with the closedform equations based on the Mualem theory will be compared with observed data for a few soils having widely varying hydraulic properties. THEORETICAL Equations Based on Mualem's Model The following equation was derived by Mualem (1976a) for predicting the relative hydraulic conductivity (Kr) from knowledge of the soil-water retention curve",

The model may consist of only a few assertions or it may be a rigorously developed argument. In each case, the method of evaluation has been to compare existing practices with the more preferable practices implied by the model or with some standard which the model implies all practices should possess. The shortcoming of this method is that it ignores a significant source of knowledge of the world, namely, the extent to which the predictions of the model conform to observed behavior. It is not enough to defend an analytical inquiry on the basis that its assumptions are empirically supportable, for how is one to know that a theory embraces all of the relevant supportable assumptions? And how does one explain the predictive powers of propositions which are based on unverifiable assumptions such as the maximization of utility functions? Further, how is one to resolve differences between propositions which arise from considering different aspects of the world? The limitations of a completely analytical approach to usefulness are illustrated by the argument that income numbers cannot be defined substantively, that they lack \"meaning\" and are therefore of doubtful utility.' The argument stems in part from the patchwork development of account-",

The emphasis is on packaging assemblies and structures and on simple meaningful practical models that can be (and actually have been) used in the mechanical (\u201cphysical\u201d) design and reliability evaluations of electronic, opto-electronic, and photonic assemblies, structures, and systems. We indicate the role, objectives, attributes, merits, and shortcomings of analytical modeling and discuss its interaction with finite-element analysis (FEA) simulations and experimental techniques. Significant attention is devoted to the physics of the addressed problems and the rationale behind the described models. The addressed topics include (1) the pioneering Timoshenko\u2019s analysis of bimetal thermostats and its extension for bimaterial assemblies of finite size and with consideration of the role of the bonding layer of finite compliance; this situation is typical for assemblies employed in electronics and photonics; (2) thermal stresses and strains in solder joints and interconnections; (3) attributes of the \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d thermal expansion (contraction) mismatch and the interaction of the induced stresses; (4) thermal stress in assemblies adhesively bonded at the ends and in assemblies (structural elements) with a low-modulus bonding layer at the ends (for lower interfacial stresses); (5) thin film systems; (6) thermal stress induced bow and bow-free assemblies subjected to the change in temperature; (7) predicted thermal stresses in, and the bow of, plastic packages of integrated circuit devices, with an emphasis on moisture-sensitive packages; (8) thermal stress in coated optical fibers and some other photonic structures; and (9) mechanical behavior of assemblies with thermally matched components (adherends). We formulate some general design recommendations for adhesively bonded or soldered assemblies subjected to thermal loading and indicate an incentive for a wider use of probabilistic methods in physical design for reliability of \u201chigh-technology\u201d assemblies, including those subjected to thermal loading. Finally, we briefly address the role of thermal stress modeling in composite nanomaterials and nanostructures. It is concluded that analytical modeling should be used, whenever possible, along with computer-aided simulations (FEA) and accelerated life testing, in any significant engineering effort, when there is a need to analyze and design, in a fast, inexpensive, and insightful way, a viable, reliable, and cost-effective electronic, opto-electronic, or photonic assembly, package, or system.",

The principle of predictive control is adopted to overcome the effects of network time delay. The necessary and sufficient conditions on the stability of the closed-loop NCS are derived, which provides useful analytical stability criteria. The closed-loop networked predictive control system with bounded random network delay is stable if the corresponding switched system is stable. Simulation and real-time results give an illustration of the proposed control strategies",

Hofstede's (1980a) original 4 cultural value dimensions and a variety of organizationally relevant outcomes. First, values predict outcomes with similar strength (with an overall absolute weighted effect size of rho = 0.18) at the individual level of analysis. Second, the predictive power of the cultural values was significantly lower than that of personality traits and demographics for certain outcomes (e.g., job performance, absenteeism, turnover) but was significantly higher for others (e.g., organizational commitment, identification, citizenship behavior, team-related attitudes, feedback seeking). Third, cultural values were most strongly related to emotions, followed by attitudes, then behaviors, and finally job performance. Fourth, cultural values were more strongly related to outcomes for managers (rather than students) and for older, male, and more educated respondents. Fifth, findings were stronger for primary, rather than secondary, data. Finally, we provide support for M. Gelfand, L. H. Nishii, and J. L. Raver's (2006) conceptualization of societal tightness-looseness, finding significantly stronger effects in culturally tighter, rather than looser, countries.",

            "abstract": "Many real-world analytics problems involve two significant challenges: prediction and optimization. Because of the typically complex nature of each challenge, the standard paradigm is predict-then-optimize. By and large, machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization problem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart \u201cPredict, then Optimize\u201d (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure\u2014that is, its objective and constraints\u2014for designing better prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function, which measures the decision error induced by a prediction. Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally challenging, and, thus, we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss function, which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+ loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex, or even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical experiments on shortest-path and portfolio-optimization problems show that the SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the predict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular, when the prediction model being trained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss tend to dominate random-forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly nonlinear. This paper was accepted by Yinyu Ye, optimization.",

            "abstract": "According to learning\u2010based models of behavior, food cue reactivity and craving are conditioned responses that lead to increased eating and subsequent weight gain. However, evidence supporting this relationship has been mixed. We conducted a quantitative meta\u2010analysis to assess the predictive effects of food cue reactivity and craving on eating and weight\u2010related outcomes. Across 69 reported statistics from 45 published reports representing 3,292 participants, we found an overall medium effect of food cue reactivity and craving on outcomes (r\u2009=\u20090.33, p\u2009<\u20090.001; approximately 11% of variance), suggesting that cue exposure and the experience of craving significantly influence and contribute to eating behavior and weight gain. Follow\u2010up tests revealed a medium effect size for the effect of both tonic and cue\u2010induced craving on eating behavior (r\u2009=\u20090.33). We did not find significant differences in effect sizes based on body mass index, age, or dietary restraint. However, we did find that visual food cues (e.g. pictures and videos) were associated with a similar effect size to real food exposure and a stronger effect size than olfactory cues. Overall, the present findings suggest that food cue reactivity, cue\u2010induced craving and tonic craving systematically and prospectively predict food\u2010related outcomes. These results have theoretical, methodological, public health and clinical implications.",

However. PMT remains the only major cognitive model of behavior not to have been the subject of a meta-analytic review. A quantitative review of PMT is important to assess its overall utility as a predictive model and to establish which of its variables would be most useful to address health-education interventions. The present paper provides a comprehensive introduction to PMT and its application to health-related behavior, together with a quantitative review of the applications of PMT to health-related intentions and behavior. The associations between threat- and coping-appraisal variables and intentions, and all components of the model and behavior were assessed both by meta-analysis and by vote-count procedures. Threat- and coping-appraisal components of PMT were found to be useful in the prediction of health-related intentions. The model was found to be useful in predicting concurrent behavior, but of less utility in predicting future behavior. The coping-appraisal component of the model was found to have greater predictive validity than was the threat-appraisal component. The main findings are discussed in relation to theory and research on social cognition models. The importance of the main findings to health education is also discussed, and future research directions are suggested.",

            "abstract": "A thermodynamic treatment of surfactant self-assembly in aqueous media is developed that allows an a priori quantitative prediction of the aggregation behavior of surfactants, starting from their molecular structures and the solution conditions. The treatment combines the general thermodynamic principles of self-assembly with detailed molecular models for various contributions to the free energy of aggregation. The treatment is employed to predict the aggregation behavior of surfactants that generate narrowly dispersed, small, spherical or globular aggregates; the transition from spherical to large, polydispersed, rodlike aggregates; the aggregation behavior of surfactants containing polymeric head groups such as the widely used poly(oxyethy1ene)-type nonionic surfactants; the solubilization of hydrophobic molecules in aggregates; the solubilization-induced transition from rodlike to spherical aggregates; the solubilization of binary mixtures of hydrocarbons; and the temperature dependence of micellization and solubilization. For illustrative purposes, calculated results concerning nonionic, zwitterionic, and ionic surfactants are presented and compared with experimental results generated by more than 20 different laboratories. The calculations show that, as a result of solubilization, microemulsion structures are formed with a single surfactant. However, the core of the solubilizate in these structures is rather small. In developing a molecular model for the free energy of aggregation, we consider contributions arising from (i) the transfer of the surfactant tail from water into the hydrophobic core of the aggregate assumed to behave like a liquid hydrocarbon, (ii) the conformational free energy of the tails inside the aggregates due to the constrained location of the head groups on the aggregate surface, (iii) the free energy of formation of the aggregatewater interface, and (iv) the interactions between the head groups of the surfactant at the aggregate surface. In the case of solubilization, the free energy of mixing of the solubilizates with the surfactants also makes a contribution. Expressions for each of the above free energy contributions are derived here. The transfer free energy is expressed as an explicit function of temperature. Analytical free energy expressions are derived for the dependence of the conformational free energy of the surfactant tails inside the aggregates as a function of the size and shape of aggregates. The interfacial tension characteristic of the aggregate-water interface is calculated using the Prigogine theory when more than two distinct molecular species are present as in the case of micellization involving poly(oxyethy1ene) surfactants and for the case of solubilization of one or more additives into the aggregates. The interactions among the poly(oxyethylene) head groups in nonionic surfactants are calculated on the basis of two limiting models which differ from one another in the description of the mixing and elastic deformation free energies of the poly(oxyethy1ene)-water region surrounding the aggregates. Also, the head group interactions between ionic Surfactants are calculated using an approximate analytical solution for the Poisson-Boltzmann equation available in the literature. The thermodynamic treatment developed here is strictly predictive in the sense that it is free of information extracted from the aggregation behavior of surfactants. In addition, no arbitrary or empirical factors are involved. The only parameters that appear are molecular constants that can be reasonably determined on the basis of known molecular structures and properties.",

Implicit attitudes were measured using the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Study 1 showed expected differences in implicit attitudes between users of two leading yogurt brands, also revealing significant correlations between IAT-measured implicit attitudes and explicit attitudes. In Study 2, users of two fast food restaurants (McDonald's and Milk Bar) showed implicit attitudi-nal preference for their favorite restaurant. In Study 3, implicit attitudes of users of two soft drinks (Coca-Cola and Pepsi) predicted brand preference, product usage, and brand recognition in a blind taste test. A meta-analytic combination of the three studies showed that the use of IAT measures increased the prediction of behavior relative to explicit attitude measures alone.",

It is parametric - basic machine performance numbers (latency, MFLOPS rate, bandwidth) and application characteristics (problem size, decomposition method, etc.) serve as input. The model is applied to add insight into the performance of current systems, to reveal bottlenecks, and to illustrate where tuning efforts can be effective. We also use the model to predict performance on future systems.",

Here we consider the problem of choosing amongst a finite (with loss of generality we assume two) set of models. After briefly reviewing classical and Bayesian model choice strategies we present a general predictive density which includes all proposed Bayesian approaches we are aware of. Using Laplace approximations we can conveniently assess and compare asymptotic behavior of these approaches. Concern regarding the accuracy of these approximation for small to moderate sample sizes encourages the use of Monte Carlo techniques to carry out exact calculations. A data set fit with nested non linear models enables comparison between proposals and between exact and asymptotic values.",

The modeling approach is based on the work material constitutive model, which depends on strain, strain rate, and temperature. In thermal modeling, oblique moving band heat source theory is utilized and analytically combined with modified Oxley's parallel shear zone theory. Normal stress distribution on the tool rake face is modeled as nonuniform with a power-law relationship. Hence, nonuniform heat intensity at the tool-chip interface is obtained from the predicted stress distributions utilizing slip line field analysis of the modified secondary shear zone. Heat sources from shearing in the primary zone and friction at the tool-chip interface are combined, heat partition ratios are determined for temperature equilibrium to obtain temperature distributions depending on cutting conditions. Model validation is performed by comparing some experimental results with the predictions for machining of AISI 1045 steel, AL 6082-T6, and AL 6061-T6 aluminum. Close agreements with the experiments are observed. A set of detailed, analytically computed stress and temperature distributions is presented.",

We conducted meta-analyses of the effect sizes of 9 commonly used risk assessment tools and their subscales to compare their predictive efficacies for violence. The effect sizes were extracted from 28 original reports published between 1999 and 2008, which assessed the predictive accuracy of more than one tool. We used a within-subject design to improve statistical power and multilevel regression models to disentangle random effects of variation between studies and tools and to adjust for study features. All 9 tools and their subscales predicted violence at about the same moderate level of predictive efficacy with the exception of Psychopathy Checklist--Revised (PCL-R) Factor 1, which predicted violence only at chance level among men. Approximately 25% of the total variance was due to differences between tools, whereas approximately 85% of heterogeneity between studies was explained by methodological features (age, length of follow-up, different types of violent outcome, sex, and sex-related interactions). Sex-differentiated efficacy was found for a small number of the tools. If the intention is only to predict future violence, then the 9 tools are essentially interchangeable; the selection of which tool to use in practice should depend on what other functions the tool can perform rather than on its efficacy in predicting violence. The moderate level of predictive accuracy of these tools suggests that they should not be used solely for some criminal justice decision making that requires a very high level of accuracy such as preventive detention.",

However, in recent years some prominent nonreplications of the EE-relapse relationship have been published. To more fully address the question of the predictive validity of EE, we conducted a meta-analysis of all available EE and outcome studies in schizophrenia. We also examined the predictive validity of the EE construct for mood disorders and eating disorders.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn extensive literature search revealed 27 studies of the EE-outcome relationship in schizophrenia. Using meta-analytic procedures, we combined the findings of these investigations to provide an estimate of the effect size associated with the EE-relapse relationship. We also used meta-analysis to provide estimates of the effect sizes associated with EE for mood and eating disorders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results confirmed that EE is a significant and robust predictor of relapse in schizophrenia. Additional analyses demonstrated that the EE-relapse relationship was strongest for patients with more chronic schizophrenic illness. Interestingly, although the EE construct is most closely associated with research in schizophrenia, the mean effect sizes for EE for both mood disorders and eating disorders were significantly higher than the mean effect size for schizophrenia.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings highlight the importance of EE in the understanding and prevention of relapse in a broad range of psychopathological conditions.",

We give equations for slides and slumps, along with some cautions about their appropriate use. We further discuss results obtained here and in Part I and their practical application to case studies. We show that initial acceleration is the primary parameter describing SMF center of mass motion during tsunami generation. We explain an apparent paradox, raised in Part I, in slump center of mass motion, whereby the distance traveled is proportional to shear strength along the failure plane. We stress that the usefulness of predictive equations depends on the quality of the parameters they rely on. Parameter ranges are discussed in the paper, and we propose a method to estimate slump motion and shear strength and discuss SMF thickness to length values, for case studies. We derive the analytical tools needed to characterize SMF tsunami sources in propagation models. Specifically, we quantify three-dimensional (3D) effects on tsunami characteristic amplitude, and we propose an analytical method to specify initial 3D tsunami elevations, shortly after tsunami generation, in long wave tsunami propagation models. This corresponds to treating SMF tsunami sources like coseismic displacement tsunami sources. We conduct four case studies of SMF tsunamis and show that our predictive equations can provide rapid rough estimates of overall tsunami observations that might be useful in crisis situations, when time is too short to run propagation models. Thus, for each case, we show that the characteristic tsunami amplitude is a reasonable predictor of maximum runup in actual 3D geometry. We refer to the latter observation as the correspondence principle, which we propose to apply for rapid tsunami hazard assessment, in combination with the predictive tsunami amplitude equations.",

First, we extended the Ferris et al. meta-theoretical framework of political skill. Next, incorporating meta-analysis, we found political skill is positively related to self-efficacy, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, work productivity, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), career success, and personal reputation, and negatively related to physiological strain. Political skill was not significantly related to psychological strain or perceptions of organizational politics. Using meta-regression and dominance analyses, political skill predicted task performance after controlling for the Big Five personality characteristics and general mental ability. In a test of indirect relationships, our results suggest that personal reputation and self-efficacy partially mediate the political skill\u2013task performance relationship. Finally, in a post hoc test of political skill dimensions, we found that networking ability, interpersonal influence, and apparent sincerity (but not social astuteness) predicted task performance. Our findings provide a comprehensive assessment of theory and research to date on political skill and extend theoretical foundations to stimulate new inquiry into the operation of this important construct.",

These include suppressing aggressive control action and conditioning the system matrix prior to inversion. The work presented here exploits this dual effect in deriving an analytical expression that computes appropriate move suppression coefficients as a function of process model parameters, other MPC design parameters, and partitioned block condition numbers of the system matrix. The development is based upon an approximate mosaic Hankel matrix structure of the multivariable system matrix. The primary contribution of this work is the derivation of the analytical expression for computing move suppression coefficients and its demonstration in an overall MPC tuning strategy (Table 1). The examples presented show that the move suppression coefficient remains properly scaled as the other MPC design parameters and process characteristics change to produce a consistent closed loop performance. This tuning m...",

In previous work this has been achieved by an analytic solution which is not valid if there are constraints on the input control signals. A simple extension is proposed which caters for rate or amplitude limits, and simulations show the corresponding improvements in closed-loop performance that can be achieved. A common problem, in practice, is the effect of torque saturation in DC motor drives: results from a compliant link, where the control sample-rate is 60Hz, show that the proposed method overcomes this and is also computationally acceptable. Bang-bang control, a limiting case of constrained inputs, is also treated within the GPC framework",

Our approach approximates full posterior distributions over model parameters and structures, as well as latent variables, in an analytical manner. These posteriors fall out of a free-form optimization procedure, which naturally incorporates conjugate priors. Unlike in large sample approximations, the posteriors are generally non-Gaussian and no Hessian needs to be computed. Predictive quantities are obtained analytically. The resulting algorithm generalizes the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm, and its convergence is guaranteed. We demonstrate that this approach can be applied to a large class of models in several domains, including mixture models and source separation.",

The update of filtering and predictive densities for nonlinear models with non-Gaussian noise using Monte Carlo particle filtering methods is considered. The Gaussian particle filter (GPF) is introduced, where densities are approximated as a single Gaussian, an assumption which is also made in the extended Kalman filter (EKF). It is analytically shown that, if the Gaussian approximations hold true, the GPF minimizes the mean square error of the estimates asymptotically. The simulations results indicate that the filter has improved performance compared to the EKF, especially for highly nonlinear models where the EKF can diverge.",

Although SDO works well as a unitary construct, some analyses suggest it might consist of two complementary dimensions\u2014SDO-Dominance (SDO-D), or the preference for some groups to dominate others, and SDO-Egalitarianism (SDO-E), a preference for nonegalitarian intergroup relations. Using seven samples from the United States and Israel, the authors confirm factor-analytic evidence and show predictive validity for both dimensions. In the United States, SDO-D was theorized and found to be more related to old-fashioned racism, zero-sum competition, and aggressive intergroup phenomena than SDO-E; SDO-E better predicted more subtle legitimizing ideologies, conservatism, and opposition to redistributive social policies. In a contentious hierarchical intergroup context (the Israeli\u2013Palestinian context), SDO-D better predicted both conservatism and aggressive intergroup attitudes. Fundamentally, these analyses begin to establish the existence of complementary psychological orientations underlying the preference for group-based dominance and inequality.",

Overall, the results suggest that hostility is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). For structured interview indicators of potential for hostility, the weighted mean r was .18. After controlling for other risk factors for CHD, the widely used Cook-Medley Hostility Scale and other cognitive-experiential measures were most predictive of all-cause mortality (weighted mean r = .16) and, to a lesser extent, CHD (weighted mean r = .08). Similar to other areas of research, the increased use of high-risk studies in recent years produced an increase in null findings.",

The tuning strategy achieves set point tracking with minimal overshoot and modest manipulated input move sizes and is applicable to a broad class of open loop stable processes. The derivation of an analytical expression for the move suppression coefficient, \u03bb, and its demonstration in a DMC tuning strategy is one of the significant contributions of this work. The compact form for the analytical expression for \u03bb is achieved by employing a first order plus dead time (FOPDT) model approximation of the process dynamics. With tuning parameters computed, DMC is then implemented in the classical fashion using a dynamic matrix formulated from step response coefficients of the actual process. Just as the FOPDT model approximation has proved a valuable tool in tuning rules such as Cohen\u2212Coon, ITAE, and IAE for PID implementations, the tunin...",

Such auditing procedures can be classified into two broad types: tests of details of transactions and balances and analytical review procedures applied to financial information. An analytical review involves the study and comparison of relationships among data. One use of analytical review is to predict or identify the need for other auditing procedures such as extensive tests of details. The effectiveness and efficiency of analytical review in the predictive mode depends upon (1) the presence of accounting error, and (2) the ability of the procedure to detect the error. There appears to be no published work on the distributions of auditor-initiated adjustments and very limited work on the effectiveness and efficiency of analytical review in predicting such adjustments. In this paper, I present distributional statistics on auditor-initiated adjustments for a sample of small manufacturing firms. I also present prediction results for widely applicable analytical review procedures which use limited and readily available information.",

Because personality-performance relationship meta-analyses have focused almost exclusively on the Big Five, the predictive power of narrow traits has not been adequately examined. In this study, the authors address this question by meta-analytically examining the degree to which the narrow traits of conscientiousness predict above and beyond global conscientiousness. Results suggest that narrow traits do incrementally predict performance above and beyond global conscientiousness, yet the degree to which they contribute depends on the particular performance criterion and occupation in question. Overall, the results of this study suggest that there are benefits to considering the narrow traits of conscientiousness in the prediction of performance.",

Individual, relationship, and external variables were investigated, and results suggest that commitment, love, inclusion of other in the self, and dependence were among the strongest predictors of dissolution. Other relational variables such as satisfaction, perceptions of alternatives, and investments were modest predictors of breakup, and the external factor of social network support was also a robust predictor. Personality measures were found to have limited predictive utility, with small effects found for dimensions relational in nature (e.g., adult attachment orientations). Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed within the context of future research on nonmarital relationship dissolution.",

First, we distinguished between extant safety climate-->injury and injury-->safety climate relationships for both organizational and psychological safety climates. Second, we examined several potential moderators of these relationships. Meta-analyses revealed that injuries were more predictive of organizational safety climate than safety climate was predictive of injuries. Additionally, the injury-->safety climate relationship was stronger for organizational climate than for psychological climate. Moderator analyses revealed that the degree of content contamination in safety climate measures inflated effects, whereas measurement deficiency attenuated effects. Additionally, moderator analyses showed that as the time period over which injuries were assessed lengthened, the safety climate-->injury relationship was attenuated. Supplemental meta-analyses of specific safety climate dimensions also revealed that perceived management commitment to safety is the most robust predictor of occupational injuries. Contrary to expectations, the operationalization of injuries did not meaningfully moderate safety climate-injury relationships. Implications and recommendations for future research and practice are discussed.",

In this paper we argue that MOOCs which have open entry and open curriculum structures, place pressure on learners to not only have the requisite knowledge and skills to complete the course, but also the skills to traverse the course in adaptive ways that lead to success. The empirical study presented in the paper investigated the degree to which students' prior knowledge and skills, and their engagement with the MOOC as measured through learning analytics, predict end-of-MOOC performance. The findings indicate that prior knowledge is the most significant predictor of MOOC success followed by students' ability to revise and revisit their previous work.",

Our findings suggest that coaching has stronger effects on eliciting relationship outcomes with the coachee than goal-attainment outcomes. Moreover, of the goal-attainment outcomes, coaching has the strongest effect on behavioural changes as opposed to attitudinal changes. Sample type, study design, background of the coach, and number of coaching sessions all emerged as significant moderators. Implications of these findings are discussed.",

A methodology of growing interest is first to estimate common factors from the panel of data by the method of principal components and then to augment an otherwise standard regression with the estimated factors. In this paper, we show that the least squares estimates obtained from these factor-augmented regressions are root-T consistent and asymptotically normal if root(T)/N -> 0. The conditional mean predicted by the estimated factors is min(root(T),root(N)) consistent and asymptotically normal. Except when T/N goes to zero, inference should take into account the effect of \"estimated regressors\" on the estimated conditional mean. We present analytical formulas for prediction intervals that are valid regardless of the magnitude of N/T and that can also be used when the factors are nonstationary.

Accordingly, much psychological research has focused on identifying predictors of academic performance, with intelligence and effort emerging as core determinants. In this article, we propose expanding on the traditional set of predictors by adding a third agency: intellectual curiosity. A series of path models based on a meta-analytically derived correlation matrix showed that (a) intelligence is the single most powerful predictor of academic performance; (b) the effects of intelligence on academic performance are not mediated by personality traits; (c) intelligence, Conscientiousness (as marker of effort), and Typical Intellectual Engagement (as marker of intellectual curiosity) are direct, correlated predictors of academic performance; and (d) the additive predictive effect of the personality traits of intellectual curiosity and effort rival that the influence of intelligence. Our results highlight that a \u201chungry mind\u201d is a core determinant of individual differences in academic achievement.",

In principle, ecologists should be able to identify a small number of limiting resources for a species of interest, estimate densities of these resources at different locations across the landscape, and then use these estimates to predict the density of the focal species at these locations. In practice, however, development of functional relationships between abundances of species and their resources has proven extremely difficult, and examples of such predictive ability are very rare. Ecological studies of prey requirements of tigers Panthera tigris led us to develop a simple mechanistic model for predicting tiger density as a function of prey density. We tested our model using data from a landscape-scale long-term (1995-2003) field study that estimated tiger and prey densities in 11 ecologically diverse sites across India. We used field techniques and analytical methods that specifically addressed sampling and detectability, two issues that frequently present problems in macroecological studies of animal populations. Estimated densities of ungulate prey ranged between 5.3 and 63.8 animals per km2. Estimated tiger densities (3.2-16.8 tigers per 100 km2) were reasonably consistent with model predictions. The results provide evidence of a functional relationship between abundances of large carnivores and their prey under a wide range of ecological conditions. In addition to generating important insights into carnivore ecology and conservation, the study provides a potentially useful model for the rigorous conduct of macroecological science.",

Static and mechanistic analysis, however, is not adequate to understand the changing world in which we live. In order to adequately address the most pressing social and environmental challenges looming ahead, we need to develop analytical tools for analyzing dynamic situations \u2013 particularly institutional change. In this paper, we develop an analytical tool to study institutional change, more specifically, the evolution of rules and norms. We believe that in order for such an analytical tool to be useful to develop a general theory of institutional change, it needs to enable the analyst to concisely record the processes of change in multiple specific settings so that lessons from such settings can eventually be integrated into a more general predictive theory of change.",

For this reason it is asymptotically unbiased, unlike Harrell's c-index based on informative pairs. The asymptotic distribution of the concordance probability estimate is derived using U-statistic theory and the methodology is applied to a predictive model in lung cancer.

The latter is a significant growth industry, particularly in Europe where subalpine base tunnels in excess of 10 m wide and dozens of kilometres long are being driven by tunnel boring machine (TBM) through alpine terrain at depths greater than 2\u00a0km. In more massive granitoid or gneissic ground, these tunnels have experienced significant spalling damage. En route to a practical predictive technique for this condition, the author utilizes a number of analytical and micromechanical tools to validate a simple empirical predictive model for tunnel spall initiation. The true nature of damage and of yield, as the result of extensile damage accumulation, in hard rocks is examined using these tools. Based on the resultant conceptual model, the author expands on the empirical damage threshold, using a spalling limit to differentiate stress paths that lead to crac...",

Two hypotheses related to these approaches are developed and tested based on matched survey data collected from the CEOs and CIOs of 110 firms. The results indicate that the resource-centered and contingency-based approaches provide complementary understanding of the strategic value of IT. On the one hand, the contingency-based approach is better at explaining the impact of cost-related IT applications on firm performance. Alignment between business strategy and information systems strategy on cost reduction was found to have a significant negative association with firm expense. On the other hand, the resource-centered perspective has a stronger predictive ability of IT impact on firm revenue and profitability. Our results indicate that investments in growth-oriented applications were directly and positively related to firm revenue. An ANOVA test indicates that the nonlinear approaches provide additional insights that help to better understand the relationship between alignment and performance. The response surface method (RSM) shows that high-end strategic alignment (i.e., fit occurring when business strategy and IT strategy are both high) leads to superior performance compared to low-end strategic alignment (i.e., fit occurring when business strategy and IT strategy are both low). We discuss the implications of this study for research and practice and conclude with suggestions for future research directions.",

In this work, we analyze Poisson regression in a Bayesian setting, by introducing a prior distribution on the weights of the linear function. Since exact inference is analytically unobtainable, we derive a closed-form approximation to the predictive distribution of the model. We show that the predictive distribution can be kernelized, enabling the representation of non-linear log-mean functions. We also derive an approximate marginal likelihood that can be optimized to learn the hyperparameters of the kernel. We then relate the proposed approximate Bayesian Poisson regression to Gaussian processes. Finally, we present experimental results using Bayesian Poisson regression for crowd counting from low-level features.",

The observer AQS security score showed convergent validity with Strange Situation procedure (SSP) security (r = .31) and excellent predictive validity with sensitivity measures (r = .39). Its association with temperament was weaker (r = .16), which supports the discriminant validity of the observer AQS. Studies on the stability of the observer AQS are still relatively scarce but they have yielded promising results (mean r = .28; k = 4, n = 162). It is concluded that the observer AQS, but not the self-reported AQS, is a valid measure of attachment.",

This massive volume of data can be analysed in order to discover hidden information about students' learning behaviours and, in particular, to identify at-risk students and to advise instructors to provide additional assistance and interventions to help those who are at risk, to increase retention rates. As a result, Learning Analytics (LA) has emerged, which aims to measure, analyse and report students' learning behaviours using data analytics techniques. In this regard, this paper aims to provide an overview of how at-risk students are identified or predicted by analysing their learning behaviours in online learning, including the types of data and tools or analytics methods used. The findings indicate that most of the data analytics techniques have successfully identified and predicted at-risk students and various types of data are determined as attributes in predicting at-risk students. Finally, further research should be conducted to identify and predict at-risk students, since there are diverse students in online learning who have different demands, and interventions should be developed to tackle the problems faced by at-risk students in order to enhance their learning performances.",

            "abstract": "The predictive validity of personality for important life outcomes is well established, but conventional longitudinal analyses cannot rule out the possibility that unmeasured third-variable confounds fully account for the observed relationships. Longitudinal hierarchical linear models (HLM) with time-varying covariates allow each subject to serve as his or her own control, thus eliminating between-individual confounds. HLM also allow the directionality of the causal relationship to be tested by reversing time-lagged predictor and outcome variables. We illustrate these techniques through a series of models that demonstrate that within-individual changes in self-control over time predict subsequent changes in GPA but not vice-versa. The evidence supporting a causal role for self-control was not moderated by IQ, gender, ethnicity, or income. Further analyses rule out one time-varying confound: self-esteem. The analytic approach taken in this study provides the strongest evidence to date for the causal role of self-control in determining achievement.",

Using a sample of 14,464 students from 48 institutions, the authors constructed hierarchical regression models to measure the predictive validity of the Student Readiness Inventory, a measure of psychosocial factors. Controlling for institutional effects and traditional predictors, the authors tested the effects of motivational and skill, social, and self-management measures on academic performance and retention. Academic Discipline was incrementally predictive of academic performance (grade-point average) and retention. Social Activity and Emotional Control also helped predict academic performance and retention, whereas Commitment to College and Social Connection offered incremental prediction of retention. This study elaborates recent meta-analytic findings (S. Robbins et al., 2004), demonstrating the salience of a subset of motivational, social, and self-management factors. Future research questions include how measures of psychosocial factors can be used to aid students, the salience of these measures over the entire college experience and for predicting job performance, and the need for testing theoretical models for explaining postsecondary educational outcomes incorporating traditional, motivational, self-management, and social engagement factors.",

This review is limited to surgical outcomes studies published between 1990 and 2004 that include (1) psychosocial variables (eg, depression, social support) as predictors of outcome and that focus on (2) clinical outcomes (eg, postoperative pain, functional recovery) using (3) specific multivariate analytic techniques with (4) relevant clinical variables (eg, presurgical health status) included as covariates. Twenty\u2010nine studies met these criteria. Results indicate that psychosocial factors play a significant role in recovery and are predictive of surgical outcome, even after accounting for known clinical factors. Attitudinal and mood factors were strongly predictive; personality factors were least predictive. The results suggest that preoperative consideration of attitudinal and mood factors will assist the surgeon in estimating both the speed and extent of postoperative recovery.",

At the heart of 802.11e is a modified contention-based access mechanism, named the enhanced distributed coordination function (EDCF). In this paper, we propose and validate an analytical model for the saturation throughput of EDCF. Key to the accuracy of our model is a treatment of the postcollision period, which has been ignored by all previous 802.11 models. With results from the ns-2 simulator, we show that our model can accurately predict throughput over a wide range of scenarios, and thereby demonstrate its usefulness as a predictive tool for use in QoS provision. With context provided by our analytical model, we discuss the primary throughput differentiation mechanisms of EDCF.",

The current study reports a meta-analysis of the relationship between accident involvement and the Big Five personality dimensions (extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness). Low conscientiousness and low agreeableness were found to be valid and generalizable predictors of accident involvement, with corrected mean validities of .27 and .26, respectively. The context of the accident acts as a moderator in the personality-accident relationship, with different personality dimensions associated with occupational and non-occupational accidents. Extraversion was found to be a valid and generalizable predictor of traffic accidents, but not occupational accidents. Avenues for further research are highlighted and discussed.",

Analyses were conducted on a sample of 2,326 freshmen from 11 postsecondary institutions. The results generally supported the predictive validity of the model but suggested that interesting differences in the patterns of influence existed when the data were disaggregated by institutional type. The basic differences across type concerned the concepts of social and academic integration. Social integration played a stronger role in influencing persistence at 4-year, primarily residential institutions, while academic integration was more important at 2- and 4-year, primarily commuter institutions.",

Specifically, the effect of both negative and positive pore water pressures on the stability of initially unsaturated slopes are carefully explained and coupled with infinite slope analysis methods in order to present a predictive formulation of slope failures that occur as a result of rainfall events. The formulation serves as a baseline analysis method for evaluating potentially unstable soil slopes that are subject to surface infiltration and explains the various triggering mechanisms that may occur based on individual combinations of the slope geometry, soil strength, and infiltration parameters. A procedural method is outlined for utilizing the analytical formulation to predict the change in the factor of safety for a slope subject to infiltration and a detailed analysis of a case study is presented to verify the method. Quantitative statements are made concerning the time and depth of failure in relationship to the soil, slope, and rainfall parameters.",

For example, 1) it isnot necessary to exceed customer expectations to increase preference, 2) receiving an expected level of bad service does not reduce preference, 3) rational customers may rationally choose an option with lower expected quality, even if all nonquality attributes are equal, and 4) paying more attention to loyal, experienced customers can sometimes be counter-productive. These surprising findings make sense in retrospect, once customer expectations are viewed as distributions, rather than simple point expectations. That is, each customer has a probability density function that describes the relative likelihood that a particular quality outcome will be experienced. Customers form these expectation distributions based on their cumulative experience with the good or service. A customer's cumulative expectation distribution maybe conceptualized as being a predictive density for the next transaction. When combined with a diminishing returns (i.e., concave) utility function, this Bayesian theoretical framework results in predictions of: (a) how consumers will behave over time, and (b) how their perceptions and evaluations will change. In managerial terms, we conclude that customers consider not only expected quality, but also risk. This may help explain why current measures of customer satisfaction (which is highly related to expected quality) only partially predict future behavior. We find that most of the predictions of our theoretical model are borne out by empirical evidence from two experiments. Thus, we conclude that our approach provides a useful simplification of reality that successfully predicts many aspects of the dynamics of consumer response to quality. These findings are relevant to both academics and managers. Academics in the area of customer satisfaction and service quality need to be aware that it may be insufficient to measure only the point expectation, as has always been the standard practice. Instead it may be necessary to measure the uncertainty that the customer has with respect to the level of service that will be received. Due to questionnaire length constraints, it may not be practical for managers to include uncertainty questions on customer satisfaction surveys. Nevertheless it is possible to build a proxy for uncertainty by measuring the extent of experience with the service/good, and this proxy can be used to partially control for uncertainty effects. The findings of the study were obtained using 1) an analytical model of customer expectation updating, based on aset of assumptions that are well-supported in the academic literature, and 2) two behavioral experiments using human subjects: a cross-sectional experiment, and a longitudinal experiment. Both the analytical model and the behavioral experiments were designed to investigate the effects that distributions of expectations might have, and especially the effects that might deviate from the predictions that would arise from a traditional point expectation model. The behavioral experiments largely confirmed the predictions of the analytical model. As it turned out, the analytical model correctly (in most cases) predicted behavioral effects that contradict some of the best-accepted \"truisms\" of customer satisfaction. It is now clear that a more sophisticated view of customer expectations is required-one that considers not only the point expectation but also the likelihood across the entire distribution of possible outcomes. This distinction is not \"just academic,\" because it results in predictable behavior that deviates significantly from that which was traditionally expected based on simpler models.",

Also, using a model predictor, the time delay in the backward channel can be compensated as well. Another key part of this paper is to analyse the stability of the networked control systems. The analytical criteria are obtained for both fixed and random communication time delays. The simulation results and practical experiments illustrate that the proposed controller design is realistic.",

One of the most commonly used approachs for interpolating and extending streamflow records is to fit observed data with an analytic power model. However, such analytic models may not adequately represent the flow process, because they are based on many simplifying assumptions about the natural phenomena that influence the river flow. This paper demonstrates how a neural network can be used as an adaptive model synthesizer as well as a predictor. Issues such as selecting an appropriate neural network architecture and a correct training algorithm as well as presenting data to neural networks are addressed using a constructive algorithm called the cascade-correlation algorithm. The neural-network approach is applied to the flow prediction of the Huron River at the Dexter sampling station, near Ann Arbor, Mich. Empirical comparisons are performed between the predictive capability of the neural network models and the most commonly used analytic nonlinear power model in terms of accuracy and convenience of use. Our preliminary results are quite encouraging. An analysis performed on the structure of the networks developed by the cascade-correlation algorithm shows that the neural networks are capable of adapting their complexity to match changes in the flow history and that the models developed by the neural-network approach are more complex than the power model.",

Using 30 primary studies (total N = 4,046), it was found that predictive validities of the Big Five were similar to Big Five validities reported for domestic employees. Extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were predictive of expatriate job performance; openness was not. Other predictors that were found to relate to expatriate job performance were cultural sensitivity and local language ability. Cultural flexibility, selection board ratings, tolerance for ambiguity, ego strength, peer nominations, task leadership, people leadership, social adaptability, and interpersonal interest emerged as predictors from exploratory investigations (K < 4). It is surprising that intelligence has seldom been investigated as a predictor of expatriate job performance.",

It may be possible to improve outcomes by addressing patient characteristics that predict continued drug use. This review uses meta-analytic techniques to identify risk factors for continued drug use in patients treated for opiate abuse.\n\n\nDESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS\nA thorough search of the published literature yielded 69 studies that reported information on the bivariate association between one or more independent variables and continued use of illicit drugs during and after treatment for opiate addiction.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nMost of the patient variables summarized have weak longitudinal relationships with continued drug use, although several variables display moderate longitudinal associations. Ten variables show statistically significant and longitudinally predictive relationships (average r > 0.1) with continued use, including: high level of pretreatment opiate/drug use, prior treatment for opiate addiction, no prior abstinence from opiates, abstinence from/light use of alcohol, depression, high stress, unemployment/employment problems, association with substance abusing peers, short length of treatment, and leaving treatment prior to completion. Several other variables may be potentially longitudinally predictive.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo prevent relapse, treatment interventions should address multiple variables because no single variable strongly predicts continued drug use.",

(2) The size of the predictive correlation is essentially the same for habituation and for recognition memory paradigms. (3) This prediction phenomenon is not obviously associated solely with one laboratory, one particular infant response measure, or a few extremely disordered infants. (4) The level of prediction to childhood IQ is substantial given the reliability of the infant measures. (5) Predictions are somewhat higher for risk than for nonrisk samples. (6) Predictions are consistently higher than for standardized infant tests of general development for nonrisk but not for risk samples, and they are not consistently higher than predicting from parental education and socioeconomic status or a few other infant behaviours for nonrisk samples. (8) Coefficients may be higher when the predicting assessments are made between 2 and 8 months of age than earlier or later, but prediction coefficients are remarkably consistent across the observed outcome age period of 2-8 years.",

Boltzmann hereditary integrals are used to generate displacement\u2013time solutions for loading at constant rate and creep following ramp loading. Experimental data for triangle- and trapezoidal-loading are examined for commercially-available polymers and compared with analytical solutions. Emphasis is given to the use of multiple experiments to test the fidelity and predictive capability of the obtained material creep function. Plastic deformation occurs in sharp indentation of glassy polymers and is found to complicate the viscoelastic analysis. A new method is proposed for estimating a material time-constant from peak displacement or hardness data obtained in pyramidal indentation tests performed at different loading rates.",

Hare, 2003) and related scales in institutional settings. In this meta-analysis, the authors coded 273 effect sizes to investigate the association between the Hare scales and a hierarchy of increasingly specific forms of institutional misconduct. Effect sizes for Total, Factor 1, and Factor 2 scores were quite heterogeneous overall and weakest for physically violent misconduct (r-sub(w) = .17, .14, and .15, respectively). Moderator analyses suggested that physical violence effect sizes were smaller in U.S. prison samples (r-sub(w) = .11) than in non-U.S. prison samples (r-sub(w) = .23). Findings are discussed in terms of the utility of the Hare measures for decision-making in institutional and other contexts.",
