A meta-analysis on 71 independent samples (N = 7,535) demonstrated that emotional stability and ambition are both related to overall adaptive performance. Openness, however, does not contribute to the prediction of adaptive performance. Analysis of predictor importance suggests that ambition is the most important predictor for proactive forms of adaptive performance, whereas emotional stability is the most important predictor for reactive forms of adaptive performance. Job level (managers vs. employees) moderates the effects of personality traits: Ambition and emotional stability exert stronger effects on adaptive performance for managers as compared to employees.",

Perceived age differences were largest for age stereotypes and smallest for evaluations. As predicted by social role theory (Eagly, 1987), effect sizes were reduced when detailed information was provided about the person being rated. The double standard of aging emerged for evaluations and behavior/behavioral intentions, but was reversed for the competence category. Perceptions depended on respondent age also. Results demonstrated both the multi-dimensionality and the complexity of attitudes toward older adults (Hummert, 1999; Kite & Wagner, 2002).",

It provides a fast and relatively accurate method to predict the performance of the IDMA scheme.

The present study demonstrates the usefulness of eigenfunctions in spatial modeling applied to ecological problems and shows equivalencies of and differences between the two current implementations of this methodology. The two approaches in this category are the distance-based (DB) eigenvector maps proposed by P. Legendre and his colleagues, and spatial filtering based upon geographic connectivity matrices (i.e., topology-based; CB) developed by D. A. Griffith and his colleagues. In both cases, the goal is to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into conventional regression models. One important advantage of these two approaches over any other spatial approach is that they provide a flexible tool that allows the full range of general and generalized linear modeling theory to be applied to ecological and geographical problems in the presence of nonzero spatial autocorrelation.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides a rigorous mathematical proof that the double scroll is indeed chaotic. Our approach is to derive a linearly equivalent class of piecewise-linear differential equations which includes the double scroll as a special case. A necessary and sufficient condition for two such piecewise-linear vector fields to be linearly equivalent is that their respective eigenvalues be a scaled version of each other. In the special case where they are identical, we have exact equivalence in the sense of linear conjugacy. An explicit normalform equation in the context of global bifurcation is derived and parametrized by their eigenvalues. Analytical expressions for various Poincare maps are then derived and used to characterize the birth and the death of the double scroll, as well as to derive an approximate one-dimensional map in analytic form which is useful for further bifurcation analysis. In particular, the analytical expressions characterizing various half-return maps associated with the Poincare map are used in a crucial way to prove the existence of a Shilnikov-type homoclinic orbit, thereby establishing rigorously the chaotic nature of the double scroll. These analytical expressions are also fundamental in our in-depth analysis of the birth (onset of the double scroll) and death (extinction of chaos) of the double scroll. The unifying theme throughout this paper is to analyze the double scroll system as an unfolding of a large family of piecewise-linear vector fields in R^3 . Using this approach, we were able to prove that the chaotic dynamics of the double scroll is quite common, and is robust because the associated horseshoes predicted from Shilnikov's theorem are structurally stable. In fact, it is exhibited by a large family (in fact, infinitely many linearlyequivalent circuits) of vector fields whose associated piecewise-linear differential equations bear no resemblance to each other. It is therefore remarkable that the normalized eigenvalues, which is a local concept, completely determine the system's global qualitative behavior.",

Unlike the stationary at-\u0393 BICs which originate from the geometric symmetry, the tunable off-\u0393 BICs are due to the weighted destructive via the continuum interference in the vicinity of accidental symmetry when the majority of the radiation is precanceled. The symmetric compatible nature of the off-\u0393 BICs leads to a trapping of light that can be tuned through continuously varying the wave vector. With the analytical approach, we explain a reported experiment and predict the existence of a new BIC at an unrevealed symmetry.",

            "abstract": "Since many Internet applications employ a multi-tier architecture, in this paper, we focus on the problem of analytically modeling the behavior of such applications. We present a model based on a network of queues, where the queues represent different tiers of the application. Our model is sufficiently general to capture (i) the behavior of tiers with significantly different performance characteristics and (ii) application idiosyncrasies such as session-based workloads, concurrency limits, and caching at intermediate tiers. We validate our model using real multi-tier applications running on a Linux server cluster. Our experiments indicate that our model faithfully captures the performance of these applications for a number of workloads and configurations. For a variety of scenarios, including those with caching at one of the application tiers, the average response times predicted by our model were within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed average response times. Our experiments also demonstrate the utility of the model for dynamic capacity provisioning, performance prediction, bottleneck identification, and session policing. In one scenario, where the request arrival rate increased from less than 1500 to nearly 4200 requests/min, a dynamic provisioning technique employing our model was able to maintain response time targets by increasing the capacity of two of the application tiers by factors of 2 and 3.5, respectively.",

Children were administered a newly developed and validated battery of 6 executive function tasks tapping inhibitory control, working memory, and attention shifting. Residualized change analysis indicated that higher quality parenting as indicated by higher scores on widely used measures of parenting at both earlier and later time points predicted more positive gain in executive function at 60 months. Latent change score models in which parenting and executive function over time were held to standards of longitudinal measurement invariance provided additional evidence of the association between change in parenting quality and change in executive function. In these models, cross-lagged paths indicated that in addition to parenting predicting change in executive function, executive function bidirectionally predicted change in parenting quality. Results were robust with the addition of covariates, including child sex, race, maternal education, and household income-to-need. Strengths and drawbacks of the 2 analytic approaches are discussed, and the findings are considered in light of emerging methodological innovations for testing the extent to which executive function is malleable and open to the influence of experience.",

In this paper we describe a penalized version of LDA. It is designed for situations in which there are many highly correlated predictors, such as those obtained by discretizing a function, or the grey-scale values of the pixels in a series of images. In cases such as these it is natural, efficient and sometimes essential to impose a spatial smoothness constraint on the coefficients, both for improved prediction performance and interpretability. We cast the classification problem into a regression framework via optimal scoring. Using this, our proposal facilitates the use of any penalized regression technique in the classification setting. The technique is illustrated with examples in speech recognition and handwritten character recognition.",

In 39 patients (44 vessels) with isolated, discrete coronary lesions varying in severity from 10 to 95 per cent stenosis, measurement of the percentage of stenosis from coronary angiograms was not significantly correlated (r = -0.25) with the reactive hyperemic response. Results were the same for obstructions in the left anterior descending, diagonal, and right coronary arteries. Underestimation of lesion severity occurred in 95 per cent of vessels with greater than 60 per cent stenosis of the diameter by arteriography. Both overestimation and underestimation of lesions with less than 60 per cent stenosis were common. These results, together with the high interobserver and intraobserver variability of standard visual analysis of angiograms, suggest that the physiologic effects of the majority of coronary obstructions cannot be determined accurately by conventional angiographic approaches. The need for improved analytical methods for the physiologic assessment of angiographically detected coronary obstructions is apparent.",

To address this issue, the authors conducted a qualitative and quantitative review of the relationships between positive and negative affectivity (PA and NA, respectively) and various performance dimensions. A series of meta-analyses based on 57 primary studies indicated that PA and NA predicted task performance in the hypothesized directions and that the relationships were strongest for subjectively rated versus objectively rated performance. In addition, PA was related to organizational citizenship behaviors but not withdrawal behaviors, and NA was related to organizational citizenship behaviors, withdrawal behaviors, counterproductive work behaviors, and occupational injury. Mediational analyses revealed that affect operated through different mechanisms in influencing the various performance dimensions. Regression analyses documented that PA and NA uniquely predicted task performance but that extraversion and neuroticism did not, when the four were considered simultaneously. Discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved).",

Application of modern machine learning approaches to pharmacogenomic datasets have demonstrated the ability to infer genomic predictors of compound sensitivity. Such modeling approaches entail many analytical design choices; however, a systematic study evaluating the relative performance attributable to each design choice is not yet available. In this work, we evaluated over 110,000 different models, based on a multifactorial experimental design testing systematic combinations of modeling factors within several categories of modeling choices, including: type of algorithm, type of molecular feature data, compound being predicted, method of summarizing compound sensitivity values, and whether predictions are based on discretized or continuous response values. Our results suggest that model input data (type of molecular features and choice of compound) are the primary factors explaining model performance, followed by choice of algorithm. Our results also provide a statistically principled set of recommended modeling guidelines, including: using elastic net or ridge regression with input features from all genomic profiling platforms, most importantly, gene expression features, to predict continuous-valued sensitivity scores summarized using the area under the dose response curve, with pathway targeted compounds most likely to yield the most accurate predictors. In addition, our study provides a publicly available resource of all modeling results, an open source code base, and experimental design for researchers throughout the community to build on our results and assess novel methodologies or applications in related predictive modeling problems.",

            "abstract": "A new analytical wake model for wind turbines, considering ambient turbulence intensity, thrust coefficient and yaw angle effects, is proposed from numerical and analytical studies. First, eight simulations by the Reynolds Stress Model are conducted for different thrust coefficients, yaw angles and ambient turbulence intensities. The wake deflection, mean velocity and turbulence intensity in the wakes are systematically investigated. A new wake deflection model is then proposed to analytically predict the wake center trajectory in the yawed condition. Finally, the effects of yaw angle are incorporated in the Gaussian-based wake model. The wake deflection, velocity deficit and added turbulence intensity in the wake predicted by the proposed model show good agreement with the numerical results. The model parameters are determined as the function of ambient turbulence intensity and thrust coefficient, which enables the model to have good applicability under various conditions.",

It has strong roots in biometrical genetic theory, which allows predictions to be made about the correlations between observed traits of identical and fraternal twins in terms of underlying genetic and environmental components. One can infer the relative importance of these 'latent' factors (model parameters) by structural equation modelling (SEM) of observed covariances of both twin types. SEM programs estimate model parameters by minimising a goodness-of-fit function between observed and predicted covariance matrices, usually by the maximum-likelihood criterion. Likelihood ratio statistics also allow the comparison of fit of different competing models. The program Mx, specifically developed to model genetically sensitive data, is now widely used in twin analyses. The flexibility of Mx allows the modelling of multivariate data to examine the genetic and environmental relations between two or more phenotypes and the modelling to categorical traits under liability-threshold models.",

Based on the density matrix formalism, our approach gives insights into the microscopic origin of excitonic transitions, their relative oscillator strength, and binding energy. We show analytical expressions for the carrier-light coupling element, which contains the optical selection rules and well describes the valleyselective polarization in MoS2. In agreement with experimental results, we find the formation of strongly bound electron-hole pairs due to the efficient Coulomb interaction. The absorption spectrum of MoS2 on a silicon substrate features two pronounced peaks at 1.91 eV and 2.05 eV corresponding to the A and B exciton, which are characterized by binding energies of 420 meV and 440 meV, respectively. Our calculations reveal their relative oscillator strength and predict the appearance of further low-intensity excitonic transitions at higher energies. The presented approach is applicable to other transition metal dichalcogenides and can be extended to investigations of trion and biexcitonic effects.",

BRACEWELL) STEINBERG AND LEQUEUX (TRANSLATOR Radio astronomy WEEKS Antenna engineering PREFACE The theory of automatic control has been advanced in important ways during recent years, particularly with respect to stability and optimal control. These are significant contributions which appeal to many workers, including the writers, because they answer important questions and are both theoretically elegant and practically useful. These theories do not, however, lay to rest all questions of importance to the control engineer. The designer of the attitude control system for a space vehicle booster which, for simplicity, utilizes a rate-switched engine gimbal drive, must know the characteristics of the limit cycle oscillation that the system will sustain and must have some idea of how the system will respond to attitude commands while continuing to limit-cycle. The designer of a chemical process control system must be able to predict the transient oscillations the process may experience during start-up due to the limited magnitudes of important variables in the system. The designer of a radar antenna pointing system with limited torque capability must be able to predict the rms pointing error due to random wind disturbances on the antenna, and must understand how these random disturbances will influence the behavior of the system in its response to command inputs. But more important than just being able to evaluate how a given system will behave in a postulated situation is the fact that these control engineers must design their systems to meet specifications on important characteristics. Thus a complicated exact analytical tool, if one existed, would be of less value to the designer than an approximate tool which is simple enough in application to give insight into the trends in system behavior as a function of system parameter values or possible compensations, hence providing the basis for system design. As an analytical tool to answer questions such as these in a way \u2026",

This theory is constructed for radiative\u2013convective equilibrium and compared against a cloud-resolving model. With some reinterpretation of variables, it can be applied more generally to the entire tropics.Given four variables\u2014pressure, temperature, and the fractional entrainment and detrainment rates\u2014the equations predict the relative humidity (RH) and the temperature lapse rate analytically. The RH is a simple ratio involving the fractional detrainment rate and the water-vapor lapse rate. When integrated upward in height, the equations give profiles of RH and temperature for a convecting atmosphere.The theory explains the magnitude of RH and the \u201cC\u201d shape of the tropospheric RH profile. It also predicts that RH is an invariant function of temperature as the atmosphere warms, and this behavior matches what has been seen in global climate mod...",

The model is shown to agree well with both literature data for the equilibrium oxygen vacancy concentration and novel experimental kinetics of oxidation and reduction obtained by the authors. The form of the Arrhenius rate equation was determined from the properties of the reaction. Equilibrium data from the literature was analyzed with respect to our rate equation. From this analysis, a number of constraints on the model parameters were determined, and some of the constants of the model were fixed. The model accurately predicts the equilibrium composition of CeO2 over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures (10\u20132 to 10\u20138 bar) and temperatures (1000\u20131900 \u00b0C). Novel results of the experimental reoxidation of ceria were analyzed to fix the remainder of the constants.

We claim that analytic thinking is not limited to problems that have a normative basis and, as an extension of this, predict that individual differences in analytic thinking will be influential in determining beliefs and values. Along with assessments of cognitive ability and style, religious beliefs, and moral values, participants judged the wrongness of acts considered disgusting and conventionally immoral, but that do not violate care- or fairness-based moral principles. Differences in willingness to engage analytic thinking predicted reduced judgements of wrongness, independent of demographics, political ideology, religiosity, and moral values. Further, we show that those who were higher in cognitive ability were less likely to indicate that purity, patriotism, and respect for traditions and authority are important to their moral thinking. These findings are consistent with a \u201cReflectionist\u201d view that assumes a role for analytic thought in determining substantive, deeply-held human beliefs and values.",

The physical and mechanical properties of such porous biomaterials have therefore received increasing attention during recent years. One of the areas that have revived is analytical study of the mechanical behavior of regular porous biomaterials with the aim of deriving analytical relationships that could predict the relative density and mechanical properties of porous biomaterials, given the design and dimensions of their repeating unit cells. In this article, we review the analytical relationships that have been presented in the literature for predicting the relative density, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress, and buckling limit of regular porous structures based on various types of unit cells. The reviewed analytical relationships are used to compare the mechanical properties of porous biomaterials based on different types of unit cells. The major areas where the analytical relationships have improved during the recent years are discussed and suggestions are made for future research directions. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The transformed equation is deduced with the introduction of only one additional parameter, which is found to be a constant for all cases. The transformed equation is tested by comparison with some analytical solutions with which it is found to be in excellent agreement. In particular, the equation is shown to predict correctly the rate of change of total particle number and volume. Compatible descriptions of linear growth and nucleation are developed with similar success. \n \nThe method is then applied to modeling the in vitro growth and aggregation of kidney stones (calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals). It is found that these phenomena are well described by McCabe's \u0394L law, a size-independent coalescence kernel, and first-order kinetics. Simulated particle size distributions and their moments are in excellent agreement with the experimental results.",

During some of the dynamic tests the specimen responded with a displacement of the order of six times the initial yield deflection. The stiffness and energy absorbing capacity of the specimens changed considerably and, at times, very rapidly during the dynamic tests. A realistic conceptual model for predicting the dynamic response of a reinforced concrete member should be based on a static force-displacement relationship which reflects the changes in stiffness for loading and unloading as a function of the previous loading history. The dynamic response calculated on the basis of the proposed force-displacement relationship resulted in satisfactory agreement with the measured response. With the hysteresis loops defined by the proposed force-displacement relationship, it was not necessary to invoke additional sources of energy absorption for a satisfactory prediction of the dynamic response.",

            "abstract": "Advances in low-power and low-cost sensor networks have led to solutions mature enough for use in a broad range of applications varying from health monitoring to building surveillance. The development of those applications has been stimulated by the finalization of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which defines the medium access control (MAC) and physical layer for sensor networks. One of the MAC schemes proposed is slotted carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), and this paper analyzes whether this scheme meets the design constraints of those low-power and low-cost sensor networks. The paper provides a detailed analytical evaluation of its performance in a star topology network, for uplink and acknowledged uplink traffic. Both saturated and unsaturated periodic traffic scenarios are considered. The form of the analysis is similar to that of Bianchi for IEEE 802.11 DCF only in the use of a per user Markov model to capture the state of each user at each moment in time. The key assumptions to enable this important simplification and the coupling of the per user Markov models are however different, as a result of the very different designs of the 802.15.4 and 802.11 carrier sensing mechanisms. The performance predicted by the analytical model is very close to that obtained by simulation. Throughput and energy consumption analysis is then performed by using the model for a range of scenarios. Some design guidelines are derived to set the 802.15.4 parameters as function of the network requirements.",

In this work, a new integrator for the steepest descent pathway is presented. This method is a Hessian based predictor-corrector algorithm that affords pathways comparable to our previous fourth order method at the cost of a second order approach. The proposed integrator is tested on an analytic surface, four moderately sized chemical reactions, and one larger organometallic system.",

This paradigm has led to the underemphasis of individual differences as being an important cause of individuals' turnover decisions. The results of the meta-analysis show that personality traits do have an impact on individuals' turnover intentions and behaviors. The trait of Emotional Stability best predicted (negatively) employees' intentions to quit, whereas the traits of Conscientiousness and Agreeableness best predicted (negatively) actual turnover decisions. A theoretically developed path model showed important direct effects from personality to intentions to quit and turnover behaviors that were not captured through job satisfaction or job performance. These direct effects indicate that employees who are low on Emotional Stability may intend to quit for reasons other than dissatisfaction with their jobs or not being able to perform their jobs well. The direct effects on turnover suggest that individuals who are low on Agreeableness or high on Openness may engage in unplanned quitting. Personality traits had stronger relationships with outcomes than did non-self-report measures of job complexity/job characteristics.",

This is often an undesired state, particularly if the animation is seeking to model a realistic world. Two issues are involved: detecting that a collision has occurred, and responding to it. The former is fundamentally a kinematic problem, involving the positional relationship of objects in the world. The latter is a dynamic problem, in that it involves predicting behavior according to physical laws. This paper discusses collision detection and response in general, presents two collision detection algorithms, describes modeling collisions of arbitrary bodies using springs, and presents an analytical collision response algorithm for articulated rigid bodies that conserves linear and angular momentum.",

Aggregated between-group effect sizes and confidence intervals were calculated for each study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLiterature search revealed 22 relevant studies, of which nine compared brief MI with no treatment, and met methodological criteria for inclusion. In these, the aggregate effect size was 0.18 (95% C.I. 0.07, 0.29), but was greater 0.60 (95% C.I. 0.36, 0.83) when, in a post-hoc analysis, the follow-up period was three months or less. Its efficacy also increased when dependent drinkers were excluded. There were nine studies meeting methodological criteria for inclusion which compared brief MI with another treatment (one of a diverse set of interventions), yielding an aggregate effect size of 0.43(95% C.I. 0.17, 0.70). The literature review pointed to several factors which may influence MI's long-term efficacy effectiveness of MI.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBrief MI is effective. Future studies should focus on possible predictors of efficacy such as gender, age, employment status, marital status, mental health, initial expectations, readiness to change, and whether the population is drawn from treatment-seeking or non-treatment-seeking populations. Also, the components of MI should be compared to determine which are most responsible for maintaining long-term changes.",

With a sample of 432 adults from a nationwide telephone survey conducted in spring 2005, factor-analytic procedures were used to develop more valid scales and to test process-based model hypotheses. Regression analyses confirmed that procedural justice judgments affect police legitimacy, which in turn influence both cooperation with police and compliance with the law. When legitimacy was disaggregated, trust in the police predicted both of the outcomes of interest. Obligation to obey, however, was not significantly associated with either compliance or cooperation. Finally, distributive fairness appeared to be as salient as legitimacy in facilitating participant cooperation.",

An analytic camera model is used to predict the location and appearance of landmarks in the image, generating a projection for an assumed viewpoint. Correspondence is achieved by adjusting the parameters of the camera model until the appearances of the landmarks optimally match a symbolic description extracted from the image. \n \nThe matching of image and map features is performed rapidly by a new technique, called \"chamfer matching\", that compares the shapes of two collections of shape fragments, at a cost proportional to linear dimension, rather than area. These two techniques permit the matching of spatially extensive features on the basis of shape, which reduces the risk of ambiguous matches and the dependence on viewing conditions inherent in conventional image based correlation matching.",

Cohen's (1992) criteria (mean r = .09), the association between AAI security and attachment style dimensions is trivial to small. Study 2 (N = 160) confirms meta-analytic results with state-of-the-art assessments of attachment security and also examines attachment dimensions in relation to the Big 5 personality traits. Finally, Study 3 is an investigation of 50 engaged couples that shows that developmental and social psychological measures of attachment security predict somewhat distinct--though theoretically anticipated--aspects of functioning in adult relationships.",

It has been evaluated on a 10 generator 39 bus system and on a 20 generator 118 bus system. The method predicts critical clearing times for first swing transient stability which agree very closely with the results of simulations.",

In addition, at high current densities, excessive amount of water is generated and condenses, filling the pores of electrodes with liquid water, and hence limiting the reactant transport to active catalyst. This phenomenon known as \u2018\u2018flooding\u2019\u2019 is an important limiting factor of PEFC performance. In this work, the governing physics of water transport in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic diffusion media is described along with one-dimensional analytical solutions of related transport processes. It is found that liquid water transport across the gas diffusion layer ~GDL! is controlled by capillary forces resulting from the gradient in phase saturation. A one-dimensional analytical solution of liquid water transport across the GDL is derived, and liquid saturation in excess of 10% is predicted for a local current density of 1.4 A/cm 2",

Two types of assumptions made by regression models concern the distribution of the response variable and the nature or shape of the relationship between the predictors and the response. This paper addresses the latter assumption by applying a direct and flexible approach, cubic spline functions, to two widely used models: the logistic regression model for binary responses and the Cox proportional hazards regression model for survival time data.",

The great advantage of these materials is the capability to appear in two different phases, the amorphous and the crystalline phases, with rather different electrical properties. The aim of this work is to provide a physically based model for conduction in the amorphous chalcogenide material, able to predict the current-voltage (I\u2212V) characteristics as a function of phase state, temperature, and cell geometry. First, the trap-limited transport at relatively low currents (subthreshold regime) is studied, leading to a comprehensive model for subthreshold conduction accounting for (a) the shape of the I\u2212V characteristics, (b) the measured temperature dependence, (c) the dependence of subthreshold slope on the thickness of the amorphous phase, and (d) the voltage dependence of the activation ener...",

            "abstract": "One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, dynamics are approximated by physics-based analytical models. These models rely on specific state representations that may be hard to obtain from raw sensory data, especially if no knowledge of the object shape is assumed. More recently, we have seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of complex physical interactions directly from sensory input. It is, however, an open question how far these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we investigate the advantages and limitations of neural-network-based learning approaches for predicting the effects of actions based on sensory input and show how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of both worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which there exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We propose the use of a convolutional neural network to convert raw depth images or organized point clouds into a suitable representation for the analytical model and compare this approach with using neural networks for both, perception and prediction. A systematic evaluation of the proposed approach on a very large real-world dataset shows two main advantages of the hybrid architecture. Compared with a pure neural network, it significantly (i) reduces required training data and (ii) improves generalization to novel physical interaction.",

For the first time a systematic analysis of random dopant effects down to an individual dopant level was carried out in 3-D on a scale sufficient to provide quantitative statistical predictions. Efficient algorithms based on a single multigrid solution of the Poisson equation followed by the solution of a simplified current continuity equation are used in the simulations. The effects of various MOSFET design parameters, including the channel length and width, oxide thickness and channel doping, on the threshold voltage lowering and fluctuations are studied using typical samples of 200 atomistically different MOSFETs. The atomistic results for the threshold voltage fluctuations were compared with two analytical models based on dopant number fluctuations. Although the analytical models predict the general trends in the threshold voltage fluctuations, they fail to describe quantitatively the magnitude of the fluctuations. The distribution of the atomistically calculated threshold voltage and its correlation with the number of dopants in the channel of the MOSFETs was analyzed based on a sample of 2500 microscopically different devices. The detailed analysis shows that the threshold voltage fluctuations are determined not only by the fluctuation in the dopant number, but also in the dopant position.",

The literature reviewed is devoted to the following application areas: heat transfer problems; thermal and mechanical stresses (including boundary layer and edge stresses); free vibrations and damping; transient dynamic response; bifurcation buckling, local buckling, face-sheet wrinkling and core crimping; large deflection and postbuckling problems; effects of discontinuities (eg, cutouts and stiffeners), and geometric changes (eg, tapered thickness); damage and failure of sandwich structures; experimental studies; optimization and design studies. Over 800 relevant references are cited in this review, and another 559 references are included in a supplemental bibliography for completeness. Extensive numerical results are presented for thermally stressed sandwich panels with composite face sheets showing the effects of variation in their geometric and material parameters on the accuracy of the free vibration response, and the sensitivity coefficients predicted by eight different modeling approaches (based on two-dimensional theories). The standard of comparison is taken to be the analytic three-dimensional thermoelasticity solutions. Some future directions for research on the modeling of sandwich plates and shells are outlined.",

            "abstract": "Expressions for predicting pure-component and cross second virial coefficients for simple and complex systems have been developed from the bound-pair formalism of Stogryn and Hirschfelder. For pure components, the generalized correlation requires the critical temperature and pressure, Thompson's mean radius of gyration or the parachor, dipole moment, and, if appropriate, a parameter to describe chemical association which depends only in the type of group (hydroxyl, amine, ester, carboxylic acid, etc.). Mixing rules have been developed for predicting cross coefficients and solvation effects can be accounted for in a similar manner to association. Agreement with experimental data on 39 nonpolar and 102 polar and associating compounds, 119 mixed nonpolar systems, and 73 mixed systems involving polar compounds, is comparable to or better than that of several other correlations including those which require data to obtain parameters. The method should be most accurate for systems of complex molecules where no data are available In order to accurately predict phase equilibria involving the vapor phase at pressures above atmospheric, deviations from the perfect-gas law usually need to be taken into account (Prausnitz, 1969; Nagata and Yasuda, 1974). The vinal equation terminated at the second coefficient is a simple but accurate method for conditions up to a density of about one-half the critical and has been employed in completely developed methods for predicting vapor-liquid equilibria such as Prausnitz et al. (1967). Several analytical methods for predicting values for the second virial coefficient have been developed (Black, 1958; O'Connell and Prausnitz, 1967; Kreglewski, 1969; Nothnagel et al., 1973; Tsonopoulos, 1974), but except for the last, all suffer from the disadvantage of often requiring one or more parameters that must be obtained from data, or the results are too inaccurate to be acceptable. This work develops an accurate method for predicting second virial coefficients using only critical properties and molecular parameters. all of which may usually be estimated from molecular structure to the required accuracy. From extensive comparisons with pure component and cross vinal coefficient data, the present method appears to be more consistently accurate than any other purely predictive method. In addition, for strongly associating substances, the method predicts association effects at higher densities in a realistic fashion (Nothnagel et al., 1973) using a parameter which depends only on the group interaction.",

The model is designed to provide performance information to an auto-tuning compiler and assist it in narrowing down the search to the more promising implementations. It can also be incorporated into a tool to help programmers better assess the performance bottlenecks in their code. We analyze each GPU kernel and identify how the kernel exercises major GPU microarchitecture features. To identify the performance bottlenecks accurately, we introduce an abstract interpretation of a GPU kernel, work flow graph, based on which we estimate the execution time of a GPU kernel. We validated our performance model on the NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). For this purpose, we used data parallel benchmarks that stress different GPU microarchitecture events such as uncoalesced memory accesses, scratch-pad memory bank conflicts, and control flow divergence, which must be accurately modeled but represent challenges to the analytical performance models. The proposed model captures full system complexity and shows high accuracy in predicting the performance trends of different optimized kernel implementations. We also describe our approach to extracting the performance model automatically from a kernel code.",

Although readiness encompasses a multitude of components, readiness assessments generally focus on measuring and predicting children's pre-academic skills and behaviors and are often the basis for placement and programming decisions. However, no quantitative estimates of effect sizes exist for the relations between preschool or kindergarten academic/cognitive and social/behavioral assessments and early school outcomes. This review presents the results of a meta-analysis of cross-time relations of academic/cognitive and social/behavioral assessments from preschool to second grade. Results from 70 longitudinal studies that reported correlations between academic/cognitive and social/behavioral measures administered in preschool or kindergarten and similar measures administered in first and second grade were included in the analysis. Academic/cognitive assessments predicting similar outcomes showed moderate effect sizes across both time spans; effect sizes were small for social/behavioral predictors of early school social outcomes. Effect sizes varied considerably across individual studies and samples. Findings are discussed in terms of assessment and conceptualization of school readiness, the role of school and classroom experiences in contributing to individual differences in school outcomes, and the importance of a quantitative estimate of effect size for early education policy and practice.",

In particular, cross-national studies are often limited in data sources, which restrict variable selection to debatable proxy indicators. This study therefore uses meta-analytic techniques to examine major cross-national predictors of homicide to determine strengths and weaknesses in theory and design. The findings indicate several critical limitations to cross-national research, including biased sample composition, a lack of theoretical clarity in predictor operationalizations, and an overwhelming reliance on cross-sectional design. The predictors that showed the strongest mean effects were Latin American regional dummy variables, income inequality indicators and the Decommodification Index. Conversely, static population indicators, democracy indices, and measures of economic development had the weakest effects on homicide.",

Understanding these beliefs is just as important as understanding organizational constraints to the adoption of selection technologies and may be more useful for informing the design of successful interventions. One of these is the implicit belief that it is theoretically possible to achieve near-perfect precision in predicting performance on the job. That is, people have an inherent resistance to analytical approaches to selection because they fail to view selection as probabilistic and subject to error. Another is the implicit belief that prediction of human behavior is improved through experience. This myth of expertise results in an overreliance on intuition and a reluctance to undermine one\u2019s own credibility by using a selection decision aid.",

Results showed that the 2 personality traits had both direct effects and indirect effects-through job satisfaction-on overall OCB. Meta-analytic moderator analyses that distinguished between individual- and organization-targeted citizenship behaviors (OCB-I and OCB-O) showed that agreeableness was more closely related with OCB-I and conscientiousness with OCB-O. Finally, the path analyses predicting OCB-I and OCB-O offered further support for the general hypothesis that these 2 constructs are distinct. That is, the results of these analyses revealed that agreeableness had both direct and indirect effects on OCB-I but only indirect effects on OCB-O, and that for conscientiousness the pattern of direct and indirect effects was exactly opposite (direct and indirect effects on OCB-O but only indirect effects on OCB-I).",

The experimental study involves a drop hammer impact test and investigates the influence of drop height and the effect of the amount of longitudinal steel reinforcement contributes to the response of RC beams. The RC beam specimens used in the experiment comprised of under-reinforced sections provided with sufficient amount of transverse reinforcements to allow for an overall flexural failure. The experimental impact responses of the RC beams were simulated with two-degree-of-freedom mass-spring-damper system model, in which the loading rate effects were duly considered. The analytical results are in good agreement with the experimental results for the RC beams that exhibited overall flexural failure.",

In addition, the ringing is always observed in the switching power supply, which is ignored in the traditional loss model. In this paper, the ringing loss is analyzed in a simple way with a clear physical meaning. Based on this model, the circuit power loss could be accurately predicted. Experimental results are provided to verify the model. The simulation results match the experimental results very well, even at 2-MHz switching frequency.",

The model is based on physical optics and describes specular, directional diffuse, and uniform diffuse reflection by a surface. The reflected light pattern depends on wavelength, incidence angle, two surface roughness parameters, and surface refractive index. The formulation is self consistent in terms of polarization, surface roughness, masking/shadowing, and energy. The model applies to a wide range of materials and surface finishes and provides a smooth transition from diffuse-like to specular reflection as the wavelength and incidence angle are increased or the surface roughness is decreased. The model is analytic and suitable for Computer Graphics applications. Predicted reflectance distributions compare favorably with experiment. The model is applied to metallic, nonmetallic, and plastic materials, with smooth and rough surfaces.",

            "abstract": "We derive an analytical theory of the prestellar core initial mass function (IMF) based on an extension of the Press-Schechter statistical formalism. Our approach relies on the general concept of the gravothermal and gravoturbulent collapse of a molecular cloud, with a selection criterion based on the thermal or turbulent Jeans mass, which yields the derivation of the mass spectrum of self-gravitating objects in a quiescent or a turbulent environment. The same formalism also yields the mass spectrum of non-self-gravitating clumps produced in supersonic flows. The mass spectrum of the self-gravitating cores reproduces well the observed IMF. The theory predicts that the shape of the IMF results from two competing contributions, namely, a power law at large scales and an exponential cutoff (lognormal form) centered around the characteristic mass for gravitational collapse. The cutoff exists both in the case of thermal or turbulent collapse, provided that the underlying density field has a lognormal distribution. Whereas pure thermal collapse produces a power-law tail steeper than the Salpeter value, dN/dlog M \u221d M\u2212x with x \u2243 1.35, the latter is recovered exactly for the (three-dimensional) value of the spectral index of the velocity power spectrum, n \u2243 3.8, found in observations and in numerical simulations of isothermal supersonic turbulence. Indeed, the theory predicts that x = (n + 1)/(2n \u2212 4) for self-gravitating structures and x = 2 \u2212 n\u2032/3 for non-self-gravitating structures, where n\u2032 is the power spectrum index of log \u03c1 . We show that, whereas supersonic turbulence promotes the formation of both massive stars and brown dwarfs, it has an overall negative impact on star formation, decreasing the star formation efficiency. This theory provides a novel theoretical foundation to understand the origin of the IMF and provides useful guidance to numerical simulations exploring star formation, while making testable predictions.",

However, a somewhat inconsistent pattern of findings has emerged. A meta-analysis was undertaken to (a) evaluate the magnitude of effects across EEG studies of resting frontal asymmetry and depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety and (b) determine whether certain moderator variables could help reconcile inconsistent findings. Moderate effects of similar magnitude were obtained for the depression and anxiety studies, whereas a smaller effect emerged for comorbid studies. Three moderating variables predicted effect sizes: (a) Shorter EEG recording periods were associated with larger effects among adults, (b) different operationalizations of depression yielded effects of marginally different magnitudes, and (c) younger infant samples showed larger effects than older ones. The current data support a link between resting frontal EEG asymmetry and depression and anxiety and provide a partial account of inconsistent findings across studies.",

It is based on the superposition of the component fields due to the permanent magnet and the stator excitation. A 2D analytical method for predicting the open-circuit airgap field distribution in both internal and external rotor radial-field motor topologies is presented. It involves the solution of the governing field equations in polar coordinates in the annular airgap/magnet region of a multipole slotless motor in which the magnets are assumed to have uniform radial magnetization and a constant relative recoil permeability. Results for various radial-field motors are compared with predictions from corresponding finite element analyses. >",

The meta-analytic summary of 21 studies (4104 participants) showed, as predicted, a positive, heterogeneous correlation between disclosure and social support (\u0155=.159), a negative, heterogeneous correlation between stigma and social support (\u0155=\u2212.344) and a negative, homogenous correlation between stigma and disclosure (\u0155=\u2212.189). The heterogeneity of the first two relationships indicates the presence of moderators, which may include participants\u2019 age and publications\u2019 year.",

The analytical framework allows the water table to be located at any depth below the ground surface and variation of soil suction and moisture content above the water table under steady infiltration conditions. The framework also explicitly considers the effect of weathering and porosity increase near the ground surface on changes in the friction angle of the soil. The factor of safety is conceptualized as a function of the depth within the vadose zone and can be reduced to the classical analytical solution for subaerial infinite slopes in the saturated zone. Slope stability analyses with hypothetical sandy and silty soils are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the framework. These analyses indicate that for hillslopes of both sandy and silty soils, failure can occur above the water table under steady infiltration conditions, which is consistent with some field observations that cannot be predicted by the classical infinite slope theory. A case study of shallow slope failures of sandy colluvium on steep coastal hillslopes near Seattle, Washington, is presented to examine the predictive utility of the proposed framework.",

Potency (a subdimension of the Big 5 personality dimension Extraversion) predicted supervisor ratings of performance (r = .28) and objective measures of sales (r = .26). Achievement (a component of the Conscientiousness dimension) predicted ratings (r = .25) and objective sales (r = .41). General cognitive ability showed a correlation of.40 with ratings but only .04 with objective sales. Similarly, age predicted ratings (r = .26) but not objective sales (r = -.06). On the basis of a small number of studies, interest appears to be a promising predictor of sales success.",

In this analysis, we characterized both the left ventricle and the arterial system by their end systolic pressure (Ps)-SV relationships and predicted SV from the intersection of the two relationship lines. The final output of the analysis was a formula that gives the SV for a given preload as a function of the ventricular properties (Ees, V0, and ejection time) and the arterial impedance properties (modeled in terms of a 3-element Windkessel). To test the validity of this framework for analyzing the ventriculoarterial interaction, we first determined the ventricular properties under a specific set of control arterial impedance conditions. With the ventricular properties thus obtained, we used the analytical formula to predict SVs under various combinations of noncontrol arterial impedance conditions and four preloads. The predicted SVs were compared with those measured while actually imposing the identical set of arterial impedance conditions and preload in eight isolated canine ventricles. The predicted SV was highly correlated (P less than 0.0001) with the measured one in all ventricles. The average correlation coefficient was 0.985 +/- 0.004 (SE), the slope 1.00 +/- 0.04, and the gamma-axis intercept 1.0 +/- 0.2 ml, indicating the accuracy of the prediction. We conclude that the representations of ventricle and arterial system by their Ps-SV relationships are useful in understanding how these two systems determine SV when they are coupled and interact.",

Based on the results of a first-principles brute force simulation of radiative transfer in the atmosphere, we use the same general approach of fitting basis function coefficients to radiance data as the Perez and Preetham models do. However, we make several modifications to this process, which together significantly improve the rendition of sunsets and high atmospheric turbidity setups -- known weak points of the Preetham model. Additionally, our model accounts for ground albedo, and handles each spectral component independently. The latter property makes it easily extensible to the near ultraviolet range of the spectrum, so that the daylight appearance of surfaces that include optical brighteners can be properly predicted. Due to its similar mathematical properties, the new model can be used as a drop-in replacement of the Preetham model.",

It is the ratio of the observed relative standard deviation among laboratories calculated from the actual performance data, RSDR (%), to the corresponding predicted relative standard deviation calculated from the Horwitz equation PRSDR (%) = 2C(-0.15), where C is the concentration found or added, expressed as a mass fraction. It is more or less independent of analyte, matrix, method, and time of publication (as a surrogate for the state of the art of analytical chemistry). It is now one of the acceptability criteria for many of the recently adopted chemical methods of analysis of AOAC INTERNATIONAL, the European Union, and other European organizations dealing with food analysis (e.g., European Committee for Standardization and Nordic Analytical Committee). The origin and applications of the formula are described. Consistent deviations from the ratio on the low side (values <0.5) may indicate unreported averaging or excellent training and experience; consistent deviations on the high side (values >2) may indicate inhomogeneity of the test samples, need for further method optimization or training, operating below the limit of determination, or an unsatisfactory method.",

In social psychological studies, helping behavior has been examined in the context of short-term encounters with strangers. This focus has tended to exclude from the research literature those helping behaviors prescribed by the female gender role, because they are displayed primarily in long-term, close relationships. In contrast, the helping behaviors prescribed by the male gender role have been generously represented in research findings because they are displayed in relationships with strangers as well as in close relationships. Results from our meta-analytic review of sex differences in helping behavior indicate that in general men helped more than women and women received more help than men. Nevertheless, sex differences in helping were extremely inconsistent across studies and were successfully predicted by various attributes of the studies and the helping behaviors. These predictors were interpreted in terms of several aspects of our social-role theory of gender and helping.",

The nanofluid was prepared by synthesizing copper nanoparticles using a chemical reduction method, with water as the solvent, and then dispersing them in ethylene glycol using a sonicator. Volume loadings of up to 2% were prepared. The measured increase in thermal conductivity was twice the value predicted by the Maxwell effective medium theory. The increase in viscosity was about four times of that predicted by the Einstein law of viscosity. Analytical calculations suggest that this nanofluid would not be beneficial as a coolant in heat exchangers without changing the tube diameter. However, increasing the tube diameter to exploit the increased thermal conductivity of the nanofluid can lead to better thermal performance.",

            "abstract": "Solid state drives (SSDs) update data by writing a new copy, rather than overwriting old data, causing prior copies of the same data to be invalidated. These writes are performed in units of pages, while space is reclaimed in units of multi-page erase blocks, necessitating copying of any remaining valid pages in the block before reclamation. The efficiency of this cleaning process greatly affects performance under random workloads; in particular, in SSDs the write bottleneck is typically internal media throughput, and write amplification due to additional internal copying directly reduces application throughput.\n We present the first precise closed-form solution for write amplification under greedy cleaning for uniformly distributed random traffic, and validate its accuracy via simulation. In addition we also present the first models which predict performance degradation for both LRU cleaning and greedy cleaning under simple non-uniform traffic conditions; simulation results show the first model to be exact and the second to be accurate within 2%. We extend the LRU model to arbitrary combinations of random traffic, and demonstrate its use in predicting cleaning performance for real-world workloads.\n The utility of these analytic models lies in their amenability to optimization techniques not feasible in simulation. We examine the strategy of separating \"hot\" and \"cold\" data, showing that for our traffic model, such separation eliminates any loss in performance due to non-uniform traffic. We show how a system which separates hot and cold data may shift free space from cold to hot data in order to achieve improved performance, and how numeric methods may be used with our model to find the optimum operating point, which approaches a write amplification of 1.0 for increasingly skewed traffic. We examine online methods for achieving this optimal operating point, and show that a control strategy based on our model achieves near-optimal performance for a number of real-world block traces.",

The PTED connection incorporates posttensioned high-strength bars to provide a self-centering response along with energy dissipating bars that are able to yield in axial tension and compression. The analytical study involves the development of an equivalent iterative sectional analysis procedure to predict the moment-rotation relationship of the PTED connection. Based on this analytical model, a simple design procedure for PTED connections is described. In the experimental study, a cyclic component test was performed on two energy dissipating bars and a cyclic test was conducted on a large-scale exterior beam-to-column PTED connection. The results of the tests show that the PTED test specimen was able to undergo large inelastic deformations without any damage in the beam or column and without residual drift. The proposed analytical model and design procedure wer...",

W. T. Powers (1991) predicted this negative relationship based on perceptual control theory. Here, 2 studies are presented to (a) confirm the causal role of self-efficacy and (b) substantiate the explanation. In Study 1, self-efficacy was manipulated for 43 of 87 undergraduates on an analytic game. The manipulation was negatively related to performance on the next trial. In Study 2, 104 undergraduates played the analytic game and reported self-efficacy between each game and confidence in the degree to which they had assessed previous feedback. As expected, self-efficacy led to overconfidence and hence increased the likelihood of committing logic errors during the game.",

Nonlinearities arising from the force equilibrium conditions in a beam significantly affect its properties as a constraint element. Consequently, beam-based flexure mechanisms suffer from performance tradeoffs in terms of motion range, accuracy and stiffness, while benefiting from elastic averaging. This paper presents simple yet accurate approximations that capture the effects of load-stiffening and elastokinematic nonlinearities in beams. A general analytical framework is developed that enables a designer to parametrically predict the performance characteristics such as mobility, over-constraint, stiffness variation, and error motions, of beam-based flexure mechanisms without resorting to tedious numerical or computational methods. To illustrate their effectiveness, these approximations and analysis approach are used in deriving the force-displacement relationships of several important beam-based flexure constraint modules, and the results are validated using finite element analysis. Effects of variations in shape and geometry are also analytically quantified.",

We present results from our latest semi-analytic models (SAMs), which employ the main ingredients thought to be important to galaxy formation and evolution, as well as an improved model for reprocessing of starlight by dust to mid- and far-IR wavelengths. These SAMs are based upon a Lambda-CDM hierarchical structural formation scenario, and are successful in reproducing a large variety of observational constraints such as number counts, luminosity and mass functions, and color bimodality. Our fiducial model is based upon a WMAP5 cosmology, and treats dust emission using empirical templates. This model predicts a background flux considerably lower than optical and near-IR measurements that rely on subtraction of zodiacal and galactic foregrounds, and near the lower bounds set by number counts of resolvable sources at a large number of wavelengths. We also show the results of varying cosmological parameters and dust attenuation model used in our SAM. For each EBL prediction, we show how the optical depth due to electron-positron pair-production is affected by redshift and gamma-ray energy, and the effect of gamma-ray absorption on the spectra of a variety of extragalactic sources. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our work, comparisons to other models and key measurements of the EBL and a discussion of how the burgeoning science of gamma-ray astronomy will continue to help constrain cosmology. The low EBL flux predicted by our fiducial model suggests an optimistic future for further studies of distant gamma-ray sources.",

A more streamlined modeling procedure is proposed which serves as a general framework for comparing different models. A duty ratio constraint that defines the diode conduction interval is identified to be the key to accurate prediction of high-frequency behavior. A new duty-ratio constraint is proposed that leads to full-order averaged models of DCM converters. Numerical analyses and experimental measurements confirm that the new models correctly predict the small-signal responses up to one third of the switching frequency and are more accurate than all previous models. Moreover, new analytical results are included to show the origin of the high-frequency pole in DCM operation and to explain why the full-order model is capable of accurately predicting it. Averaged circuit counterparts of the new models are developed in the form of averaged switch models to facilitate circuit simulation.",

A computer implementation of the model is provided using an example of heterotrophicautotrophic competition to illustrate how the observed phenomena can be numerically reproduced and indicating how they might affect overall biofilm performance.",

Various considerations result in the selection of rare earth\u2010transition metal compounds such as Sm2Fe17\u2212xCox for this task. These materials offer a wide range of suitable magnetic ordering temperatures as a function of x. They also show relatively high effective magnetic moments per volume. Molecular field models are developed for analytically predicting entropy changes at and above the ordering temperature. Concomitant adiabatic cooling \u0394T is accordingly computed for these compounds near the ordering temperatures. It is found that for a family of compounds \u0394T values increase somewhat with increasing ordering temperatures due to the decreasing influence of the lattice heat capacity at higher temperatures. Adiabatic cooling of \u0394T=\u22127.5 K at 70 kOe to \u0394T=\u22129.2 K at 70 kOe is predicted for materials Y2Fe17\u2212xCox near their Curie points of 300 and 600 K, respectively (c...",

            "abstract": "This paper presents the results of experimental and analytical studies on the performance of concrete columns externally wrapped wtih carbon and glass fiber reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) sheets. Concrete columns were wrapped with three different types of FRPCs: two carbon and one glass. Confined and unconfined specimens were loaded in uniaxial compression. Axial load and axial and lateral strains were obtained to evaluate stress-strain behavior, ultimate strength, stiffness, and ductility of the wrapped specimens. Results show that external confinement of concrete by FRPC sheets can significantly enhance the strength, ductility, and energy absorption capacity of the concrete specimens. An analytical model to predict the entire stress-strain relationship of concrete specimens wrapped with FRPC sheets was developed. The proposed model consists of two distinct parts. In the first part, the behavior is similar to that of plain concrete, since lateral expansion of the confined concrete is insignificant. The second region, which is mainly dependent on the stiffness of the FRPC, is recognized in which the FRP wrap is fully activated. Comparison between the experimental and analytical results indicates that the model provides satisfactory predictions of the stress-strain response. Results from a series of experimental tests on concrete confined with FRP sheets available in the literature are also compared favorably with results obtained by the model.",
