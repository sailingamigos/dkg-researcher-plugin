This paper starts up by showing that a 30% error in predicting the battery capacity of a lithium-ion battery can result in up to 20% performance degradation for a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling algorithm. Next, this paper presents a closed form analytical expression for predicting the remaining capacity of a lithium-ion battery. The proposed high-level model, which relies on online current and voltage measurements, correctly accounts for the temperature and cycle aging effects. The accuracy of the high-level model is validated by comparing it with DUALFOIL simulation results, demonstrating a maximum of 5% error between simulated and predicted data.",

The use of channel power prediction improves the performance of the link adaptation. It is then of interest to take the quality of these predictions into account explicitly when designing an adaptive modulation scheme. We study the optimum design of an adaptive modulation scheme based on uncoded M-QAM modulation assisted by channel prediction for the flat Rayleigh fading channel. The data rate, and in some variants the transmit power, are adapted to maximize the spectral efficiency subject to average power and bit error rate constraints. The key issues studied here are how a known prediction error variance affects the optimized transmission properties such as the SNR boundaries that determine when to apply different modulation rates, and to what extent it affects the spectral efficiency. This investigation is performed by analytical optimization of the link adaptation, using the statistical properties of a particular but efficient channel power predictor. Optimum solutions for the rate and transmit power are derived based on the predicted SNR and the prediction error variance.",

The model is based on physical properties of dark matter halos, with the three main model inputs being analytic halo density profiles, halo mass functions, and halo-halo spatial correlations, each of which has been well studied in the literature. We demonstrate that this new model can reproduce the power spectrum and bispectrum computed from cosmological simulations of both an n = -2 scale-free model and a low-density cold dark matter model. To enhance the dynamic range of these large simulations, we use the synthetic-halo replacement technique of Ma & Fry, in which the original halos with numerically softened cores are replaced by synthetic halos of realistic density profiles. At high wavenumbers, our model predicts a slope for the nonlinear power spectrum different from the often-used fitting formulas in the literature based on the stable-clustering assumption. Our model also predicts a three-point amplitude, Q, that is scale dependent, in contrast to the popular hierarchical clustering assumption. This model provides a rapid way to compute the mass power spectrum and bispectrum over all length scales where the input halo properties are valid. It also provides a physical interpretation of the clustering properties of matter in the universe.",

The ED bars are detailed to provide energy dissipation without premature fracture at the critical column segment joint. For design purposes, a simplified analytical model to predict the lateral force-displacement response (pushover curve) is proposed. Moreover, a detailed three-dimensional (3D) finite-element (FE) model is developed and utilized to predict the behavior of segmental columns under cyclic loading. Parametric studies using the simplified analytical model and the 3D FE model are conducted to investigate the seismic behavior of this type of column construction. At the end of this paper, the comparisons of the results of the response-history analyses between the segmental columns with flag-shape hysteretic behavior and their comparable conventional counterparts are given.",

Analytic expressions for prediction of the critical force and critical elongation of edge-notched paper webs were developed based on isotropic deformation theory of plasticity and J-integral theory. The analytic expressions were applied to predict the critical force and elongation of paper webs with different edge-notch sizes for six different paper materials. The accuracy of the analytic failure predictions was verified by numerical predictions and experiments on edge-notched paper webs, showing that the developed engineering fracture mechanics analysis procedure predicted failure accurately.",

The nanoparticles, with surface bound drug molecules, are injected into the vascular system upstream from malignant tissue, and are captured at the tumor site using a local applied magnetic field. The applied field is produced by a rare-earth cylindrical magnet positioned outside the body. An analytical expression is derived for predicting the trajectory of a particle as it flows through the microvasculature in proximity to the magnet. In addition, a scaling relation is developed that enables the prediction of the minimum particle radius required for particle capture. The theory takes into account the dominant magnetic and fluidic forces, which depend on the position and properties of the magnet, the size and magnetic properties of the nanoparticles, the dimensions of the microvessel, the hematocrit level of the blood, and the flow velocity. The model is used to study noninvasive drug targeting, and the analysis indicates that submicron particles can be directed to tumors that are several centimeters from the field source.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of \u03b1\u2010amylase inhibitors has been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and two analytical approaches, the Gaussian network model (GNM) and anisotropic network model (ANM). MD simulations use a full atomic approach with empirical force fields, while the analytical approaches are based on a coarse\u2010grained single\u2010site\u2010per\u2010residue model with a single\u2010parameter harmonic potential between sufficiently close (r \u2264 7 \u00c5) residue pairs. The major difference between the GNM and the ANM is that no directional preferences can be obtained in the GNM, all residue fluctuations being theoretically isotropic, while ANM does incorporate directional preferences. The dominant modes of motions are identified by (i) the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the MD trajectory matrices, and (ii) the similarity transformation of the Kirchhoff matrices of inter\u2010residue contacts in the GNM or ANM. The mean\u2010square fluctuations of individual residues and the cross\u2010correlations between domain movements retain the same characteristics, in all approaches\u2014although the dispersion of modes and detailed amplitudes of motion obtained in the ANM conform more closely with MD results. The major weakness of the analytical approaches appears, on the other hand, to be their inadequacy to account for the anharmonic motions or multimeric transitions driven by the slowest collective mode observed in MD. Such motions usually suffer, however, from MD sampling inefficiencies, and multiple independent runs should be tested before making conclusions about their validity and detailed mechanisms. Overall this study invites attention to (i) the robustness of the average properties (mean\u2010square fluctuations, cross\u2010correlations) controlled by the low frequency motions, which are invariably reproduced in all approaches, and (ii) the utility and efficiency of the ANM, the computational time cost of which is of the order of \u201cminutes\u201d (real time), as opposed to \u201cdays\u201d for MD simulations.

Plates of glass, carbon and aramid fibers were bonded to the tension side of the beams using a 2-part epoxy. An interative analytical method was developed to predict the stiffness and maximum strength in bending of the plated beam. Increases in stiffness (over the working load range) from 17 to 99 percent and increases in strength (ultimate) from 40 to 97% were achieved for the beams with FRP plates. Predicted and acutal load-deflection curves showed fairly good agreement, although generally the theoretical curves were stiffer. Experimental failure did not occur in the maximum moment region on many of the beams, despite attempts at end anchorages to postpone local shear failure. The ulltimate loads of the beams that did fail in the maximum region were within about 5% of predicted values.",

BE statistical properties are calculated from approximate analytical solutions of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation associated with the Langevin model, and from computer simulations of domain\u2010wall motion. It is predicted that the amplitude probability distribution P0(\u03a6) of the B flux rate \u03a6 should obey the equation P0(\u03a6)\u221d\u03a6c\u22121\u2009exp(\u2212c\u03a6/\u3008\u03a6\u3009), with c>0. This result implies scaling properties in the intermittent behavior of BE at low magnetization rates, which are described in terms of a fractal structure of fractal dimension D<1. Analytical expressions for the B power spectrum are also derived. Finally, the extension of the theory to the case where many domain walls participate in the magnetization process is discussed.",

The former requires a large amount of simulation time to evaluate each cache configuration while the latter is restricted to measurements of existing caches. An analytical cache model that uses parameters extracted from address traces of programs can efficiently provide estimates of cache performance and show the effects of varying cache parameters. By representing the factors that affect cache performance, we develop an analytical model that gives miss rates for a given trace as a function of cache size, degree of associativity, block size, subblock size, multiprogramming level, task switch interval, and observation interval. The predicted values closely approximate the results of trace-driven simulations, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation cost.",

The reactions contained in the mechanism reflect the current state of knowledge of the chemistry of the hydrogen/air system, and the assigned rate coefficients are consistent with accepted values. It was determined that the mechanism is capable of satisfactorily reproducing the experimental results for a range of conditions relevant to scramjet combustion. Calculations made with the reaction mechanism for representative scramjet combustor conditions at Mach 8, 16, and 25 showed that chemical kinetic effects can be important and that combustor models which use nonequilibrium chemistry should be used in preference to models that assume equilibrium chemistry. For the conditions examined the results also showed the importance of including the HO2 chemistry in the mechanism. For Mach numbers less than 16, the studies suggest that an ignition source will most likely be required to overcome slow ignition chemistry. At Mach 25, the initial temperature and pressure was high enough that ignition was rapid and the presence of an ignition source did not significantly affect reaction rates.",

Attractiveness effects were stronger for males than for females, and stronger when explicit information about competence was absent than when it was present, in keeping with status generalization theory. In partial support of status generalization theory and expectancy theory, attractiveness was related to actual competence in children, but not in adults. Direct measures of competence were influenced strongly more by attractiveness than were indirect measures, as predicted by status generalization theory. implications for theory, organizational policy, and future research are discussed.",

The effective material properties are derived directly from the averages of local momentum, stress, and strain defined in a single doubly coated sphere. It is shown that the effective material parameters predicted by the proposed model are in excellent agreements with the coherent-potential approximation results at low filling fractions where the anisotropy of periodic structures can be neglected for elastic waves. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can reveal clearly the physical mechanism for negative effective material parameters induced by the resonant effect. It is found that negative effective mass density is induced by negative total momentum of the composite for a positive momentum excitation. Negative effective bulk modulus appears for composites with an increasing (decreasing) total volume under a compressive (tensile) stress. Negative effective shear modulus describes composites with axisymmetric deformation under an opposite axisymmetric loading. Numerical examples are also given to illustrate these mechanisms. These findings may be useful in design of elastic metamaterials.",

The concept of a relationship between the bond shear stress and the local slip at the interface between the reinforcement and the matrix for fiber\u2010reinforced, cement\u2010based composites is relatively new. Moreover, the difficulties involved in conducting strain measurements on short discontinuous fibers have made it impossible so far to develop experimental bond shear stress versus slip curves for fiber\u2010reinforced concrete. This paper involves a fundamental study of the bond\u2010stress\u2010slip relationship between steel fibers and concrete. The analysis consists of a primal problem, whereby a complete pullout curve is predicted from an assumed bond\u2010slip relationship, and a dual problem in which the bond\u2010slip relationship is obtained from an experimental pullout curve.

At temperatures well below the charging energy of a dot, disorder leads to a threshold for conduction which grows linearly with the size of the array. For short-ranged interactions, one of the correlation length exponents near threshold is found from a novel argument based on interface growth. The dynamical exponent for the current above threshold is also predicted analytically, and the requirements for its experimental observation are described.",

Comparisons show that the analytical solutions provide reasonable predictions of the flow\u2019s path for initial discharge angles ranging from 0 to 75\u00b0 and initial Froude numbers ranging from 14 to 99. The solutions also predict the maximum height of the outer edge of the jet with reasonable accuracy, and thus the outer spread of the jet is well predicted. However, the inner spread is underestimated and minimum dilution predictions are shown to be conservative by approximately 18% at the centerline maximum height and 34% at the return or impact point. Predictions from the CorJet and VisJet numerical models are also shown to be conservative.",

The model predicts a discrete spectrum having peaks at the characteristic defect frequencies and their harmonics. In the case of an inner race defect or a rolling element defect under a radial load, there are sidebands around each peak. The effect of load and pulse shape on the vibration amplitude has been considered in the model. Typical numerical results for a 6002 deep groove ball bearing have been obtained and plotted. A comparison with the experimental values obtained from published literature shows that the model can be successfully used to predict amplitude ratios among various spectral lines.",

Chapters 2 and 3 combine experimental and analytic techniques respectively to measure and to predict the performance of the A(+ or -) best-first search algorithm, which solves path-finding problems defined in terms of finite strongly connected graphs. In this domain, we make numerous experimental performance measurements varying the heuristic function, the size of the problem, a weighting coefficient, and the performance measure; we derive general formulas in a simpler worst case analysis model that purport to predict the experimental observations when evaluated at particular argument values that correspond to the experimental parameter settings; and we test the analytic predictions against the experimental observations. The A(+ or -) experiments use as case study a randomly generated set of instances of the Eight puzzle of varying size (depth of goal). The analysis in Chapter 3 extends the worst case tree search model of Pohl and others to arbitrary heuristic functions, resulting in cost formulas whose arguments include functions.",

The dispersive term in the advection-dispersion equation can overpredict pore-scale mixing, and thereby overpredict homogeneous chemical reaction. We quantified this experimentally by imaging instantaneous colorimetric reactions between solutions of aqueous CuSO4 and EDTA4- within a 30-cm long translucent chamber packed with cryolite sand that closely matched the optical index of refraction of water. A charge-coupled device camera was used to quantify concentrations of blue CuEDTA2- within the chamber as it was produced by mixing of the two reactants at different flow rates. We compared these experimental results with a new analytic solution for instantaneous bimolecular reaction coupled with advection and dispersion of the product and reactants. For all flow rates, the concentrations of CuEDTA2- recorded in the experiments were about 20% less than predicted by the analytic solution, thereby demonstrating that models assuming complete mixing at the pore scale can overpredict reaction during transport.",

A new concept called \"fatigue modulus,\" which is defined as a slope of applied stress and resultant strain at a specific cycle is introduced. Fatigue modulus degradation is studied using an assumption that the fatigue modulus degrada tion rate follows a power function of fatigue cycle. Theoretical equation for predicting fatigue life is formulated using the fatigue modulus and its degradation rate. This rela tion is simplified by strain failure criterion for the practical application. It is proved that the final formula predicts the fatigue life of a glass fiber epoxy composite material better than S-N curve or Basquin's relation. An attempt is made to find the relation ship between fatigue modulus and elastic modulus by the geometric relation from stress-strain curve under the cyclic loading.",

An analytical technique for predicting the open-circuit magnetic field distribution in the airgap/magnet region of a brushless permanent-magnet DC motor equipped with a surface mounted magnet rotor and a slotless stator was presented in Pt.I. In the present work, the analysis is extended to the prediction of the armature reaction field produced by the three-phase stator windings. As before, th motor model is formulated in polar coordinates and accounts for the large effective airgap, but it is not developed further to consider the effect of winding current harmonics on the airgap field distribution. Predicted instantaneous armature reaction field distributions are validated by a comparison with corresponding finite element calculations. >",

The performance correlations based on these analyses are unable to describe adequately the impact of coal quality on conversion efficiencies and plant performance. A number of advanced bulk analytical techniques, such as FTIR and 13C NMR, provide information on the organic structure of coal.

Findings from 72 studies of rape attitudes and individual differences were quantitatively synthesized. The meta-analysis revealed more rape acceptance for men, older people, and people from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds. For men, cognitive predispositions toward perpetrating rape were strong predictors of rape acceptance. For women, experience as and exposure to rape victims were associated with slightly less rape acceptance. Consistent with some theoretical predictions, traditional gender role beliefs, adversarial sexual beliefs, needs for power and dominance, aggressiveness and anger, and conservative political beliefs predicted rape acceptance. Implications for rape education programs and research are discussed.",

The effects of the vegetation on the flow field are assumed to be expressible in terms of the drag force acting on the vegetation. An analytical solution is obtained for the monochromatic wave whose height decays exponentially. The expressions for the wave number and the exponential decay coefficient derived for arbitrary damping are shown to reduce to those based on linear wave theory and the conservation equation of energy if the damping is small. The analytical solution is compared with 60 test runs conducted using deeply submerged artificial kelp. The calibrated drag coefficients for these runs are found to vary in a wide range and appear to be affected by the kelp motion and viscous effects that are neglected in the analysis. The analytical solution is also shown to be applicable to subaerial vegetation, which is predicted to be much more effective in dissipating wave energy.",

Nonlinear fluid equations can predict backscatter energies the order of the incident laser energy; however, the size of the interaction region and nonlinear effects on the excited electrostatic wave are very important in determining the amount of backscatter. In many cases of contemporary interest for a high power laser incident on a target plasma, the latter effects can play a crucial role in reducing backscatter to a tolerable level.",

The current article draws on recent analytical and software advances to demonstrate that a broad class of MLMs may be estimated as structural equation models (SEMs). Moreover, within the SEM approach it is possible to include measurement models for predictors or outcomes, and to estimate the mediational pathways among predictors explicitly, tasks which are currently difficult with the conventional approach to multilevel modeling. The equivalency of the SEM approach with conventional methods for estimating MLMs is illustrated using empirical examples, including an example involving both multiple indicator latent factors for the outcomes and a causal chain for the predictors. The limitations of this approach for estimating MLMs are discussed and alternative approaches are considered.",

Along the orbit, the ram pressure that this galaxy experiences varies with time. In this paper, we focus on the evolution of the radius and mass of the remaining gas disc, and compare it with the classical analytical estimate proposed by Gunn & Gott. We find that this simple estimate works well in predicting the evolution of the radius of the remaining gas disc. Only if the ram pressure increases faster than the stripping time-scale, the disc radius remains larger than predicted. However, orbits with such short ram pressure peaks are unlikely to occur in other than compact clusters. Unlike the radius evolution, the mass-loss history for the galaxy is not accurately described by the analytical estimate. Generally, in the simulations the galaxy loses its gas more slowly than predicted.",

Using the failure history, the neural-network model automatically develops its own internal model of the failure process and predicts future failures. Because it adjusts model complexity to match the complexity of the failure history, it can be more accurate than some commonly used analytic models. Results with actual testing and debugging data which suggest that neural-network models are better at endpoint predictions than analytic models are presented.<<ETX>>",

There may, however, be reasons to ignore one of the levels of nesting in the data analysis. In this article a three level model with one predictor variable is used as a reference model and the top or intermediate level is ignored in the data analysis. Analytical results show that this has an effect on the estimated variance components and that standard errors of regression coefficients estimators may be overestimated, leading to a lower power of the test of the effect of the predictor variable. The magnitude of these results depends on the ignored level and the level at which the predictor variable varies, and on the values of the variance components and the sample sizes.",

These models are constructed from submodels, termed predictors, of individual plants. Fecundity and survivorship predictors give the fecundity and survivorship of an individual as a function of local population density. Dispersal predictors predict the dispersal pattern of a plant's maternal progeny and the survivorship of plants from seed to seedlings. We develop both computer models and analytically tractable models. Our computer models are designed to determine the population dynamic consequences of specific fecundity, survivorship and dispersal predictors. The analytical models are valid when dispersal is sufficiently large, and are used to explain the predictions of analogous computer models. We show through examples that the predictions of corresponding computer and analytical models may be virtually identical. Empirical tests of these models are practical because all model parameters and functional forms can be estimated with data obtained in a single year. We describe the experiments and statistical methods used to test a neighborhood model. Finally, we describe how neighborhood models can be used to address specific issues in plant ecology and discuss possible extensions of neighborhood theory.",

An analytical solution to the depth-integrated turbulent form of the Navier-Stokes equation is presented that includes lateral shear and secondary flows in addition to bed friction. The novelty of the present approach is not only its inclusion of the secondary flows in the formulation but also its applicability to straight and meandering channels. The analytical solution is applied to a number of channels, at model and field scales, and is also compared with other available methods such as that of Shiono and Knight and the lateral distribution method. The present formulation gives much better predictions of velocity and shear stress, particularly in those cases where the secondary flows are dominant.",

Electromagnetic forces have been identified as the main cause of noise and vibration in these machines, rather than the torque ripple and cogging torque. A procedure for calculating the magnetic forces on the stator teeth based on the 2-D finite-element (FE) method is presented first. An analytical model is then developed to predict the radial displacement along the stator teeth. The displacement calculations from the analytical model are validated with structural finite-element analysis (FEA) and experimental data. Finally, the radial displacement is converted into sound power level. Four different PMSM topologies, suitable for the electric power steering application, are compared for their performances with regard to noise and vibration.",

This prediction applies to two, three and four space-time dimensions. Moreover, the gluon propagator is predicted to be null at p = 0. Numerical studies by several groups indeed support an enhanced ghost propagator when compared to the tree-level behavior $1/p^2$ and a finite infrared gluon propagator. However, the agreement between analytic and numerical studies is only at the qualitative level in three and in four dimensions. In particular, the infrared exponent of the ghost propagator seems to be smaller than the one predicted analytically and the gluon propagator seems to display a (finite) nonzero value at zero momentum. It has been argued that this discrepancy might go away once simulations are done on much larger lattice sizes than the ones used up to now. Here we present data in three and four space-time dimensions using huge lattices in the scaling region, i.e. up to 320^3 at beta = 3.0 and up to 128^4 at beta = 2.2, corresponding to V \\approx (85 fm)^3 and V \\approx (27 fm)^4. Simulations have been done on the IBM supercomputer at the University of Sao Paulo",

            "abstract": "Summary During the 13 years since it was first advanced, the fractal network theory (FNT), an analytic theory of allometric scaling, has been subjected to a wide range of methodological, mathematical and empirical criticisms, not all of which have been answered satisfactorily. FNT presumes a two-variable power-law relationship between metabolic rate and body mass. This assumption has been widely accepted in the past, but a growing body of evidence during the past quarter century has raised questions about its general validity. There is now a need for alternative theories of metabolic scaling that are consistent with empirical observations over a broad range of biological applications. In this article, we briefly review the limitations of FNT, examine the evidence that the two-variable power-law assumption is invalid, and outline alternative perspectives. In particular, we discuss quantum metabolism (QM), an analytic theory based on molecular\u2013cellular processes. QM predicts the large variations in scaling exponent that are found empirically and also predicts the temperature dependence of the proportionality constant, issues that have eluded models such as FNT that are based on macroscopic and network properties of organisms.",

We derived analytically the open-circuit air-gap field distribution, average air-gap flux density, and leakage fluxes. To verify the developed models and analytical method, we adopted finite-element analysis (FEA). We show that for prototype machines, the errors between the FEA and analytically predicted results are <1% for multisegment IPM machines and <2% for multilayer IPM machines. By utilizing the developed lumped magnetic circuit models, the IPM machines can be optimized for maximum fundamental and minimum total harmonic distortion of the air-gap flux density distribution.",

The analytic expressions presented, which involve the solution of one transcendental equation, can predict signal gains and pump absorptions in an amplifier containing an arbitrary number of pumps and signals from arbitrary directions. The gain of an amplifier was measured over a range of more than 20 dB in both pump and signal powers. The measured theoretical results agreed to within 0.5 dB. Although the results described apply explicitly to EDFAs pumped in the 1480-nm region, they are also applicable to EDFAs pumped in the 980-nm region. The method is valid whenever the gain saturation by amplified spontaneous-emission noise can be neglected, which is typically the case for amplifiers with less than about 20 dB of gain.<<ETX>>",

A path analytic model showed that social skills mediated the effect of emotion knowledge on both same- and opposite-sex social preference, but social skills and verbal ability were more strongly related to opposite-sex peer acceptance. These findings suggest that adaptive social skills constitute a mechanism through which children express their emotion knowledge and achieve peer acceptance. Results also supported findings of previous studies that showed that emotion knowledge mediated the effect of verbal ability on social skills. Findings from the present study have specific implications for emotion-centered prevention programs that aim to improve children's socioemotional competence and enhance the likelihood of peer acceptance.",

Based upon Rubin's (1979) research, we tested a family of hypotheses that gender, relative to social class, accounted for more variation in subjective well-being. Examination of zero-order and first-order effect sizes revealed that men have slightly higher subjective well-being than women and that, while gender is a statistically significant predictor of subjective well-being, it accounts for little variance. Three measures of social class, composite socioeconomic status, occupational status, and income also are significantly related to subjective well-being on the zero-order level; but that relation is reduced when gender is used as a covariate. Overall, across the studies we synthesized, gender does not transcend social class as a major determinant of subjective well-being.",

The bending slope and elastic twist at a station are measured using an optical system, and the results correlated with predicted values from a simple beam analysis as well as a refined finite element analysis. A symmetric ply layup results in bending-twist coupling whereas an antisymmetric layup causes extension-twist coupling. Simple analytical results with plane-stress assumption agree better with measured data as well as finite element predictions than with plane-strain assumption. For symmetric layup beams, the bending-induced twist and torsion-induced bending slope are predicted satisfactorily using simple analytical solution. Correlations with measured data, however, are generally improved using a finite element solution. For antisymmetric beams, axial force-induced twist is predicted satisfactorily by both methods.",

It is shown that the unbalanced magnetic force can be significant in machines having a fractional ratio of slot number to pole number, particularly when the electric loading is high. The developed model is validated by finite-element calculations on 9-slot/8-pole and 3-slot/2-pole machines. In addition, the unbalanced magnetic force has been measured on a prototype 3-slot/2-pole machine and shown to be in excellent agreement with predicted results.",

The purpose of this article is to construct a matrix that incorporates as complete information as possible on the relationships among cognitive ability measures, three sets of alternative predictors, and job performance, We build upon a starting matrix used by Schmitt, Rodgers, Chan, Sheppard, and Jennings (1997). Mean differences, by race, for each of the measures and the potential for adverse impact of predictor composites are also considered. We demonstrate that the use of alternative predictors alone to predict job performance (in the absence of cognitive ability) lowers the potential for adverse impact. However, in contrast to recent claims, adverse impact continues to occur at many commonly used selection ratios. Future researchers are encouraged to use our matrix and to expand upon it as new primary research becomes available. We also report and reaffirm many methodological lessons along the way, including the many judgment calls that appear in an effort of this magnitude and a reminder that the field could benefit from even greater conceptual care regarding what is labeled an \u201calternative predictor.\u201d Directions for future meta-analyses and for future primary research activities are also derived.",

There was no evidence that these aggregated effect sizes were moderated by variables such as the type of IQ measure, outcome, age, or intervention. In simulations of the capacity of variables with effect sizes of .03 and .001 for predicting response to intervention, we found little evidence of practical significance.",

            "abstract": "Recently it has been proposed that a strange logarithmic expression for the so-called Barbero-Immirzi parameter, which is one of the ingredients that are necessary for Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) to predict the correct black hole entropy, is not another sign of the inconsistency of this approach to quantization of General Relativity, but is rather a meaningful number that can be independently justified in classical GR. The alternative justification involves the knowledge of the real part of the frequencies of black hole quasinormal states whose imaginary part blows up. In this paper we present an analytical derivation of the states with frequencies approaching a large imaginary number plus ln 3 / 8 pi M; this constant has been only known numerically so far. We discuss the structure of the quasinormal states for perturbations of various spin. Possible implications of these states for thermal physics of black holes and quantum gravity are mentioned and interpreted in a new way. A general conjecture about the asymptotic states is stated. Although our main result lends some credibility to LQG, we also review some of its claims in a critical fashion and speculate about its possible future relevance for Quantum Gravity.",

By including the effect of the interaction between the pole transitions and slot openings, the model is able to predict the airgap field and magnetic forces with high accuracy, which cannot be achieved using the previously available analytical methods. The results of electromagnetic forces, i.e., the cogging torque and unbalanced magnetic pull, computed analytically agree well with numerical simulations using the finite-element method. The model is used to analyze the magnetic forces developed in permanent magnet brushless motors when the design parameters vary in wide ranges. The model is useful in design and optimization of permanent magnet motors.",

This paper proposes analytical models for predicting the cache contention and throughput of heavily multithreaded architectures such as Sun Microsystems' Niagara. First, it proposes a novel probabilistic model to accurately predict the number of extra cache misses due to cache contention for significantly larger numbers of threads than possible with prior analytical cache contention models. Then it presents a Markov chain model for analytically estimating the throughput of multicore, fine-grained multithreaded architectures. The Markov model uses the number of stalled threads as the states and calculates transition probabilities based upon the rates and latencies of events stalling a thread. By modeling the overlapping of the stalls among threads and taking account of cache contention our models accurately predict system throughput obtained from a cycle-accurate performance simulator with an average error of 7.9%. We also demonstrate the application of our model to a design problem\u2014optimizing the design of fine-grained multithreaded chip multiprocessors for application-specific workloads\u2014yielding the same result as detailed simulations 65 times faster. Moreover, this paper shows that our models accurately predict cache contention and throughput trends across varying workloads on real hardware\u2014a Sun Fire T1000 server.",

Estimation of cosmic-ray neutron spectra in the atmosphere has been an essential issue in the evaluation of the aircrew doses and the soft-error rates of semiconductor devices. We therefore performed Monte Carlo simulations for estimating neutron spectra using the PHITS code in adopting the nuclear data library JENDL-High-Energy file. Excellent agreements were observed between the calculated and measured spectra for a wide altitude range even at the ground level. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the simulation results, we propose analytical functions that can predict the cosmic-ray neutron spectra for any location in the atmosphere at altitudes below 20 km, considering the influences of local geometries such as ground and aircraft on the spectra. The accuracy of the analytical functions was well verified by various experimental data.",

EDCA provides class-based differentiated QoS to IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The main contribution of this paper opposed to other works is that the model predicts the throughput, delay and frame dropping probabilities of the different traffic classes in the whole range from a lightly loaded, non-saturated channel to a heavily congested, saturated medium. Furthermore, the model describes differentiation based on different AIFS-values, in addition to the other adjustable parameters (i.e. window-sizes, retransmission limits, TXOP lengths etc.) also encompassed by previous models. AIFS differentiation is described by a simple equation that enables access points to predict at which traffic loads starvation of a traffic class will occur. The model is calculated numerically and validated against simulation results. We observed a good match between the analytical model and simulations.",

It has been shown that the current in partially short-circuited turns is dependent on their relative position in the slot where the phase winding is accommodated, and the slot-leakage flux associated with these turns has a significant influence on the short-circuit current when a remedial action has been applied. An analytical model that quantifies the variation of the slot-leakage flux as a function of the relative position of partially short-circuited turns has been developed. Both finite-element analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for predicting the short-circuit current.",

The children were selected from two elementary schools with historically low achievement in reading. Sixty children received training in both analytic and synthetic awareness skills, and 40 children constituted a no-treatment control group. Pretest measures included assessment of phonological awareness, phonological memory and naming rate, letter knowledge, reading and spelling, and general verbal ability. Growth in phonological awareness was assessed during the middle and at the end of the training period. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to estimate individual growth curves in phonological awareness for children in both the treatment and control groups. Initial comparisons between children in the two groups indicated substantial overall training effects in phonological awareness for children in the treatment group. For children in the training group, the model that best predicted growth in analytic awareness included invented spelling and general verbal ability, while growth in synthetic awareness was predicted best by a combination of invented spelling and rapid automatic naming of digits.",

In these devices, nanowires or nanoparticles are typically in contact with another surface. The contact between a nanowire and a nanoparticle with a substrate forms a constriction of the order of a few nanometers. A continuum description of heat transport at these nanosized constrictions will break down. In this paper, an analytical model is presented in which the relevant length scales have been taken into consideration. The results show that the constriction resistance of nanoconstrictions is much higher than those predicted using macroscopic approaches. The Knudsen number is the key parameter for constriction formed between the same materials, whereas the microscopic Biot number based on phonon thermal boundary resistance is the key parameter for constriction formed between dissimilar materials. Finally, the model is applied to calculate the thermal resistance of the nanowire/planar interface.",

Such factors as the accessibility of information on the construction of bomb devices, relative ease of manufacturing, mobility and portability, coupled with significant property damage and injuries, are responsible for significant increase in bomb attacks all over the world. In most of cases, structural damage and the glass hazard have been major contributors to death and injury for the targeted buildings. Following the events of September 11, 2001, the so-called \u201cicon buildings\u201d are perceived to be attractive targets for possible terrorist attacks. Research into methods for protecting buildings against such bomb attacks is required. Several analysis methods available to predict the loads from a high explosive blast on buildings are examined. Analytical and numerical techniques are presented and the results obtained by different methods are compared. A number of examples are given.",

The use of these analytical equations to trade-off different SRM attributes is discussed. The various approximations and simplifications used in the development of the analytical design equations are justified using results obtained from a detailed computer model of the SRM and by using experimental results from a high power density SRM designed for an aircraft engine fuel pumping application. Comparisons of predicted and measured machine performance parameters for this 90 kW 25000 RPM machine, such as flux linkage curves, back EMF, electromechanical power converted, and inverter volt-ampere requirements are presented. It is also shown that there exists a fundamental maximum torque density that is attainable with the SRM and an estimate of this maximum torque density limit is given. The power factor for a SRM is defined and the machine parameters that determine its value are presented. This power factor is compared to the similarly defined power factor for an AC machine and found to be smaller.<<ETX>>",

The dynamic milling system is formulated as a function of cutter geometry, the frequency response of the machine tool structure at the cutting zone in three Cartesian directions, cutter engagement conditions and material property. The dynamic milling system with nonlinearities and periodic delayed differential equations is reduced to a three dimensional linear stability problem by approximations based on the physics of milling. The chatter stability lobes are predicted in the frequency domain using the proposed analytical solution, and verified experimentally in milling a Titanium alloy with a face milling cutter having circular inserts.",

An analytic form of the sensitivity of the pinhole collimator is derived in this paper.

Although previous experimental studies have shown that using fiber-reinforced polymer FRP sheets for torsion strengthening of reinforced concrete RC beams is an effective solution in many situations, very few analytical models are available for predicting the section capacity. None of these models predicted the full behavior of RC beams wrapped with FRP, account for the fact that the FRP is not bonded to all beam faces, or predicted the ultimate FRP strain using equations developed based on testing FRP strengthened beams in torsion. In this paper, an analytical model was developed for the case of the RC beams strengthened in torsion. The model is based on the basics of the modified compression field theory, the hollow tube analogy, and the compatibility at the corner of the cross section. Several modifications were implemented to be able to take into account the effect of various parameters including various strengthening schemes where the FRP is not bonded to all beam faces, FRP contribu- tion, and different failure modes. The model showed good agreement with the experimental results. The model predicted the strength more accurately than a previous model, which will be discussed later. The model predicted the FRP strain and the failure mode.",

In this paper, we present a file prefetching mechanism that is based on on-line analytic modeling of interesting system events and is transparent to higher levels. The mechanism, incorporated into a client's file cache manager, seeks to build semantic structures that capture the intrinsic correlations between file accesses. It then heuristically uses these structures to represent distinct file usage patterns and exploits them to prefetch files from a file server. We show results of a simulation study and of a working implementation. Measurements suggest that our method can predict future file accesses with an accuracy around 90%, that it can reduce cache miss rate by up to 47% and application latency by up to 40%. Our method imposes little overhead, even under antagonistic circumstances.",

An extensive series of experimental tests of four types of seismic isolation bearings\u2014two types of high-damping rubber bearings, one type of lead-rubber bearing and one type of silicon rubber bearing\u2014was carried out with the objective of fully identifying their mechanical characteristics. The proposed model is capable of well-predicting the mechanical properties of each type of elastomeric bearing into the large strain range. Earthquake simulator tests were also conducted after the loading tests of the individual bearings. In order to show the validity of the proposed model, non-linear dynamic analyses were conducted to simulate the earthquake simulator test results. Good agreement between the experimental and analytical results shows that the model can be an effective numerical tool to predict not only the peak response value but also the force\u2013displacement relationship of the isolators and floor response spectra for isolated structures. \u00a9 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Recommended procedures for determining analysis parameters for efficient delamination growth predictions using the Abaqus/Standard cohesive element and relatively coarse meshes are provided for single and mixed-mode loading. The Abaqus cohesive element, COH3D8, and a user-defined cohesive element are used to develop finite element models of the double cantilever beam specimen, the end-notched flexure specimen, and the mixed-mode bending specimen to simulate progressive delamination growth in Mode I, Mode II, and mixed-mode fracture, respectively. The predicted responses are compared with their analytical solutions. The results show that for single-mode fracture, the predicted responses obtained with the Abaqus cohesive element correlate well with the analytical solutions. For mixed-mode fracture, it was found that the response predicted using COH3D8 elements depends on the damage evolution criterion that is used. The energy-based criterion overpredicts the peak loads and load-deflection response. The results predicted using a tabulated form of the BK criterion correlate well with the analytical solution and with the results predicted with the user- written element.",

Such models can be used to improve the design of positioning systems, for example by eliminating some fingerprints and reducing the size of the location fingerprint database. In this paper, we develop a new analytical model that employs proximity graphs for predicting performance of indoor positioning systems based on location fingerprinting. The model allows computation of an approximate probability distribution of error distance given a location fingerprint database based on received signal strength and its associated statistics. The performance results from the simulation and the analytical model are found to be congruent. This model also allows us to perform analysis of the internal structure of location fingerprints. We employ the analysis of the internal structure to identify and eliminate unnecessary location fingerprints stored in the database, thereby saving on computation while performing location estimation.",

Experimental results from various geometry MOS devices are used to verify the trends predicted by the model.

We suggest that for gate capacitance-limited circuits one should reduce the channel length, and for parasitic capacitance-limited circuits one should reduce the gate dielectric thickness to improve circuit performance.",

            "abstract": "Field studies have shown that the driving of a displacement pile into cohesive soil generates large excess pore pressures in the vicinity of the pile. These pore pressures are often larger than the effective overburden pressure and facilitate the installation of the pile. The subsequent increase in bearing capacity of the pile is largely controlled by the dissipation of the excess pore pressures and a consequent increase in the effective stresses acting on the pile. The paper presents a closed formanalytical solution for the radial consolidation of the soil around a driven pile, assuming that the soil skeleton deforms elastically. This assumption is examined in the light of the predicted effective stress changes in the soil and is shown to lead to, a realistic model for the decay of pore pressure near the pile with time after driving. Although the solution may be applied to any initial distribution of excess pore pressure, attention is focussed on that due to the expansion of a cylindrical cavity in an ideal elastic, perfectly plastic soil. The resulting logarithmic variation of excess pore pressure with radius is considered to be close to that generated around a pile as a result of driving. In addition to giving estimates of the time needed for a driven pile to achieve its maximum strength, the solution may also be used in the analysis of pressuremeter tests to provide in-situ measurements of the coefficient of consolidation of the soil.",

Also, asymptotic results from both approximations for small contact angles, as well as an asymptotic result from lubrication theory that is good when the length scale of the drop is large compared with the slip length, are given. The results for the hydrodynamic force also can be used to predict the quasi-steady speed of a drop sliding down an incline.",

Unlike previous authors (Russell &38; Dopita, Tsujimoto et al. and Pilyugin), we assume neither a steepened initial mass function nor selective galactic winds, since among the \u03b1-particle elements only oxygen shows a large deficit relative to iron and a similar deficit is also found in Galactic supergiants. Thus we assume yields and time delays identical to those that we previously assumed for the solar neighbourhood. We include inflow and non-selective galactic winds and consider both smooth and bursting star formation rates, the latter giving a better fit to the age\u2013metallicity relations. We predict essentially solar abundance ratios for primary elements and these seem to fit most of the data within their substantial scatter. Our model for the Large Magellanic Cloud also gives a remarkably good fit to the anomalous Galactic halo stars discovered by Nissen &38; Schuster. \u00a0Our models predict current ratios of Type Ia supernova to core-collapse supernova rates enhanced by 50 and 25 per cent respectively relative to the solar neighbourhood, in fair agreement with ratios found by Cappellaro et al. for Sdm\u2013Im relative to Sbc galaxies, but these ratios are sensitive to detailed assumptions about the bursts and a still higher enhancement in the Large Magellanic Cloud has been deduced from X-ray studies of remnants by Hughes et al. The corresponding ratios integrated over time up to the present are slightly below 1, but they exceed 1 if one compares the Magellanic Clouds with the Galaxy at times when it had the corresponding metallicities.",
