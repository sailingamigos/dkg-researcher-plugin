Various considerations result in the selection of rare earth\u2010transition metal compounds such as Sm2Fe17\u2212xCox for this task. These materials offer a wide range of suitable magnetic ordering temperatures as a function of x. They also show relatively high effective magnetic moments per volume. Molecular field models are developed for analytically predicting entropy changes at and above the ordering temperature. Concomitant adiabatic cooling \u0394T is accordingly computed for these compounds near the ordering temperatures. It is found that for a family of compounds \u0394T values increase somewhat with increasing ordering temperatures due to the decreasing influence of the lattice heat capacity at higher temperatures. Adiabatic cooling of \u0394T=\u22127.5 K at 70 kOe to \u0394T=\u22129.2 K at 70 kOe is predicted for materials Y2Fe17\u2212xCox near their Curie points of 300 and 600 K, respectively (c...",

Concrete columns were wrapped with three different types of FRPCs: two carbon and one glass. Confined and unconfined specimens were loaded in uniaxial compression. Axial load and axial and lateral strains were obtained to evaluate stress-strain behavior, ultimate strength, stiffness, and ductility of the wrapped specimens. Results show that external confinement of concrete by FRPC sheets can significantly enhance the strength, ductility, and energy absorption capacity of the concrete specimens. An analytical model to predict the entire stress-strain relationship of concrete specimens wrapped with FRPC sheets was developed. The proposed model consists of two distinct parts. In the first part, the behavior is similar to that of plain concrete, since lateral expansion of the confined concrete is insignificant. The second region, which is mainly dependent on the stiffness of the FRPC, is recognized in which the FRP wrap is fully activated. Comparison between the experimental and analytical results indicates that the model provides satisfactory predictions of the stress-strain response. Results from a series of experimental tests on concrete confined with FRP sheets available in the literature are also compared favorably with results obtained by the model.",

Our method aims at rare events, which currently cannot be predicted with traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, since these currently are limited to time scales shorter than a few nanoseconds. Given an initial conformation of the system, our method identifies one or more product states, which may be separated from the initial state by free energy barriers that are large on the scale of thermal energy. It also provides an approximate reaction path, which can be used to determine barrier heights or reaction rates with the usual techniques. The method employs an artificial potential that destabilizes the initial conformation and, thereby, lowers free energy barriers of structural transitions. As a result, transitions are accelerated and may be observed in MD simulations. An analytical estimate for the acceleration factor is given. The method is applied to two test systems, an argon microcluster and a simplified protein model. By these studies we demonstrated that our method is capable of shortening mean transition times from 0.5 \\ensuremath{\\mu}s (argon cluster) and 1.4 ns (protein model) to a few picoseconds. These results suggest that our method is particularly well suited to study biochemically relevant conformational motions in proteins at a microsecond time scale.",

The present paper is concerned with the development and application of an analytical model of cyclic crack growth that includes the effects of crack closure. The model was based on a concept like the Dugdale model, but was modified to leave plastically deformed material in the wake of the advancing crack tip. The model was used to correlate crack growth rates under constant-amplitude loading and to predict crack growth under aircraft spectrum loading on 2219-T851 aluminum alloy plate material. The predicted crack growth lives agreed well with experimental data. The ratio of predicted-to-experimental lives ranged from 0.66 to 1.48. These predictions were made using data from an ASTM Task Group E24.06.01 round-robin analysis.",

Researchers generally establish the construct validity of a measure by correlating it with a number of other measures and arguing from the pattern of correlations that the measure is associated with these variables in theoretically predictable ways. This article presents 2 simple metrics for quantifying construct validity that provide effect size estimates indicating the extent to which the observed pattem of correlations in a convergent-discriminant validity matrix matches the theoretically predicted pattern of correlations. Both measures, based on contrast analysis, provide simple estimates of validity that can be compared across studies, constructs, and measures meta-analytically, and can be implemented without the use of complex statistical procedures that may limit their accessibility.",

Participants solved problems selected from the Raven's Progressive Matrices Test, a test known to predict performance on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In three conditions, participants solved problems requiring (1) analytic reasoning; (2) figural or visuospatial reasoning; or (3) simple pattern matching that served as a perceptual-motor control. Right frontal and bilateral parietal regions were activated more by figural than control problems. Bilateral frontal and left parietal, occipital, and temporal regions were activated more by analytic than figural problems. All of these regions were activated more by analytic than match problems. Many of these activations occurred in regions associated with working memory. Figural reasoning activated areas involved in spatial and object working memory. Analytic reasoning activated additional areas involved in verbal working memory and domain-independent associative and executive processes. These results suggest that fluid reasoning is mediated by a composite of working memory systems.",

By exploiting the intuitive features of the recently proposed capture/emission time (CET) maps [1, 2], we suggest an analytic model capable of handling a wide number of BTI stress and recovery patterns. As the model captures both the temperature- and bias- dependence of the degradation, it allows for realistic lifetime extrapolation. Compared to available models which do not consider the saturation of the degradation, our model predicts considerably more optimistic lifetimes.",

This theoretical analysis is based on the observed deformation mechanisms, and can, in principle, be developed to predict the elastic properties of other micro-lattice structures. The analytical solutions are verified by comparing the predictions with FEM data using 1D beam and 3D solid elements and uniaxial compression tests on samples fabricated by selective laser melting. The FEM predictions using the 3D solid elements agree well with the experimental data for a wide range of strut aspect ratios, d/L. In addition, the range of applicability of the analytical model and the FEM predictions using beam elements are clarified.",

Recently, the demand for synthetic receptors is rapidly increasing within the analytical sciences. These classes of receptors are finding uses in simple indicator chemistry, cellular imaging, and enantiomeric excess analysis, while also being involved in various truly practical assays of bodily fluids. Moreover, one of the most promising areas for the use of synthetic receptors is in the arena of differential sensing. Although many synthetic receptors have been shown to yield exquisite selectivities, in general, this class of receptor suffers from cross-reactivities. Yet, cross-reactivity is an attribute that is crucial to the success of differential sensing schemes. Therefore, both selective and nonselective synthetic receptors are finding uses in analytical applications. Hence, a field of chemistry that herein is entitled \"Supramolecular Analytical Chemistry\" is emerging, and is predicted to undergo increasingly rapid growth in the near future.",

A reduced path model yielded results generally consistent with the model's expectations. When the sample was disaggregated by sex, however, notable differences in the path model were indicated. For women, social integration had a somewhat stronger direct effect on voluntary freshman year persistence/withdrawal decisions than academic integration, whereas the reverse was true for males. Additional analysis suggested significant compensatory interaction between social and academic integration and between institutional and goal commitment. In terms of the magnitude of its positive influence on persistence, academic integration was most important for students with low levels of social integration, and vice versa. A similar relationship existed for the Goal Commitment X Institutional Commitment interaction. Student withdrawal from postsecondary",

A three-step analytical and numerical approach was carried out to predict the shapes of manufactured structures and thermal loadings induced by the DMD process. First, powder temperature was calculated using a recent analytical model, then the geometry of walls was predicted by a combined numerical + analytical modelling using a discretization of the physical interaction domain, and finally, a finite element calculation was carried out on COMSOL 3.3 Multiphysics software to describe thermal behaviour during DMD of a titanium alloy. Our thermal model takes into account the moving interface during metal deposition with a specific function \u03ba (t, x, y, z) allowing the conductivity front to move simultaneously with the moving laser source (with an appropriate spatial energy distribution), thus representing rather precisely the DMD process. This allowed us to provide an adequate representation of temperatures near the melt-pool, and to reproduce with a good accuracy thermal cycles and melt-pool dimensions during the construction of up to 25-layer walls. This was confirmed by comparisons with experimental thermocouple data T = f(t), and fast camera melt-pool recording.",

On the basis of 102 coefficients and 10,640 people, situational judgment tests showed useful levels of validity (rho = .34) that were generalizable. A review of 79 correlations between situational judgment tests and general cognitive ability involving 16,984 people indicated that situational judgment tests typically evidence relationships with cognitive ability (rho = .46). On the basis of the literature review and meta-analytic findings, implications for the continued use of situational judgment tests are discussed, particularly in terms of recent investigations into tacit knowledge.",

The theory is in quantitative agreement with simulations for central-force systems and predicts the vanishing of the shear modulus at the isostatic point with the linear law {mu}{approx}(z-2d), where z is the coordination number. The vanishing of rigidity at the isostatic point is shown to be a consequence of the canceling out of positive affine and negative nonaffine terms.",

The whole field domain is divided into four types of simple subdomains, viz. magnets, air-gap, slot openings, and slots. The analytical expression of each subdomain is derived and the field solution is obtained by applying the boundary conditions and interface conditions between subdomains. Compared with the conventional subdomain models, the subdomain model accounting for tooth-tips can accurately predict the flux density inside the slots. Based on the developed field model, the cogging torque is computed by the Maxwell stress tensor. The finite element analysis is carried out to validate the analytical model. It shows that the developed subdomain model accounting for tooth-tips is more accurate, especially for the machines having larger slot opening width compared with tooth-tip height.",

Many have proposed models to be able to extract the film modulus ( E _f) from the measured substrate-affected modulus, assuming that the film thickness ( t ) and substrate modulus ( E _s) are known. Existing analytic models work well if the film is more compliant than the substrate. However, no analytic model accurately predicts response when the modulus of the film is more than double the modulus of the substrate. In this work, a new analytic model is proposed. This new model is shown by finite-element analysis to be able to accurately predict composite response over the domain 0.1 < E _f /E _s < 10. Finally, the new model is used to analyze experimental data for compliant films on stiff substrates and stiff films on compliant substrates.",

Previous numerical simulations have suggested that complex niche-structured models produce species abundance distributions (SADs) that are qualitatively similar to those of very simple neutral models that ignore differences between species. However, in the absence of an analytical treatment of niche models, one cannot tell whether the two classes of model produce the same patterns via similar or different mechanisms. We present an analytical proof that, in the limit as diversity becomes large, a strong niche model give rises to exactly the same asymptotic form of SAD as the neutral model, and we verify the analytical predictions for a Panamanian tropical forest data set. Our results strongly suggest that neutral processes drive patterns of relative species abundance in high-diversity ecological communities, even when strong niche structure exists. However, neutral theory cannot explain what generates high diversity in the first place, and it may not be valid in low-diversity communities. Our results also confirm that neutral theory cannot be used to infer an absence of niche structure or to explain ecosystem function.",

The source which occurs quite early in the life of a specimen or component is matrix cracking, the subject of this paper. While most laboratories now report stiffness changes, very little systematic philosophy has been developed to account for and explain such stiffness changes. The complexity of this situation requires systematic study, and motivates the search for a model, or models, which can describe the behavior and predict unfamiliar response. The present paper reports the results of an experimental program and an analytical modelling exercise which indicate that much of the observed matrix cracking can be predicted and the effects on stiffness calculated with various degrees of accuracy depending upon the sophistication of the model used.",

Conflict prediction is based on trajectory prediction and is less certain the farther in advance the prediction, however. An estimate is therefore needed of the probability that a conflict will occur, given a pair of predicted trajectories and their levels of uncertainty. This paper presents a method to estimate that conflict probability. The trajectory prediction errors are modeled as normally distributed, and the two error covariances for an aircraft pair are combined into a single, equivalent covariance of the relative position. A coordinate transformation is then used to derive an analytical solution. Numerical examples and a Monte Carlo validation are presented. (Author)",

Methods to accomplish such predictions must account for uncertainties in observation, sampling, models, and parameters. Statistical methods for spatiotemporal processes are powerful, yet difficult to implement in complicated high-dimensional settings. However, recent advances in hierarchical formulations for such processes can be utilized for ecological prediction. These formulations are able to account for the various sources of uncertainty and can incorporate scientific judgment in a probabilistically consistent manner. In particular, analytical diffusion models can serve as motivation for the hierarchical model for invasive species. We demonstrate by example that such a framework can be utilized to predict, spatially and temporally, the relative population abundance of House Finches over the eastern United States.

Moreover, there is increasing skepticism about the importance of contagion and, as has long been known, S-shaped diffusion curves can also result from heterogeneity in the propensity to adopt. We present hypotheses about conditions under which specific contagion mechanisms and income heterogeneity are more pronounced, and test these hypotheses using a meta-analysis of the q/p ratio in applications of the Bass diffusion model. The ratio is positively associated with the Gini index of income inequality in a country, supporting the heterogeneity-in-thresholds interpretation. The ratio also varies as predicted by the Gamma-Shifted Gompertz diffusion model, but the evidence vanishes after controlling for national culture. As to contagion, the q/p ratio varies with the four Hofstede dimensions of national culture-for three of them in a direction consistent with the social contagion interpretation. Furthermore, products with competing standards have a higher q/p ratio, which is again consistent with the social contagion interpretation. Finally, we find effects of national culture only for products without competing standards, suggesting that technological effects and culturally moderated social contagion effects might not operate independently from each other.",

These model composites allow the L/D dependence of the electrical percolation threshold, \u03d5c, to be isolated for finite\u2010L/D particles. Experimental \u03d5c values decrease with increasing L/D, as predicted qualitatively by analytical percolation models. However, quantitative agreement between experimental data and both soft\u2010core and core\u2013shell analytical models is not achieved, because both models are strictly accurate only in the infinite\u2010L/D limit. To address this analytical limitation, a soft\u2010core simulation method to calculate \u03d5c and network conductivity for cylinders with finite L/D are developed. Our simulated \u03d5c results agree strongly with our experimental data, suggesting i) that the infinite\u2010aspect\u2010ratio assumption cannot safely be made for experimental networks of particles with L/D < 35 and ii) in predicting \u03d5c, the soft\u2010core model makes a less significant assumption than the infinite\u2010L/D models do. The demonstrated capability of the simulations to predict \u03d5c in the finite\u2010L/D regime will allow researchers to optimize the electrical properties of polymer nanocomposites of finite\u2010L/D particles.",

EF contributed to the prediction of all academic domains beyond general intellectual functioning in distinct ways: Conceptual flexibility predicted reading and science, monitoring predicted reading and social studies, and inhibition predicted mathematics and science. These findings suggest that demands related to specific academic domains access different cognitive abilities and have implications for both intervention and research science.",

We compare these analytic calculations to numerical simulations and use them to develop a sub-grid model of BH growth that can be incorporated into semi-analytic calculations or cosmological simulations. Motivated by both analytic calculations and simulations of gas inflow in galactic nuclei, we argue that the strongest torque on gas arises when non-axisymmetric perturbations to the stellar gravitational potential produce orbit crossings and shocks in the gas. This is true both at large radii \u223c0.01\u20151 kpc, where bar-like stellar modes dominate the non-axisymmetric potential, and at smaller radii \u227210 pc, where a lopsided/eccentric stellar disc dominates. The traditional orbit-crossing criterion is not always adequate to predict the locations of, and inflow due to, shocks in gas+stellar discs with finite sound speeds. We derive a modified criterion that predicts the presence of shocks in stellar-dominated systems even absent formal orbit crossing. We then derive analytic expressions for the loss of angular momentum and the resulting gas inflow rates in the presence of such shocks. We test our analytic predictions using hydrodynamic simulations at a range of galactic scales, and show that they successfully predict the mass inflow rates and quasi-steady gas surface densities with a small scatter \u22430.3 dex. We use our analytic results to construct a new estimate of the BH accretion rate given galaxy properties at larger radii, for use in galaxy and cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. While highly simplified, this accretion rate predictor captures the key scalings in the numerical simulations. By contrast, alternate estimates such as the local viscous accretion rate or the spherical Bondi rate fail systematically to reproduce the simulations and have significantly larger scatter.",

            "abstract": "An analytic model of free-surface flow over an erodible bed is developed and used to investigate the stability of the fluid-bed interface and the characteristics of the bed features. The model is based on the potential flow over a two-dimensional, moving, wavy bed with a sinusoidal profile of varying amplitude, and a sediment transport relation in which the transport rate is proportional to a power of the fluid velocity at the level of the bed. By assuming that the dominant wavelength is that for which the rate of amplitude growth is the greatest, expressions are obtained for the wavelength and velocity of the bed features. In addition, conditions for the occurrence of the different configurations, dunes, flat bed, and antidunes, are found from the model. The predicted wavelengths of antidunes and ranges of wavelengths of dunes, and the predicted conditions for change of bed configuration are found to be in good agreement with experimental data. Finally, brief consideration is given to the factors involved in determining the maximum heights of the bed features and surface waves.",

The analytic solution, which is in good agreement with the numerical solution, is utilized to obtain an expression for the thermal focusing due to temperature\u2010induced refractive index changes. For Nd:YAG, 1 W of pump power deposited as heat is predicted to cause a thermal focusing length comparable to the cavity length of a typical diode end\u2010pumped laser.",

Methods: We conducted a meta-analytic review of 111 TRA/TPB and exercise studies and examined the influences of five moderator variables. Results: We found that: a) exercise was most strongly associated with intention and perceived behavioral control; b) intention was most strongly associated with attitude; and c) intention predicted exercise behavior, and attitude and perceived behavioral control predicted intention. Also, the time interval between intention to behavior; scale correspondence; subject age; operationalization of subjective norm, intention, and perceived behavioral control; and publication status moderated the size of the effect. Conclusions: The TRA/TPB effectively explained exercise intention and behavior and moderators of this relationship. Researcher...",

This paper presents a comprehensive procedure for calculating all contributions to the self-capacitance of high-voltage transformers and provides a detailed analysis of the problem, based on a physical approach. The advantages of the analytical formulation of the problem rather than a finite element method analysis are discussed. The approach and formulas presented in this paper can also be used for other wound components rather than just step-up transformers. Finally, analytical and experimental results are presented for three different high-voltage transformer architectures.",

The technique is based on two-dimensional models in polar coordinates and solves the governing Laplacian/quasi-Poissonian field equations in the airgap/magnet regions without any assumption regarding the relative recoil permeability of the magnets. The analysis works for both internal and external rotor motor topologies, and either radial or parallel magnetized magnets, as well as for overlapping and nonoverlapping stator windings. The paper validates results of the analytical models by finite-element analyses, for both slotless and slotted motors.",

Our model captures the main elements of both theories by incorporating the combined effects of area, isolation, stochastic colonization and extinction processes, habitat heterogeneity, and niche partitioning in a unified, demographically based framework. While classical niche theory predicts a positive relationship between species richness and habitat heterogeneity, our unified model demonstrates that area limitation and dispersal limitation (the main elements of island biogeography) may create unimodal and even negative relationships between species richness and habitat heterogeneity. We attribute this finding to the fact that increasing heterogeneity increases the potential number of species that may exist in a given area (as predicted by niche theory) but simultaneously reduces the amount of suitable area available for each species and, thus, increases the likelihood of stochastic extinction. Area limitation, dispersal limitation, and low reproduction rates intensify the latter effect by increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinction. These analytical results demonstrate that the integration of island biogeography and niche theory provides new insights about the mechanisms that regulate the diversity of ecological communities and generates unexpected predictions that could not be attained from any single theory.",

As predicted, the requirement for rapid responding increased the amount of belief bias observed on the task and reduced the number of logically correct decisions, both effects being substantial and statistically significant. These findings were predicted by the dual-process account of reasoning, which posits that fast heuristic processes, responsible for belief bias, compete with slower analytic processes that can lead to correct logical decisions. Requiring rapid responding thus differentially inhibits the operation of analytic reasoning processes, leading to the results observed.",

These models use response moments (skewness, kurtosis, etc.) to form non\u2010Gaussian contributions, made orthogonal through a Hermite series. First\u2010yield and fatigue failure rates are predicted from these moments, which are often simpler to estimate (from either a time. history or analytical model). Both hardening and softening nonlinear models are developed. These are shown to be more flexible than the conventional Charlier and Edgeworth series, with the ability to reflect wider ranges of nonlinear behavior. Analytical moment\u2010based estimates of spectral densities, crossing rates, probability distributions of the response and its extremes, and fatigue damage rates are formed. These are found to compare well with exact results for various nonlinear models, including nonlinear oscillator responses and quasi\u2010static responses to Morison wave loads.",

Inspired by recent findings from the literature, we take a closer look at the complex detection procedure and model the detected artifacts in the spatial and frequency domain by means of the variance of the prediction residue. We give an exact formulation on how transformation parameters influence the appearance of periodic artifacts and analytically derive the expected position of characteristic resampling peaks. We present an equivalent accelerated and simplified detector, which is orders of magnitudes faster than the conventional scheme and experimentally shown to be comparably reliable.",

Turner (1979) predicted would influence differentiation (group identification, relevance of the dimension of comparison, relevance of the outgroup. and nature of intergroup relations). Analysis of 60 tests revealed that the overall effect of distinctiveness on differentiation was not significantly different from 0, but reactive distinctiveness was found on behavioral differentiation measures, whereas reflective distinctiveness was found on judgmental differentiation measures. Only group identification was a reliable moderator. High identifiers showed reactive distinctiveness, whereas low identifiers showed reflective distinctiveness.",

The authors examined whether variations in knowledge of storybooks (assumed to index factors such as frequency of shared reading) were related to vocabulary scores for 3- to 6-year-olds. In Experiment 1, parents' knowledge of storybooks explained unique variance in children's receptive vocabulary scores after controlling for children's analytic intelligence, parents' exposure to adult reading material, and parents' education. In Experiment 2, children's knowledge of storybooks explained unique variance in their receptive and expressive vocabulary scores after controlling for parents' exposure to print and socioeconomic status level. Children's knowledge of storybooks indexed cognitive factors as well as exposure. The findings obtained in the 2 experiments suggest that storybook experiences during the preschool years may be an important influence on the development of children's language skills.",

The minimum chip thickness effect significantly affects machining process performance in terms of cutting forces, tool wear, surface integrity, process stability, etc. In this paper, an analytical model has been developed to predict the minimum chip thickness values, which are critical for the process model development and process planning and optimization. The model accounts for the effects of thermal softening and strain hardening on the minimum chip thickness. The influence of cutting velocity and tool edge radius on the minimum chip thickness has been taken into account. The model has been experimentally validated with 1040 steel and A16082-T6 over a range of cutting velocities and tool edge radii. The developed model has then been applied to investigate the effects of cutting velocity and edge radius on the normalized minimum chip thickness for various carbon steels with different carbon contents and A16082-T6.",

Results of path analysis of survey data gatheredfrom 166 managers provided moderate support for the proposed model and the pattern of linkages specified among the variables. Results showed education is negatively related to computer anxiety, and external locus of control and math anxiety contribute to increased computer anxiety. Managers' age, education, external locus of control, and thefeeling-thinking dimension of cognitive style are directly related to attitudes toward microcomputers. However, math anxiety and external locus of control affect microcomputer attitudes only indirectly, through their effect on computer anxiety, which is the strongest predictor of negative attitudes toward microcomputers. Implications for the design and success of management information systems involving microcomputers, andfuture research are discussed.",

Objectives: To identify predictors for loneliness in adolescents through a comprehensive review of the literature and to use quantitative meta-analysis to determine the magnitude of the relationships between each predictor and loneliness. Methods: The literature reviewed included 242 studies published or unpublished between 1980 and 2004, of which 95 met the inclusion criteria. Eleven key predictors for loneliness were identified in the 95 studies. A meta-analysis was conducted on each of the 11 predictors in relation to loneliness. Results: Four predictors (gender, depression, shyness, and self-esteem) had large effect sizes, four predictors (social support, social anxiety, maternal expressiveness, and paternal expressiveness) had large medium to medium effect sizes, two predictors (stress and self-disclosure) had low effect sizes, and one predictor (age) had a very low effect size. Discussion: Theories of loneliness served as a framework for interpreting the findings of the meta-analysis. The most powerful predictors can be used in intervention studies aimed at reducing loneliness in adolescents.",

A submerged jet-testing apparatus has been developed and used for characterizing \nsoil erodibility in several applications as cited in the literature. The apparatus has been developed based on knowledge \nof the hydraulic characteristics of a submerged jet and the characteristics of soil erodibility. The test is simple, quick, \nand relatively inexpensive to perform. The test is repeatable and gives consistent results. The coefficients obtained from the \ntest results can be used in current equations to predict erosion. This article provides a description of the apparatus, methodology, \nand procedures for conducting jet tests in the field. An example case is also presented to illustrate the use of test results \nto predict erosion in an earthen channel. The estimated average erosion, for the example case of an open channel test based \non jet test results, was 15.7 cm (6.2 in.) and the measured average centerline erosion in the open channel flow test was 14.5 \ncm (5.7 in.).",

            "abstract": "The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term (\u226415-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (H20, height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance (Z\u0302*, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing Z\u0302* showed that (i) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (ii) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (Quercus rubra) and mesic (codominance by Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (Thuja occidentalis) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g., Fraxinus nigra, A. rubrum).",

In this work we present a steric mass-action (SMA) ion-exchange equilibrium formalism, which explicitly accounts for the steric hindrance of salt counterions upon protein binding in multicomponent equilibria. An analytical solution has been derived for the calculation of isotachic effluent profiles of displaced proteins and induced salt gradients under ideal chromatographic conditions. A stability analysis has been employed to establish the order of the feed components in the displacement train. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental results for the separation of proteins by cation-exchange displacement chromatography. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the SMA formalism in predicting complex behavior present in ion-exchange displacement systems. Furthermore, the analytical solution of ideal isotachic displacement profiles with the SMA formalism enables rapid methods development and optimization of ion-exchange displacement separations.",

Although they are used for forest management and are able to predict dynamics of real forests, they are also analytically intractable, which limits their usefulness to basic scientists. We have developed a new spatial individual-based forest model that includes a perfect plasticity formulation for crown shape. Its structure allows us to derive an accurate approximation for the individual-based model that predicts mean densities and size structures using the same parameter values and functional forms, and also it is analytically tractable. The approximation is represented by a system of von Foerster partial differential equations coupled with an integral equation that we call the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA). We have derived a series of analytical results including equilibrium abundances for trees of different crown shapes, stability conditions, transient behaviors, such as the constant yield law and self-thinning exponents, and two species coexistence conditions.",

In this letter, we propose a simple analytical model to predict the delay degradation of a wide class of digital logic gate based on both worst case and activity dependent threshold voltage change under NBTI. We show that by knowing the threshold voltage degradation of a single transistor due to NBTI, one can predict the performance degradation of a circuit with a reasonable degree of accuracy. We find that digital circuits are much less sensitive (approximately 9.2% performance degradation in ten years for 70 nm technology) to NBTI degradation than previously anticipated.",

These hypotheses, derived from the social psychological literature on stereotyping, predicted that salience of applicant sex, job sex-type, sex of rater, and amount of job-relevant information would affect discrimination against female and male applicants. Generally, the hypotheses concerning job sex-type and job-relevant information were supported. Female and male applicants received lower ratings when being considered for an opposite-sex-type job, and the difference between ratings of males and females decreased as more job-relevant information was provided. However, ratings of males and females did not differ as hypothesized in regard to salience of sex and rater sex. The research and practice implications of these results are discussed.",

Interventions specifically focused on changing self-esteem and self-concept were significantly more effective (mean effect size = 0.57) than programs focused on another target, such as behavior or social skills (0.10). Treatment programs were also more effective (0.47) than primary prevention programs (0.09) in changing self-esteem. Four variables emerged as significant predictors of self-esteem outcomes: 2 methodological features (type of design and control group), the use of a theoretical or empirical rationale, and the type of program (treatment or prevention). Future research needs to examine the causal connection between changes occurring in self-esteem and other areas of adjustment, assess intervention success for different ethnic groups and for children of different ages and sex, and determine the long-term impact of interventions.",

Electromagnetic forces have been identified as the main cause of noise and vibration in these machines rather than the torque ripple and cogging torque. A procedure for calculating the magnetic forces on the stator teeth based on the 2D finite element (FE) method is presented first. An analytical model is then developed to predict the radial displacement along the stator teeth. The displacement calculations from analytical model are validated with structural FEA and experimental data. Finally, the radial displacement is converted into sound power level. Four different PMSM topologies suitable for electric power steering application are compared for their performances with regards to noise and vibration.",

Numerous formulas are derived to predict the external coupling Q values, and intrinsic whispering gallery loss, for arbitrary structures, and for any sphere mode. Phase-mismatch due to the differences in propagation constants between input and sphere modes is taken into account. These formulas are strictly mechanical once a simple characteristic equation is solved which relates the spherical mode orders to the resonant wave vector. Results are in very good agreement with values that are calculated by different numerical methods.",

Specifically, the authors predicted that arm flexion would elicit a heuristic processing strategy and bolster insight processes, whereas arm extension would elicit a systematic processing strategy and impair insight processes. To test these predictions, the authors assessed the effects of these motor actions on 3 central elements of creative insight: contextual set-breaking, restructuring, and mental search. As predicted, in 6 experiments, arm flexion, relative to arm extension, facilitated insight-related processes. In a 7th experiment, arm extension, relative to arm flexion, facilitated analytical reasoning, supporting a cognitive tuning interpretation of the findings.",

One of the most attractive applications of FRP materials is their use as confining devices for concrete columns, which may result in remarkable increases of strength and ductility as indicated by numerous published experimental results. Despite a large research effort, a proper analytical tool to predict the behavior of FRP-confined concrete has not yet been established. Most of the available models are empirical in nature and have been calibrated against their own sets of experimental data. On the other hand, the experimental results available in the literature encompass a wide range of values of the significant variables. The objective of this work is a systematic assessment of the performance of the existing models on confinement of concrete columns with FRP materials. The study is conducted in the following steps: the experimental data on confinement of concrete cylinders with FRP available in the technical literature are classified according to the values of the significant variables; the existing empirical and analytical models are reviewed, pointing out their distinct features; the whole set of available experimental results is compared with the whole set of analytical models; strengths and weaknesses of the various models are analyzed. Finally, a new equation is proposed to evaluate the axial strain at peak stress of FRP-confined concrete cylinders.",

A 20-item, self-report scale was developed in a series of three factor analytic studies. The internal consistency and test-retest reliabilities of the scale were high. A series of additional studies yielded considerable evidence as to the validity of the scale. The conceptualization of argumentativeness accounts for state as well as trait components. The state components consisted of the individual's perceptions of the probability and importance of success and failure in a particular argumentative situation. A hypothesis was supported which posited response to a particular argument would be predicted better by trait and state components together than by the trait component alone.",

Our analytic results are used to predict levels of variation for the entire third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. The predictions are consistent with the low levels of variation that have been observed at loci near the centromeres of the third chromosome of D. melanogaster. However, the low levels of variation observed near the tips of this chromosome are not predicted using currently available estimates of the deleterious mutation rate and of selection coefficients. If considerably smaller selection coefficients are assumed, the low observed levels of variation at the tips of the third chromosome are consistent with the background selection model.",

The shape comparison method uses the newly described shape multipoles that can also be used to describe the inherent shape of molecules.

This paper examines one of the leading explanations; computerization in the workplace. I offer a theory of computers\u2019 impact on white-collar work which goes far toward explaining the timing, form, and locus of recent labor market changes. The theory looks at the bureaucratic and organizational applications of computers that have been first, largest, and most influential. They have two effects on firms\u2019 demand for labor at different skill levels. Computer decisionmaking has been a substitute for human decisionmaking over a limited range of tasks. Low- and middle-skill white collar work has been the most affected. Substitution of computers for high-skill workers has been quite limited. The rising demand for more highly skilled workers is driven by broad changes in the economics of the firm with many causes including computerization. While this theory is in agreement with many recent analyses pointing to computers, the specifics are quite different. Complementarities between computer use and individual workers\u2019 skills are not an important component of change. This very different view of the mechanisms of skill biased technical change has new implications for understanding labor markets over the last 25 years, for the policy debate, and for predicting the future evolution of labor demand.",

The analytical model can be applied to machines having single-layer, two-radial-layer, or two-circumferential-layer windings. The interaction between spatial harmonics is accurately accounted for in the calculation of the AC copper loss. The investigation shows that neglecting the interaction in the analytical model has negligible influence on the prediction of total AC copper loss but results in significant error in the predicted loss distribution among conductors. The influence of tooth-tip dimension, conductor segmentation, and current on the AC copper loss is also investigated by the analytical model. The finite element analysis has verified the validity of the developed analytical model.",

The micromodelling approach provides a behavioral basis for explaining adoption at the disaggregate level and the consequent pattern of diffusion at the aggregate level. The analytical implications of the model are compared and contrasted with the traditional, aggregate-level, diffusion models. An advantage of our approach is its micro-theory driven flexibility in accommodating various patterns of diffusion. Examples are provided of conditions under which the model yields diffusion patterns identical to those of some well-known aggregate models. A pilot study is reported, outlining procedures for data collection and estimation of the individual-level parameters, and providing a preliminary test of the predictive performance of the model. Measurement of the individual parameters prior to product launch enables potential applications of the model for segmentation of the target population in terms of their expected adoption times.",

Recently, considerable research has been directed to characterize the use of FRP bars and strips as near surface mounted reinforcement, primarily for strengthening applications. Nevertheless, in-depth understanding of the bond mechanism is still a challenging issue. This paper presents both experimental and analytical investigations undertaken to evaluate bond characteristics of near surface mounted carbon FRP (CFRP) strips. A total of nine concrete beams, strengthened with near surface mounted CFRP strips were constructed and tested under monotonic static loading. Different embedment lengths were used to evaluate the development length needed for effective use of near surface mounted CFRP strips. A closed-form analytical solution is proposed to predict the interfacial shear stresses. The model is validated by comparing t...",

The simulations produce a detailed merging tree for the dark matter haloes, including complete knowledge of the statistical properties arising from the gravitational forces. We intend to predict the overall statistical properties of galaxies, with special emphasis on the panchromatic spectral energy distribution emitted by galaxies in the ultraviolet/optical and infrared/submillimetre wavelength ranges. \n \nIn this paper, we outline the physically motivated assumptions and key free parameters that go into the model, comparing and contrasting with other parallel efforts. We specifically illustrate the success of the model in comparison with several data sets, showing how it is able to predict the galaxy disc sizes, colours, luminosity functions from the ultraviolet to far infrared, the Tully\u2013Fisher and Faber\u2013Jackson relations, and the fundamental plane in the local Universe. We also identify certain areas where the model fails, or where the assumptions needed to succeed are at odds with observations, and pay special attention to understanding the effects of the finite resolution of the simulations on the predictions made. Other papers in this series will take advantage of different data sets available in the literature to extend the study of the limitations and predictive power of galics, with particular emphasis put on high-redshift galaxies.",

Several visualization and data mining techniques were used to validate and attempt to discover new methods for distinguishing coding DNA sequences (exons) from non-coding DNA sequences (introns). The goal of the data mining was to see whether some other, possibly non-linear combination of the fundamental position-dependent DNA nucleotide frequency values could be a better predictor than the AMI (average mutual information). We tried many different classification techniques including rule-based classifiers and neural networks. We also used visualization of both the original data and the results of the data mining to help verify patterns and to understand the distinction between the different types of data and classifications. In particular, the visualization helped us develop refinements to neural network classifiers, which have accuracies as high as any known method. Finally, we discuss the interactions between visualization and data mining and suggest an integrated approach.",

Finite-element analysis was used to calculate the field distribution in chains of magnetizable particles. The field-dependent stress required to shear the chains was then obtained using the Maxwell stress tensor. Three regimes are identified: at low applied fields, the stress increase quadratically, as expected from linear magnetostatics. In intermediate fields, the contact or polar regions of each particle saturate, reducing the rate of increase of the stress with increasing field. At high fields, the particles saturate completely, and the stress reaches its limiting value. Approximate analytical expressions for the yield stress and shear modulus in these regimes are also derived. The predictions of these models are compared to magnetorheological experiments in the literature and from our laboratory. These models predict successfully the magn...",

These models are validated by comparing the power estimated using these models against the power estimated using a detailed simulator called CAPE (CAache Power Estimator). The analytical models for conventional caches are found to be accurate to within 2% error. However, these analytical models over-predict the dissipations of low-power caches by as much as 30%. The inaccuracies can be attributed to correlated signal values and locality of reference, both of which are exploited in making some cache organizations energy efficient.",

            "abstract": "Fault zone properties are incorporated in production flow simulators using transmissibility multipliers. These are a function of properties of the fault zone and of the grid-blocks to which they are assigned. Consideration of the geological factors influencing the content of fault zones allows construction of high resolution, geologically driven, fault transmissibility models. Median values of fault permeability and thickness are predicted empirically from petrophysical and geometrical details of the reservoir model. A simple analytical up-scaling scheme is used to incorporate the influence of likely small-scale fault zone heterogeneity. Fine-scale numerical modelling indicates that variability in fault zone permeability and thickness should not be considered separately, and that the most diagnostic measure of flow through a heterogeneous fault is the arithmetic average of the permeability to thickness ratio. The flow segregation through heterogeneous faults predicted analytically is closely, but not precisely, matched by numerical results. Identical faults have different equivalent permeabilities which depend, in part, on characteristics of the permeability field in which they are contained.",

As hypothesized, self-report measures of individual differences in affective information processing were associated with choices in a task designed by Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson (1994) to mimic the gains, losses, and uncertainties of real life decisions. The results were stronger when the processing of losses was considered separately from the processing of gains. Greater negative affectivity was associated with more avoidance of high-loss options; greater positive affectivity was associated with more choices from high-gain options. Both measures of affectivity added unique explanatory power to the prediction of choices among the decks over and above conscious knowledge about the decks. Affect appears to play an important role in guiding decisions and judgments.",

We have derived analytical expressions based on the diffusion approximation that describe the photon density in a uniform, infinite, strongly scattering medium that contains a sinusoidally intensity-modulated point source of light. These expressions predict that the photon density will propagate outward from the light source as a spherical wave of constant phase velocity with an amplitude that attenuates with distance r from the source as exp(-alpha r)/r. The properties of the photon-density wave are given in terms of the spectral properties of the scattering medium. We have used the Green's function obtained from the diffusion approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation with a sinusoidally modulated point source to derive analytic expressions describing the diffraction and the reflection of photon-density waves from an absorbing and/or reflecting semi-infinite plane bounded by a straight edge immersed in a strongly scattering medium. The analytic expressions given are in agreement with the results of frequency-domain experiments performed in skim-milk media and with Monte Carlo simulations. These studies provide a basis for the understanding of photon diffusion in strongly scattering media in the presence of absorbing and reflecting objects and allow for a determination of the conditions for obtaining maximum resolution and penetration for applications to optical tomography.",

Three cases are considered: a workpiece with single-degree-of-freedom, a face milling cutter with two-degree-of-freedom, and peripheral milling ofa cantilevered thin web. The general milling stability formulation is further simplified for the less complicated models. For each case, an analytical expression which explicitly relate the chatter limit to the milling conditions and tool-workpiece dynamics are derived. The analytical predictions are compared with numerical and time domain solutions proposed by previous research. It is shown that the proposed method can accurately predict the chatter limits in milling and thus eliminates the time consuming numerical solutions.",

The technique is more general than previous analytical models: it removes most restrictions on surface microgeometry. Three main points are described: a new representation of the BRDF, a Monte Carlo technique to estimate the coefficients of the representation, and the means of creating a milliscale BRDF from microscale scattering events. These allowthe prediction of scattering from essentially arbitrary roughness geometries. The BRDF is concisely represented by a matrix of spherical harmonic coefficients; the matrix is directly estimated from a geometric optics simulation, enforcing exact reciprocity. The method applies to roughness scales that are large with respect to the wavelength of light and small with respect to the spatial density at which the BRDF is sampled across the surface; examples include brushed metal and textiles. The method is validated by comparing with an existing scattering model and sample images are generated with a physically-based global illumination algorithm.

The present study meta-analytically demonstrates that occupation-level situational strength is one important source of this variability. Consistent with theory, predicted uncorrected conscientiousness\u2013performance correlations ranged from r \u00bc .09 to .23 (overall performance) and r \u00bc .06 to .18 (task performance), with stronger correlations observed in weak occupations. These results highlight the need for continued inquiry into the nature of situational strength, its impact on other predictor\u2013outcome relationships, and the implications of these issues vis-a`-vis theory and practice.

However, it only requires 2-D FE analysis of the magnetic field distribution over a cross section of the machine. The developed method is used to predict the torque-speed characteristic of an interior PM brushless ac machine with one stator slot-pitch skew.

            "abstract": "Piezoelectric transduction has received great attention for vibration-to-electric energy conversion over the last five years. A typical piezoelectric energy harvester is a unimorph or a bimorph cantilever located on a vibrating host structure, to generate electrical energy from base excitations. Several authors have investigated modeling of cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvesters under base excitation. The existing mathematical modeling approaches range from elementary single-degree-of-freedom models to approximate distributed parameter solutions in the sense of Rayleigh\u2013Ritz discretization as well as analytical solution attempts with certain simplifications. Recently, the authors have presented the closed-form analytical solution for a unimorph cantilever under base excitation based on the Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam assumptions. In this paper, the analytical solution is applied to bimorph cantilever configurations with series and parallel connections of piezoceramic layers. The base excitation is assumed to be translation in the transverse direction with a superimposed small rotation. The closed-form steady state response expressions are obtained for harmonic excitations at arbitrary frequencies, which are then reduced to simple but accurate single-mode expressions for modal excitations. The electromechanical frequency response functions (FRFs) that relate the voltage output and vibration response to translational and rotational base accelerations are identified from the multi-mode and single-mode solutions. Experimental validation of the single-mode coupled voltage output and vibration response expressions is presented for a bimorph cantilever with a tip mass. It is observed that the closed-form single-mode FRFs obtained from the analytical solution can successfully predict the coupled system dynamics for a wide range of electrical load resistance. The performance of the bimorph device is analyzed extensively for the short circuit and open circuit resonance frequency excitations and the accuracy of the model is shown in all cases.",

It is formulated in polar co-ordinates and based on the calculation of the two-dimensional electromagnetic field in the airgap/magnet regions, with due account of the eddy current reaction field. It enables the eddy current loss in the permanent magnets and the retaining sleeve, if fitted, to be calculated, and caters for motors having either overlapping or non-overlapping stator windings, as well as any specified load condition. The analysis accounts for both time and space mmf harmonics, but neglects the influence of stator slotting. The model is applied to a brushless DC traction machine in which the rotor loss is due predominantly to time harmonics in the armature reaction field which result from commutation events. The predicted rotor loss is compared with the loss deduced from thermometric measurements and from an analytical magnetostatic model which neglects the eddy current reaction field. Good agreement between predictions and measurements is achieved over the complete operating speed range.",

Our model includes the effects of the source/drain and body doping concentrations, the lengths of the gate metals and their work functions, applied drain and substrate biases, the thickness of the gate and buried oxide and also the silicon thin film. We demonstrate that the surface potential in the channel region exhibits a step function that ensures the screening of the drain potential variation by the gate near the drain resulting in suppressed SCEs like the hot-carrier effect and drain-induced barrier-lowering (DIBL). The model is extended to find an expression for the threshold voltage in the submicrometer regime, which predicts a desirable \"rollup\" in the threshold voltage with decreasing channel lengths. The accuracy of the results obtained using our analytical model is verified using 2-D numerical simulations.",

It is found that a radiating-bow-shock model formed around a 'bullet' of dense gas plowing into the ambient medium accounts for existing observations sufficiently well to constitute a unifying model. For particular bow-shock orientations, double-peaked profiles are predicted in spatially unresolved spectra. A simple analytic formula is presented that can be used to estimate the shock velocity and bow-shock orientation from a single high-resolution observation of a low-excitation line. 63 references.",

The scattering term is a function of density and propagation velocity perturbations. The integral solution to the wave equation is combined with a general description of the field from typical transducers used in clinical ultrasound to yield a model for the received pulse-echo pressure field. Analytic expressions are found in the literature for a number of transducers, and any transducer excitation can be incorporated into the model. An example is given for a concave, nonapodized transducer in which the predicted pressure field is compared to a measured field.",

            "abstract": "We investigated how parameters describing the heart and the arterial system contribute to the systolic and diastolic pressures (Ps and Pd, respectively) and stroke volume (SV). We have described the heart by the varying-elastance model with six parameters and the systemic arterial tree by the three-element windkessel model, leading to a total of nine parameters. Application of dimensional analysis led to a total of six dimensionless parameters describing dimensionless Ps and Pd, i.e., pressures with respect to venous pressure (Ps/Pv and Pd/Pv). SV was normalized with respect to unloaded ventricular volume (Vd). Sensitivity analysis showed that Ps/Pv, Pd/Pv, and SV/Vd could be accurately described by four, three, and three dimensionless parameters, respectively. With this limited number of parameters, it was then possible to obtain empirical analytical expressions for Ps/Pv, Pd/Pv, and SV/Vd. The analytic predictions were tested against the model values and found to be as follows: Ps predicted = (1.0007 +/- 0.0062) Ps, r = 0.987; Pd predicted = (1.016 +/- 0.0085) Pd, r = 0.992; and SV predicted = (0.9987 +/- 0.0028) SV, r = 0.996. We conclude that aortic Ps, Pd, and SV can be accurately described by a limited number of parameters and that, for any condition of the heart and the arterial system, Ps, Pd, and SV can be presented in analytical form.",

The ventricular properties were quantified by Ees and V0, the slope and volume axis intercept, respectively, of the linear end-systolic pressure-volume relationship. Ventricular afterload was represented by the effective arterial elastance (Ea), a parameter that is dependent on aortic input impedance parameters. O2 consumption was assessed by estimating ventricular pressure-volume area, which has been shown to be linearly related to O2 consumption. Model analysis indicated that SW is maximum when Ea = Ees, the afterload that results in the greatest efficiency is always less than that which provides the maximum SW, the SW and efficiency of a weak heart are more sensitive to changes in afterload than in a strong heart, and there is a sigmoidal relation between ventricular efficiency and end-diastolic volume that reaches its maximum at volumes outside the upper limit of the physiological range. Further analysis of the model indicated that under physiological conditions ventricular and arterial properties may be adjusted more toward optimization of efficiency than SW.",
