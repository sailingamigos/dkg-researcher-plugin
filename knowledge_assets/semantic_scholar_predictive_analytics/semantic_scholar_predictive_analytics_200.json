            "abstract": "Q & A with Author Eric Siegel Eric Siegel Why does early retirement decrease life expectancy and why do vegetarians miss fewer flights? These are two more colorful examples of the multitudes of predictive discoveries waiting within data. University of Zurich discovered that, for a certain working category of males in Austria, each additional year of early retirement decreases life expectancy by 1.8 months. They conjecture that this could be due to unhealthy habits such as smoking and drinking following retirement. One airline discovered that customers who preorder a vegetarian meal are more likely to make their flight, with the interpretation that knowledge of a personalized or specific meal awaiting the customer provides an incentive, or establishes a sense of commitment. Predictive analytics seeks out such predictive connections and then works to see how they may combine together for more precise prediction. What are the hottest trends in predictive analytics? There have been many exciting improvements in the core technology of predictive analytics. One is \"uplift modeling\" (a.k.a. \"persuasion modeling\"), which predicts influence . . . in order to do influence. The Obama campaign used it to influence voters in the 2012 presidential election; marketing uses it to more adeptly persuade customers; and medicine uses it to better select per-patient treatments. This topic is the focus of the final chapter of this book. Another hot trend is ensemble models. Like the collective intelligence that spawns the wisdom of a crowd of people, we see the same effect with a crowd of predictive models. Each model alone may be fairly primitive such as a few simple rules, so it gets prediction wrong a lot, as an individual person trying to predict also does. But have them come together as a group and there emerges a new level of predictive performance. Did Nate Silver use predictive analytics to forecast Obama's election? No--but Obama did. Nate Silver made election forecasts for each state as a whole: which way would a state trend, overall? In the meantime, the Obama campaign was using predictive analytics to make per-voter prediction. Moving beyond forecasting, true power comes in influencing the future rather than speculating on it--the raison d'tre of predictive analytics. Nate Silver publicly competed to win election forecasting, while Obama's analytics team quietly competed to win the election itself. Specifically, team Obama drove per-voter campaign decisions by way of per-vote predictions. What is the coolest thing predictive analytics has done? One of the most inspiration accomplishments of predictive analytics is IBM's Watson, which was able to compete against the all-time human champions on the TV quiz show Jeopardy! The questions can be about most any topic, are intended for humans to answer, and can be complex grammatically. It turns out that predictive modeling is the way in which Watson succeeds in determining the answer to a question: it predicts, \"Is this candidate answer the correct answer to this question?\" It knocks off one correct answer after another--incredible. What are companies predicting about me as a customer? Here are just a few examples: Microsoft helped develop technology that, based on GPS data, accurately predicts one's location up to multiple years beforehand. Target predicts customer pregnancy from shopping behavior, thus identifying prospects to contact with offers related to the needs of a newborn's parents. Tesco (UK) annually issues 100 million personalized coupons at grocery cash registers across 13 countries. Predictive analytics increased redemption rates by a factor of 3.6. Netflix sponsored a $1 million competition to predict which movies you will like in order to improve movie recommendations. One top-five U.S. health insurance company predicts the likelihood an elderly insurance policy holder will die within 18 months in order to trigger end-of-life counseling. Con Edison predicts energy distribution cable failure, updating risk levels that are displayed on operators' screens three times an hour in New York City.",

Thanks to the predictive capabilities offered by the emerging smart data analytics, data-driven approaches for condition monitoring are becoming widely used for early detection of anomalies on production machines. The aim of this paper is to provide insights on the predictive maintenance of industrial robots and the possibility of building a condition-monitoring system based on the data analysis of robot's power measurements. A predictive modeling approach is proposed to detect robot manipulator accuracy errors based on robot's current data analysis for predictive maintenance purposes. An experimental procedure is also carried out to oversee the correlation between the robot accuracy error and a set of extracted features from current time-series, and to evaluate the proposed predictive modeling. The obtained results are satisfactory and prove the feasibility of building a data-driven condition monitoring of robot manipulators using the electrical power time-series data analysis.",

Predictive analytics can generate valuable information for the management of a supply chain company to improve decision-making. Even though the importance of the topic is clear, there is no clear overview of the use of predictive analytics in the supply chain currently. This research provides a state-ofthe-art by performing a systematic literature review. In the literature review we have found the models, methods, techniques and applications of predictive analytics in the supply chain and have determined the trends and literature gaps. The most important nding is that even though there is only a limited amount of literature available, the interest in this topic is growing gradually. We also provide future research directions for further research on this subject.",

We observed that the traffic intensities and speeds in an abstracted network are interrelated in the same way as they are at the level of road segments. We developed interactive visual interfaces that support representing these interdependencies by mathematical models, which can be then utilized for forecasting not only the expectable normal traffic situation for a given moment and its development over time but also how the normal conditions may change due to extraordinary mass movements caused by public events or emergencies. We developed further interactive visual tools to support the use of data-derived models for predictive traffic simulation on the basis of an abstracted network. We came to a general conclusion that visualization support to predictive analytics, which consists of threeed network. We came to a general conclusion that visualization support to predictive analytics, which consists of three successive tasks (analyze data \u2013 develop models \u2013 obtain and analyze forecasts), may need to be developed in an evolutionary way. This applies to cases when all tasks cannot be fully defined in advance, but clear definitions for later tasks emerge depending on the results of the preceding ones.",

Although there is clear interest in big data, the adoption rate of analytical techniques fuelled by big data that can extract knowledge and value from these data is less well understood. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of trends in publications related to predictive analytics, predictive modelling, big data and data intensive computing. Our evaluation shows an increasing popularity of big data in scientific publications, with ten-fold increase in the last three years. Concomitantly, we find that predictive analytics are connected with this trend, with two-fold increase in the last three years, but also a seven-fold increase in the same period when used in context with big data. We also classify the main application domains for big data and predictive analytics. Contrary to popular belief that big data is focused primarily on social media and business intelligence, our analysis found that almost half of scientific publications using predictive analytics were in healthcare, smart services, the internet of things, and weather and environment. Our results indicate the early adoption of big data-based analytics in these domains.",

However, inspecting input-output relationships of those models using visual analytics, while treating them as black-box, can help to understand the reasoning behind outcomes without sacrificing predictive quality. We identify a space of possible solutions and provide two examples of where such techniques have been successfully used in practice.",

            "abstract": "Background We live in an era of explosive data generation that will continue to grow and involve all industries. One of the results of this explosion is the need for newer and more efficient data analytics procedures. Traditionally, data analytics required a substantial background in statistics and computer science. In 2015, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) released the IBM Watson Analytics (IBMWA) software that delivered advanced statistical procedures based on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The latest entry of Watson Analytics into the field of analytical software products provides users with enhanced functions that are not available in many existing programs. For example, Watson Analytics automatically analyzes datasets, examines data quality, and determines the optimal statistical approach. Users can request exploratory, predictive, and visual analytics. Using natural language processing (NLP), users are able to submit additional questions for analyses in a quick response format. This analytical package is available free to academic institutions (faculty and students) that plan to use the tools for noncommercial purposes. Objective To report the features of IBMWA and discuss how this software subjectively and objectively compares to other data mining programs. Methods The salient features of the IBMWA program were examined and compared with other common analytical platforms, using validated health datasets. Results Using a validated dataset, IBMWA delivered similar predictions compared with several commercial and open source data mining software applications. The visual analytics generated by IBMWA were similar to results from programs such as Microsoft Excel and Tableau Software. In addition, assistance with data preprocessing and data exploration was an inherent component of the IBMWA application. Sensitivity and specificity were not included in the IBMWA predictive analytics results, nor were odds ratios, confidence intervals, or a confusion matrix. Conclusions IBMWA is a new alternative for data analytics software that automates descriptive, predictive, and visual analytics. This program is very user-friendly but requires data preprocessing, statistical conceptual understanding, and domain expertise.",

As part of an Internal Research and Development project, Boeing Research and Technology (BR&T) Advanced Air Traffic Management (AATM) built a system that makes predictions based upon descriptive patterns of massive aviation data. Boeing AATM has been receiving live Aircraft Situation Display to Industry (ASDI) data and archiving it for over two years. At the present time, there is not an easy mechanism to perform analytics on the data. The incoming ASDI data is large, compressed, and requires correlation with other flight data before it can be analyzed. The service exposes this data once it has been uncompressed, correlated, and stored in a data warehouse for further analysis using a variety of descriptive, predictive, and possibly prescriptive analytics tools. The service is being built partially in response to requests from Boeing Commercial Aviation (BCA) for analysis of capacity and flow in the US National Airspace System (NAS). The service utilizes a custom tool developed by Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) that correlates the raw ASDI feed, IBM Warehouse with DB2 for data management, WebSphere Message Broker for real-time message brokering, SPSS Modeler for statistical analysis, and Cognos BI for front-end business intelligence (BI) visualization tools. This paper describes a scalable service architecture, implementation and value it adds to the aviation domain.",

            "abstract": "Background A unique archive of Big Data on Parkinson\u2019s Disease is collected, managed and disseminated by the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The integration of such complex and heterogeneous Big Data from multiple sources offers unparalleled opportunities to study the early stages of prevalent neurodegenerative processes, track their progression and quickly identify the efficacies of alternative treatments. Many previous human and animal studies have examined the relationship of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) risk to trauma, genetics, environment, co-morbidities, or life style. The defining characteristics of Big Data\u2013large size, incongruency, incompleteness, complexity, multiplicity of scales, and heterogeneity of information-generating sources\u2013all pose challenges to the classical techniques for data management, processing, visualization and interpretation. We propose, implement, test and validate complementary model-based and model-free approaches for PD classification and prediction. To explore PD risk using Big Data methodology, we jointly processed complex PPMI imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data. Methods and Findings Collective representation of the multi-source data facilitates the aggregation and harmonization of complex data elements. This enables joint modeling of the complete data, leading to the development of Big Data analytics, predictive synthesis, and statistical validation. Using heterogeneous PPMI data, we developed a comprehensive protocol for end-to-end data characterization, manipulation, processing, cleaning, analysis and validation. Specifically, we (i) introduce methods for rebalancing imbalanced cohorts, (ii) utilize a wide spectrum of classification methods to generate consistent and powerful phenotypic predictions, and (iii) generate reproducible machine-learning based classification that enables the reporting of model parameters and diagnostic forecasting based on new data. We evaluated several complementary model-based predictive approaches, which failed to generate accurate and reliable diagnostic predictions. However, the results of several machine-learning based classification methods indicated significant power to predict Parkinson\u2019s disease in the PPMI subjects (consistent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity exceeding 96%, confirmed using statistical n-fold cross-validation). Clinical (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores), demographic (e.g., age), genetics (e.g., rs34637584, chr12), and derived neuroimaging biomarker (e.g., cerebellum shape index) data all contributed to the predictive analytics and diagnostic forecasting. Conclusions Model-free Big Data machine learning-based classification methods (e.g., adaptive boosting, support vector machines) can outperform model-based techniques in terms of predictive precision and reliability (e.g., forecasting patient diagnosis). We observed that statistical rebalancing of cohort sizes yields better discrimination of group differences, specifically for predictive analytics based on heterogeneous and incomplete PPMI data. UPDRS scores play a critical role in predicting diagnosis, which is expected based on the clinical definition of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Even without longitudinal UPDRS data, however, the accuracy of model-free machine learning based classification is over 80%. The methods, software and protocols developed here are openly shared and can be employed to study other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as for other predictive Big Data analytics applications.",

We argue that although optimization is used to obtain predictive models, and predictive tools are used to forecast parameters in optimization models, still the deep relation between the predictive and prescriptive analytics is neither well understood nor fully exploited. We describe two opportunities to really exploit the synergy between the predictive and prescriptive part. The first is to perform optimization by directly using the predictive models. Adding optimization functionality in predictive analytics tools could be of huge added value for practice. The second opportunity is to replace manual model building with automated data-driven model building, using modern predictive analytics. The pros and cons for such a way of optimization are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Detect fraud earlier to mitigate loss and prevent cascading damage Fraud Analytics Using Descriptive, Predictive, and Social Network Techniquesis an authoritative guidebook for setting up a comprehensive fraud detection analytics solution. Early detection is a key factor in mitigating fraud damage, but it involves more specialized techniques than detecting fraud at the more advanced stages. This invaluable guide details both the theory and technical aspects of these techniques, and provides expert insight into streamlining implementation. Coverage includes data gathering, preprocessing, model building, and post-implementation, with comprehensive guidance on various learning techniques and the data types utilized by each. These techniques are effective for fraud detection across industry boundaries, including applications in insurance fraud, credit card fraud, anti-money laundering, healthcare fraud, telecommunications fraud, click fraud, tax evasion, and more, giving you a highly practical framework for fraud prevention. It is estimated that a typical organization loses about 5% of its revenue to fraud every year. More effective fraud detection is possible, and this book describes the various analytical techniques your organization must implement to put a stop to the revenue leak. Examine fraud patterns in historical data Utilize labeled, unlabeled, and networked data Detect fraud before the damage cascades Reduce losses, increase recovery, and tighten security The longer fraud is allowed to go on, the more harm it causes. It expands exponentially, sending ripples of damage throughout the organization, and becomes more and more complex to track, stop, and reverse. Fraud prevention relies on early and effective fraud detection, enabled by the techniques discussed here. Fraud Analytics Using Descriptive, Predictive, and Social Network Techniques helps you stop fraud in its tracks, and eliminate the opportunities for future occurrence.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we combine ideas from machine learning (ML) and operations research and management science (OR/MS) in developing a framework, along with specific methods, for using data to prescribe optimal decisions in OR/MS problems. In a departure from other work on data-driven optimization and reflecting our practical experience with the data available in applications of OR/MS, we consider data consisting, not only of observations of quantities with direct effect on costs/revenues, such as demand or returns, but predominantly of observations of associated auxiliary quantities. The main problem of interest is a conditional stochastic optimization problem, given imperfect observations, where the joint probability distributions that specify the problem are unknown. We demonstrate that our proposed solution methods, which are inspired by ML methods such as local regression, CART, and random forests, are generally applicable to a wide range of decision problems. We prove that they are tractable and asymptotically optimal even when data is not iid and may be censored. We extend this to the case where decision variables may directly affect uncertainty in unknown ways, such as pricing's effect on demand. As an analogue to R^2, we develop a metric P termed the coefficient of prescriptiveness to measure the prescriptive content of data and the efficacy of a policy from an operations perspective. To demonstrate the power of our approach in a real-world setting we study an inventory management problem faced by the distribution arm of an international media conglomerate, which ships an average of 1bil units per year. We leverage internal data and public online data harvested from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Google to prescribe operational decisions that outperform baseline measures. Specifically, the data we collect, leveraged by our methods, accounts for an 88\\% improvement as measured by our P.",

Although some studies may have shown that cloud technologies relying on the MapReduce framework do not perform as well as parallel database management systems, e.g., with ad hoc queries and interactive applications, MapReduce has still been widely used by many organizations for big data storage and analytics. A number of MapReduce based tools are broadly available over the cloud. In this work we explore the Apache Hive data warehousing solution and particularly its Mahout data mining libraries for predictive analytics. We present results in the context of text classification, recommender systems and decision support. We develop prototype tools in these areas and discuss our outcomes from the study useful to researchers and other professionals in cloud computing and application domains. To the best of our knowledge, ours is among the first few in-depth studies on Mahout with application prototypes available for use.",

            "abstract": "Today, successful firms compete and win based on analytics. Modeling Techniques in Predictive Analytics brings together all the concepts, techniques, and R code you need to excel in any role involving analytics. Thomas W. Millers unique balanced approach combines business context and quantitative tools, appealing to managers, analysts, programmers, and students alike. Miller addresses multiple business challenges and business cases, including segmentation, brand positioning, product choice modeling, pricing research, finance, sports, text analytics, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis. He illuminates the use of cross-sectional data, time series, spatial, and even spatio-temporal data. For each problem, Miller explains why the problem matters, what data is relevant, how to explore your data once youve identified it, and then how to successfully model that data. Youll learn how to model data conceptually, with words and figures; and then how to model it with realistic R programs that deliver actionable insights and knowledge. Miller walks you through model construction, explanatory variable subset selection, and validation, demonstrating best practices for improving out-of-sample predictive performance. He employs data visualization and statistical graphics in exploring data, presenting models, and evaluating performance. All example code is presented in R, todays #1 system for applied statistics, statistical research, and predictive modeling; code is set apart from other text so its easy to find for those who want it (and easy to skip for those who dont).",

The subject of prediction are daily stock price movements from Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index (S&P 500) during a period from June 2011 to November 2011. To forecast price movements we filter messages by stocks, apply state-of-the-art sentiment analysis to message texts, and aggregate message sentiments to generate trading signals for daily buy and sell decisions. We evaluate prediction quality through a simple trading model considering real-world limitations like transaction costs or broker commission fees. Considering 833 virtual trades, our model outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved a positive return on investment of up to ~0.49% per trade or ~0.24% when adjusted by market, depending on supposed trading costs.",

It is increasingly the case that healthcare innovation and growth could take place with predictions analyzing big data [1]. I introduce the book by referring book description and author\u2019s interview with amazon.com. The author makes the how and why of predictive analytics (aka PA) understandable and captivating in various fields of big data through the book. Although it is not targeted only for researcher or stakeholders in healthcare area, the book would be useful for us because it is targeted from the small to large business owner, entrepreneurs, other PAers and us common folk who want to further understand how computerized data research is analyzed to predict specified outcomes and scenarios. The book breaks down predictive analytics into seven chapters. Cause and effect charts, illustrations along with a few comics and a glossy centerfold divulge cases of predictions in advertising, finance, healthcare, fraud, insurance, government, employment and personal venues. Some topics discussed explain ways to increase consumer buying, limit bank loan defaulting or paying off, anticipate employees quitting or clients dropping cellphone coverage along with collecting online blogs, social networking and risk information. Each chapter includes sections of \u201cwhat\u2019s predicted\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s done about it\u201d to show the correlation of PA and gathered Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie or Die",

The challenges involved with such predictive analytics processes include end-users' understanding, and the application of the underlying statistical algorithms at the right spatiotemporal granularity levels so that good prediction estimates can be established. In our approach, we provide analysts with a suite of natural scale templates and methods that enable them to focus and drill down to appropriate geospatial and temporal resolution levels. Our forecasting technique is based on the Seasonal Trend decomposition based on Loess (STL) method, which we apply in a spatiotemporal visual analytics context to provide analysts with predicted levels of future activity. We also present a novel kernel density estimation technique we have developed, in which the prediction process is influenced by the spatial correlation of recent incidents at nearby locations. We demonstrate our techniques by applying our methodology to Criminal, Traffic and Civil (CTC) incident datasets.",

            "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | Today, the amount of data we are able to collect has been exploding. As a result, Big Data have become a new buzzword in information technology. Storing, managing, and analyzing Big Data is challenging, and will soon become a major differentiator between high-performing and low-performing organizations. This article discusses the issue of Big Data including the four dimensions of Big Data and the opportunities and challenges created by them. It also discusses various Big Data analytics applications.Every day, we use several different devices to generate large amounts of data; for example, searching online, making purchases through e-commerce web sites, making transactions in the supermarket, reading data from sensors, using social media to interact with our friends, and using GPS. All the data are accumulated and stored somewhere, which we call \"Big Data. \"WHAT IS BIG DATA?According to the McKinsey Global Institute, \"Big Data refer to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyze. \"The EdTech Report to the nation in 2013 states \"Every day, we create 2.5 quintillion (1020) bytes of data- so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone. These data come from everywhere: sensors used to gather climate information, posts to social media sites, digital pictures and videos, purchase transaction records, and cell phone GPS signals to name a few. These data are \"Big Data.\" The concept of Big Data actually is not new. We have been accumulating data since the beginning of recorded time. However, as technology advances, data are accumulating at an alarming rate.FOUR DIMENSIONS OF BIG DATAIBM data scientists break Big Data down into four dimensions: volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (4-Vs). The volume dimension refers to the scale of the data. From the beginning of recorded time until 2003, we created 5 billion gigabytes (exabytes) of data. In 2011, the same amount were created nearly every two days. In 2013, the same amount of data were created every 10 minutes. Velocity refers to the analysis of streaming data. As data are accumulated every second, data quickly become out-of-date. Therefore, it is important to use the data as fast as possible. The third dimension, variety, refers to different types of data we collect, e.g., structured data, unstructured data, text data, numerical data, image data, and audio and video data. Veracity refers to the uncertainty in the data.The data we collect may contain noise, but we do not know which data are accurate and which have noise. This is why many business leaders do not trust the information generated from them. What's more, according to IBM, poor data quality costs the U.S. economy around $3.1 trillion each year.WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT BIG DATA?The model of generating/consuming data has changed. The old model was that few companies were generating data; all the others were consuming data. As technology advanced, a new model has evolved. Many companies are now generating and consuming data. But our ultimate goal is not just generating, storing, and managing Big Data. Once data are generated and stored, the next step is to analyze the data to find useful information. Information is then converted into knowledge to make decisions to optimize profit Figure 1 shows an overview of the data analysis and decision making process.The article by Clay Dillow, published in Fortune magazine on September 4, 2013, states that Big Data are now viewed as \"the new oil\"to drive the economies in the century ahead, the same way as they did at the beginning of the last century. So, we are experiencing a Big Data employment boom. Dillow's claim is supported by the job trends from indeed.com. Indeed.com is an employment-related meta-search engine for job listings. According to the job trends from indeed.com, the number of job postings related to Big Data increased exponentially after 2011. \u2026",

            "abstract": "\n \n Sales pipeline win-propensity prediction is fundamental to effective sales management. In contrast to using subjective human rating, we propose a modern machine learning paradigm to estimate the win-propensity of sales leads over time. A profile-specific two-dimensional Hawkes processes model is developed to capture the influence from seller's activities on their leads to the win outcome, coupled with lead's personalized profiles. It is motivated by two observations: i) sellers tend to frequently focus their selling activities and efforts on a few leads during a relatively short time. This is evidenced and reflected by their concentrated interactions with the pipeline, including login, browsing and updating the sales leads which are logged by the system; ii) the pending opportunity is prone to reach its win outcome shortly after such temporally concentrated interactions. Our model is deployed and in continual use to a large, global, B2B multinational technology enterprize (Fortune 500) with a case study. Due to the generality and flexibility of the model, it also enjoys the potential applicability to other real-world problems.\n \n",

Many complex events require real-time detection in order to have enough time for appropriate reactions. However, there are several events (e.g. credit card fraud) that should be prevented proactively before they occur, not just responded after they happened. In this paper, we briefly describe Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Predictive Analytics (PA). Afterwards, we focus on a major future direction of CEP, namely the inclusion of PA technologies into CEP tools and applications. Involving PA opens a wide range of possibilities in several application fields. However, we have observed that only few solutions apply PA techniques. In this paper, we define a conceptual framework which combines CEP and PA and which can be the basis of generic design pattern in the future. The conceptual framework is demonstrated in a proof--of--concept experiment. Finally we provide the results and lessons learned.",

It also discusses a variety of practical topics that are frequently missing from similar texts. The book begins with the statistical and linear algebra/matrix foundation of modeling methods, from distributions to cumulant and copula functions to CornishFisher expansion and other useful but hard-to-find statistical techniques. It then describes common and unusual linear methods as well as popular nonlinear modeling approaches, including additive models, trees, support vector machine, fuzzy systems, clustering, nave Bayes, and neural nets. The authors go on to cover methodologies used in time series and forecasting, such as ARIMA, GARCH, and survival analysis. They also present a range of optimization techniques and explore several special topics, such as DempsterShafer theory. An in-depth collection of the most important fundamental material on predictive analytics, this self-contained book provides the necessary information for understanding various techniques for exploratory data analysis and modeling. It explains the algorithmic details behind each technique (including underlying assumptions and mathematical formulations) and shows how to prepare and encode data, select variables, use model goodness measures, normalize odds, and perform reject inference.

As part of an Internal Research and Development project, Boeing Research and Technology (BR&T) Advanced Air Traffic Management (AATM) built a system that makes predictions based upon descriptive patterns of archived aviation data. Boeing AATM has been receiving live Aircraft Situation Display to Industry (ASDI) data and archiving it for over two years. At the present time, there is not an easy mechanism to perform analytics on the data. The incoming ASDI data is large, compressed, and requires correlation with other flight data before it can be analyzed.\n The service exposes this data once it has been uncompressed, correlated, and stored in a data warehouse for further analysis using a variety of descriptive, predictive, and possibly prescriptive analytics tools. The service is being built partially in response to requests from Boeing Commercial Aviation (BCA) for analysis of capacity and flow in the US National Airspace System (NAS). The service utilizes a custom tool for correlating the raw ASDI feed, IBM Warehouse with DB2 for data management, WebSphere Message Broker for real-time message brokering, SPSS Modeler for statistical analysis, and Cognos BI for front-end business intelligence (BI) visualization. This paper describes a scalable service architecture, implementation and the value it adds to the aviation domain.",

            "abstract": "textabstractThis research essay highlights the need to integrate predictive analytics into information systems research and shows several concrete ways in which this goal can be accomplished. Predictive analytics include empirical methods (statistical and other) that generate data predictions as well as methods for assessing predictive power. Predictive analytics not only assist in creating practically useful models, they also play an important role alongside explanatory modeling in theory building and theory testing. We describe six roles for predictive analytics: new theory generation, measurement development, comparison of competing theories, improvement of existing models, relevance assessment, and assessment of the predictability of empirical phenomena. Despite the importance of predictive analytics, we find that they are rare in the empirical IS literature. Extant IS literature relies nearly exclusively on explanatory statistical modeling, where statistical inference is used to test and evaluate the explanatory power of underlying causal models, and predictive power is assumed to follow automatically from the explanatory model. However, explanatory power does not imply predictive power and thus predictive analytics are necessary for assessing predictive power and for building empirical models that predict well. To show that predictive analytics and explanatory statistical modeling are fundamentally disparate, we show that they are different in each step of the modeling process. These differences translate into different final models, so that a pure explanatory statistical model is best tuned for testing causal hypotheses and a pure predictive model is best in terms of predictive power. We convert a well-known explanatory paper on TAM to a predictive context to illustrate these differences and show how predictive analytics can add theoretical and practical value to IS research.",

Linked views and interactive displays provide insight into correlations among people, events, and places in space and time. Analysts search for events of interest through statistical tools linked to visual displays, drill down into the data, and form hypotheses based upon the available information. However, current systems stop short of predicting events. In spatiotemporal data, analysts are searching for regions of space and time with unusually high incidences of events (hotspots). In the cases where hotspots are found, analysts would like to predict how these regions may grow in order to plan resource allocation and preventative measures. Furthermore, analysts would also like to predict where future hotspots may occur. To facilitate such forecasting, we have created a predictive visual analytics toolkit that provides analysts with linked spatiotemporal and statistical analytic views. Our system models spatiotemporal events through the combination of kernel density estimation for event distribution and seasonal trend decomposition by loess smoothing for temporal predictions. We provide analysts with estimates of error in our modeling, along with spatial and temporal alerts to indicate the occurrence of statistically significant hotspots. Spatial data are distributed based on a modeling of previous event locations, thereby maintaining a temporal coherence with past events. Such tools allow analysts to perform real-time hypothesis testing, plan intervention strategies, and allocate resources to correspond to perceived threats.",

            "abstract": "The widespread popularity of smart meters enables an immense amount of fine-grained electricity consumption data to be collected. Meanwhile, the deregulation of the power industry, particularly on the delivery side, has continuously been moving forward worldwide. How to employ massive smart meter data to promote and enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the power grid is a pressing issue. To date, substantial works have been conducted on smart meter data analytics. To provide a comprehensive overview of the current research and to identify challenges for future research, this paper conducts an application-oriented review of smart meter data analytics. Following the three stages of analytics, namely, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, we identify the key application areas as load analysis, load forecasting, and load management. We also review the techniques and methodologies adopted or developed to address each application. In addition, we also discuss some research trends, such as big data issues, novel machine learning technologies, new business models, the transition of energy systems, and data privacy and security.",

            "abstract": "Many real-world data-mining applications involve obtaining predictive models using datasets with strongly imbalanced distributions of the target variable. Frequently, the least-common values of this target variable are associated with events that are highly relevant for end users (e.g., fraud detection, unusual returns on stock markets, anticipation of catastrophes, etc.). Moreover, the events may have different costs and benefits, which, when associated with the rarity of some of them on the available training data, creates serious problems to predictive modeling techniques. This article presents a survey of existing techniques for handling these important applications of predictive analytics. Although most of the existing work addresses classification tasks (nominal target variables), we also describe methods designed to handle similar problems within regression tasks (numeric target variables). In this survey, we discuss the main challenges raised by imbalanced domains, propose a definition of the problem, describe the main approaches to these tasks, propose a taxonomy of the methods, summarize the conclusions of existing comparative studies as well as some theoretical analyses of some methods, and refer to some related problems within predictive modeling.",

S3 synthesizes several strands of risk analytics: the use of predictive models to identify academically at-risk students, the creation of data visualizations for reaching diagnostic insights, and the application of a case-based approach for managing interventions. Such a system poses numerous design, implementation, and research challenges. In this paper we discuss a core research challenge for designing early warning systems such as S3. We then propose our approach for meeting that challenge. A practical implementation of an student risk early warning system, utilizing predictive models, must meet two design criteria: a) the methodology for generating predictive models must be flexible to allow generalization from one context to another; b) the underlying mechanism of prediction should be easily interpretable by practitioners whose end goal is to design meaningful interventions on behalf of students. Our proposed solution applies an ensemble method for predictive modeling using a strategy of decomposition. Decomposition provides a flexible technique for generating and generalizing predictive models across different contexts. Decomposition into interpretable semantic units, when coupled with data visualizations and case management tools, allows practitioners, such as instructors and advisors, to build a bridge between prediction and intervention.",

            "abstract": "The data mining community has derived a broad foundation of statistical algorithms and software solutions that has allowed predictive analytics to become a standard approach used in science and industry.For many years, much emphasis has been placed on the development of predictive models. As a consequence, the market place offers a range of powerful tools, many open-source, for effective model building. However, once we turn to the operational deployment and practical application of predictive solutions within an existing IT infrastructure, we face a much more limited choice of options. Often it takes months for models to be integrated and deployed via custom code or proprietary processes.The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard has reached a significant stage of maturity and has obtained broad industry support, allowing users to develop predictive solutions within one application and use another to execute them. Previously, this was very difficult, but with PMML, the exchange of predictive solutions between compliant applications is now straightforward.The aim of this book is to present PMML from a practical perspective. It contains a variety of code snippets so that concepts are made clear through the use of examples. Readers are assumed to have a basic knowledge of predictive analytics and its techniques and so the book is intended for data mining movers and shakers: anyone interested in moving predictive analytic solutions between applications, including students and scientists.PMML in Action is a great way to learn how to represent your predictive solutions through a mature and refined open standard. For the 2nd edition, the book has been completely revised for PMML 4.1, the latest version of PMML. It includes new chapters and an expanded description of how to represent multiple models in PMML, including model ensemble, segmentation, chaining, and composition. The book is divided into six parts, taking you in a PMML journey in which language elements and attributes are used to represent not only modeling techniques but also data pre- and post-processing.With PMML, users benefit from a single and concise standard to represent predictive models, thus avoiding the need for custom code and proprietary solutions.You too can join the PMML movement!

However, how to utilize the information retrieved from the analysis of these data to retain the most valuable customers, identify customers with additional revenue potential, and achieve cost-effective customer relationship management, continue to pose challenges for companies. This study proposes a two-level approach combining SOM-Ward clustering and predictive analytics to segment the customer base of a case company with 1.5 million customers. First, according to the spending amount, demographic and behavioral characteristics of the customers, we adopt SOM-Ward clustering to segment the customer base into seven segments: exclusive customers, high-spending customers, and five segments of mass customers. Then, three classification models - the support vector machine (SVM), the neural network, and the decision tree, are employed to classify high-spending and low-spending customers. The performance of the three classification models is evaluated and compared. The three models are then combined to predict potential high-spending customers from the mass customers. It is found that this hybrid approach could provide more thorough and detailed information about the customer base, especially the untapped mass market with potential high revenue contribution, for tailoring actionable marketing strategies.",

In this paper we focus on the inclusion of PA technologies into CEP applications. Involving PA opens a wide range of possibilities in several application fields. However, we have observed that only a few CEP solutions apply PA techniques. We extended a CEP solution with predictive capabilities, defined the key aspects of the combination of these techniques, and summarized how CEP and PA could gain from the joint solution. Our approach is demonstrated in a proof-of-concept experiment and simulation results are provided.",

            "abstract": "Observing failures and other \u2013 desired or undesired \u2013 behavior patterns in large scale software systems of specific domains (telecommunication systems, information systems, online web applications, etc.) is difficult. Very often, it is only possible by examining the runtime behavior of these systems through operational logs or traces. However, these systems can generate data in order of gigabytes every day, which makes a challenge to process in the course of predicting upcoming critical problems or identifying relevant behavior patterns. We can say that there is a gap between the amount of information we have and the amount of information we need to make a decision. Low level data has to be processed, correlated and synthesized in order to create high level, decision helping data. The actual value of this high level data lays in its availability at the time of decision making (e.g., do we face a virus attack?). In other words high level data has to be available real-time or near real-time. The research area of event processing deals with processing such data that are viewed as events and with making alerts to the administrators (users) of the systems about relevant behavior patterns based on the rules that are determined in advance. The rules or patterns describe the typical circumstances of the events which have been experienced by the administrators. Normally, these experts improve their observation capabilities over time as they experience more and more critical events and the circumstances preceding them. However, there is a way to aid this manual process by applying the results from a related (and from many aspects, overlapping) research area, predictive analytics, and thus improving the effectiveness of event processing. Predictive analytics deals with the prediction of future events based on previously observed historical data by applying sophisticated methods like machine learning, the historical data is often collected and transformed by using techniques similar to the ones of event processing, e.g., filtering, correlating the data, and so on. In this paper, we are going to examine both research areas and offer a survey on terminology, research achievements, existing solutions, and open issues. We discuss the applicability of the research areas to the telecommunication domain. We primarily base our survey on articles published in international conferences and journals, but we consider other sources of information as well, like technical reports, tools or web-logs.",

However, analyses of the differential effectiveness of these models across demographic, identity, or other groups has been scarce. In this paper, we present a method for evaluating unfairness in predictive student models. We define this in terms of differential accuracy between subgroups, and measure it using a new metric we term the Absolute Between-ROC Area (ABROCA). We demonstrate the proposed method through a gender-based \"slicing analysis\" using five different models replicated from other works and a dataset of 44 unique MOOCs and over four million learners. Our results demonstrate (1) significant differences in model fairness according to (a) statistical algorithm and (b) feature set used; (2) that the gender imbalance ratio, curricular area, and specific course used for a model all display significant association with the value of the ABROCA statistic; and (3) that there is not evidence of a strict tradeoff between performance and fairness. This work provides a framework for quantifying and understanding how predictive models might inadvertently privilege, or disparately impact, different student subgroups. Furthermore, our results suggest that learning analytics researchers and practitioners can use slicing analysis to improve model fairness without necessarily sacrificing performance.1",

However, even in this scenario, interoperability and open standards still lack broader adoption among data miners and modelers.\n In this article we highlight the use of the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard, which allows for models to be easily exchanged between analytic applications. With a focus on interoperability and PMML, we also discuss here emerging trends in cloud computing and Software as a Service, which have already started to play a critical role in promoting a more effective implementation and widespread application of predictive models.\n As an illustration of how the benefits of open standards and cloud computing can be combined, we describe a predictive analytics scoring engine platform that leverages these elements to deliver an efficient deployment process for statistical models.",

In this paper, we discuss the application of data analytics in predicting first tier supply chain disruptions using historical data available to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Our methodology includes three phases: First, an exploratory phase is conducted to select and engineer potential features that can act as useful predictors of disruptions. This is followed by the development of a performance metric in alignment with the specific goals of the case study to rate successful methods. Third, an experimental design is created to systematically analyse the success rate of different algorithms, algorithmic parameters, on the selected feature space. Our results indicate that adding engineered features in the data, namely agility, outperforms other experiments leading to the final algorithm that can predict late orders with 80% accuracy. An additional contribution is the novel application of machine learning in predicting supply disruptions. Through the discussion and the development of the case study we hope to shed light on the development and application of data analytics techniques in the analysis of supply chain data. We conclude by highlighting the importance of domain knowledge for successfully engineering features.",

Client systems now are integrated with the cloud, the Internet of Things, and external data sources such as social media. Furthermore, many engagement clients are now integrating this Big Data with new and complex business analytical approaches to generate intelligence for decision making. This scenario provides almost limitless opportunities and the urgency for the external auditor to utilize advanced analytics. This paper first positions the need for the external audit profession to move toward Big Data and audit analytics. It then reviews the regulations regarding audit evidence and analytical procedures, in contrast to the emerging environment of Big Data and advanced analytics. In a Big Data environment, the audit profession has the potential to undertake more advanced predictive and prescriptive-oriented analytics. The next s...",

            "abstract": "Educational institutions are increasingly turning to learning analytics to identify and intervene with students at risk of underperformance or discontinuation. However, the extent to which the current evidence base supports this investment is currently unclear, and particularly so in relation to the effectiveness of interventions based on predictive models. The aim of the present paper was to conduct a systematic review and quality assessment of studies on the use of learning analytics in higher education, focusing specifically on intervention studies. Search terms identified 689 papers, but only 11 studies evaluated the effectiveness of interventions based on learning analytics. These studies highlighted the potential of such interventions, but the general quality of the research was moderate, and left several important questions unanswered. The key recommendation based on this review is that more research into the implementation and evaluation of scientifically driven learning analytics is needed to build a solid evidence base for the feasibility, effectiveness and generalizability of such interventions. This is particularly relevant when considering the increasing tendency of educational institutions around the world to implement learning analytics interventions with only little evidence of their effectiveness. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic? Drop\u2010out rates and underachivement is a significant issue at most Western universities.Learning analytics have been shown to predict student performance and risk of dropping out.Interventions based on learning analytics have emerged in recent years, some reportedly successful.What this paper adds The paper also reviews and synthesizes the evidence on the effectiveness of learning analytics interventions targeting student underperformance, experience and discontinuation.The paper compares and contrasts past and current learning analytics methods and foci, and makes recommendations for the future research and practice.It critically synthesizes the current evidence base on learning analytics interventions, which is a field that is in constant flux and development.Implications for practice and/or policy The paper focuses on an increasing part of higher education with the goal of validating learning analytics methods and usefulness.The paper makes evidence\u2010based recommendations for institutions wishing to implement learning analytics programs and/or interventions.The paper makes evidence\u2010based recommendations for instructors as well as researchers in the field.

            "abstract": "Over the last two decades, manufacturing across the globe has evolved to be more intel-ligent and data driven. In the age of industrial Internet of Things, a smart production unit can be perceived as a large connected industrial system of materials, parts, machines, tools, inventory, and logistics that can relay data and communicate with each other. While, traditionally, the focus has been on machine health and predictive maintenance, the manufacturing industry has also started focusing on analyzing data from the entire production line. These applications bring a new set of analytics challenges. Unlike tradi-tional data mining analysis, which consists of lean datasets (that is, datasets with few fea-tures), manufacturing has fat datasets. In addition, previous approaches to manufacturing analytics restricted themselves to small time periods of data. The latest advances in big data analytics allows researchers to do a deep dive into years of data. Bosch collects and utilizes all available information about its products to increase its understanding of complex linear and nonlinear relationships between parts, machines, and assembly lines. This helps in use cases such as the discovery of the root cause of internal defects. This article presents a case study and provides detail about challenges and approaches in data extraction, modeling, and visualization.",

            "abstract": "Smart manufacturing (SM) is a term generally applied to the improvement in manufacturing operations through integration of systems, linking of physical and cyber capabilities, and taking advantage of information including leveraging the big data evolution. SM adoption has been occurring unevenly across industries, thus there is an opportunity to look to other industries to determine solution and roadmap paths for industries such as biochemistry or biology. The big data evolution affords an opportunity for managing significantly larger amounts of information and acting on it with analytics for improved diagnostics and prognostics. The analytics approaches can be defined in terms of dimensions to understand their requirements and capabilities, and to determine technology gaps. The semiconductor manufacturing industry has been taking advantage of the big data and analytics evolution by improving existing capabilities such as fault detection, and supporting new capabilities such as predictive maintenance. For most of these capabilities: (1) data quality is the most important big data factor in delivering high quality solutions; and (2) incorporating subject matter expertise in analytics is often required for realizing effective on-line manufacturing solutions. In the future, an improved big data environment incorporating smart manufacturing concepts such as digital twin will further enable analytics; however, it is anticipated that the need for incorporating subject matter expertise in solution design will remain.",

One of the key reasons is that software practitioners are reluctant to trust predictions produced by the analytics machinery without understanding the rationale for those predictions. While complex models such as deep learning and ensemble methods improve predictive performance, they have limited explainability. In this paper, we argue that making software analytics models explainable to software practitioners is as important as achieving accurate predictions. Explainability should therefore be a key measure for evaluating software analytics models. We envision that explainability will be a key driver for developing software analytics models that are useful in practice. We outline a research roadmap for this space, building on social science, explainable artificial intelligence and software engineering.",

Therefore data mining and predictive analytics are rapidly gaining acceptance and use in the applied public safety, security, and intelligence setting given their ability to process large data sets and identify actionable patterns and trends. In particular, the areas of force deployment and homeland security have emerged as early adopters of this technology",

Yet, current practices do not focus on such metrics and instead employ what may be termed \u201ctechnical metrics.\u201d As we will see, technical metrics tell an organization little about whether a predictive model will benefit the organization. This chapter will review these topics, explain the difference between financial business impact metrics and technical metrics, and show how financial business impact metrics can be calculated with little effort. Throughout the chapter, we will illustrate the use of technical and financial business impact metrics with running examples in the areas of insurance fraud prevention and predictive marketing.

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT There are plenty of definitions proposed for business analytics \u2013 some of them focus on the scope/coverage/problem, some on the nature of the data, and some concentrate on the enabling methods and methodologies. The common denominator of all of these definitions is that business analytics is the encapsulation of all mechanisms that help convert data into actionable insight for better and faster decision-making. Although the name is new, its purpose has been around for several decades, characterised under different labels. Largely driven by the need in the business world, business analytics has become one of the most active research areas in academics and in industry/practice. The Journal of Business Analytics is created to establish a dedicated home for analytics researchers to publish their research outcomes. Covering all facets of business analytics (descriptive/diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive), the journal is destined to become the pinnacle for rigorous and relevant analytics research manuscripts. Herein we provide an overview of research challenges and opportunities for business analytics to lay the groundwork for this new journal.",

Even though a lot of information is shared in Twitter, little is known yet about how and why certain information spreads more widely than others. In this paper, we examine a number of features that might affect retweetability of tweets. We gathered content and contextual features from 74M tweets and used this data set to identify factors that are significantly associated with retweet rate. We also built a predictive retweet model. We found that, amongst content features, URLs and hashtags have strong relationships with retweetability. Amongst contextual features, the number of followers and followees as well as the age of the account seem to affect retweetability, while, interestingly, the number of past tweets does not predict retweetability of a user's tweet. We believe that this research would inform the design of sensemaking and analytics tools for social media streams.",

Jisc, a charitable organisation which champions the use of digital technologies in UK education and research, has attempted to address this with the development of a Code of Practice for Learning Analytics. The Code covers the main issues institutions need to address in order to progress ethically and in compliance with the law. This paper outlines the extensive research and consultation activities which have been carried out to produce a document which covers the concerns of institutions and, critically, the students they serve. The resulting model for developing a code of practice includes a literature review, setting up appropriate governance structures, developing a taxonomy of the issues, drafting the code, consulting widely with stakeholders, publication, dissemination, and embedding it in institutions.",

            "abstract": "As higher education increasingly moves to online and digital learning spaces, we have access not only to greater volumes of student data, but also to increasingly fine-grained and nuanced data. A significant body of research and existing practice are used to convince key stakeholders within higher education of the potential of the collection, analysis and use of student data to positively impact on student experiences in these environments. Much of the recent focus in learning analytics is around predictive modeling and uses of artificial intelligence to both identify learners at risk, and to personalize interventions to increase the chance of success. In this paper we explore the moral and legal basis for the obligation to act on our analyses of student data. The obligation to act entails not only the protection of student privacy and the ethical collection, analysis and use of student data, but also, the effective allocation of resources to ensure appropriate and effective interventions to increase effective teaching and learning. The obligation to act is, however tempered by a number of factors, including inter and intra-departmental operational fragmentation and the constraints imposed by changing funding regimes. Increasingly higher education institutions allocate resources in areas that promise the greatest return. Choosing (not) to respond to the needs of specific student populations then raises questions regarding the scope and nature of the moral and legal obligation to act. There is also evidence that students who are at risk of failing often do not respond to institutional interventions to assist them. In this paper we build and expand on recent research by, for example, the LACE and EP4LA workshops to conceptually map the obligation to act which flows from both higher education's mandate to ensure effective and appropriate teaching and learning and its fiduciary duty to provide an ethical and enabling environment for students to achieve success. We examine how the collection and analysis of student data links to both the availability of resources and the will to act and also to the obligation to act. Further, we examine how that obligation unfolds in two open distance education providers from the perspective of a key set of stakeholders - those in immediate contact with students and their learning journeys - the tutors or adjunct faculty.",

            "abstract": "Predictive policing is sweeping the nation, promising the holy grail of policing \u2013 preventing crime before it happens. Police have embraced predictive analytics and data-driven metrics to improve law enforcement tactics, practice, and strategy. Predictive \u201chot spots\u201d become targets for intensive police surveillance. Targeted \u201chot people\u201d become suspects. In big cities and small towns, data-based predictions drive police patrol schedules. Risk assessment algorithms target suspicious individuals. Increased data collection fuels a growing feedback loop requiring more robust data crunching systems.All of these predictive innovations share one thing in common: a belief that crime can be understood by identifying and analyzing crime patterns and risk factors. The insight that risk can be isolated, analyzed, and forecast to deter criminal behavior has led to the creation of a new industry of predictive policing companies. Small start-ups and huge technology corporations are contracting with cities to provide predictive services. New products designed to study crime, social media patterns, and other clues are in development. Federal grants are financing pilot projects. Cities are investing millions in unproven predictive software. And, at this particular moment in American history with a heightened awareness of racial disparity in the criminal justice system, predictive policing has been promoted as a data-driven, race-neutral, objective solution to the failed policing policies of the past. Predictive policing raises profound questions about the nature of predictive analytics and the attached article is the first sustained practical and theoretical critique of predictive policing. Questions of data collection, methodology, transparency, accountability, security, vision, and practical implementation emerge from this move toward actuarial justice. Building off a wealth of theoretical insights from scholars who have addressed the rise of risk assessment throughout the criminal justice system, this article provides an analytical framework to police not just predictive policing, but all future predictive technologies.",

Frequently, the least common values of this target variable are associated with events that are highly relevant for end users (e.g. fraud detection, unusual returns on stock markets, anticipation of catastrophes, etc.). Moreover, the events may have dierent costs and benets, which when associated with the rarity of some of them on the available training data creates serious problems to predictive modelling techniques. This paper presents a survey of existing techniques for handling these important applications of predictive analytics. Although most of the existing work addresses classication tasks (nominal target variables), we also describe methods designed to handle similar problems within regression tasks (numeric target variables). In this survey we discuss the main challenges raised by imbalanced distributions, describe the main approaches to these problems, propose a taxonomy of these methods and refer to some related problems within predictive modelling.",

            "abstract": "The rise of \u201cbig data\u201d analytics in the private sector poses new challenges for privacy advocates. Unlike previous computational models that exploit personally identifiable information (PII) directly, such as behavioral targeting, big data has exploded the definition of PII to make many more sources of data personally identifiable. By analyzing primarily metadata, such as a set of predictive or aggregated findings without displaying or distributing the originating data, big data approaches often operate outside of current privacy protections (Rubinstein 2013; Tene and Polonetsky 2012), effectively marginalizing regulatory schema. Big data presents substantial privacy concerns \u2013 risks of bias or discrimination based on the inappropriate generation of personal data \u2013 a risk we call \u201cpredictive privacy harm.\u201d Predictive analysis and categorization can pose a genuine threat to individuals, especially when it is performed without their knowledge or consent. While not necessarily a harm that falls within the conventional \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d boundaries, such harms still center on an individual\u2019s relationship with data about her. Big data approaches need not rely on having a person\u2019s PII directly: a combination of techniques from social network analysis, interpreting online behaviors and predictive modeling can create a detailed, intimate picture with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, harms can still result when such techniques are done poorly, rendering an inaccurate picture that nonetheless is used to impact on a person\u2019s life and livelihood. In considering how to respond to evolving big data practices, we began by examining the existing rights that individuals have to see and review records pertaining to them in areas such as health and credit information. But it is clear that these existing systems are inadequate to meet current big data challenges. Fair Information Privacy Practices and other notice-and-choice regimes fail to protect against predictive privacy risks in part because individuals are rarely aware of how their individual data is being used to their detriment, what determinations are being made about them, and because at various points in big data processes, the relationship between predictive privacy harms and originating PII may be complicated by multiple technical processes and the involvement of third parties. Thus, past privacy regulations and rights are ill equipped to face current and future big data challenges.We propose a new approach to mitigating predictive privacy harms \u2013 that of a right to procedural data due process. In the Anglo-American legal tradition, procedural due process prohibits the government from depriving an individual\u2019s rights to life, liberty, or property without affording her access to certain basic procedural components of the adjudication process \u2013 including the rights to review and contest the evidence at issue, the right to appeal any adverse decision, the right to know the allegations presented and be heard on the issues they raise. Procedural due process also serves as an enforcer of separation of powers, prohibiting those who write laws from also adjudicating them.While some current privacy regimes offer nominal due process-like mechanisms in relation to closely defined types of data, these rarely include all of the necessary components to guarantee fair outcomes and arguably do not apply to many kinds of big data systems (Terry 2012). A more rigorous framework is needed, particularly given the inherent analytical assumptions and methodological biases built into many big data systems (boyd and Crawford 2012). Building on previous thinking about due process for public administrative computer systems (Steinbock 2005; Citron 2010), we argue that individuals who are privately and often secretly \u201cjudged\u201d by big data should have similar rights to those judged by the courts with respect to how their personal data has been used in such adjudications. Using procedural due process principles, we analogize a system of regulation that would provide such rights against private big data actors.",

However, few research studies to date, have examined the impact of the implemented intervention strategies designed to address such retention challenges. Moreover, the methodological rigor of some of the existing studies has been challenged. This study evaluates the impact of a pilot retention program. The study contrasts the findings obtained by the use of different methods for analysis of the effect of the intervention. The pilot study was undertaken between 2012 and 2014 resulting in a combined enrolment of 11,160 students. A model to predict attrition was developed, drawing on data from student information system, learning management system interactions, and assessment. The predictive model identified some 1868 students as academically at-risk. Early interventions were implemented involving learning and remediation support. Common statistical methods demonstrated a positive association between the intervention and student retention. However, the effect size was low. The use of more advanced statistical methods, specifically mixed-effect methods explained higher variability in the data (over 99%), yet found the intervention had no effect on the retention outcomes. The study demonstrates that more data about individual differences is required to not only explain retention but to also develop more effective intervention approaches.",

Sustainability has become a necessary goal for businesses and a powerful strategy for competitive advantage. There's a need for sustainable innovations along the supply chain to enable companies to have a strong market presence. Developing absorptive capacity both in firms and in supply chains are also integral to responding to dynamic markets and customer needs. The main objective of this paper is to identify the features of big data and predictive analytics applied to sustainable supply chain innovation, and to analyze the role of absorptive capacity. Methods: A literature review investigates how absorptive capacity affects the impact of the utilization of big data and predictive analytics on sustainable supply chain innovation. Results: This paper proposes a conceptual framework linking the different elements. It also proposes a synthesis of the existing definitions of the used concepts. In particular, the role of absorptive capacity as enabler on Big Data and Predictive Analytics on sustainable supply chain innovation is stressed. Conclusions: The paper investigates the emerging paradigm of big data and predictive analytics. The conceptual framework use theoretical foundation of absorptive capacity, and the extant literature on Big Data and predictive analytics. This framework will help us to build a research model for sustainable supply chain innovation applications. Further work is required to develop an action research methodology for validating the framework in depth within a company.",

However, for data that is high-dimensional, a critical step in predictive modeling is determining which features should be included in the models. Feature selection algorithms are often used to remove non-informative features from models. However, there are many different classes of feature selection algorithms. Deciding which one to use is problematic as the algorithmic output is often not amenable to user interpretation. This limits the ability for users to utilize their domain expertise during the modeling process. To improve on this limitation, we developed INFUSE, a novel visual analytics system designed to help analysts understand how predictive features are being ranked across feature selection algorithms, cross-validation folds, and classifiers. We demonstrate how our system can lead to important insights in a case study involving clinical researchers predicting patient outcomes from electronic medical records.",

Many manufacturing systems are not ready to manage big data due to the lack of smart analytics tools. Germany is leading a transformation toward 4th Generation Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) based on Cyber-Physical System based manufacturing and service innovation. As more software and embedded intelligence are integrated in industrial products and systems, predictive technologies can further intertwine intelligent algorithms with electronics and tether-free intelligence to predict product performance degradation and autonomously manage and optimize product service needs. This article addresses the trends of industrial transformation in big data environment as well as the readiness of smart predictive informatics tools to manage big data to achieve transparency and productivity.

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The scientific literature was systematically reviewed to identify relevant empirical studies. These studies were analysed and synthesized in the form of a proposed conceptual framework, which was thereafter applied to further analyse this literature, hence gaining new insights into the field. Findings \u2013 The proposed framework reveals that all relevant studies can be decomposed into a small number of steps, and different approaches can be followed in each step. The application of the framework resulted in interesting findings. For example, most studies support SM predictive power, however, more than one-third of these studies infer predictive power without employing predictive analytics. In addition, a...",

However, data scientists are facing large challenges, handling the massive amount of data efficiently and generating insights with real business value. In this paper, the Intelligent Customer Analytics for Recognition and Exploration (iCARE) framework is presented to analyze banking customer behaviors from banking big data, through analytical modeling methodologies and techniques designed for a key business scenario. Combining IBM software platforms and big data processing power with customized data analytical models, the iCARE solution provides deeper customer insights to satisfy a bank's specific business need and data environment. The advantages of the iCARE framework have been confirmed in a real case study of a bank in southeast China. In this case, iCARE helps generate insights for active customers based on their transaction behavior, using close to 20 terabytes of data.",

Tapping the source of \u2018Big Data\u2019 requires powerful algorithms combined with a strong understanding of the data used. One of the key challenges in predictive analytics is the identification of relevant factors that may explain the variables of interest. In this paper, we present a case study in predictive analytics in which we focus on the selection of relevant exogenous variables. More specifically, we attempt to predict the German electricity spot prices with reference to historical prices and a deep set of weather variables. In order to choose the relevant weather stations, we use the least absolute shrinkage selection operation (LASSO) and random forests to implicitly execute a variable selection. Overall, in our case study of German weather data, we manage to improve forecasting accuracy by up to 16.9% in terms of mean average error.",

However, the adoption of these methods faces multiple challenges particularly at the course level where instructors and students would derive the most benefit from the use of analytics and predictive models. The challenge lies in the knowledge gap between how the data is captured, processed and used to derive models of student behavior, and the subsequent interpretation and the decision to deploy pedagogical actions and interventions by instructors. Simply put, the provision of learning analytics alone has not necessarily led to changing teaching practices. In order to support pedagogical change and aid interpretation, this paper proposes a model that can enable instructors to readily identify subpopulations of students to provide specific support actions. The approach was applied to a first year course with a large number of students. The resulting model classifies students according to their predicted exam scores, based on indicators directly derived from the learning design.",

As a general matter, the suspicion derives from information a police officer observes or knows. It is individualized to a particular person at a particular place. Most reasonable suspicion cases involve police confronting unknown suspects engaged in observable suspicious activities. Essentially, the reasonable suspicion doctrine is based on \u201csmall data\u201d \u2013 discrete facts involving limited information and little knowledge about the suspect. But what if this small data is replaced by \u201cbig data\u201d? What if police can \u201cknow\u201d about the suspect through new networked information sources? Or, what if predictive analytics can forecast who will be the likely troublemakers in a community? The rise of big data technology offers a challenge to the traditional paradigm of Fourth Amendment law. Now, with little effort, most unknown suspects can be \u201cknown,\u201d as a web of information can identify and provide extensive personal data about a suspect independent of the officer\u2019s observations. New data sources including law enforcement databases, third party information sources (phone records, rental records, GPS data, video surveillance data, etc.), and predictive analytics, combined with biometric or facial recognition software, means that information about that suspect can be known in a few data searches. At some point, the data (independent of the observation) may become sufficiently individualized and predictive to justify the seizure of a suspect. The question this article poses is can a Fourth Amendment stop be predicated on the aggregation of specific, individualized, but otherwise non-criminal factors?This article traces the consequences in the shift from a \u201csmall data\u201d reasonable suspicion doctrine, focused on specific, observable actions of unknown suspects, to the \u201cbig data\u201d reality of an interconnected information rich world of known suspects. With more targeted information, police officers on the streets will have a stronger predictive sense about the likelihood that they are observing criminal activity. This evolution, however, only hints at the promise of big data policing. The next phase will be using existing predictive analytics to target suspects without any actual observation of criminal activity, merely relying on the accumulation of various data points. Unknown suspects will become known, not because of who they are but because of the data they left behind. Using pattern matching techniques through networked databases, individuals will be targeted out of the vast flow of informational data. This new reality subverts reasonable suspicion from being a source of protection against unreasonable stops, to a means of justifying those same stops.",

            "abstract": "With the increasingly widespread collection and processing of \"big data,\" there is natural interest in using these data assets to improve decision making. One of the best understood ways to use data to improve decision making is via predictive analytics. An important, open question is: to what extent do larger data actually lead to better predictive models? In this article we empirically demonstrate that when predictive models are built from sparse, fine-grained data-such as data on low-level human behavior-we continue to see marginal increases in predictive performance even to very large scale. The empirical results are based on data drawn from nine different predictive modeling applications, from book reviews to banking transactions. This study provides a clear illustration that larger data indeed can be more valuable assets for predictive analytics. This implies that institutions with larger data assets-plus the skill to take advantage of them-potentially can obtain substantial competitive advantage over institutions without such access or skill. Moreover, the results suggest that it is worthwhile for companies with access to such fine-grained data, in the context of a key predictive task, to gather both more data instances and more possible data features. As an additional contribution, we introduce an implementation of the multivariate Bernoulli Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm that can scale to massive, sparse data.",

However, in general, the industry has not deployed the level of data management and analysis necessary to make use of those data. As a result, healthcare executives face the risk of being overwhelmed by a flood of unusable data. In this essay I argue that, in order to extract actionable information, leaders must take advantage of the promise of data analytics. Small data, predictive modeling expansion, and real\u2010time analytics are three forms of data analytics. On the basis of my analysis for this study, I recommend all three for adoption. Recognizing the uniqueness of each organization's situation, I also suggest that practices, hospitals, and healthcare systems examine small data and conduct real\u2010time analytics and that large\u2010scale organizations managing populations of patients adopt predictive modeling. I found that all three solutions assist in the collection, management, and analysis of raw data to improve the quality of care and decrease costs.",

Researchers, in contrast, have built up a substantial base of techniques for analyzing discourse, social networks, sentiments, predictive models, and in semantic content (i.e., \"intelligent\" curriculum). In spite of the currently limited knowledge exchange and dialogue between researchers, vendors, and practitioners, existing learning analytics implementations indicate significant potential for generating novel insight into learning and vital educational practices. This paper presents an integrated and holistic vision for advancing learning analytics as a research discipline and a domain of practices.
