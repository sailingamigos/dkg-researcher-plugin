                "abstract": "We introduce a Cascaded Diffusion Model (Cas-DM) that improves a Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) by effectively incorporating additional\nmetric functions in training. Metric functions such as the LPIPS loss have been\nproven highly effective in consistency models derived from the score matching.\nHowever, for the diffusion counterparts, the methodology and efficacy of adding\nextra metric functions remain unclear. One major challenge is the mismatch\nbetween the noise predicted by a DDPM at each step and the desired clean image\nthat the metric function works well on. To address this problem, we propose\nCas-DM, a network architecture that cascades two network modules to effectively\napply metric functions to the diffusion model training. The first module,\nsimilar to a standard DDPM, learns to predict the added noise and is unaffected\nby the metric function. The second cascaded module learns to predict the clean\nimage, thereby facilitating the metric function computation. Experiment results\nshow that the proposed diffusion model backbone enables the effective use of\nthe LPIPS loss, leading to state-of-the-art image quality (FID, sFID, IS) on\nvarious established benchmarks.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation and\nspread of toxic aggregates of tau protein. The progression of AD tau pathology\nis thought to be highly stereotyped, which is in part due to the fact that tau\ncan spread between regions via the white matter tracts that connect them.\nMathematically, this phenomenon has been described using models of \"network\ndiffusion\", where the rate of spread of tau between brain regions is\nproportional to its concentration gradient and the amount of white matter\nbetween them. Although these models can robustly predict the progression of\npathology in a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, an\nunder explored aspect of tau spreading is that it is governed not simply by\ndiffusion but also active transport along axonal microtubules. Spread can\ntherefore take on a directional bias, resulting in distinct patterns of\ndeposition, but current models struggle to capture this phenomenon. Recently,\nwe have developed a mathematical model of the axonal transport of toxic tau\nproteins that takes into account the effects tau exerts on the molecular\nmotors. Here we describe and implement a macroscopic version of this model,\nwhich we call the Network Transport Model (NTM). A key feature of this model is\nthat, while it predicts tau dynamics at a regional level, it is parameterized\nin terms of only microscopic processes such as aggregation and transport rates;\nthat is, differences in brain-wide tau progression can be explained by its\nmicroscopic properties. We provide numerical evidence that, as with the\ntwo-neuron model that the NTM extends, there are distinct and rich dynamics\nwith respect to the overall rate of spread and the staging of pathology when we\nsimulated the NTM on the hippocampal subnetwork. The theoretical insights\nprovided by the NTM have broad implications for understanding AD\npathophysiology more generally.",

Our first main result shows\nthat, surprisingly, QSAT on qubits can remain $\\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard, in that\n$(2,5)$-QSAT is $\\mathsf{QMA}_1$-complete. In contrast, $2$-SAT on qubits is\nwell-known to be poly-time solvable [Bravyi, 2006]. Our second main result\nproves that $(3,d)$-QSAT on the 1D line with $d\\in O(1)$ is also\n$\\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard. Finally, we initiate the study of 1D $(2,d)$-QSAT by\ngiving a frustration-free 1D Hamiltonian with a unique, entangled ground state.\n  Our first result uses a direct embedding, combining a novel clock\nconstruction with the 2D circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction of [Gosset, Nagaj,\n2013]. Of note is a new simplified and analytic proof for the latter (as\nopposed to a partially numeric proof in [GN13]). This exploits Unitary Labelled\nGraphs [Bausch, Cubitt, Ozols, 2017] together with a new \"Nullspace Connection\nLemma\", allowing us to break low energy analyses into small patches of\nprojectors, and to improve the soundness analysis of [GN13] from\n$\\Omega(1/T^6)$ to $\\Omega(1/T^2)$, for $T$ the number of gates. Our second\nresult goes via black-box reduction: Given an arbitrary 1D Hamiltonian $H$ on\n$d'$-dimensional qudits, we show how to embed it into an effective null-space\nof a 1D $(3,d)$-QSAT instance, for $d\\in O(1)$.

                "abstract": "We present a method that employs physics-informed deep learning techniques\nfor parametrically solving partial differential equations. The focus is on the\nsteady-state heat equations within heterogeneous solids exhibiting significant\nphase contrast. Similar equations manifest in diverse applications like\nchemical diffusion, electrostatics, and Darcy flow. The neural network aims to\nestablish the link between the complex thermal conductivity profiles and\ntemperature distributions, as well as heat flux components within the\nmicrostructure, under fixed boundary conditions. A distinctive aspect is our\nindependence from classical solvers like finite element methods for data. A\nnoteworthy contribution lies in our novel approach to defining the loss\nfunction, based on the discretized weak form of the governing equation. This\nnot only reduces the required order of derivatives but also eliminates the need\nfor automatic differentiation in the construction of loss terms, accepting\npotential numerical errors from the chosen discretization method. As a result,\nthe loss function in this work is an algebraic equation that significantly\nenhances training efficiency. We benchmark our methodology against the standard\nfinite element method, demonstrating accurate yet faster predictions using the\ntrained neural network for temperature and flux profiles. We also show higher\naccuracy by using the proposed method compared to purely data-driven approaches\nfor unforeseen scenarios.",

Chest\nX-ray (CXR) imaging is a fundamental diagnostic tool, but traditional analysis\nrelies on time-intensive expert evaluation. Recently, deep learning has shown\nimmense potential for automating pneumonia detection from CXRs. This paper\nexplores applying neural networks to improve CXR-based pneumonia diagnosis. We\ndeveloped a novel model fusing Convolution Neural networks (CNN) and Vision\nTransformer networks via model-level ensembling. Our fusion architecture\ncombines a ResNet34 variant and a Multi-Axis Vision Transformer small model.\nBoth base models are initialized with ImageNet pre-trained weights. The output\nlayers are removed, and features are combined using a flattening layer before\nfinal classification. Experiments used the Kaggle pediatric pneumonia dataset\ncontaining 1,341 normal and 3,875 pneumonia CXR images. We compared our model\nagainst standalone ResNet34, Vision Transformer, and Swin Transformer Tiny\nbaseline models using identical training procedures. Extensive data\naugmentation, Adam optimization, learning rate warmup, and decay were employed.\nThe fusion model achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.87%, surpassing the\nbaselines. We also attained excellent sensitivity, specificity, kappa score,\nand positive predictive value. Confusion matrix analysis confirms fewer\nmisclassifications.

The\nmain effect of diffuse flux in the absence of collimated flux is on the\nswimming behaviour of microorganisms in the suspension. At higher diffuse flux,\nthe horizontal component of swimming orientation exhibits a higher magnitude,\nwhich slows the rate of pattern formation in the suspension. Also, the linear\nstability of the suspension predicts that the most unstable mode of disturbance\ntransits from stationary (oscillatory) to oscillatory (stationary) at the\nvariation in the magnitude of diffuse flux for some fixed parameters. The\noverstable nature of disturbance is mostly observed at the high value of\nswimming speed and extinction coefficient.

                "abstract": "The emergence of text-to-image generative models has revolutionized the field\nof deepfakes, enabling the creation of realistic and convincing visual content\ndirectly from textual descriptions. However, this advancement presents\nconsiderably greater challenges in detecting the authenticity of such content.\nExisting deepfake detection datasets and methods often fall short in\neffectively capturing the extensive range of emerging deepfakes and offering\nsatisfactory explanatory information for detection. To address the significant\nissue, this paper introduces a deepfake database (DFLIP-3K) for the development\nof convincing and explainable deepfake detection. It encompasses about 300K\ndiverse deepfake samples from approximately 3K generative models, which boasts\nthe largest number of deepfake models in the literature. Moreover, it collects\naround 190K linguistic footprints of these deepfakes. The two distinguished\nfeatures enable DFLIP-3K to develop a benchmark that promotes progress in\nlinguistic profiling of deepfakes, which includes three sub-tasks namely\ndeepfake detection, model identification, and prompt prediction. The deepfake\nmodel and prompt are two essential components of each deepfake, and thus\ndissecting them linguistically allows for an invaluable exploration of\ntrustworthy and interpretable evidence in deepfake detection, which we believe\nis the key for the next-generation deepfake detection. Furthermore, DFLIP-3K is\nenvisioned as an open database that fosters transparency and encourages\ncollaborative efforts to further enhance its growth. Our extensive experiments\non the developed benchmark verify that our DFLIP-3K database is capable of\nserving as a standardized resource for evaluating and comparing\nlinguistic-based deepfake detection, identification, and prompt prediction\ntechniques.",

In this context, we have first revisited the impact of recently\nmeasurements of $R({D^{(*)}})$ and $R(\\Lambda_c)$ on the parametric space of\nthe NP scenarios. In addition, we have included the $R(J/\\psi)$ and the\n$R(X_c)$ data in the analysis and found that their influence on the best-fit\npoint and the parametric space is mild. Using the recent HFLAV data, after\nvalidating the well established sum rule of $R(\\Lambda_c)$, we derived the\nsimilar sum rule for $R(J/\\psi)$. Furthermore, we have modified the correlation\namong the different observables, giving us their interesting interdependence.\nFinally, to discriminate the various NP scenarios, we have plotted the\ndifferent angular observables and their ratios for $B \\to D^* \\tau\\nu_\\tau$\nagainst the transfer momentum square $\\left(q^2\\right)$, using the $1\\sigma$\nand $2\\sigma$ parametric space of considered NP scenarios. To see the clear\ninfluence of NP on the amplitude of the angular observables, we have also\ncalculated their numerical values in different $q^2$ bins and shown them\nthrough the bar plots.

In\nthis work, we investigate its structural stability using an advanced\nsoft-sphere-discrete-element-model code, DEMBody, which is integrated with\nbonded-aggregate models to simulate highly irregular boulders. The asteroid\nbody is numerically constructed by tens of thousands particles, and then is\nslowly spin up until structural failure. Rubble piles with different\nmorphologies, grain size distributions and structures are investigated. We find\na 2016 HO3 shaped granular asteroid would undergo tensile failure at higher\ncohesive strengths as opposed to shear failure in lower strengths, regardless\nof its shape and constituent grain size ratio. Such a failure mode transition\nis consistent with the priority between the Maximum Tensile Stress criterion\ncriterion and the Drucker-Prager criterion. Therefore, previous works that\nsolely considered the Drucker-Prager failure criterion have underestimated the\nminimal cohesion strength required for fast-rotating asteroids. We predict that\nthe high spin rate of asteroid 2016 HO3 requires a surface cohesion over ~1 Pa\nand a bulk cohesion over ~10-20 Pa. Through comparing these strength conditions\nwith the latest data from asteroid missions, we suggest a higher likelihood of\na monolithic structure over a typical rubble pile structure.

                "abstract": "Solving complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, characterized by\nnonlinear partial differential equations, is crucial in various scientific and\nengineering applications. Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\nsolvers are insufficient to meet the growing requirements for large-scale and\nlong-period simulations. Fortunately, the rapid advancement in neural networks,\nespecially neural operator learning mappings between function spaces, has\nintroduced novel approaches to tackle these challenges via data-driven\nmodeling. In this paper, we propose a Fourier neural operator-based\nfluid-structure interaction solver (FNO-based FSI solver) for efficient\nsimulation of FSI problems, where the solid solver based on the finite\ndifference method is seamlessly integrated with the Fourier neural operator to\npredict incompressible flow using the immersed boundary method. We analyze the\nperformance of the FNO-based FSI solver in the following three situations:\ntraining data with or without the steady state, training method with one-step\nlabel or multi-step labels, and prediction in interpolation or extrapolation.\nWe find that the best performance for interpolation is achieved by training the\noperator with multi-step labels using steady-state data. Finally, we train the\nFNO-based FSI solver using this optimal training method and apply it to vesicle\ndynamics. The results show that the FNO-based FSI solver is capable of\ncapturing the variations in the fluid and the vesicle.",

                "abstract": "Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) based on natural\nlanguage queries are two highly related tasks, which aim to obtain relevant\nmoments within videos and highlight scores of each video clip. Recently,\nseveral methods have been devoted to building DETR-based networks to solve both\nMR and HD jointly. These methods simply add two separate task heads after\nmulti-modal feature extraction and feature interaction, achieving good\nperformance. Nevertheless, these approaches underutilize the reciprocal\nrelationship between two tasks. In this paper, we propose a task-reciprocal\ntransformer based on DETR (TR-DETR) that focuses on exploring the inherent\nreciprocity between MR and HD. Specifically, a local-global multi-modal\nalignment module is first built to align features from diverse modalities into\na shared latent space. Subsequently, a visual feature refinement is designed to\neliminate query-irrelevant information from visual features for modal\ninteraction. Finally, a task cooperation module is constructed to refine the\nretrieval pipeline and the highlight score prediction process by utilizing the\nreciprocity between MR and HD. Comprehensive experiments on QVHighlights,\nCharades-STA and TVSum datasets demonstrate that TR-DETR outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Using NOVA, a one-dimensional hydrodynamic computer code, we accrete\nSolar matter until the TNR is ongoing and then switch to a mixed composition.\nThis approach is guided by the results of multi-dimensional studies of TNRs in\nWDs which find that sufficient mixing with WD core material occurs after the\nTNR is well underway, and levels of enrichment of the CNONeMg elements are\nreached that agree with observations of CN ejecta abundances. Because the\namount of accreted material is inversely proportional to the oxygen abundance,\nby first accreting Solar matter, the amount of accreted material is larger than\nin those simulations with an initially enriched composition. We vary the mass\nof the WD (from 0.6 Msun to 1.35 Msun) and the composition of the mixed\nmaterials. Our results show large enrichments of 7Be in the ejected gases\nimplying that ONe CNe and CO CNe (Starrfield et al. 2020) may be responsible\nfor a significant fraction (about 100 Msun) of the galactic 7Li ( about 1000\nMsun). The production of 22Na and 26Al in CN explosions and the gamma-ray\nemission predicted by our simulations is discussed.

To reconstruct continuous surfaces from discrete point clouds,\nencoding the input points into regular grid features (plane or volume) has been\ncommonly employed in existing approaches. However, these methods typically use\nthe grid as an index for uniformly scattering point features. Compared with the\nirregular point features, the regular grid features may sacrifice some\nreconstruction details but improve efficiency. To take full advantage of these\ntwo types of features, we introduce a novel and high-efficiency attention\nmechanism between the grid and point features named Point-Grid Transformer\n(GridFormer).

                "abstract": "Nonreciprocal devices, allowing to manipulate one-way signals, are crucial to\nquantum information processing and quantum network. Here we propose a nonlinear\ncavity-magnon system, consisting of a microwave cavity coupled to one or two\nyttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) spheres supporting magnons with Kerr nonlinearity, to\ninvestigate nonreciprocal photon blockade. The nonreciprocity originates from\nthe direction-dependent Kerr effect, distinctly different from previous\nproposals with spinning cavities and dissipative couplings. For a single sphere\ncase, nonreciprocal photon blockade can be realized by manipulating the\nnonreciprocal destructive interference between two active paths, via vary the\nKerr coefficient from positive to negative, or vice versa. By optimizing the\nsystem parameters, the perfect and well tuned nonreciprocal photon blockade can\nbe predicted. For the case of two spheres with opposite Kerr effects, only\nreciprocal photon blockade can be observed when two cavity-magnon coupling\nstrengths Kerr strengths are symmetric. However, when coupling strengths or\nKerr strengths become asymmetric, nonreciprocal photon blockade appears. This\nimplies that two-sphere nonlinear cavity-magnon systems can be used to switch\nthe transition between reciprocal and nonreciprocal photon blockades. Our study\noffers a potential platform for investigating nonreciprocal photon blockade\neffect in nonlinear cavity magnonics.",

In this work, we examine the concept\nof hybrid stars - objects containing quark cores surrounded by nucleonic\nenvelopes - as models that account for these new data along with other\n(multimessenger) inferences. We employ a family of 81 nucleonic equations of\nstate (EoSs) based on covariant density functional with variable skewness and\nslope of symmetry energy at saturation density and a constant speed-of-sound\nEoS for quark matter. For each nucleonic EoS, a family of hybrid star EoS is\ngenerated by varying the transition density from nucleonic to quark matter, the\ndensity jump at the transition, and the speed-of-sound. These models are tested\nagainst the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EoS\nand PSR J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EoS. We\nthen examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of\nmasses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347\ndata favors EoS models which predict low-mass twin stars with masses $M\n\\lesssim 1.3\\,M_{\\odot}$ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition\ndensity is low. If combined with a large speed-of-sound in quark matter such\nmodels allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in the range\n$2.0$-$2.6\\,M_{\\odot}$.",

This work is based upon some of the early ideas of quark matter. It\ncan satisfy the different observational constraints on the neutron star (NS),\nsuch as its maximum mass and the canonical radius. In addition, we put an extra\ncomponent inside the NS known as Dark Matter (DM) because it is trapped due to\nits immense gravitational potential. In this work, we explore the impact of\nfermionic DM on the structure of the NS. The equation of state (EOS) is derived\nfor the NS with the quarkyonic matter by assuming that nucleons and quarks are\nin equilibrium, followed by the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism. The\nrecently modeled two parameterizations, such as G3 and IOPB-I, are taken to\ncalculate the various macroscopic properties of the NS. The three unknown\nparameters such as the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale\n($\\Lambda_{\\rm sc}$), and the DM Fermi momentum ($k_f^{\\rm DM}$) are varied to\nobtain the NS properties. The quarkyonic matter stiffens the EOS while DM\nsoftens it. The mutual combination provides us with good theoretical\npredictions for the magnitude of macroscopic properties consistent with the\ndifferent observational results.

Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), as a\nrepresentative method, integrates Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)\nand Image Caption (IC) into a unified framework, resulting in impressive\nresults. CLIP imposes a bidirectional constraints on global representation of\nentire images and sentences. Although IC conducts an unidirectional\nimage-to-text generation on local representation, it lacks any constraint on\nlocal text-to-image reconstruction, which limits the ability to understand\nimages at a fine-grained level when aligned with texts. To achieve multimodal\nalignment from both global and local perspectives, this paper proposes\nSymmetrizing Contrastive Captioners (SyCoCa), which introduces bidirectional\ninteractions on images and texts across the global and local representation\nlevels. Specifically, we expand a Text-Guided Masked Image Modeling (TG-MIM)\nhead based on ITC and IC heads. The improved SyCoCa can further leverage\ntextual cues to reconstruct contextual images and visual cues to predict\ntextual contents. When implementing bidirectional local interactions, the local\ncontents of images tend to be cluttered or unrelated to their textual\ndescriptions. Thus, we employ an attentive masking strategy to select effective\nimage patches for interaction. Extensive experiments on five vision-language\ntasks, including image-text retrieval, image-captioning, visual question\nanswering, and zero-shot/finetuned image classification, validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.",

This\nresults in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is\nespecially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance\nwhere reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical. This\nwork proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the\nconsistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach.\nUnlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our\nmethod employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the\nparagraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into\nindividual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on\npredefined criteria. To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic\nmetric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an\ninterpretable numeric score. Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further\npresent a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons\nwith explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing\nthese inconsistencies. Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis,\nwe show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large\nmargin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the\nconsistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual,\nand summarization consistency tasks.

ACPs are\nshort chains of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and they possess\nthe ability to selectively target and kill cancer cells. One of the key\nadvantages of ACPs is their ability to selectively target cancer cells while\nsparing healthy cells to a greater extent. This selectivity is often attributed\nto differences in the surface properties of cancer cells compared to normal\ncells. That is why ACPs are being investigated as potential candidates for\ncancer therapy. ACPs may be used alone or in combination with other treatment\nmodalities like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. While ACPs hold promise as\na novel approach to cancer treatment, there are challenges to overcome,\nincluding optimizing their stability, improving selectivity, and enhancing\ntheir delivery to cancer cells, continuous increasing in number of peptide\nsequences, developing a reliable and precise prediction model. In this work, we\npropose an efficient transformer-based framework to identify anticancer\npeptides for by performing accurate a reliable and precise prediction model.\nFor this purpose, four different transformer models, namely ESM, ProtBert,\nBioBERT, and SciBERT are employed to detect anticancer peptides from amino acid\nsequences. To demonstrate the contribution of the proposed framework, extensive\nexperiments are carried on widely-used datasets in the literature, two versions\nof AntiCp2, cACP-DeepGram, ACP-740. Experiment results show the usage of\nproposed model enhances classification accuracy when compared to the\nstate-of-the-art studies. The proposed framework, ESM, exhibits 96.45 of\naccuracy for AntiCp2 dataset, 97.66 of accuracy for cACP-DeepGram dataset, and\n88.51 of accuracy for ACP-740 dataset, thence determining new state-of-the-art.",

It is\none of the tools to diagnose quantum chaos and unravel the universal dynamics\ntherein. The definition of SFF in most literature only encapsulates the\ntwo-level correlation. In this manuscript, we extend the definition of SSF to\ninclude the high-order correlation. Specifically, we introduce the standard\ndeviation of energy levels to define correlation functions, from which the\ngeneralized spectral form factor (GSFF) can be obtained by Fourier transforms.\nGSFF provides a more comprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of chaotic\nsystems. Using random matrices as examples, we demonstrate new dynamics\nfeatures that are encoded in GSFF. Remarkably, the GSFF is complex, and both\nthe real and imaginary parts exhibit universal dynamics. For instance, in the\ntwo-level correlated case, the real part of GSFF shows a dip-ramp-plateau\nstructure akin to the conventional counterpart, and the imaginary part for\ndifferent system sizes converges in the long time limit. For the two-level\nGSFF, the closed analytical forms of the real part are obtained and consistent\nwith numerical results. The results of the imaginary part are obtained by\nnumerical calculation. Similar analyses are extended to three-level GSFF.",

Towards achieving this goal, we propose a\nnovel TTA approach involving two effective strategies. First, we progressively\nestimate the global Batch Normalization (BN) statistics of the target\ndistribution with incoming data stream. Leveraging these statistics during\ninference has the ability to effectively reduce domain gap. Furthermore, we\nenhance prediction quality by refining the predicted masks using global class\ncenters. Both strategies employ dynamic momentum for fast and stable\nconvergence.

(2)~Overlaps among different clothing parts\n(e.g., sleeves and torso) can not be modeled by a single TPS transformation, as\nit assumes the clothing as a single planar object; therefore, disregards the\nindependence of movement of different clothing parts. To this end, we make two\nmajor contributions. Concerning the bending limitations of TPS, we propose a\nhuman AnaTomy-Aware Geometric (ATAG) transformation.

The first one follows an explain-and-summarize\nstrategy that first generates high-quality explanation subgraphs which best\nexplain GNNs in terms of feature influence maximization, and then performs a\nsummarization step to generate patterns. We show that this strategy provides an\napproximation ratio of 1/2. Our second algorithm performs a single-pass to an\ninput node stream in batches to incrementally maintain explanation views,\nhaving an anytime quality guarantee of 1/4 approximation. Using real-world\nbenchmark data, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency,\nand scalability of GVEX. Through case studies, we showcase the practical\napplications of GVEX.",

                "abstract": "In last few years the experimental evidence of charmed mesons is increasing\nremarkably. In the present work we systematically studied the $D$ meson by\nemploying Regge phenomenology. By assuming the existence of the quasilinear\nRegge trajectories, several relations between Regge slope, intercept, and meson\nmasses have been extracted. With the aid of these derived relations, Regge\nparameters are evaluated in both the ($J,M^{2}$) and ($n,M^{2}$) planes to\nobtain the mass spectra of $D$ meson. In the forthcoming years, we believe that\nmore candidates will be reported and our predictions could provide useful\ninformation for future experimental evidences.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "We present cosmological constraints from the abundance of galaxy clusters\nselected via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in South Pole Telescope\n(SPT) data with a simultaneous mass calibration using weak gravitational\nlensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST). The cluster sample is constructed from the combined SPT-SZ, SPTpol ECS,\nand SPTpol 500d surveys, and comprises 1,005 confirmed clusters in the redshift\nrange $0.25-1.78$ over a total sky area of 5,200 deg$^2$. We use DES Year 3\nweak-lensing data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z<0.95$ and HST weak-lensing\ndata for 39 clusters with $0.6<z<1.7$. The weak-lensing measurements enable\nrobust mass measurements of sample clusters and allow us to empirically\nconstrain the SZ observable--mass relation. For a flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology,\nand marginalizing over the sum of massive neutrinos, we measure\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}=0.286\\pm0.032$, $\\sigma_8=0.817\\pm0.026$, and the parameter\ncombination $\\sigma_8\\,(\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.25}=0.805\\pm0.016$. Our\nmeasurement of $S_8\\equiv\\sigma_8\\,\\sqrt{\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}/0.3}=0.795\\pm0.029$\nand the constraint from Planck CMB anisotropies (2018 TT,TE,EE+lowE) differ by\n$1.1\\sigma$. In combination with that Planck dataset, we place a 95% upper\nlimit on the sum of neutrino masses $\\sum m_\\nu<0.18$ eV. When additionally\nallowing the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ to vary, we obtain\n$w=-1.45\\pm0.31$ from our cluster-based analysis. In combination with Planck\ndata, we measure $w=-1.34^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$, or a $2.2\\sigma$ difference with a\ncosmological constant. We use the cluster abundance to measure $\\sigma_8$ in\nfive redshift bins between 0.25 and 1.8, and we find the results to be\nconsistent with structure growth as predicted by the $\\Lambda$CDM model fit to\nPlanck primary CMB data.",

Conventionally, trustworthy AI literature relies on the\nprobabilistic framework and calibration as prerequisites for trustworthiness.\nIn this work, we depart from this viewpoint by proposing a novel trust\nframework inspired by the philosophy literature on trust. We present a precise\nmathematical definition of trustworthiness, termed\n$\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness, specifically tailored for a subset of tasks\naimed at maximizing a utility function. We argue that a model's\n$\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness is contingent upon its ability to maximize Bayes\nutility within this task subset. Our first set of results challenges the\nprobabilistic framework by demonstrating its potential to favor less\ntrustworthy models and introduce the risk of misleading trustworthiness\nassessments. Within the context of $\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness, we prove that\nproperly-ranked models are inherently $\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthy. Furthermore,\nwe advocate for the adoption of the AUC metric as the preferred measure of\ntrustworthiness. By offering both theoretical guarantees and experimental\nvalidation, AUC enables robust evaluation of trustworthiness, thereby enhancing\nmodel selection and hyperparameter tuning to yield more trustworthy outcomes.",

                "abstract": "For settling the problem with rotating turbulence modelling, a quasi-dynamic\none-equation subgrid-scale (SGS) model is proposed in this paper. Considering\nthe key role of the joint cascade of kinetic energy and helicity in rotating\nturbulence, the new SGS model is constrained by the fluxes of kinetic energy\nand helicity. Specifically, the new theory of dual channels of helicity flux is\ntaken into account. The modelling of the unclosed quantities is achieved by\nadopting a quasi-dynamic process that eliminates the need for test filtering\ncompared to the classic dynamic process, and the model coefficients are\ndynamically obtained through the SGS kinetic energy transport equation and\nconsidering the joint constraints of kinetic energy and helicity fluxes. As a\nresult, the model demonstrates a high correlation with DNS data in a priori\ntests. We refer to this new model as the quasi-dynamic joint-constraint model\n(QCM), which is introduced for both incompressible and compressible flows. To\nassess the effectiveness of the QCM, numerical experiments are conducted for\nthree typical cases: incompressible streamwise rotating channel flow, transonic\nstreamwise rotating annular pipe flow, and hypersonic transition flow at Mach 6\nover a rotating cone. The results suggest that the QCM has the potential to\nsignificantly improve the prediction of rotational flows that are strongly\ninfluenced by helicity. Additionally, the new model demonstrates excellent\ncapability in handling the transition process.",

In this work we explore\napproximate analytic yield calculations for a future flagship direct imaging\nmission for a survey sample of uniformly distributed set of identical Sun-like\nstars. We consider the dependence of this exoplanet detection yield on factors\nsuch as eta_Earth, telescope diameter, total on-sky time, orbital phase and\nseparation, inner working angle, flux contrast, desired signal-to-noise ratio,\nspectral resolution, and other factors. We consider the impact on yield and\nsurvey efficiency in the absence of and with precursor knowledge of the\nEarth-size analog exoplanets. In particular, for precursor knowledge we assume\nthe exoplanet orbital phase at the time of observation can be optimized so as\nto only image the Earth-size analog exoplanet when it is outside the inner\nworking angle. We find that the yield of flagship direct imaging missions such\nas Habitable Worlds Observatory will be inner-working angle limited for the\nestimated exoplanet yields, and will not be impacted by precursor knowledge\ngiven our assumptions presented herein. However, we find that the survey\nefficiency will be enhanced by precursor knowledge.

With the recent success of the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM),\nwe found it is especially suitable for accurate and crisp edge detection since\nthe denoising process is directly applied to the original image size.\nTherefore, we propose the first diffusion model for the task of general edge\ndetection, which we call DiffusionEdge. To avoid expensive computational\nresources while retaining the final performance, we apply DPM in the latent\nspace and enable the classic cross-entropy loss which is uncertainty-aware in\npixel level to directly optimize the parameters in latent space in a\ndistillation manner. We also adopt a decoupled architecture to speed up the\ndenoising process and propose a corresponding adaptive Fourier filter to adjust\nthe latent features of specific frequencies. With all the technical designs,\nDiffusionEdge can be stably trained with limited resources, predicting crisp\nand accurate edge maps with much fewer augmentation strategies. Extensive\nexperiments on four edge detection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of\nDiffusionEdge both in correctness and crispness.

These embeddings, in turn,\ncontribute to better decision boundaries and lead to improved results in\ndownstream tasks. To validate the effectiveness of SwitchTab, we conduct\nextensive experiments across various domains involving tabular data. The\nresults showcase superior performance in end-to-end prediction tasks with\nfine-tuning. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained salient embeddings can\nbe utilized as plug-and-play features to enhance the performance of various\ntraditional classification methods (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.).\nLastly, we highlight the capability of SwitchTab to create explainable\nrepresentations through visualization of decoupled mutual and salient features\nin the latent space.",

Transmission failures can happen due to network congestion,\nhardware/software issues, communication outage, and other factors. In this\npaper, we investigate the random link failure problem in decentralized\nmulti-task online convex optimization, where agents have individual decisions\nthat are coupled with each other via pairwise constraints. Although widely used\nin constrained optimization, conventional saddle-point algorithms are not\ndirectly applicable here because of random packet dropping. To address this\nissue, we develop a robust decentralized saddle-point algorithm against random\nlink failures with heterogeneous probabilities by replacing the missing\ndecisions of neighbors with their latest received values. Then, by judiciously\nbounding the accumulated deviation stemming from this replacement, we first\nestablish that our algorithm achieves $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and\n$\\mathcal{O}(T^\\frac{3}{4})$ constraint violations for the full information\nscenario, where the complete information on the local cost function is revealed\nto each agent at the end of each time slot. These two bounds match, in order\nsense, the performance bounds of algorithms with perfect communications.\nFurther, we extend our algorithm and analysis to the two-point bandit feedback\nscenario, where only the values of the local cost function at two random points\nare disclosed to each agent sequentially. Performance bounds of the same orders\nas the full information case are derived. Finally, we corroborate the efficacy\nof the proposed algorithms and the analytical results through numerical\nsimulations.",

                "abstract": "Reward-based crowdfunding platforms are becoming increasingly popular to\nfinance projects proposing innovative products, e.g., Kickstarter. One\nimportant challenge of this form of financing is the uncertainty in the quality\nof projects. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty for backers,\nplatforms share information regarding the decisions of earlier backers visiting\nthe project campaign pages. This allows backers not only to rely on their\nexpertise to identify project qualities but also to learn from the decisions of\ntheir fellow backers who might be more informed. Current studies on\nobservational learning (OL) in crowdfunding mainly focus on predicting the\nsuccess chances of projects, and there is a lack of understanding of how OL\naffects crowdfunding dynamics for backers, project creators and platforms. This\npaper aims to fill this gap by using a theoretical OL model involving two\nprojects competing for funding from backers who may have differentiated\nexpertness in identifying project quality. By introducing various performance\nmeasures for backers, creators and platforms and comparing these measures under\nOL to the case without learning, we provide a thorough analysis of how OL\nimpacts crowdfunding outcomes. We find that information sharing and OL always\nbenefit backers, especially when the early backers are experts. Regarding the\nimpact of OL on creators and platforms, our analysis reveals two understudied\nbut important aspects: the tightness of the competition for projects according\nto the availability of funding, and the quality difference among the proposed\nprojects. Additionally, we investigate how OL affects the quality decisions of\ncreators and show that OL increases the incentive for high-quality products,\nespecially in situations where funding is scarce.",

Over the past three decades,\nthe BHP Mitsubishi Alliance Coal framework has been a cornerstone in Australian\ncoal mines for characterising waste dump materials.

In response to these limitations, this study\nproposes an innovative approach to classify coal spoil attributes by remotely\nacquiring images through phones/tablets.

In this work we investigate the effects of\ndark energy on the internal structure of a neutron star composed of two phases,\nwhich leads us to wonder: Do stable neutron stars have a dark-energy core? To\naddress this question, we focus on the radial stability of stellar\nconfigurations composed by a dark-energy core -- described by a Chaplygin-type\nequation of state (EoS) -- and an ordinary-matter external layer which is\ndescribed by a polytropic EoS. We examine the impact of the rate of energy\ndensities at the phase-splitting surface, defined as $\\alpha= \\rho_{\\rm\ndis}^-/\\rho_{\\rm dis}^+$, on the radius, total gravitational mass and\noscillation spectrum. The resulting mass-radius diagrams are notably different\nfrom dark energy stars without a common-matter crust. Specifically, it is found\nthat both the mass and the radius of the maximum-mass configuration decrease as\n$\\alpha$ becomes smaller. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions for\nmass-radius relations consistently describe the observational measurements of\ndifferent massive millisecond pulsars as well as the central compact object\nwithin the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347. The analysis of the normal\noscillation modes reveals that there are two regions of instability on the\n$M(\\rho_c)$ curve when $\\alpha$ is small enough indicating that the usual\nstability criterion $dM/d\\rho_c>0$ still holds for rapid phase transitions.\nHowever, this is no longer true for the case of slow transitions.",

The gauge sector of the theory is specified\nby the topology and geometry of the extra dimensions, and the challenge is to\nreproduce all the features of the Standard Model of Particle Physics from them.\nWe review the state-of-the-art in reproducing the Standard Model from string\ncompactifications, together with the lessons drawn from this fascinating quest.\nWe describe novel scenarios and mechanisms that string theory provides to\naddress some of the Standard Model puzzles, as well as the most frequent\nsignatures of new physics that could be detected in future experiments.

Our\nfindings reveal that paths in the flavor state space of solutions with similar\ninitial conditions diverge exponentially, exhibiting chaos. This inherent chaos\nmakes the microscopic scales of neutrino flavor transformations unpredictable.\nHowever, the domain-averaged neutrino density matrix remains relatively stable,\nwith chaos minimally affecting it.

We assume a 'perfect' instrument\nand neglect instrumental calibration and beam effects. To model the ionospheric\neffect, we considered the static and time-varying ionospheric conditions for\nthe mid-latitude region where LOFAR is situated. In this work, we trained the\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) model for various situations using a synthetic\nset of the global 21cm signals created by altering its parameter space based on\nthe \"$\\rm \\tanh$\" parameterized model and the Accelerated Reionization Era\nSimulations (ARES) algorithm. The obtained result shows that the ANN model can\nextract the global signal parameters with an accuracy of $\\ge 96 \\% $ in the\nfinal study when we include foreground and ionospheric effects.

A popular approach to handling\nmissing data in these settings is through multiple imputation, which can be\nespecially effective when there is an auxiliary variable that is strongly\npredictive of and has a smaller amount of missing data than the variable of\ninterest. However, standard methods for multiple imputation of hierarchical\ntime series data can perform poorly when the auxiliary variable and the\nvariable of interest are have a nonlinear relationship. Performance of standard\nmultiple imputation methods can also suffer if the substantive analysis model\nof interest is uncongenial to the imputation model, which can be a common\noccurrence for social science data if the imputation phase is conducted\nindependently of the analysis phase. We propose a Bayesian method for multiple\nimputation of hierarchical nonlinear time series data that uses a sequential\ndecomposition of the joint distribution and incorporates smoothing splines to\naccount for nonlinear relationships between variables. We compare the proposed\nmethod with existing multiple imputation methods through a simulation study and\nan application to secondary school enrollment data. We find that the proposed\nmethod can lead to substantial performance increases for estimation of\nparameters in uncongenial analysis models and for prediction of individual\nmissing values.",

To\naddress this gap, a radar-based step length measurement system for the home is\nproposed based on detection and tracking using radar point cloud, followed by\nDoppler speed profiling of the torso to obtain step lengths in the home. The\nproposed method was evaluated in a clinical environment, involving 35 frail\nolder adults, to establish its validity. Additionally, the method was assessed\nin people's homes, with 21 frail older adults who had participated in the\nclinical assessment. The proposed radar-based step length measurement method\nwas compared to the gold standard Zeno Walkway Gait Analysis System, revealing\na 4.5cm/8.3% error in a clinical setting.

                "abstract": "The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a spaceborne lidar\ninstrument that collects near-global measurements of forest structure. While\nexpansive in scope, GEDI samples are spatially sparse and cover a small\nfraction of the land surface. Converting the sparse samples into spatially\ncomplete predictive maps is of practical importance for many ecological\nstudies. A complicating factor is that GEDI collects measurements over forested\nand non-forested land alike, with no automatic labeling of the land type. Such\nclassification is important, as it categorically influences the probability\ndistribution of the spatial process and the ecological interpretation of the\nobservations/predictions. We implement a spatial mixture model, separating the\nspatial domain into two latent classes. The latent classes are governed by a\nBernoulli spatial process and within each class the process is governed by a\nseparate spatial model. Model predictions take the form of scalar predictions\nas well as discrete labeling of the class membership. Inference is conducted\nthrough a Bayesian paradigm, yielding rich quantification of prediction and\nuncertainty. We demonstrate the method using GEDI data over Wollemi National\nPark. When compared to a single spatial model, the mixture model achieves much\nhigher posterior predictive densities on the true value. When compared to a\nrandom forest model, a common algorithmic approach in the remote sensing\ncommunity, the random forest achieves better absolute prediction accuracy for\nprediction locations far from observed training data locations, but at the\nexpense of location-specific assessments of uncertainty. The unsupervised\nbinary classifications of the mixture model appear broadly ecologically\ninterpretable as forest and non-forest when compared to optical imagery, but\nfurther comparison to ground-truth data is required.",

In recent years, graph neural networks have achieved\nremarkable performance in this problem by formulating multiple stocks as\ngraph-structured data. However, most of these approaches rely on artificially\ndefined factors to construct static stock graphs, which fail to capture the\nintrinsic interdependencies between stocks that rapidly evolve. In addition,\nthese methods often ignore the hierarchical features of the stocks and lose\ndistinctive information within. In this work, we propose a novel graph learning\napproach implemented without expert knowledge to address these issues. First,\nour approach automatically constructs dynamic stock graphs by entropy-driven\nedge generation from a signal processing perspective. Then, we further learn\ntask-optimal dependencies between stocks via a generalized graph diffusion\nprocess on constructed stock graphs.

This is\nconsistent with the thermal energy of the HII region as well as with the energy\ndeposited by the stellar wind luminosity from HD 169442A, an O7 V star, over\nthe 0.5 Myr lifetime of the star. The observed momentum of the PDR shell is\nlower than what theoretical calculations predict for the radial momentum due to\nthe shell being swept up by an expanding HII region, which suggests that\nsignificant mass loss has occurred in M20 due to the dispersal of the\nsurrounding gas by the advancing ionization front.",

To extract knowledge from the cell firings, in\nthis paper we learn an interpretable graph-based classifier from data to\npredict the firings of ganglion cells in response to visual stimuli.\nSpecifically, we learn a positive semi-definite (PSD) metric matrix $\\mathbf{M}\n\\succeq 0$ that defines Mahalanobis distances between graph nodes (visual\nevents) endowed with pre-computed feature vectors; the computed inter-node\ndistances lead to edge weights and a combinatorial graph that is amenable to\nbinary classification. Mathematically, we define the objective of metric matrix\n$\\mathbf{M}$ optimization using a graph adaptation of large margin nearest\nneighbor (LMNN), which is rewritten as a semi-definite programming (SDP)\nproblem. We solve it efficiently via a fast approximation called Gershgorin\ndisc perfect alignment (GDPA) linearization. The learned metric matrix\n$\\mathbf{M}$ provides interpretability: important features are identified along\n$\\mathbf{M}$'s diagonal, and their mutual relationships are inferred from\noff-diagonal terms.

When the statistic is not asymptotically pivotal,\nconstructing the critical value for each grid point in the parameter space adds\nto the computational burden. In this paper, we convert the computational issue\ninto a classification problem by using a support vector machine (SVM)\nclassifier. Its decision function provides a faster and more systematic way of\ndividing the parameter space into two regions: inside vs. outside of the\nconfidence set. We label those points in the CS as 1 and those outside as -1.\nResearchers can train the SVM classifier on a grid of manageable size and use\nit to determine whether points on denser grids are in the CS or not. We\nestablish certain conditions for the grid so that there is a tuning that allows\nus to asymptotically reproduce the test in the CS.

However,\ncurrent geometric GNNs only offer a mean-field approximation of the many-body\nsystem, encapsulated within two-body message passing, thus falling short in\ncapturing intricate relationships within these geometric graphs. To address\nthis limitation, tensor networks, widely employed by computational physics to\nhandle manybody systems using high-order tensors, have been introduced.\nNevertheless, integrating these tensorized networks into the message-passing\nframework of GNNs faces scalability and symmetry conservation (e.g.,\npermutation and rotation) challenges.

Our\nmethod effectively models complex many-body relationships, suppressing\nmean-field approximations, and captures symmetries within geometric graphs.\nImportantly, it seamlessly replaces the standard message-passing and\nlayer-aggregation modules intrinsic to geometric GNNs.

                "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is an important process in astrophysical environments,\nas it re-configures magnetic field topology and converts magnetic energy into\nthermal and kinetic energy. In extreme astrophysical systems, such as black\nhole coronae and pulsar magnetospheres, radiative cooling modifies the energy\npartition by radiating away internal energy, which can lead to the radiative\ncollapse of the layer. In this paper, we perform 2D & 3D simulations to model\nthe MARZ (Magnetic Reconnection on Z) experiments, which are designed to access\ncooling rates in the laboratory necessary to investigate reconnection in a\npreviously unexplored radiatively-cooled regime. These simulations are\nperformed in GORGON, an Eulerian resistive magnetohydrodynamic code, which\nmodels the experimental geometry comprising two exploding wire arrays driven by\n20 MA of current on the Z machine (Sandia National Laboratories). Radiative\nlosses are implemented using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium tables\ncomputed using the atomic code Spk, and we probe the effects of radiation\ntransport by implementing both a local radiation loss model and P$_{1/3}$\nmulti-group radiation transport. The load produces highly collisional,\nsuper-Alfv\\'enic $(M_{A} \\approx 1.5)$, supersonic $(M_S \\approx 4-5)$ plasma\nflows which generate a reconnection layer ($L/{\\delta} \\approx 100, S_L \\approx\n400$). The reconnection layer undergoes radiative collapse when the radiative\nlosses exceed Ohmic and compressional heating ${\\tau}_{cool}^{-1}/{\\tau}_A^{-1}\n\\approx 100$; this generates a cold strongly compressed current sheet, leading\nto an accelerated reconnection rate, consistent with theoretical predictions.\nFinally, the current sheet is unstable to the plasmoid instability, but the\nmagnetic islands are extinguished by strong radiative cooling before ejection\nfrom the layer.",

The general objective of\nthis paper is to systematically review applications of machine learning and\nInternet of Things (IoT) for outdoor air pollution prediction and the\ncombination of monitoring sensors and input features used. Two research\nquestions were formulated for this review. 1086 publications were collected in\nthe initial PRISMA stage. After the screening and eligibility phases, 37 papers\nwere selected for inclusion. A cost-based analysis was conducted on the\nfindings to highlight high-cost monitoring, low-cost IoT and hybrid enabled\nprediction. Three methods of prediction were identified: time series,\nfeature-based and spatio-temporal. This review's findings identify major\nlimitations in applications found in the literature, namely lack of coverage,\nlack of diversity of data and lack of inclusion of context-specific features.\nThis review proposes directions for future research and underlines practical\nimplications in healthcare, urban planning, global synergy and smart cities.",

However, methodologies using\nneural networks, such as PINN and neural operators, lack robustness and\ngeneralization power. To compensate for such drawbacks, there are many types of\nresearch combining classical numerical schemes and machine learning methods by\nreplacing a small portion of the numerical schemes with neural networks. In\nthis work, we focus on hyperbolic conservation laws and replace numerical\nfluxes in the numerical schemes by neural operator. For this, we construct\nlosses that are motivated by numerical schemes for conservation laws and\napproximate numerical flux by FNO. Through experiments, we show that our\nmethodology has advantages of both numerical schemes and FNO by comparing with\noriginal methods. For instance, we demonstrate our method gains robustness,\nresolution invariance property, and feasibility of a data-driven method. Our\nmethod especially has the ability to predict continuously in time and\ngeneralization power on the out-of-distribution samples, which are challenges\nto be tackled for existing neural operator methods.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have permeated various disciplinary\ndomains, ranging from bioinformatics to financial analytics, where their\napplication has become an indispensable facet of contemporary scientific\nresearch endeavors. However, the inherent limitations of traditional neural\nnetworks arise due to their relatively fixed network structures and activation\nfunctions. 1, The type of activation function is single and relatively fixed,\nwhich leads to poor \"unit representation ability\" of the network, and it is\noften used to solve simple problems with very complex networks; 2, the network\nstructure is not adaptive, it is easy to cause network structure redundant or\ninsufficient. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a novel\nneural network called X-Net. By utilizing our designed Alternating\nBackpropagation mechanism, X-Net dynamically selects appropriate activation\nfunctions based on derivative information during training to enhance the\nnetwork's representation capability for specific tasks. Simultaneously, it\naccurately adjusts the network structure at the neuron level to accommodate\ntasks of varying complexities and reduce computational costs. Through a series\nof experiments, we demonstrate the dual advantages of X-Net in terms of\nreducing model size and improving representation power. Specifically, in terms\nof the number of parameters, X-Net is only 3$\\%$ of baselines on average, and\nonly 1.4$\\%$ under some tasks. In terms of representation ability, X-Net can\nachieve an average $R^2$=0.985 on the fitting task by only optimizing the\nactivation function without introducing any parameters. Finally, we also tested\nthe ability of X-Net to help scientific discovery on data from multiple\ndisciplines such as society, energy, environment, and aerospace, and achieved\nconcise and good results.",

Such\nmergers are predicted to originate in the vicinity of massive black holes\n(MBHs). Especially, GW190814, due to its secondary mass and mass ratio being\nbeyond the expectations of isolated stellar evolution theories, is a promising\nevent that has happened in an active galactic nucleus(AGN) disk. In this model,\na compact object resides in the vicinity of a merging BBH. Here we report\nmultiple pieces of evidence pointing to the fact that GW190814 is a BBH merging\nnear a compact object. The orbital motion of BBHs around the third body\nproduces a line-of-sight acceleration (LSA) and induces a varying Doppler\nshift. Using a waveform template that considers LSA, we perform Bayesian\ninference on a few BBH events with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the\ngravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC). Compared to the model for isolated\nBBH mergers, we obtain significantly higher network signal-to-noise ratios for\nGW190814 by that with the LSA and constrain the LSA to $a =\n0.0014^{+0.0014}_{-0.0022} ~c~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In addition, the logarithmic\nBayes factor for the LSA case over the isolated case is $16.6$, which means the\nLSA model is significantly preferred by the GW data.

Interestingly, using the atomistic model developed by our group, it\nis clearly seen that different atoms are not switched together. In addition,\nour study reveals that the nature of switching is spatially nonuniform even in\nthe small sample with the dimension of 20 nm-20 nm. Furthermore, the\ncharacteristics of nonuniformity are completely different for samples with\ndifferent Gd composition (x). When x is close to the magnetization compensation\npoint, successful switching cannot be obtained, but is accompanied by the\nstable oscillation. The atom type that dominates the oscillation is different\nfrom that predicted by the two-sublattice macrospin model.

                "abstract": "The recovery of 3D human mesh from monocular images has significantly been\ndeveloped in recent years. However, existing models usually ignore spatial and\ntemporal information, which might lead to mesh and image misalignment and\ntemporal discontinuity. For this reason, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal\nAlignment Fusion (STAF) model. As a video-based model, it leverages coherence\nclues from human motion by an attention-based Temporal Coherence Fusion Module\n(TCFM). As for spatial mesh-alignment evidence, we extract fine-grained local\ninformation through predicted mesh projection on the feature maps. Based on the\nspatial features, we further introduce a multi-stage adjacent Spatial Alignment\nFusion Module (SAFM) to enhance the feature representation of the target frame.\nIn addition to the above, we propose an Average Pooling Module (APM) to allow\nthe model to focus on the entire input sequence rather than just the target\nframe. This method can remarkably improve the smoothness of recovery results\nfrom video. Extensive experiments on 3DPW, MPII3D, and H36M demonstrate the\nsuperiority of STAF. We achieve a state-of-the-art trade-off between precision\nand smoothness. Our code and more video results are on the project page\nhttps://yw0208.github.io/staf/",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available\nsource code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.\nHowever, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within\na specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing\nAPIs. Instead, LLMs often invent, or \"hallucinate\", non-existent APIs or\nproduce variants of already existing code. Although the API information is\navailable to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion\ntechniques from including all relevant context into the prompt. This paper\npresents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds\nthe predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable\nAPI references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable\ncontext information in the prompt. The approach exploits the observation that\nLLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails\nto correctly refer to already existing APIs. De-Hallucinator automatically\nidentifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to\nthe model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt. Our\nevaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in\nopen-source Python projects. We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves\nthe predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the\nmodel only with the code before the cursor. In particular, the approach\nimproves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of\ncorrectly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Effective collaboration requires groups to strategically regulate themselves\nto overcome challenges. Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due\nto differences in members' perceptions of challenges which may benefit from\nexternal support. In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging\nthree distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge\nrule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language\nmodel (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification\n(cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from\nstudent discourse, was investigated. The results show that the supervised ML\nand the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast\nto the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered\nfeatures by experts. The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three\napproaches' performance for automated detection and support of students'\nchallenge moments in collaborative learning activities. It argues that,\nalthough LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to\nissues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of\nlearning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity\nevaluation, privacy and confabulation. We conclude the paper with a discussion\non additional considerations, including model transparency to explore feasible\nand meaningful analytical feedback for students and educators using LLMs.",

By systematically\nanalyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus\nmaterial by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The\nstructural optimizations have been carried out using the FP-LAPW (Full\nPotential Linear Augmented Plane Wave) basis, as implemented in the ELK using\ntb-mBJ exchange correlation potential. Computed structural parameters are in\ngood comparison with literature reports. Further, optimized crystal structures\nwere used for computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric\nproperties using pseudo potential based Quantum espresso code. Dynamical\nstability predicts material can withstand strain upto 10% strain. Computed\nelectronic structure reveals material to be indirect wide bandgap ferromagnetic\nmaterial with magnetic moment 1{\\mu}B. With increase in the biaxial tensile\nstrain the band gap increases. Furthermore, the computed magneto-thermoelectric\nproperties predicts high Seebeck coefficient of ~ 400 {\\mu}V/K and low thermal\nconductivity of ~ 1.13 X 1014 W/msK in LaBrI which results high ZT of ~ 1.92\nwith 8% strain at 800 K with p-type doping. Thus, present study supports the\nfact that tensile strain on ferromagnetic LaBrI material can further enhance TE\nproperties and making it to be a promising material for TE applications at\nhigher temperature.",

After\nlaying down our theoretical approach in particular discussing how to compute\ncharge and spin bond currents, DFT+NEGF calculations are carried out for ideal\nclean systems. In these the transport is ballistic and the linear response\nlimit is met. The SHE emerges in a central region attached to two leads when we\napply a bias voltage so that electrons are accelerated by a uniform electric\nfield. As a result, we obtain a finite spin-Hall current and, by performing a\nscaling analysis with respect to the system size, we estimate the ballistic\nspin Hall conductivity (SHC). We consider 5d metals with fcc and bcc crystal\nstructures, finding that the SHC exhibits a rough qualitative dependence on the\nd-band filling, and comment on these results in relation to existing\nliterature.

Existing approaches for SFDA focus on\nself-training usually including well-established entropy minimization and\npseudo-labeling techniques. Recent work suggested a co-learning strategy to\nimprove the quality of the generated target pseudo-labels using robust\npretrained networks such as Swin-B. However, since the generated pseudo-labels\ndepend on the source model, they may be noisy due to domain shift. In this\npaper, we view SFDA from the perspective of label noise learning and learn to\nde-confuse the pseudo-labels. More specifically, we learn a noise transition\nmatrix of the pseudo-labels to capture the label corruption of each class and\nlearn the underlying true label distribution. Estimating the noise transition\nmatrix enables a better true class-posterior estimation results with better\nprediction accuracy.

Despite\nadvantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive\nredundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and\ncompact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated\ninformation blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images\n(WSIs) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic\ndata, leading to an ``intra-modal redundancy\" issue. (2) Duplicated information\namong modalities dominates the representation of multimodal data, which makes\nmodality-specific information prone to being ignored, resulting in an\n``inter-modal redundancy\" issue. To address these, we propose a new framework,\nPrototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling (PIBD), consisting of\nPrototypical Information Bottleneck (PIB) module for intra-modal redundancy and\nPrototypical Information Disentanglement (PID) module for inter-modal\nredundancy. Specifically, a variant of information bottleneck, PIB, is proposed\nto model prototypes approximating a bunch of instances for different risk\nlevels, which can be used for selection of discriminative instances within\nmodality. PID module decouples entangled multimodal data into compact distinct\ncomponents: modality-common and modality-specific knowledge, under the guidance\nof the joint prototypical distribution.

While the amodal segmentation task is to predict the\ncomplete mask of partially occluded objects, it is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive to annotate the pixel-level ground truth amodal masks.\nBox-level supervised amodal segmentation addresses this challenge by relying\nsolely on ground truth bounding boxes and instance classes as supervision,\nthereby alleviating the need for exhaustive pixel-level annotations.\nNevertheless, current box-level methodologies encounter limitations in\ngenerating low-resolution masks and imprecise boundaries, failing to meet the\ndemands of practical real-world applications. We present a novel solution to\ntackle this problem by introducing a directed expansion approach from visible\nmasks to corresponding amodal masks. Our approach involves a hybrid end-to-end\nnetwork based on the overlapping region - the area where different instances\nintersect. Diverse segmentation strategies are applied for overlapping regions\nand non-overlapping regions according to distinct characteristics. To guide the\nexpansion of visible masks, we introduce an elaborately-designed connectivity\nloss for overlapping regions, which leverages correlations with visible masks\nand facilitates accurate amodal segmentation.

In this\ncontribution we study parameter identifiability in a multi-resource\nconsumer-resource model, for which we can obtain the steady-state and\nout-of-equilibrium probability distributions of predator's abundances by\nanalytically solving the master equation. Based on these analytical results, we\ncan conduct in silico experiments by tracking the abundance of consumers that\nare either searching for or handling prey, data then used for maximum\nlikelihood parameter estimation.

The\ntrajectories include further exotic states with higher angular momentum or\nhigher stringy excited states. A trajectory is a property of a genuine exotic\nhadron and can be used to distinguish between the latter and a molecule. We\nexamine 71 tetraquarks and 210 pentaquarks. Few of these states have already\nbeen found but most of the predicted zoo have yet not been discovered. We\nanalyze the strong decay processes of these exotic hadrons and compute the\ncorresponding decay widths of part of them.",

To further reduce the number of interactions\nand the computational complexity of the iterative scheme, we propose a\ntwo-stage probing beam selection scheme. Firstly, probing beams are selected\nfrom a location-specific codebook designed by an entropy-based criterion, and\npredictions are made with corresponding feedback. Secondly, the optimal beam is\nidentified using additional probing beams with the highest predicted power\nvalues.

For an example of the liner advection, we\nconsider the $O(n)$ model in the steady shear. Our scaling analysis reveals\nthat the model can undergo the continuous symmetry breaking even in $d=2$ and,\nmoreover, predicts the upper critical dimension $d_{\\rm up}=2$. These results\nare fully consistent with a recent numerical simulation of the $O(2)$ model,\nwhere the authors reported a continuous symmetry breaking characterized by the\nmean-field critical exponents in $d=2$. For an example of the non-linear\nadvection, we consider Toner and Tu model, which was introduced to explain the\npolar-ordered flocks observed, for instance, in the Vicsek model in $d=2$. Our\nsimple scaling argument reproduces the previous results by the dynamical\nrenormalization theory. We furthermore discuss the effects of the additional\nnon-linear terms discovered by the recent re-analysis of the hydrodynamic\nequation of the polar-ordered flocks. Our scaling argument predicts that the\nadditional non-linear terms modify the scaling exponents and, in particular,\nrecover the isotropic scaling behavior reported in the previous numerical\nsimulation of the Vicsek model.",

                "abstract": "Multi-modal Learning has attracted widespread attention in medical image\nanalysis. Using multi-modal data, whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical\ninformation, can improve the performance of deep learning models in the\ndiagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. However, clinical information is\nnot easy to collect in clinical practice due to privacy concerns, limited\nresources, lack of interoperability, etc. Although patient selection can ensure\nthe training set to have multi-modal data for model development, missing\nmodality of clinical information can appear during test. This normally leads to\nperformance degradation, which limits the use of multi-modal models in the\nclinic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional distillation\nframework consisting of a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch. The\nsingle-modal branch acquires the complete multi-modal knowledge from the\nmulti-modal branch, while the multi-modal learns the robust features of WSI\nfrom the single-modal. We conduct experiments on a public dataset of Lymph Node\nMetastasis in Early Breast Cancer to validate the method. Our approach not only\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 0.861 on the test set\nwithout missing data, but also yields an AUC of 0.842 when the rate of missing\nmodality is 80\\%. This shows the effectiveness of the approach in dealing with\nmulti-modal data and missing modality. Such a model has the potential to\nimprove treatment decision-making for early breast cancer patients who have\naxillary lymph node metastatic status.",

                "abstract": "Point cloud completion is an indispensable task for recovering complete point\nclouds due to incompleteness caused by occlusion, limited sensor resolution,\netc. The family of coarse-to-fine generation architectures has recently\nexhibited great success in point cloud completion and gradually became\nmainstream. In this work, we unveil one of the key ingredients behind these\nmethods: meticulously devised feature extraction operations with explicit\ncross-resolution aggregation. We present Cross-Resolution Transformer that\nefficiently performs cross-resolution aggregation with local attention\nmechanisms. With the help of our recursive designs, the proposed operation can\ncapture more scales of features than common aggregation operations, which is\nbeneficial for capturing fine geometric characteristics. While prior\nmethodologies have ventured into various manifestations of inter-level\ncross-resolution aggregation, the effectiveness of intra-level one and their\ncombination has not been analyzed. With unified designs, Cross-Resolution\nTransformer can perform intra- or inter-level cross-resolution aggregation by\nswitching inputs. We integrate two forms of Cross-Resolution Transformers into\none up-sampling block for point generation, and following the coarse-to-fine\nmanner, we construct CRA-PCN to incrementally predict complete shapes with\nstacked up-sampling blocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on several widely used\nbenchmarks.

                "abstract": "Despite the recent progress in deep neural networks (DNNs), it remains\nchallenging to explain the predictions made by DNNs. Existing explanation\nmethods for DNNs mainly focus on post-hoc explanations where another\nexplanatory model is employed to provide explanations. The fact that post-hoc\nmethods can fail to reveal the actual original reasoning process of DNNs raises\nthe need to build DNNs with built-in interpretability. Motivated by this, many\nself-explaining neural networks have been proposed to generate not only\naccurate predictions but also clear and intuitive insights into why a\nparticular decision was made. However, existing self-explaining networks are\nlimited in providing distribution-free uncertainty quantification for the two\nsimultaneously generated prediction outcomes (i.e., a sample's final prediction\nand its corresponding explanations for interpreting that prediction).\nImportantly, they also fail to establish a connection between the confidence\nvalues assigned to the generated explanations in the interpretation layer and\nthose allocated to the final predictions in the ultimate prediction layer. To\ntackle the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we design a novel\nuncertainty modeling framework for self-explaining networks, which not only\ndemonstrates strong distribution-free uncertainty modeling performance for the\ngenerated explanations in the interpretation layer but also excels in producing\nefficient and effective prediction sets for the final predictions based on the\ninformative high-level basis explanations. We perform the theoretical analysis\nfor the proposed framework. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the\neffectiveness of the proposed uncertainty framework.",

                "abstract": "Coherent small-amplitude unsteadiness of the shock wave and the separation\nregion over a canonical double cone flow, termed in literature as\noscillation-type unsteadiness, is experimentally studied at Mach 6. The double\ncone model is defined by three non-dimensional geometric parameters: fore- and\naft-cone angles ($\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$), and ratio of the conical slant\nlengths ($\\Lambda$). Previous studies of oscillations have been qualitative in\nnature, and mostly restricted to a special case of the cone model with fixed\n$\\theta_1 = 0^\\circ$ and $\\theta_2 = 90^\\circ$ (referred to as the\nspike-cylinder model), where $\\Lambda$ becomes the sole governing parameter. In\nthe present effort we investigate the self-sustained flow oscillations in the\n$\\theta_1$-$\\Lambda$ parameter space for fixed $\\theta_2 = 90^\\circ$ using\ntime-resolved schlieren visualization. The experiments reveal two distinct\nsub-types of oscillations, characterized by the motion (or lack thereof) of the\nseparation point on the fore-cone surface. The global time scale associated\nwith flow oscillation is extracted using spectral proper orthogonal\ndecomposition. The non-dimensional frequency (Strouhal number) of oscillation\nis seen to exhibit distinct scaling for the two oscillation sub-types. The\nrelationship observed between the local flow properties, instability of the\nshear layer, and geometric constraints on the flow suggests that an\naeroacoustic feedback mechanism sustains the oscillations. Based on this\ninsight, a simple model with no empiricism is developed for the Strouhal\nnumber. The model predictions are found to match well with experimental\nmeasurements. The model provides helpful physical insight into the nature of\nthe self-sustained flow oscillations over a double cone at high-speeds.",

                "abstract": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has emerged as a vital tool to evaluate\nagents' ability to understand human daily behaviors. Despite the recent success\nof large vision language models in many multi-modal tasks, complex situation\nreasoning over videos involving multiple human-object interaction events still\nremains challenging. In contrast, humans can easily tackle it by using a series\nof episode memories as anchors to quickly locate question-related key moments\nfor reasoning. To mimic this effective reasoning strategy, we propose the\nGlance-Focus model. One simple way is to apply an action detection model to\npredict a set of actions as key memories. However, these actions within a\nclosed set vocabulary are hard to generalize to various video domains. Instead\nof that, we train an Encoder-Decoder to generate a set of dynamic event\nmemories at the glancing stage. Apart from using supervised bipartite matching\nto obtain the event memories, we further design an unsupervised memory\ngeneration method to get rid of dependence on event annotations. Next, at the\nfocusing stage, these event memories act as a bridge to establish the\ncorrelation between the questions with high-level event concepts and low-level\nlengthy video content. Given the question, the model first focuses on the\ngenerated key event memory, then focuses on the most relevant moment for\nreasoning through our designed multi-level cross-attention mechanism. We\nconduct extensive experiments on four Multi-Event VideoQA benchmarks including\nSTAR, EgoTaskQA, AGQA, and NExT-QA.

                "abstract": "The Kov\\'ats Retention index (RI) is a quantity measured using gas\nchromatography and commonly used in the identification of chemical structures.\nCreating libraries of observed RI values is a laborious task, so we explore the\nuse of a deep neural network for predicting RI values from structure for\nstandard semipolar columns. This network generated predictions with a mean\nabsolute error of 15.1 and, in a quantification of the tail of the error\ndistribution, a 95th percentile absolute error of 46.5. Because of the\nArtificial Intelligence Retention Indices (AIRI) network's accuracy, it was\nused to predict RI values for the NIST EI-MS spectral libraries. These RI\nvalues are used to improve chemical identification methods and the quality of\nthe library. Estimating uncertainty is an important practical need when using\nprediction models. To quantify the uncertainty of our network for each\nindividual prediction, we used the outputs of an ensemble of 8 networks to\ncalculate a predicted standard deviation for each RI value prediction. This\npredicted standard deviation was corrected to follow the error between observed\nand predicted RI values. The Z scores using these predicted standard deviations\nhad a standard deviation of 1.52 and a 95th percentile absolute Z score\ncorresponding to a mean RI value of 42.6.",

                "abstract": "Real-time safety metrics are important for the automated driving system (ADS)\nto assess the risk of driving situations and to assist the decision-making.\nAlthough a number of real-time safety metrics have been proposed in the\nliterature, systematic performance evaluation of these safety metrics has been\nlacking. As different behavioral assumptions are adopted in different safety\nmetrics, it is difficult to compare the safety metrics and evaluate their\nperformance. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we propose an\nevaluation framework utilizing logged vehicle trajectory data, in that vehicle\ntrajectories for both subject vehicle (SV) and background vehicles (BVs) are\nobtained and the prediction errors caused by behavioral assumptions can be\neliminated. Specifically, we examine whether the SV is in a collision\nunavoidable situation at each moment, given all near-future trajectories of\nBVs. In this way, we level the ground for a fair comparison of different safety\nmetrics, as a good safety metric should always alarm in advance to the\ncollision unavoidable moment. When trajectory data from a large number of trips\nare available, we can systematically evaluate and compare different metrics'\nstatistical performance. In the case study, three representative real-time\nsafety metrics, including the time-to-collision (TTC), the PEGASUS Criticality\nMetric (PCM), and the Model Predictive Instantaneous Safety Metric (MPrISM),\nare evaluated using a large-scale simulated trajectory dataset. The proposed\nevaluation framework is important for researchers, practitioners, and\nregulators to characterize different metrics, and to select appropriate metrics\nfor different applications. Moreover, by conducting failure analysis on moments\nwhen a safety metric failed, we can identify its potential weaknesses which are\nvaluable for its potential refinements and improvements.",

Pathologically,\nthyroid tumors pose diagnostic challenges due to improper specimen sampling. In\nthis study, we have designed a three-stage model using representation learning\nto integrate pixel-level and slice-level annotations for distinguishing thyroid\ntumors. This structure includes a pathology structure recognition method to\npredict structures related to thyroid tumors, an encoder-decoder network to\nextract pixel-level annotation information by learning the feature\nrepresentations of image blocks, and an attention-based learning mechanism for\nthe final classification task. This mechanism learns the importance of\ndifferent image blocks in a pathological region, globally considering the\ninformation from each block. In the third stage, all information from the image\nblocks in a region is aggregated using attention mechanisms, followed by\nclassification to determine the category of the region. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method can predict microscopic structures more\naccurately. After color-coding, the method achieves results on unstained\npathology slides that approximate the quality of Hematoxylin and eosin\nstaining, reducing the need for stained pathology slides.

Here we assume a\nfluctuating pressure field at a nucleation site due to adjacent bubble\nactivity, which acts in combination with convective effects to alter bubble\ngrowth depending on the phase of the pressure oscillation with respect to the\ninstant of bubble nucleation. The results suggest that even when a single\ndeparture frequency is assumed for nearby bubbles, its effect on the nucleation\nsite being considered is to cause aperiodicity and intermittency in bubble\ndeparture quantities. The effects of pressure field phase angle, degree of\nsuperheat, and choice of force balance model on the bubble departure quantities\nare examined. The phase angle of the pressure fluctuation at the instant of\nbubble nucleation is shown to play a major role in determining bubble departure\ndiameter and growth time.

A hybrid\nneural network model was proposed, which accurately predicted daily nitrate\nconcentration and its trends using six water quality parameters. We conducted a\n105-day aquaculture experiment, during which we collected 450 samples from five\nsets of RAS to train our model (C-L-A model) which incorporates Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and self-Attention.\nFurthermore, we obtained 90 samples from a standalone RAS as the testing data\nto evaluate the performance of the model in practical applications. The\nexperimental results proved that the C-L-A model accurately predicted nitrate\nconcentration in RAS and maintained good performance even with a reduced\nproportion of training data. We recommend using water quality parameters from\nthe past 7 days to forecast future nitrate concentration, as this timeframe\nallows the model to achieve maximum generalization capability. Additionally, we\ncompared the performance of the C-L-A model with three basic neural network\nmodels (CNN, LSTM, self-Attention) as well as three hybrid neural network\nmodels (CNN-LSTM, CNN-Attention, LSTM-Attention). The results demonstrated that\nthe C-L-A model (R2=0.956) significantly outperformed the other neural network\nmodels (R2=0.901-0.927).

Recent U-Net-based methods have demonstrated superior performance\nin predicting real-world datasets. However, the performance of these models is\nlower than patch-based models or linear models. In this work, we propose a\nsymmetric and hierarchical framework, Kernel-U-Net, which cuts the input\nsequence into slices at each layer of the network and then computes them using\nkernels. Furthermore, it generalizes the concept of convolutional kernels in\nclassic U-Net to accept custom kernels that follow the same design pattern.\nCompared to the existing linear or transformer-based solution, our model\ncontains 3 advantages: 1) A small number of parameters: the parameters size is\n$O(log(L)^2)$ where $L$ is the look-back window size, 2) Flexibility: its\nkernels can be customized and fitted to the datasets, 3) Computation\nefficiency: the computation complexity of transformer modules is reduced to\n$O(log(L)^2)$ if they are placed close to the latent vector. Kernel-U-Net\naccuracy was greater than or equal to the state-of-the-art model on six (out of\nseven) real-world datasets.",

                "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used in always-on safety-critical\napplications deployed on hardware accelerators (NN-HAs) employing various\nmemory technologies. Reliable continuous operation of NN is essential for\nsafety-critical applications. During online operation, NNs are susceptible to\nsingle and multiple permanent and soft errors due to factors such as radiation,\naging, and thermal effects. Explicit NN-HA testing methods cannot detect\ntransient faults during inference, are unsuitable for always-on applications,\nand require extensive test vector generation and storage. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose the \\emph{uncertainty fingerprint} approach representing the\nonline fault status of NN. Furthermore, we propose a dual head NN topology\nspecifically designed to produce uncertainty fingerprints and the primary\nprediction of the NN in \\emph{a single shot}. During the online operation, by\nmatching the uncertainty fingerprint, we can concurrently self-test NNs with up\nto $100\\%$ coverage with a low false positive rate while maintaining a similar\nperformance of the primary task.

                "abstract": "Visual obstacle discovery is a key step towards autonomous navigation of\nindoor mobile robots. Successful solutions have many applications in multiple\nscenes. One of the exceptions is the reflective ground. In this case, the\nreflections on the floor resemble the true world, which confuses the obstacle\ndiscovery and leaves navigation unsuccessful. We argue that the key to this\nproblem lies in obtaining discriminative features for reflections and\nobstacles. Note that obstacle and reflection can be separated by the ground\nplane in 3D space. With this observation, we firstly introduce a\npre-calibration based ground detection scheme that uses robot motion to predict\nthe ground plane. Due to the immunity of robot motion to reflection, this\nscheme avoids failed ground detection caused by reflection. Given the detected\nground, we design a ground-pixel parallax to describe the location of a pixel\nrelative to the ground. Based on this, a unified appearance-geometry feature\nrepresentation is proposed to describe objects inside rectangular boxes.\nEventually, based on segmenting by detection framework, an appearance-geometry\nfusion regressor is designed to utilize the proposed feature to discover the\nobstacles. It also prevents our model from concentrating too much on parts of\nobstacles instead of whole obstacles. For evaluation, we introduce a new\ndataset for Obstacle on Reflective Ground (ORG), which comprises 15 scenes with\nvarious ground reflections, a total of more than 200 image sequences and 3400\nRGB images. The pixel-wise annotations of ground and obstacle provide a\ncomparison to our method and other methods. By reducing the misdetection of the\nreflection, the proposed approach outperforms others.

Different mechanisms and\nprogenitors have been proposed to explain their properties; nevertheless, after\nanalyzing their timing, spectral parameters, host-galaxy properties, luminosity\nfunction, and volumetric rates, their nature remains uncertain. We interpret a\nsub-sample of nine FXTs that show a plateau or a fast-rise light curve within\nthe framework of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger magnetar model. We fit\ntheir light curves and derive magnetar (magnetic field and initial rotational\nperiod) and ejecta (ejecta mass and opacity) parameters. This model predicts\ntwo zones: an orientation-dependent free zone (where the magnetar spin-down\nX-ray photons escape freely to the observer) and a trapped zone (where the\nX-ray photons are initially obscured and only escape freely once the ejecta\nmaterial becomes optically thin). We argue that six FXTs show properties\nconsistent with the free zone and three FXTs with the trapped zone. This\nsub-sample of FXTs has a similar distribution of magnetic fields and initial\nrotation periods to those inferred for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs),\nsuggesting a possible association. We compare the predicted ejecta emission fed\nby the magnetar emission (called merger-nova) to the optical and near-infrared\nupper limits of two FXTs, XRT 141001 and XRT 210423 where contemporaneous\noptical observations are available. The non-detections place lower limits on\nthe redshifts of XRT 141001 and XRT 210423 of z>1.5 and >0.1, respectively.

Our reference formalism is the NLL/NLO$^+$\nhybrid collinear and high-energy factorization, where the standard collinear\ndescription is improved by the inclusions of energy logarithms resummed up to\nthe next-to-leading approximation and beyond. We provide a corroborating\nevidence that $b$-flavor emissions act as fair stabilizers of the high-energy\nresummation, thus serving as valuable tools for precision studies of\nhigh-energy QCD. As a bonus, we highlight that the predicted production-rate\nhierarchy between noncharmed $b$-hadrons and charmed $B_c(^1S_0)$ mesons is in\nline with recent LHCb estimates.

We demonstrate that, unlike the\nSchwarzschild criterion in hydrodynamics (``entropy must increase upwards for\nconvective stability''), the so-called modified Schwarzschild criterion for 2D\nMHD (or for any kind of fluid dynamics with more than one source of pressure)\nguarantees only linear stability. As a result, in 2D MHD (unlike in\nhydrodynamics) there exist metastable equilibria that are unstable to nonlinear\nperturbations despite being stable to linear ones. We show that the\nminimum-energy configurations attainable by these atmospheres via non-diffusive\nreorganization can be determined by solving a combinatorial optimization\nproblem. We find inter alia that these minimum-energy states are usually 2D,\neven when the original metastable equilibrium was 1D. We demonstrate with\ndirect numerical simulations that these 2D states are fairly accurate\npredictors of the final state reached by laminar relaxation of metastable\nequilibria at small Reynolds number. To describe relaxation at large Reynolds\nnumber, we construct a statistical mechanical theory based on the maximization\nof Boltzmann's mixing entropy that is analogous to the Lynden-Bell statistical\nmechanics of self-gravitating systems and collisionless plasmas, and to the\nRobert-Sommeria-Miller (RSM) theory of 2D vortex turbulence.

We investigate in\ndetail the production of $W$-boson pair at $e^+e^-$ colliders and calculate the\nmixed QCD-EW corrections at the next-to-next-to-leading order. By employing the\nmethod of differential equations, we analytically compute the two-loop master\nintegrals for the mixed QCD-EW corrections to $e^+e^- \\rightarrow W^+W^-$. By\nutilizing the Magnus transformation, we derive a canonical set of master\nintegrals for each integral family. This canonical basis fulfills a system of\ndifferential equations where the dependence on the dimensional regulator,\n$\\epsilon$, is linearly factorized from the kinematics. Finally, these\ncanonical master integrals are given as Taylor series in $\\epsilon$ up to\n$\\epsilon^4$, with coefficients written as combinations of Goncharov\npolylogarithms up to weight four. Upon applying our analytic expressions of\nthese master integrals to the phenomenological analysis on $W$-pair production,\nwe find that the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha\\alpha_s)$ corrections hold substantial\nsignificance in the $\\alpha(0)$ scheme, especially in the vicinity of the\ntop-pair resonance ($\\sqrt{s} = 2\\, m_t$) induced by top-loop integrals.\nHowever, these corrections can be heavily suppressed by adopting the $G_{\\mu}$\nscheme.",

We use parameters of the system, which may be appropriate for\nthe so-called 'precessing massive' model of OJ 287. We calculate expressions\nfor torque exerted on the disc by the secondary and a contribution of the\nsecondary to the apsidal precession of disc elements by a double averaging\nprocedure over the periods of the secondary and the disc elements. These\nexpressions are used at all scales of interest, including the ones inside the\nbinary orbit. We calculate numerically the evolution of the disc tilt and twist\nassuming a flat initial configuration. We consider the disc aspect ratio\n$h/r=10^{-3}$, a rather large viscosity parameter $\\alpha=0.1$ and several\nvalues of the primary rotational parameter, $\\chi$. We find that, after a few\nperiods of Lense-Thirring precession of the orbit, the disc relaxes to a\nquasi-stationary configuration in the precessing frame with a non-trivial\ndistribution of the disc inclination angle, $\\beta$, over the radial scale. We\npropose an analytic model for this configuration. We show that the presence of\nthe twisted disc leads to multiple crossings of the disc by the secondary per\none orbital period, with time periods between the crossings being different\nfrom the flat disc model.

In region IIa, single\nand multi-band instabilities are noted with a gapped mode, while multi-band\ninstability accompanied by a gapless mode between low-lying and first excited\nstates is realized in region IIb, which also provides evidence of unstable\navoided crossing between low-lying and first excited modes The gap between\nlow-lying and first-excited states increases upon increasing the Rabi coupling\nwhile decreases upon increase of SO coupling. Using eigenvector analysis, we\nconfirm the presence of the spin-dipole mode in the spin-like modes in Region\nII. We corroborate the nature of the collective excitation through real-time\ndynamical evolution of the ground state perturbed with the quench of the trap\nusing the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii model. This analysis suggests the\npresence of dynamical instability leading to the disappearance of the $0$-th\ncomponent of the condensate. In Region III, mainly encompassing $\\Omega \\sim 0$\nand finite $k_L$, we observe phonon-like excitations in both the first excited\nand the low-lying state. The eigenvectors in this region reveal alternative in-\nand out-of-phase behaviours of the spin components. Numerical analysis reveals\nthe presence of a super stripe phase for small Rabi coupling in this region,\nwherein the eigenvector indicates the presence of more complicated\nspin-like-density mixed modes.",

To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS\nreceiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used. The detection\nframework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing\nthe predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two\nconsecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift. For this\npurpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the\naccelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) neural network. The second strategy employs a Random-Forest\nsupervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing\nbetween left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor.\nIn experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong\nturn are simulated. These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection\nattacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives\ninjected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to\ndetect legitimate GNSS signals. Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised\nthroughout the spoofing attack. To test the effectiveness of the detection\nframework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road\nstructures. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various\nsophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting\nattacks. Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy\nof the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding\nAVs against GNSS spoofing threats.",

The ``only if'' part follows from the properties of\nthe so-called layered wheels due to Sintiari and Trotignon.\n  Alecu, Chudnovsky, Spirkl and the author recently proved the conjecture in\ntwo special cases: (a) when $t=4$; and (b) when $H=cone (F)$ for some forest\n$F$; that is, $H$ is obtained from $F$ by adding a universal vertex. Our first\nresult is a common strengthening: for an integer $t\\geq 4$ and graphs $F$ and\n$H$, (even-hole, $cone(cone (F))$, $H$, $K_t$)-free graphs have bounded\ntreewidth if and only if $F$ is a forest and $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph.\n  For general $t\\geq 4$, we push the current state of the art further than (b)\nby settling the conjecture for the smallest choices of $H$ that are not coned\nforests. This follows from our second result: we prove the conjecture when $H$\nis a crystal; that is, a graph obtained from several coned double stars by\ngluing them together along the middle edges of the double stars.\n  We also propose another conjecture motivated by the following observation:\nexcept for complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs, all the constructions\nof graphs with unbounded treewidth which have been discovered so far are\n$2$-degenerate. Specifically, we conjecture that for every $t\\geq 1$, every\ngraph of sufficiently large treewidth has an induced subgraph of treewidth $t$\nwhich is either complete, complete bipartite, or $2$-degenerate. This\nconjecture is the first to predict a grid-type theorem for induced subgraphs,\nand what makes it even more relevant is somewhat serendipitous: if true, it\nwould imply our former conjecture by reducing it to (a).",

                "abstract": "Computing reduced-order models using non-intrusive methods is particularly\nattractive for systems that are simulated using black-box solvers. However,\nobtaining accurate data-driven models can be challenging, especially if the\nunderlying systems exhibit large-amplitude transient growth. Although these\nsystems may evolve near a low-dimensional subspace that can be easily\nidentified using standard techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\n(POD), computing accurate models often requires projecting the state onto this\nsubspace via a non-orthogonal projection. While appropriate oblique projection\noperators can be computed using intrusive techniques that leverage the form of\nthe underlying governing equations, purely data-driven methods currently tend\nto achieve dimensionality reduction via orthogonal projections, and this can\nlead to models with poor predictive accuracy. In this paper, we address this\nissue by introducing a non-intrusive framework designed to simultaneously\nidentify oblique projection operators and reduced-order dynamics. In\nparticular, given training trajectories and assuming reduced-order dynamics of\npolynomial form, we fit a reduced-order model by solving an optimization\nproblem over the product manifold of a Grassmann manifold, a Stiefel manifold,\nand several linear spaces (as many as the tensors that define the low-order\ndynamics). Furthermore, we show that the gradient of the cost function with\nrespect to the optimization parameters can be conveniently written in\nclosed-form, so that there is no need for automatic differentiation. We compare\nour formulation with state-of-the-art methods on three examples: a\nthree-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, the complex\nGinzburg-Landau (CGL) equation, and a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at\nReynolds number Re = 8300.",

These\nengines support a large number of analytic jobs processing huge volumes of data\non a daily basis, and workloads are often inundated with overlapping\ncomputations across multiple jobs. Reusing common computation is crucial for\nefficient cluster resource utilization and reducing job execution time.\nDetecting common computation is the first and key step for reducing this\ncomputational redundancy. However, detecting equivalence on large-scale\nanalytics engines requires efficient and scalable solutions that are fully\nautomated. In addition, to maximize computation reuse, equivalence needs to be\ndetected at the semantic level instead of just the syntactic level (i.e., the\nability to detect semantic equivalence of seemingly different-looking queries).\nUnfortunately, existing solutions fall short of satisfying these requirements.\n  In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing\nGEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for\nefficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale. GEqO\nintroduces two machine-learning-based filters that quickly prune out\nnonequivalent subexpressions and employs a semi-supervised learning feedback\nloop to iteratively improve its model with an intelligent sampling mechanism.\nFurther, with its novel database-agnostic featurization method, GEqO can\ntransfer the learning from one workload and database to another.

Here, we demonstrate theoretically\nthe generation of ultra-wideband (UWB) magnonic frequency combs induced by\ndissipative coupling in an open cavity magnomechanical system. A broadband comb\nwith gigahertz repetition rates is obtained in the magnonic spectrum and a\ntypical non-perturbation frequency-comb structure is also observed. The total\nwidth of the magnonic comb in the robust plateau region can be up to 400 comb\nlines, which is much broader and flatter than the reported in the previous\nworks. Furthermore, when the dissipative coupling strength is further\nincreased, the chaotic motion is predicted in the magnonic spectrum. Our\nresults provide an in-depth understanding of nonlinear magnomechanic dynamics\nin open quantum systems and fundamentally broadens the research range of magnon\nin new spectral regimes.",

                "abstract": "Concept-based learning improves a deep learning model's interpretability by\nexplaining its predictions via human-understandable concepts. Deep learning\nmodels trained under this paradigm heavily rely on the assumption that neural\nnetworks can learn to predict the presence or absence of a given concept\nindependently of other concepts. Recent work, however, strongly suggests that\nthis assumption may fail to hold in Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), a\nquintessential family of concept-based interpretable architectures. In this\npaper, we investigate whether CBMs correctly capture the degree of conditional\nindependence across concepts when such concepts are localised both spatially,\nby having their values entirely defined by a fixed subset of features, and\nsemantically, by having their values correlated with only a fixed subset of\npredefined concepts. To understand locality, we analyse how changes to features\noutside of a concept's spatial or semantic locality impact concept predictions.\nOur results suggest that even in well-defined scenarios where the presence of a\nconcept is localised to a fixed feature subspace, or whose semantics are\ncorrelated to a small subset of other concepts, CBMs fail to learn this\nlocality. These results cast doubt upon the quality of concept representations\nlearnt by CBMs and strongly suggest that concept-based explanations may be\nfragile to changes outside their localities.",

A 76, 052107] generalises these notions for higher-dimensional\nquantum systems, which were initially defined for qubits, and subsequently\nproves a complementarity relation between predictability and visibility. By\ndefining the single-party information content of a quantum system as the\naddition of predictability and visibility, and assuming that entanglement in a\nbipartite system in the form of concurrence mutually excludes the single-party\ninformation, the authors have proposed a complementarity relation between the\nconcurrence and the single-party information content. We show that the\ninformation content of a quantum system defined by Jakob and Bergou is nothing\nbut the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the state of the quantum system of our\nconsideration and the maximally mixed state. Motivated by the fact that the\ntrace distance is a good measure of distance as compared to the Hilbert-Schmidt\ndistance from the information theoretic point of view, we, in this work, define\nthe information content of a quantum system as the trace distance between the\nquantum state and the maximally mixed state. We then employ the quantum\nPinsker's inequality and the reverse Pinsker's inequality to derive a new\ncomplementarity and a reverse complementarity relation between the single-party\ninformation content and the entanglement present in a bipartite quantum system\nin a pure state. As a consequence of our findings, we show that for a bipartite\nsystem in a pure state, its entanglement and the predictabilities and\nvisibilities associated with the subsystems cannot be arbitrarily small as well\nas arbitrarily large.",

Unlike criminals\nassociated with common crimes such as robbery, theft or street crime, insurgent\ngangs are trained in sophisticated arms and strategise against the government\nto weaken its resolve. They are constantly on the move, operating over large\nareas causing damage to national properties and terrorizing ordinary citizens.\nDifferent from the more commonly addressed problem of modeling crime-events,\nour context requires that an approach be formulated to model the movement of\ninsurgent gangs, which is more valuable to the police forces in preempting\ntheir activities and nabbing them. This paper evolved as a collaborative work\nwith the Indian police to help augment their tactics with a systematic method,\nby integrating past data on observed gang-locations with the expert knowledge\nof the police officers. A methodological challenge in modeling the movement of\ninsurgent gangs is that the data on their locations is incomplete, since they\nare observable only at some irregularly separated time-points. Based on a\nweighted kernel density formulation for temporal data, we analytically derive\nthe closed form of the likelihood, conditional on incomplete past observed\ndata. Building on the current tactics used by the police, we device an approach\nfor constructing an expert-prior on gang-locations, along with a sequential\nBayesian procedure for estimation and prediction. We also propose a new metric\nfor predictive assessment that complements another known metric used in similar\nproblems.",

                "abstract": "The NASA New Horizons Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (SDC) measures dust\nparticle impacts along the spacecraft's flight path for grains with mass $\\ge$\n$10^{-12}$ g, mapping out their spatial density distribution. We present the\nlatest SDC dust density, size distribution, and flux measurements through 55 au\nand compare them to numerical model predictions. Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are\nthought to be the dominant source of interplanetary dust particles (IDP) in the\nouter solar system due to both collisions between KBOs, and their continual\nbombardment by interstellar dust particles (ISD).\n  Continued measurements through 55 au show higher than model-predicted dust\nfluxes as New Horizons approaches the putative outer edge of the Kuiper Belt\n(KB). We discuss potential explanations for the growing deviation: radiation\npressure stretches the dust distribution to further heliocentric distances than\nits parent body distribution; icy dust grains undergo photo-sputtering that\nrapidly increases their response to radiation pressure forces and pushes them\nfurther away from the sun; and the distribution of KBOs may extend much further\nthan existing observations suggest. Ongoing SDC measurements at even larger\nheliocentric distances will continue to constrain the contributions of dust\nproduction in the KB. Continued SDC measurements remain crucial for\nunderstanding the Kuiper Belt and the interpretation of observations of dust\ndisks around other stars.",

                "abstract": "We study the emission of dust grains within the Orion Bar - a well-known,\nhighly far-UV (FUV)-irradiated PDR. The Orion Bar because of its edge-on\ngeometry provides an exceptional benchmark for characterizing dust evolution\nand the associated driving processes under varying physical conditions. Our\ngoal is to constrain the local properties of dust by comparing its emission to\nmodels. Taking advantage of the recent JWST PDRs4All data, we follow the dust\nemission as traced by JWST NIRCam (at 3.35 and 4.8 micron) and MIRI (at 7.7,\n11.3, 15.0, and 25.5 micron), along with NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic\nobservations. First, we constrain the minimum size and hydrogen content of\ncarbon nano-grains from a comparison between the observed dust emission spectra\nand the predictions of the THEMIS dust model coupled to the numerical code\nDustEM. Using this dust model, we then perform 3D radiative transfer\nsimulations of dust emission with the SOC code and compare to data obtained\nalong well chosen profiles across the Orion Bar. The JWST data allows us, for\nthe first time, to spatially resolve the steep variation of dust emission at\nthe illuminated edge of the Orion Bar PDR. By considering a dust model with\ncarbonaceous nano-grains and submicronic coated silicate grains, we derive\nunprecedented constraints on the properties of across the Orion Bar. To explain\nthe observed emission profiles with our simulations, we find that the\nnano-grains must be strongly depleted with an abundance (relative to the gas)\n15 times less than in the diffuse ISM. The NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic\nobservations reveal variations in the hydrogenation of the carbon nano-grains.\nThe lowest hydrogenation levels are found in the vicinity of the illuminating\nstars suggesting photo-processing while more hydrogenated nano-grains are found\nin the cold and dense molecular region, potentially indicative of larger\ngrains.",

Experimental result shows that LLMs are prone to exhibit position\nbias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or\nspecific positional cues within the input. Existing works on mitigating\nposition bias require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples,\nwhich is unpractical in reality. In this work, we propose a zero-shot position\ndebiasing (ZOE) framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs. ZOE leverages\nunsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing, thus without any\nexternal knowledge or datasets. To improve the quality of unsupervised\nresponses, we propose a master-slave alignment (MSA) module to prune these\nresponses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks show that ZOE\nconsistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating four types of position\nbiases. Besides, ZOE achieves this by sacrificing only a small performance on\nbiased samples, which is simple and effective.",

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Crowd counting has gained significant popularity due to its practical\napplications. However, mainstream counting methods ignore precise individual\nlocalization and suffer from annotation noise because of counting from\nestimating density maps. Additionally, they also struggle with high-density\nimages.To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end model called\nFine-Grained Extraction Network (FGENet). Different from methods estimating\ndensity maps, FGENet directly learns the original coordinate points that\nrepresent the precise localization of individuals.This study designs a fusion\nmodule, named Fine-Grained Feature Pyramid(FGFP), that is used to fuse feature\nmaps extracted by the backbone of FGENet. The fused features are then passed to\nboth regression and classification heads, where the former provides predicted\npoint coordinates for a given image, and the latter determines the confidence\nlevel for each predicted point being an individual. At the end, FGENet\nestablishes correspondences between prediction points and ground truth points\nby employing the Hungarian algorithm. For training FGENet, we design a robust\nloss function, named Three-Task Combination (TTC), to mitigate the impact of\nannotation noise. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used crowd\ncounting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nFGENet. Notably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of 3.14 points in\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) on the ShanghaiTech Part A dataset, showcasing its\nsuperiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Even more impressively,\nFGENet surpasses previous benchmarks on the UCF\\_CC\\_50 dataset with an\nastounding enhancement of 30.16 points in MAE.",

In this paper, a novel query-based\nknowledge sharing paradigm is proposed to explore the multi-modal knowledge\nfrom the pretrained VLP model for open-vocabulary multi-label classification.\nSpecifically, a set of learnable label-agnostic query tokens is trained to\nextract critical vision knowledge from the input image, and further shared\nacross all labels, allowing them to select tokens of interest as visual clues\nfor recognition. Besides, we propose an effective prompt pool for robust label\nembedding, and reformulate the standard ranking learning into a form of\nclassification to allow the magnitude of feature vectors for matching, which\nboth significantly benefit label recognition.

                "abstract": "Simulating high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in complex\nscenes has consistently presented a significant research challenge. The\ndevelopment of a microwave-domain surface scattering model and its\nreversibility are poised to play a pivotal role in enhancing the authenticity\nof SAR image simulations and facilitating the reconstruction of target\nparameters. Drawing inspiration from the field of computer graphics, this paper\nproposes a surface microwave rendering model that comprehensively considers\nboth Specular and Diffuse contributions. The model is analytically represented\nby the coherent spatially varying bidirectional scattering distribution\nfunction (CSVBSDF) based on the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and the\nperturbation method (SPM). And SAR imaging is achieved through the synergistic\ncombination of ray tracing and fast mapping projection techniques. Furthermore,\na differentiable ray tracing (DRT) engine based on SAR images was constructed\nfor CSVBSDF surface scattering parameter learning. Within this SAR image\nsimulation engine, the use of differentiable reverse ray tracing enables the\nrapid estimation of parameter gradients from SAR images. The effectiveness of\nthis approach has been validated through simulations and comparisons with real\nSAR images. By learning the surface scattering parameters, substantial\nenhancements in SAR image simulation performance under various observation\nconditions have been demonstrated.",

This\nstudy aims to reverse radar view angles in synthetic aperture radar (SAR)\nimages given a target model. Nonetheless, the scarcity of SAR data, combined\nwith the intricate background interference and imaging mechanisms, limit the\napplications of existing learning-based approaches. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an interactive deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nframework, where an electromagnetic simulator named differentiable SAR render\n(DSR) is embedded to facilitate the interaction between the agent and the\nenvironment, simulating a human-like process of angle prediction. Specifically,\nDSR generates SAR images at arbitrary view angles in real-time. And the\ndifferences in sequential and semantic aspects between the view\nangle-corresponding images are leveraged to construct the state space in DRL,\nwhich effectively suppress the complex background interference, enhance the\nsensitivity to temporal variations, and improve the capability to capture\nfine-grained information. Additionally, in order to maintain the stability and\nconvergence of our method, a series of reward mechanisms, such as memory\ndifference, smoothing and boundary penalty, are utilized to form the final\nreward function.

Whilst shocks are reasonably well understood for ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems, in many astrophysical plasmas, radiation is\nan important phenomena, which can allow energy to leave the system. As such,\nenergy becomes non-conservative which can fundamentally change the behaviour of\nshocks. The energy emitted through optically-thin radiation post-shock can\nexceed the thermal energy increase, resulting in shocks that reduce the\ntemperature of the medium, i.e., cooling shocks that have a net decrease in\ntemperature across the interface. In this paper, semi-analytical solutions for\nradiative shocks are derived to demonstrate that both cooling (temperature\ndecreasing) and heating (temperature increasing) shock solutions are possible\nin radiative MHD. Numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection with\noptically-thin radiative losses also yield both heating and cooling shocks in\nroughly equal abundances. The detected cooling shocks feature a significantly\nlower pressure jump across the shock than their heating counterparts. The\ncompression at the shock front leads to locally-enhanced radiative losses,\nresulting in significant cooling within a few grid cells in the upstream and\ndownstream directions.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "The prediction of rolling bearing lifespan is of significant importance in\nindustrial production. However, the scarcity of high-quality, full lifecycle\ndata has been a major constraint in achieving precise predictions. To address\nthis challenge, this paper introduces the CVGAN model, a novel framework\ncapable of generating one-dimensional vibration signals in both horizontal and\nvertical directions, conditioned on historical vibration data and remaining\nuseful life. In addition, we propose an autoregressive generation method that\ncan iteratively utilize previously generated vibration information to guide the\ngeneration of current signals. The effectiveness of the CVGAN model is\nvalidated through experiments conducted on the PHM 2012 dataset. Our findings\ndemonstrate that the CVGAN model, in terms of both MMD and FID metrics,\noutperforms many advanced methods in both autoregressive and non-autoregressive\ngeneration modes. Notably, training using the full lifecycle data generated by\nthe CVGAN model significantly improves the performance of the predictive model.\nThis result highlights the effectiveness of the data generated by CVGans in\nenhancing the predictive power of these models.",

                "abstract": "Aircraft landing time (ALT) prediction is crucial for air traffic management,\nespecially for arrival aircraft sequencing on the runway. In this study, a\ntrajectory image-based deep learning method is proposed to predict ALTs for the\naircraft entering the research airspace that covers the Terminal Maneuvering\nArea (TMA). Specifically, the trajectories of all airborne arrival aircraft\nwithin the temporal capture window are used to generate an image with the\ntarget aircraft trajectory labeled as red and all background aircraft\ntrajectory labeled as blue. The trajectory images contain various information,\nincluding the aircraft position, speed, heading, relative distances, and\narrival traffic flows. It enables us to use state-of-the-art deep convolution\nneural networks for ALT modeling. We also use real-time runway usage obtained\nfrom the trajectory data and the external information such as aircraft types\nand weather conditions as additional inputs. Moreover, a convolution neural\nnetwork (CNN) based module is designed for automatic holding-related\nfeaturizing, which takes the trajectory images, the leading aircraft holding\nstatus, and their time and speed gap at the research airspace boundary as its\ninputs. Its output is further fed into the final end-to-end ALT prediction. The\nproposed ALT prediction approach is applied to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO\nCode: WSSS) using one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)\ndata from November 1 to November 30, 2022. Experimental results show that by\nintegrating the holding featurization, we can reduce the mean absolute error\n(MAE) from 82.23 seconds to 43.96 seconds, and achieve an average accuracy of\n96.1\\%, with 79.4\\% of the predictions errors being less than 60 seconds.",

                "abstract": "Due to the poor illumination and the difficulty in annotating, nighttime\nconditions pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicle perception\nsystems. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely applied to\nsemantic segmentation on such images to adapt models from normal conditions to\ntarget nighttime-condition domains. Self-training (ST) is a paradigm in UDA,\nwhere a momentum teacher is utilized for pseudo-label prediction, but a\nconfirmation bias issue exists. Because the one-directional knowledge transfer\nfrom a single teacher is insufficient to adapt to a large domain shift. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose to alleviate domain gap by incrementally\nconsidering style influence and illumination change. Therefore, we introduce a\none-stage Dual-Teacher Bi-directional Self-training (DTBS) framework for smooth\nknowledge transfer and feedback. Based on two teacher models, we present a\nnovel pipeline to respectively decouple style and illumination shift. In\naddition, we propose a new Re-weight exponential moving average (EMA) to merge\nthe knowledge of style and illumination factors, and provide feedback to the\nstudent model. In this way, our method can be embedded in other UDA methods to\nenhance their performance.

In the framework of large-eddy\nsimulation (LES) and flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) approach, a joint\nprobability density function (PDF) method is constructed to characterize\nsubgrid correlations. To pave the way for high dimensional tabulation modeling,\na deep residual network (ResNet) is trained, dramatically reducing the memory\nfootprint of tabulation. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) shared memory\ntechnique is applied to load the original chemical table during parallel\ncomputations. Application of LES to a partially pre-vaporized ethanol spray\nflame demonstrates good agreement with experimental results. Consideration of\nthe subgrid correlation results in a noticeable improvement in temperature\nprediction. Calculations using ResNet show a notable consistency with those\nusing chemical tables. Visualization of enthalpy highlights the significance of\nnon-adiabatic tabulation in modeling liquid fuel combustion. The unscaled\nprogress variable is selected to better describe the chemical reaction rate in\nthe blending zone of an air stream and a pilot stream with the product of a\nfully burnt lean fuel mixture. The impact of the source term due to evaporation\nin the transport equation of the progress variable is validated.

                "abstract": "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) with incremental training is crucial in\nindustrial manufacturing, as unpredictable defects make obtaining sufficient\nlabeled data infeasible. However, continual learning methods primarily rely on\nsupervised annotations, while the application in UAD is limited due to the\nabsence of supervision. Current UAD methods train separate models for different\nclasses sequentially, leading to catastrophic forgetting and a heavy\ncomputational burden. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Unsupervised\nContinual Anomaly Detection framework called UCAD, which equips the UAD with\ncontinual learning capability through contrastively-learned prompts. In the\nproposed UCAD, we design a Continual Prompting Module (CPM) by utilizing a\nconcise key-prompt-knowledge memory bank to guide task-invariant `anomaly'\nmodel predictions using task-specific `normal' knowledge. Moreover,\nStructure-based Contrastive Learning (SCL) is designed with the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) to improve prompt learning and anomaly segmentation\nresults. Specifically, by treating SAM's masks as structure, we draw features\nwithin the same mask closer and push others apart for general feature\nrepresentations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and set the benchmark on\nunsupervised continual anomaly detection and segmentation, demonstrating that\nour method is significantly better than anomaly detection methods, even with\nrehearsal training.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are promising 3D representations for scenes,\nobjects, and humans. However, most existing methods require multi-view inputs\nand per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover,\ncurrent methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting\nhands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations\nremain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable\nvisibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically,\ngiven an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a\nmesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric\nand textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the\nvisibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge\nfeatures of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas.\nAdditionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator\nwithin an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional\ndiscriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image,\nthe proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing\nfine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to\nimprove the visual quality of synthesized images. Experiments on the\nInterhand2.6M dataset demonstrate that our proposed VA-NeRF outperforms\nconventional NeRFs significantly. Project Page:\n\\url{https://github.com/XuanHuang0/VANeRF}.",

This study aims\nto develop an advanced machine learning-based model to predict the probability\nof transfusion necessity over the next 24 hours for a diverse range of\nnon-traumatic ICU patients.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 72,072 adult\nnon-traumatic ICU patients admitted to a high-volume US metropolitan academic\nhospital between 2016 and 2020. We developed a meta-learner and various machine\nlearning models to serve as predictors, training them annually with four-year\ndata and evaluating on the fifth, unseen year, iteratively over five years.\n  Results: The experimental results revealed that the meta-model surpasses the\nother models in different development scenarios. It achieved notable\nperformance metrics, including an Area Under the Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.97, an accuracy rate of 0.93, and an F1-score\nof 0.89 in the best scenario.\n  Conclusion: This study pioneers the use of machine learning models for\npredicting blood transfusion needs in a diverse cohort of critically ill\npatients.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "The proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is tasked with\nthe detection and characterization of gravitational waves from various sources\nin the universe. This endeavor is challenged by transient displacement and\nacceleration noise artifacts, commonly called glitches. Uncalibrated glitches\nimpact the interferometric measurements and decrease the signal quality of\nLISA's time-delay interferometry (TDI) data used for astrophysical data\nanalysis. The paper introduces a novel calibration pipeline that employs a\nneural network ensemble to detect, characterize, and mitigate transient\nglitches of diverse morphologies. A convolutional neural network is designed\nfor anomaly detection, accurately identifying and temporally pinpointing\nanomalies within the TDI time series. Then, a hybrid neural network is\ndeveloped to differentiate between gravitational wave bursts and glitches,\nwhile a long short-term memory (LSTM) network architecture is deployed for\nglitch estimation. The LSTM network acts as a TDI inverter by processing noisy\nTDI data to obtain the underlying glitch dynamics. Finally, the inferred noise\ntransient is subtracted from the interferometric measurements, enhancing data\nintegrity and reducing biases in the parameter estimation of astronomical\ntargets. We propose a low-latency solution featuring generalized LSTM networks\nprimed for rapid response data processing and alert service in high-demand\nscenarios like predicting binary black hole mergers. The research highlights\nthe critical role of machine learning in advancing methodologies for data\ncalibration and astrophysical analysis in LISA.",

We handle this efficiently using Bell polynomials. Under mild\nassumptions on the fluid depth, we prove that there are no exact resonances,\nthough small divisors may occur. Sudden changes in growth rate in the expansion\ncoefficients are found to correspond to imperfect bifurcations observed when\nfamilies of standing waves are computed using a shooting method. A direct\nconnection between small divisors in the recursive algorithm and imperfect\nbifurcations in the solution curves is observed, where the small divisor\nexcites higher-frequency parasitic standing waves that oscillate on top of the\nmain wave. A 109th order Pad\\'e approximation maintains 25--30 digits of\naccuracy on both sides of the first imperfect bifurcation encountered for the\nunit-depth problem.

To mitigate the coverage limitations,\nhigh-gain beamforming is essential. Implementation of beamforming involves a\nlarge number of antennas, which introduces analog beam constraint, i.e., only\none frequency-flat beam is generated per transceiver chain (TRx). Recently\nintroduced joint phase-time array (JPTA) architecture, which utilizes both true\ntime delay (TTD) units and phase shifters (PSs), alleviates analog beam\nconstraint by creating multiple frequency-dependent beams per TRx, for\nscheduling multiple users at different directions in a frequency-division\nmanner. One class of previous studies offered solutions with \"rainbow\" beams,\nwhich tend to allocate a small bandwidth per beam direction. Another class\nfocused on uniform linear array (ULA) antenna architecture, whose\nfrequency-dependent beams were designed along a single axis of either azimuth\nor elevation direction. In this paper, we present a novel 3D beamforming\ncodebook design aimed at maximizing beamforming gain to steer radiation toward\ndesired azimuth and elevation directions, as well as across sub-bands\npartitioned according to scheduled users' bandwidth requirements. We provide\nboth analytical solutions and iterative algorithms to design the PSs and TTD\nunits for a desired subband beam pattern.

It is anticipated that atypical occurrences and climate\nchange will pose severe risks to agricultural output. It follows that a 70% or\nmore significant rise in food output is anticipated. Smart farming, often known\nas agriculture 4.0, is a tech-driven revolution in agriculture with the goal of\nraising industry production and efficiency. Four primary trends are responsible\nfor it: food waste, climate change, population shifts, and resource scarcity.\nThe agriculture industry is changing as a result of the adoption of emerging\ntechnologies. Using cutting-edge technology like IoT, AI, and other sensors,\nsmart farming transforms traditional production methods and international\nagricultural policies. The objective is to establish a value chain that is\noptimized to facilitate enhanced monitoring and decreased labor expenses. The\nagricultural sector has seen tremendous transformation as a result of the\nfourth industrial revolution, which has combined traditional farming methods\nwith cutting-edge technology to increase productivity, sustainability, and\nefficiency. To effectively utilize the potential of technology gadgets in the\nagriculture sector, collaboration between governments, private sector entities,\nand other stakeholders is necessary.

They are expected to be observed as\n(1-7) solar mass hot He-rich stars located in the HRD between sdO/B and\nWR-stars. Several thousands of such stars are expected to exist in the Galaxy,\nbut none of them have been identified so far. We aim to provide comprehensive\npredictions of the numbers and fundamental properties of He-stars and their\ncompanions in the Galaxy. This is a necessary first step to guide observations,\nto enable a comparison between evolutionary models and observed populations,\nand to determine the feedback of He-stars in the Galaxy. We expanded the\npreviously considered space of parameters describing progenitors of He-stars\nand applied a population synthesis based on a grid of models computed by the\ncode MESA. The estimated number of Galactic binaries hosting (1-7) solar mass\nHe-stars is about 20000; it declines to about 3000 for mass exceeding two solar\nones. The decisive factor that defines the number of He-stars is runaway mass\nloss after Roche lobe overflow by primary components, resulting in formation of\ncommon envelopes and merger of components. He-stars are much less numerous than\nexpected, since a fraction of close binaries with primary masses below (5-7)\nsolar ones produce subdwarfs with masses below solar. Overwhelming majority of\nHe-stars reside in binaries with an early-type companions and can be identified\nneither by the UV excess nor by emission features. The large periods of a\nsignificant fraction of binaries hosting stripped stars (exceeding several\nhundred days) also hamper their discovery. (Abridged).",

We employ the linear-sigma model as the\nlow-energy description of dark many flavor QCD and show that the model\nundergoes ultra-supercooling due to the produced strong first-order thermal\nphase transition along the (approximately realized) flat direction based on the\nGildener-Weinberg mechanism. Passing through evaluation of the bubble\nnucleation/percolation, we address the reheating and relaxation processes,\nwhich are generically non-thermal and nonadiabatic. Parametrizing the reheating\nepoch in terms of the efolding number, we propose proper formulae for the\nredshift effects on the GW frequencies and signal spectra. It then turns out\nthat the ultra-supercooling predicted from the Higgs-portal scalegenesis\ngenerically yields none of GW signals with the frequencies as low as nano Hz,\ninstead, prefers to give the higher frequency signals, which still keeps the\nfuture prospected detection sensitivity, like at LISA, BBO, and DECIGO, etc. We\nalso find that with large flavors in the dark sector, the GW signals are made\nfurther smaller and the peak frequencies higher.

                "abstract": "Vector-like quarks have been predicted in various new physics scenarios\nbeyond the Standard Model (SM). In a simplified modelling of a $(B,Y)$ doublet\nincluding a vector-like quark $Y$, with charge $-\\frac{4}{3}$e, there are only\ntwo free parameters: the $Y$ coupling $\\kappa_{Y}$ and mass $m_Y$. In the five\nflavor scheme, we investigate the single production of the $Y$ state decaying\ninto $Wb$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run-III and High-Luminosity LHC\n(HL-LHC) operating at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, the possible High-Energy LHC\n(HE-LHC) with $\\sqrt{s}$ = 27 TeV as well as the Future Circular Collider in\nhadron-hadron mode (FCC-hh) with $\\sqrt{s}$ = 100 TeV. Through detailed\nsignal-to-background analyses and detector simulations, we assess the exclusion\ncapabilities of the $Y$ state at the different colliders. We find that this can\nbe improved significantly with increasing collision energy, especially at the\nHE-LHC and FCC-hh, both demonstrating an obvious advantage with respect to the\nHL-LHC case in the case of high $m_Y$. Assuming a 10% systematic uncertainty on\nthe background event rate, the exclusion capabilities are summarized as\nfollows: (1) the LHC Run-III can exclude the correlated regions of $\\kappa_{Y}\n\\in [0.044,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \\in [1000\\text{ GeV},3099\\text{ GeV}]$ with\nintegrated luminosity $L = 300\\text{ fb}^{-1}$; (2) the HL-LHC can exclude the\ncorrelated regions of $\\kappa_{Y} \\in [0.027,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \\in [1000\\text{\nGeV},3653\\text{ GeV}]$ with $L = 3$ ab$^{-1}$; (3) the HE-LHC can exclude the\ncorrelated regions of $\\kappa_Y \\in [0.030,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \\in [1000\\text{\nGeV} , 4936\\text{ GeV}]$ with $L = 3$ ab$^{-1}$; (4) the FCC-hh can exclude the\ncorrelated regions of $\\kappa_{Y} \\in [0.051,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \\in [1000\\text{\nGeV} , 6610\\text{ GeV}]$ with $L = 3$ ab$^{-1}$.",

Although various existing works have\nachieved remarkable progress, the model performance can be further improved by\nfully extracting the trends, variations, and the correlation between the trends\nand variations in dynamic features. In addition, sparse visit records limit the\nperformance of deep learning models. To address these issues, we propose the\nMulti-perspective Patient Representation Extractor (MPRE) for disease\nprediction. Specifically, we propose Frequency Transformation Module (FTM) to\nextract the trend and variation information of dynamic features in the\ntime-frequency domain, which can enhance the feature representation. In the 2D\nMulti-Extraction Network (2D MEN), we form the 2D temporal tensor based on\ntrend and variation. Then, the correlations between trend and variation are\ncaptured by the proposed dilated operation. Moreover, we propose the\nFirst-Order Difference Attention Mechanism (FODAM) to calculate the\ncontributions of differences in adjacent variations to the disease diagnosis\nadaptively. To evaluate the performance of MPRE and baseline methods, we\nconduct extensive experiments on two real-world public datasets.

                "year": 2024,
                "abstract": "Self-supervised pre-training paradigms have been extensively explored in the\nfield of skeleton-based action recognition. In particular, methods based on\nmasked prediction have pushed the performance of pre-training to a new height.\nHowever, these methods take low-level features, such as raw joint coordinates\nor temporal motion, as prediction targets for the masked regions, which is\nsuboptimal. In this paper, we show that using high-level contextualized\nfeatures as prediction targets can achieve superior performance. Specifically,\nwe propose Skeleton2vec, a simple and efficient self-supervised 3D action\nrepresentation learning framework, which utilizes a transformer-based teacher\nencoder taking unmasked training samples as input to create latent\ncontextualized representations as prediction targets. Benefiting from the\nself-attention mechanism, the latent representations generated by the teacher\nencoder can incorporate the global context of the entire training samples,\nleading to a richer training task. Additionally, considering the high temporal\ncorrelations in skeleton sequences, we propose a motion-aware tube masking\nstrategy which divides the skeleton sequence into several tubes and performs\npersistent masking within each tube based on motion priors, thus forcing the\nmodel to build long-range spatio-temporal connections and focus on\naction-semantic richer regions. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and\nPKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our proposed Skeleton2vec outperforms\nprevious methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.",

However, the\nintricacies of the real world, particularly with the presence of light effects\nand low-light regions affected by noise, create significant domain gaps,\nhampering synthetic-trained models in removing rain streaks properly and\nleading to over-saturation and color shifts. Motivated by this, we introduce\nNightRain, a novel nighttime video deraining method with adaptive-rain-removal\nand adaptive-correction. Our adaptive-rain-removal uses unlabeled rain videos\nto enable our model to derain real-world rain videos, particularly in regions\naffected by complex light effects. The idea is to allow our model to obtain\nrain-free regions based on the confidence scores. Once rain-free regions and\nthe corresponding regions from our input are obtained, we can have region-based\npaired real data. These paired data are used to train our model using a\nteacher-student framework, allowing the model to iteratively learn from less\nchallenging regions to more challenging regions. Our adaptive-correction aims\nto rectify errors in our model's predictions, such as over-saturation and color\nshifts. The idea is to learn from clear night input training videos based on\nthe differences or distance between those input videos and their corresponding\npredictions. Our model learns from these differences, compelling our model to\ncorrect the errors. From extensive experiments, our method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance.

Third, they do not efficiently utilize incomplete time\nseries data. To address these limitations, we introduce FedGmTE-Net++, a\nfederated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Using the power of\nfederation, we aggregate local learnings among diverse hospitals with limited\ndatasets. As a result, we enhance the performance of each hospital's local\ngenerative model, while preserving data privacy. The three key innovations of\nFedGmTE-Net++ are: (i) presenting the first federated learning framework\nspecifically designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction in a\ndata-scarce environment, (ii) incorporating an auxiliary regularizer in the\nlocal objective function to exploit all the longitudinal brain connectivity\nwithin the evolution trajectory and maximize data utilization, (iii)\nintroducing a two-step imputation process, comprising a preliminary KNN-based\nprecompletion followed by an imputation refinement step that employs regressors\nto improve similarity scores and refine imputations. Our comprehensive\nexperimental results showed the outperformance of FedGmTE-Net++ in brain\nmulti-trajectory prediction from a single baseline graph in comparison with\nbenchmark methods.",

This paper aims to review the applications of GNNs in six\nrepresentative and emerging ITS domains: traffic forecasting, autonomous\nvehicles, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction, and\nparking management. We have reviewed extensive graph-related studies from 2018\nto 2023, summarized their methods, features, and contributions, and presented\nthem in informative tables or lists.

However, existing NSS-based methods are solely suitable for\nmeshgrid data such as images and videos, but are not suitable for emerging\noff-meshgrid data, e.g., point cloud and climate data. In this work, we revisit\nthe NSS from the continuous representation perspective and propose a novel\nContinuous Representation-based NonLocal method (termed as CRNL), which has two\ninnovative features as compared with classical nonlocal methods. First, based\non the continuous representation, our CRNL unifies the measure of\nself-similarity for on-meshgrid and off-meshgrid data and thus is naturally\nsuitable for both of them. Second, the nonlocal continuous groups can be more\ncompactly and efficiently represented by the coupled low-rank function\nfactorization, which simultaneously exploits the similarity within each group\nand across different groups, while classical nonlocal methods neglect the\nsimilarity across groups. This elaborately designed coupled mechanism allows\nour method to enjoy favorable performance over conventional NSS methods in\nterms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive multi-dimensional data\nprocessing experiments on-meshgrid (e.g., image inpainting and image denoising)\nand off-meshgrid (e.g., climate data prediction and point cloud recovery)\nvalidate the versatility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our CRNL as compared\nwith state-of-the-art methods.",

The first method involves comparing the dynamical MOND mass and\nbaryonic mass, while the second method entails a comparison of the\nMOND-estimated temperature with the observed temperature. We then compare the\nunseen mass predicted by Emergent Gravity with the estimated dark matter mass.\nWe find that MOND is able to explain the mass discrepancy at large radii but\nnot in the central regions. The observed temperature profile is also in slight\ndisagreement with that in the MOND paradigm.

A prime example is the widely used ensemble Kalman filter\n(EnKF), which relies on linear updates to minimize variance among the ensemble\nof forecast states. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of deep\nlearning approaches in this domain, primarily within a supervised learning\nframework. However, the adaptability of such models to untrained scenarios\nremains a challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel DA strategy that\nutilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to apply state corrections using full or\npartial observations of the state variables. Our investigation focuses on\ndemonstrating this approach to the chaotic Lorenz '63 system, where the agent's\nobjective is to minimize the root-mean-squared error between the observations\nand corresponding forecast states. Consequently, the agent develops a\ncorrection strategy, enhancing model forecasts based on available system state\nobservations. Our strategy employs a stochastic action policy, enabling a Monte\nCarlo-based DA framework that relies on randomly sampling the policy to\ngenerate an ensemble of assimilated realizations. Results demonstrate that the\ndeveloped RL algorithm performs favorably when compared to the EnKF.\nAdditionally, we illustrate the agent's capability to assimilate non-Gaussian\ndata, addressing a significant limitation of the EnKF.",

However, in a bipartite graph setting one\nprocrastination aware scheduling is proposed but balanced job distribution in\ndifferent slots (also termed as schedules) is not considered there. In this\npaper, a procrastination aware scheduling of jobs is proliferated by proposing\nan (randomized) algorithm in crowdsourcing scenario (also applicable in mobile\nand spatial crowdsourcing). Our algorithm ensures that balancing of jobs in\ndifferent schedules are maintained. Our scheme is compared with the existing\nalgorithm through extensive simulation and in terms of balancing effect, our\nproposed algorithm outperforms the existing one. Analytically it is shown that\nour proposed algorithm maintains the balanced distribution.",

The gluon distribution is\nobtained from the Golec-Biernat-W$\\ddot{\\mathrm{u}}$sthoff (GBW) and Bartels,\nGolec-Biernat and Kowalski (BGK )models. The main elements are based on the\ncolor dipole picture (CDP) and the generalized double asymptotic scaling (DAS)\napproach for usual parton distribution functions (PDFs). The comparisons with\nthe HERA data are made and predictions for the proposed LHeC and FCC-he\ncolliders are also provided in a wide range of the transverse separation $r$.\nIn particular, the ratio $R^{h}=F_{L}^{h}/F_{2}^{h}, h=c,b,t$ is well described\nby the dipole models and is sensitive to the collider energies from HERA until\nFCC-he. We derive correlated bounds on the ratio $F^{c}_{2}/F_{2}$ and\n$F^{b}_{2}/F_{2}$ and compared them with the BGK and IP-sat models. The\nuncertainties are due to the renormalization and factorization scales at large\nand low $r$ values.

                "abstract": "Wind is one kind of high-efficient, environmentally-friendly and\ncost-effective energy source. Wind power, as one of the largest renewable\nenergy in the world, has been playing a more and more important role in\nsupplying electricity. Though growing dramatically in recent years, the amount\nof generated wind power can be directly or latently affected by multiple\nuncertain factors, such as wind speed, wind direction, temperatures, etc. More\nimportantly, there exist very complicated dependencies of the generated power\non the latent composition of these multiple time-evolving variables, which are\nalways ignored by existing works and thus largely hinder the prediction\nperformances. To this end, we propose DEWP, a novel Deep Expansion learning for\nWind Power forecasting framework to carefully model the complicated\ndependencies with adequate expressiveness. DEWP starts with a stack-by-stack\narchitecture, where each stack is composed of (i) a variable expansion block\nthat makes use of convolutional layers to capture dependencies among multiple\nvariables; (ii) a time expansion block that applies Fourier series and\nbackcast/forecast mechanism to learn temporal dependencies in sequential\npatterns. These two tailored blocks expand raw inputs into different latent\nfeature spaces which can model different levels of dependencies of\ntime-evolving sequential data. Moreover, we propose an inference block\ncorresponding for each stack, which applies multi-head self-attentions to\nacquire attentive features and maps expanded latent representations into\ngenerated wind power. In addition, to make DEWP more expressive in handling\ndeep neural architectures, we adapt doubly residue learning to process\nstack-by-stack outputs. Finally, we present extensive experiments in the\nreal-world wind power forecasting application on two datasets from two\ndifferent turbines to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Mainstream FL\nmethodologies overlook the dynamic nature of real-world data, particularly its\ntendency to grow in volume and diversify in classes over time. This oversight\nresults in FL methods suffering from catastrophic forgetting, where models\ninadvertently discard previously learned information upon assimilating new\ndata. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel Federated\nClass-Incremental Learning (FCIL) method, named FCIL with New-Class Augmented\nSelf-Distillation (FedNASD). FedNASD combines new class scores, which are\ninferred from current models, with historical models' predictions. Based on the\ncombined past and present knowledge, it incorporates self-distillation over\nmodels on clients, aiming to achieve effective knowledge transfer from\nhistorical models to current models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that\nFedNASD is equivalent to modeling old class scores as conditional probabilities\nin the absence of new classes. Additionally, it reconciles the predictions of\nnew classes with current models to refine the conditional probabilities of\nhistorical scores where new classes do not exist. Empirical experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of FedNASD over four baseline algorithms in\nreducing the average forgetting rate and boosting global accuracy.",

                "abstract": "Camera traps are valuable tools in animal ecology for biodiversity monitoring\nand conservation. However, challenges like poor generalization to deployment at\nnew unseen locations limit their practical application. Images are naturally\nassociated with heterogeneous forms of context possibly in different\nmodalities. In this work, we leverage the structured context associated with\nthe camera trap images to improve out-of-distribution generalization for the\ntask of species identification in camera traps. For example, a photo of a wild\nanimal may be associated with information about where and when it was taken, as\nwell as structured biology knowledge about the animal species. While typically\noverlooked by existing work, bringing back such context offers several\npotential benefits for better image understanding, such as addressing data\nscarcity and enhancing generalization. However, effectively integrating such\nheterogeneous context into the visual domain is a challenging problem. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework that reformulates species\nclassification as link prediction in a multimodal knowledge graph (KG). This\nframework seamlessly integrates various forms of multimodal context for visual\nrecognition. We apply this framework for out-of-distribution species\nclassification on the iWildCam2020-WILDS and Snapshot Mountain Zebra datasets\nand achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches.\nFurthermore, our framework successfully incorporates biological taxonomy for\nimproved generalization and enhances sample efficiency for recognizing\nunder-represented species.",

This\nbias has been extensively examined and attributed to principles derived from\nalgorithmic information theory and algorithmic probability. In a significant\nadvancement, it has been demonstrated that the renowned logistic map\n$x_{k+1}=\\mu x_k(1-x_k)$, and other one-dimensional maps exhibit simplicity\nbias when conceptualized as input-output systems. Building upon this\nfoundational work, our research delves into the manifestations of simplicity\nbias within the random logistic map, specifically focusing on scenarios\ninvolving additive noise. This investigation is driven by the overarching goal\nof formulating a comprehensive theory for the prediction and analysis of time\nseries.Our primary contributions are multifaceted. We discover that simplicity\nbias is observable in the random logistic map for specific ranges of $\\mu$ and\nnoise magnitudes. Additionally, we find that this bias persists even with the\nintroduction of small measurement noise, though it diminishes as noise levels\nincrease. Our studies also revisit the phenomenon of noise-induced chaos,\nparticularly when $\\mu=3.83$, revealing its characteristics through\ncomplexity-probability plots. Intriguingly, we employ the logistic map to\nunderscore a paradoxical aspect of data analysis: more data adhering to a\nconsistent trend can occasionally lead to reduced confidence in extrapolation\npredictions, challenging conventional wisdom.We propose that adopting a\nprobability-complexity perspective in analyzing dynamical systems could\nsignificantly enrich statistical learning theories related to series\nprediction.",

For\nthe purpose, we construct energy quantization conditions by exact WKB analysis\nand write down their transseries solution by solving the conditions.

Methods: We investigate the ability\nof change-point survival models to estimate changes in the relative treatment\neffects, specifically treatment delay, loss of treatment effects and converging\nhazards. These models are implemented using standard Bayesian statistical\nsoftware and propagate the uncertainty associate with all model parameters\nincluding the change-point location. A simulation study was conducted to assess\nthe predictive performance of these models compared with other parametric\nsurvival models. Change-point survival models were applied to three datasets,\ntwo of which were used in previous health technology assessments. Results:\nChange-point survival models typically provided improved extrapolated survival\npredictions, particularly when the changes in relative treatment effects are\nlarge. When applied to the real world examples they provided good fit to the\nobserved data while and in some situations produced more clinically plausible\nextrapolations than those generated by flexible spline models. Change-point\nmodels also provided support to a previously implemented modelling approach\nwhich was justified by visual inspection only and not goodness of fit to the\nobserved data.

These 2 species formed by\nslow n-captures in the interior of low- and intermediate-mass stars, belong to\nthe family of 2nd-peak s-process elements. We defined a working sample of\n19,544 AGB stars with high-quality Ce and/or Nd abundances, selected by\napplying a specific combination of the GSP-spec quality flags. We compared\nthese abundances with the yield production predicted by AGB stars evolutionary\nmodels. We found a good correlation between the Ce and Nd abundances,\nconfirming the high quality of the derived abundances and that these species\nindeed belong to the same s-process family. We also found higher Ce and Nd\nabundances for more evolved AGB stars of similar metallicity, illustrating the\nsuccessive mixing episodes enriching the AGB star surface. We then compared the\nobserved Ce and Nd abundances with the FRUITY and Monash AGB yields and found\nthat the higher Ce and Nd abundances cannot be explained by AGB stars of masses\nhigher than 5Msun. In contrast, the yields predicted by both models for AGB\nstars with an initial mass between ~1.5 and ~2.5Mssun and metallicities between\n~-0.5 and ~0.0dex are fully compatible with the observed GSP-spec abundances.\nThis work based on the largest catalogue of high-quality second-peak s-element\nabundances in O-rich AGB stars allows evolutionary models to be constrained and\nconfirms the fundamental role played by low- and intermediate-mass stars in the\nenrichment of the Universe in these chemical species.",

This intuitive, yet effective model achieves superior or\nclose results to the state-of-the-art methods for the graph-, edge- and\nnode-level tasks on the large scale molecular dataset PCQM4Mv2, the\nprotein-protein association dataset ogbl-ppa and the ogbn-proteins dataset from\nthe Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Furthermore, the generative pre-training\nenables us to train GraphGPT up to 400M+ parameters with consistently\nincreasing performance, which is beyond the capability of GNNs and previous\ngraph transformers. The source code and pre-trained checkpoints will be\nreleased soon\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt}} to pave the\nway for the graph foundation model research, and also to assist the scientific\ndiscovery in pharmaceutical, chemistry, material and bio-informatics domains,\netc.",

The analytical investigation is\nconcentrated on the horizon radius, employing two distinct approaches to\nsimplify the complexity and length of the calculations. Furthermore, our\nexamination extends to deciphering the intricate relationship between dark\nenergy and critical phenomena. This includes visually portraying a range of\ncritical behaviors while detailing a recent discovery regarding how the\nintensity of quintessence affects phase transitions. The shifts in these\ntransitions conform to either a concave or convex function, a characteristic\ndependent on the sign of quintessence intensity.",

The availability of the\ndata represents an opportunity to analyze and understand the market from the\ncomplexity that emerges from the interactions of the actors (users, bots and\ncompanies) operating in the embedded market. In this paper we focus on the\nEthereum network and our main goal is to show that the properties of the\nunderlying transaction network provide further and useful information to\nforecast the evolution of the market. We aim to separate the non redundant\neffects of the blockchain transaction network properties from classic technical\nindicators and social media trends in the future price of Ethereum. To this\nend, we build two machine learning models to predict the future trend of the\nmarket. The first one serves as a base model and considers a set of the most\nrelevant features according to the current scientific literature including\ntechnical indicators and social media trends. The second model considers the\nfeatures of the base model, together with the network properties computed from\nthe transaction networks. We found that the full model outperforms the base\nmodel and can anticipate 46 more rises in the price than the base model and 19\nmore falls.",

This paradigm enables deep models to\nlearn robust representations and has demonstrated exceptional performance in\nthe context of computer vision, natural language processing, and other\nmodalities. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the masked\nmodeling framework and its methodology. We elaborate on the details of\ntechniques within masked modeling, including diverse masking strategies,\nrecovering targets, network architectures, and more.

Second, in dimension $d$, let $V_n$\nbe a sequence of crystalline representations converging in a certain geometric\nsense to a crystalline representation $V$. We show that for any refined version\n$(V, \\sigma)$ of $V$ (or equivalently for any chosen triangulation of its\nattached $(\\varphi, \\Gamma)$-module $D_{\\text{rig}} (V)$ over the Robba ring),\nthere exists a sequence of refinement $\\sigma_n$ of each of the $V_n$ such that\nthe limit as refined representations $(V_n , \\sigma_n )$ converges to the $(V,\n\\sigma)$.

Highly supersonic jets launched by active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) power a cocoon that confines them and shocks the ambient\nmedium. We build upon the models of narrow conical jets interacting with a\nsmooth ambient medium, to include the effect of dense clouds that are an\nessential ingredient of a multiphase ISM. The key physical ingredient of this\nmodel is that the clouds along the supersonic jet-beam strongly decelerate the\njet-head, but the subsonic cocoon easily moves around the clouds without much\nresistance. We propose scalings for important physical quantities -- cocoon\npressure, head & cocoon speed, and jet radius. We obtain, for the first time,\nthe analytic condition on clumpiness of the ambient medium for the jet to\ndissipate within the cocoon and verify it with numerical simulations of conical\njets interacting with a uniform ISM with embedded spherical clouds. A jet is\ndefined to be dissipated when the cocoon speed exceeds the speed of the\njet-head. We compare our models to more sophisticated numerical simulations,\ndirect observations of jet-ISM interaction (e.g., quasar J1316+1753), and\ndiscuss implications for the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles.

                "abstract": "The energy consumption of mobile networks poses a critical challenge.\nMitigating this concern necessitates the deployment and optimization of network\nenergy-saving solutions, such as carrier shutdown, to dynamically manage\nnetwork resources. Traditional optimization approaches encounter complexity due\nto factors like the large number of cells, stochastic traffic, channel\nvariations, and intricate trade-offs. This paper introduces the simulated\nreality of communication networks (SRCON) framework, a novel, data-driven\nmodeling paradigm that harnesses live network data and employs a blend of\nmachine learning (ML)- and expert-based models. These mix of models accurately\ncharacterizes the functioning of network components, and predicts network\nenergy efficiency and user equipment (UE) quality of service for any energy\ncarrier shutdown configuration in a specific network. Distinguishing itself\nfrom existing methods, SRCON eliminates the reliance on expensive expert\nknowledge, drive testing, or incomplete maps for predicting network\nperformance. This paper details the pipeline employed by SRCON to decompose the\nlarge network energy efficiency modeling problem into ML and expert-based\nsubmodels. It demonstrates how, by embracing stochasticity, and carefully\ncrafting the relationship between such submodels, the overall computational\ncomplexity can be reduced and prediction accuracy enhanced. Results derived\nfrom real network data underscore the paradigm shift introduced by SRCON,\nshowcasing significant gains over a state-of-the art method used by a operator\nfor network energy efficiency modeling. The reliability of this local,\ndata-driven modeling of the network proves to be a key asset for network\nenergy-saving optimization.",

However, these methods have certain limitations. Firstly,\ntheir iterative refinement design lacks transparency, and their iterative\nupdates follow a fixed path during the refinement process, which can lead to\nsuboptimal results. Secondly, these methods overlook the importance of refining\nor optimizing correspondences (or matching matrices) as a precursor to solving\ntransformations or flow fields. They typically compute candidate\ncorrespondences based on distances in the point feature space. However, they\nonly project the candidate matching matrix into some matrix space once with\nSinkhorn or dual softmax operations to obtain final correspondences. This\none-shot projected matching matrix may be far from the globally optimal one,\nand these approaches do not consider the distribution of the target matching\nmatrix. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that exploits the Denoising\nDiffusion Model to predict a searching gradient for the optimal matching matrix\nwithin the Doubly Stochastic Matrix Space. During the reverse denoising\nprocess, our method iteratively searches for better solutions along this\ndenoising gradient, which points towards the maximum likelihood direction of\nthe target matching matrix. Our method offers flexibility by allowing the\nsearch to start from any initial matching matrix provided by the online\nbackbone or white noise.

                "abstract": "Some theoretical models for the early universe predict a spike-type\nenhancement in the primordial power spectrum on a small scale, which would\nresult in forming early-formed dark matter halos (EFHs). In this work, we study\nthe CMB lensing effect, considering the existence of EFHs, and investigate the\npotential to probe the EFHs and the primordial perturbations on scales smaller\nthan $1\\mathrm{Mpc}$. We numerically calculate the angular power spectrum of\nthe lensing potential and the lensed CMB anisotropy of temperature, E-mode, and\nB-mode polarization, including the nonlinear effects of EFHs. We find the\npossibility that the lensed CMB temperature anisotropy is significantly\nenhanced on small scales, $\\ell>1000$, and could be tested by component\ndecomposition of observed signals through multi-frequency observations. Through\nthe calculation with different models of the spiky-type power spectrum, we\ndemonstrate that the accurate measurements of the CMB lensing effect would\nprovide insight into the abundance of EFHs within the limited mass range around\n$10^{12}M_\\odot$ and the primordial power spectrum on the limited scales around\n$k\\sim 1\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In particular, we find that the existence of such\nEFHs can amplify the lensed anisotropy of CMB B-mode polarization even on large\nscales, $\\ell <100$, as the overall enhancement by $\\sim 10 \\%$ level compared\nto the standard structure formation model without EFHs. Therefore, future CMB\nmeasurements such as the LiteBIRD satellite can probe the existence of the EFHs\nand the spike-type primordial power spectrum through the precise measurement of\nthe large-scale CMB B-mode polarization.",

Traditional methods\noften rely on expensive equipment or large datasets, which are impractical in\nmany scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, geometry-based approach to\naddress these challenges, utilizing consumer-grade hardware for broader\napplicability. Methods: We leverage novel face landmark detection neural\nnetworks capable of fast inference on consumer-grade chips to generate accurate\nand stable 3D landmarks of the face and iris. From these, we derive a small set\nof geometry-based descriptors, forming an 8-dimensional manifold representing\nthe eye and head movements. These descriptors are then used to formulate linear\nequations for predicting eye-gaze direction. Results: Our approach demonstrates\nthe ability to predict gaze with an angular error of less than 1.9 degrees,\nrivaling state-of-the-art systems while operating in real-time and requiring\nnegligible computational resources. Conclusion: The developed method marks a\nsignificant step forward in gaze estimation technology, offering a highly\naccurate, efficient, and accessible alternative to traditional systems.

Such information can be\nused, for example, to generate empathetic response in human-machine interaction\nor to inform models of pre-emptive toxicity detection. In this work, we\nintroduce the novel problem of Predicting Emotions in Conversations (PEC) for\nthe next turn (n+1), given combinations of textual and/or emotion input up to\nturn n. We systematically approach the problem by modeling three dimensions\ninherently connected to evoked emotions in dialogues, including (i) sequence\nmodeling, (ii) self-dependency modeling, and (iii) recency modeling. These\nmodeling dimensions are then incorporated into two deep neural network\narchitectures, a sequence model and a graph convolutional network model. The\nformer is designed to capture the sequence of utterances in a dialogue, while\nthe latter captures the sequence of utterances and the network formation of\nmulti-party dialogues. We perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the\nvarious proposed models for addressing the PEC problem. The results indicate\n(i) the importance of the self-dependency and recency model dimensions for the\nprediction task, (ii) the quality of simpler sequence models in short\ndialogues, (iii) the importance of the graph neural models in improving the\npredictions in long dialogues.",

These models\nexhibit quasi-particle-like excitations when $g=J_2/J_1$ is small,\ncharacterized by low-energy magnons, intermediate-energy doublons, and\nhigh-energy quartons. The low-energy magnons are associated with the magnetic\nground states. They can be described by the linear spin wave theory (LSWT) of\nthe effective block spin model and the original spin model. Doublons and\nquartons emerge from the corresponding internal excitations of the trimers with\ndistinct energy levels, which can be effectively analyzed using perturbation\ntheory when the ratio of exchange interactions $g$ is small. In this small $g$\nregime, we observe a clear separation between the magnon and higher-energy\nspectra. However, as $g$ increases, these three spectra gradually merge into\nthe magnon modes or continua. Nevertheless, the LSWT fails to provide\nquantitative descriptions of the higher-energy excitation bands due to\nsignificant quantum fluctuations. Notably, in the Collinear II and trimerized\nhexagon lattice, a broad continuum emerges above the single-magnon spectrum,\noriginating from the quasi-1D physics due to the dilute connections between\nchains.

                "abstract": "We compute a nonperturbative effective potential between two static fermions\nin light-front Yukawa theory as a Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem. Fermion pair\nproduction is suppressed, to make possible an exact analytic solution in the\nform of a coherent state of bosons that form clouds around the sources. The\neffective potential is essentially an interference term between individual\nclouds. The model is regulated with Pauli-Villars bosons and fermions, to\nachieve consistent quantization and renormalization of masses and couplings.\nThis extends earlier work on scalar Yukawa theory where Pauli-Villars\nregularization did not play a central role. The key result is that the\nnonperturbative solution restores rotational symmetry even though the\nlight-front formulation of Yukawa theory, with its preferred axis, appears\nantithetical to such a symmetry.",

                "abstract": "Feynman integrals play a central role in the modern scattering amplitudes\nresearch program. Advancing our methods for evaluating Feynman integrals will,\ntherefore, strengthen our ability to compare theoretical predictions with data\nfrom particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. Motivated by\nthis, the present manuscript purports to study mathematical concepts related to\nFeynman integrals. In particular, we present both numerical and analytical\nalgorithms for the evaluation of Feynman integrals.\n  The content is divided into three parts. Part I focuses on the method of DEQs\nfor evaluating Feynman integrals. An otherwise daunting integral expression is\nthereby traded for the comparatively simpler task of solving a system of DEQs.\nWe use this technique to evaluate a family of two-loop Feynman integrals of\nrelevance for dark matter detection. Part II situates the study of DEQs for\nFeynman integrals within the framework of D-modules, a natural language for\nstudying PDEs algebraically. Special emphasis is put on a particular D-module\ncalled the GKZ system, a set of higher-order PDEs that annihilate a generalized\nversion of a Feynman integral. In the course of matching the generalized\nintegral to a Feynman integral proper, we discover an algorithm for evaluating\nthe latter in terms of logarithmic series. Part III develops a numerical\nintegration algorithm. It combines Monte Carlo sampling with tropical geometry,\na particular offspring of algebraic geometry that studies \"piecewise-linear\"\npolynomials. Feynman's i*epsilon-prescription is incorporated into the\nalgorithm via contour deformation. We present an open-source program named\nFeyntrop that implements this algorithm, and use it to numerically evaluate\nFeynman integrals between 1-5 loops and 0-5 legs in physical regions of phase\nspace.",

By exposing the polymer films below their\nablation threshold to laser fluence ranging from 4 to 16 mJcm-2 at 6,000\npulses, we studied both single-phase exposure at beam incidence angles of 0deg\nand 45deg, and two-phase exposure. Atomic force microscopy analysis revealed\nthat the laser-treated samples contained distinctive periodic patterns such as\nwaves, globules, and pod-like structures each exhibiting unique surface\nroughness. Moreover, using analytical methods like EDS and XPS shed light on\nthe changes in the atomic composition, specifically focusing on the C and O\nelements, as a result of laser exposure. Notably, in almost all cases, we\nobserved an increase in oxygen percentage on the sample surfaces. This increase\nnot only led to a decrease in the contact angle with water but also lowered the\nzeta potential value, thus showing that the modified samples have enhanced\nhydrophilicity of the surface and altered electrostatic properties. Last but\nnot least, the samples were assessed for biocompatibility; we studied the\ninteraction of the prepared replicates with mouse myoblasts (C2C12). The impact\nof globular/dot structures on the cell growth in comparison to pristine or\nlinear LIPSS-patterned surfaces was determined.

A popular approach to improving the poor acceptance\nrate of the basic rejection sampling ABC algorithm is to use sequential Monte\nCarlo (ABC SMC) to produce a sequence of proposal distributions adapting\ntowards the posterior, instead of generating values from the prior distribution\nof the model parameters. Proposal distribution for the subsequent iteration is\ntypically obtained from a weighted set of samples, often called particles, of\nthe current iteration of this sequence. Current methods for constructing these\nproposal distributions treat all the particles equivalently, regardless of the\ncorresponding value generated by the sampler, which may lead to inefficiency\nwhen propagating the information across iterations of the algorithm. To improve\nsampler efficiency, we introduce a modified approach called stratified distance\nABC SMC. Our algorithm stratifies particles based on their distance between the\ncorresponding synthetic and observed data, and then constructs distinct\nproposal distributions for all the strata. Taking into account the distribution\nof distances across the particle space leads to substantially improved\nacceptance rate of the rejection sampling. We further show that efficiency can\nbe gained by introducing a novel stopping rule for the sequential process based\non the stratified posterior samples and demonstrate these advances by several\nexamples.",

Minimalist market design initially evolved through my integrated\nresearch and policy efforts in school choice from 1997 to 2005 and in kidney\nexchange from 2003 to 2007. Given its success in school choice and kidney\nexchange, I systematically followed this approach in many other, often unusual\nreal-world settings.

Given\nprevious claims for high-precision constraints, we critically examine the\nveracity of a so-called ``blinding'' approach, in which alpha is fixed at the\nterrestrial value during the model building process, releasing it as a free\nparameter only after the ``final'' absorption system kinematic structure has\nbeen obtained. We show that this approach results in an extended flat canyon in\nchi squared-alpha space, such that convergence is unlikely to be reached, even\nafter as many as 1000 iterations. The fix is straightforward: alpha must be\ntreated as a free parameter from the earliest possible stages of absorption\nsystem model building. The implication of the results presented here is that\nall previous measurements that have used initially-fixed alpha should be\nreworked.",

                "abstract": "Dynamic control via optimized, piecewise-constant pulses is a common paradigm\nfor open-loop control to implement quantum gates. While numerous methods exist\nfor the synthesis of such controls, there are many open questions regarding the\nrobustness of the resulting control schemes in the presence of model\nuncertainty; unlike in classical control, there are generally no analytical\nguarantees on the control performance with respect to inexact modeling of the\nsystem. In this paper a new robustness measure based on the differential\nsensitivity of the gate fidelity error to parametric (structured) uncertainties\nis introduced, and bounds on the differential sensitivity to parametric\nuncertainties are used to establish performance guarantees for optimal\ncontrollers for a variety of quantum gate types, system sizes, and control\nimplementations. Specifically, it is shown how a maximum allowable perturbation\nover a set of Hamiltonian uncertainties that guarantees a given fidelity error,\ncan be reliably computed. This measure of robustness is inversely proportional\nto the upper bound on the differential sensitivity of the fidelity error\nevaluated under nominal operating conditions. Finally, the results show that\nthe nominal fidelity error and differential sensitivity upper bound are\npositively correlated across a wide range of problems and control\nimplementations, suggesting that in the high-fidelity control regime, rather\nthan there being a trade-off between fidelity and robustness, higher nominal\ngate fidelities are positively correlated with increased robustness of the\ncontrols in the presence of parametric uncertainties.",

While existing estimation approaches have achieved remarkable\nsuccess in enhancing prediction accuracy, they primarily infer gaze directions\nfrom single-image signals and discard the huge potentials of the currently\ndominant text guidance. Notably, visual-language collaboration has been\nextensively explored across a range of visual tasks, such as image synthesis\nand manipulation, leveraging the remarkable transferability of large-scale\nContrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. Nevertheless, existing\ngaze estimation approaches ignore the rich semantic cues conveyed by linguistic\nsignals and priors in CLIP feature space, thereby yielding performance\nsetbacks. In pursuit of making up this gap, we delve deeply into the text-eye\ncollaboration protocol and introduce a novel gaze estimation framework in this\npaper, referred to as GazeCLIP. Specifically, we intricately design a\nlinguistic description generator to produce text signals with coarse\ndirectional cues. Additionally, a CLIP-based backbone that excels in\ncharacterizing text-eye pairs for gaze estimation is presented. This is\nfollowed by the implementation of a fine-grained multi-modal fusion module\naimed at modeling the interrelationships between heterogeneous inputs.\nExtensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed GazeCLIP which surpasses the previous approaches and achieves\nthe state-of-the-art estimation accuracy.",

Thus, RL can be seen as an\nautomated approach to AO control, where its usage is entirely a turnkey\noperation.

                "abstract": "In the present work we revisit the problem of the quantum droplet in atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates with an eye towards describing its ground state in\nthe large density, so-called Thomas-Fermi limit. We consider the problem as\nbeing separable into 3 distinct regions: an inner one, where the Thomas-Fermi\napproximation is valid, a sharp transition region where the density abruptly\ndrops towards the (vanishing) background value and an outer region which\nasymptotes to the background value. We analyze the spatial extent of each of\nthese regions, and develop a systematic effective description of the rapid\nintermediate transition region. Accordingly, we derive a uniformly valid\ndescription of the ground state that is found to very accurately match our\nnumerical computations. As an additional application of our considerations, we\nshow that this formulations allows for an analytical approximation of excited\nstates such as the (trapped) dark soliton in the large density limit.",

We observe\na new resonance $\\mathcal R(3810)$ in the cross sections for the first time,\nand observe the $\\mathcal R(3760)$ resonance with high significance in the\ncross sections. The $\\mathcal R(3810)$ has a mass of $(3804.5 \\pm 0.9 \\pm 0.9)$\n~MeV/$c^2$, a total width of $(5.4 \\pm 3.5 \\pm 3.2)$~MeV, and an electronic\npartial width of $(19.4 \\pm 7.4 \\pm 12.1)$~eV. Its significance is $7.7\\sigma$.\nThe $\\mathcal R(3810)$ could be interpreted as a hadro-charmonium resonance\npredicted by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In addition, we measure the mass\n$(3751.9\\pm 3.8\\pm 2.8)$ ~MeV/$c^2$, the total width $(32.8 \\pm 5.8 \\pm\n8.7)$~MeV, and the electronic partial width $(184\\pm 75\\pm 86)$~eV with\nimproved precision for the $\\mathcal R(3760)$.

The $\\mathcal R(3780)$ can be interpreted\nas the $1^3D_1$ state of charmonium.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Online behavioral advertising (OBA) has a significant role in the digital\neconomy. It allows advertisers to target consumers categorized according to\ntheir algorithmically inferred interests based on their behavioral data. As\nAlphabet and Meta gatekeep the Internet with their digital platforms and\nchannel most of the consumer attention online, they are best placed to execute\nOBA and earn profits far exceeding fair estimations. There are increasing\nconcerns that gatekeepers achieve such profitability at the expense of\nconsumers, advertisers, and publishers who are dependent on their services to\naccess the Internet. In particular, some claim that OBA systematically exploits\nconsumers' decision-making vulnerabilities, creating internet infrastructure\nand relevant markets that optimize for consumer manipulation.\n  Intuitively, consumer manipulation via OBA comes in tension with the ideal of\nconsumer autonomy in liberal democracies. Nevertheless, academia has largely\noverlooked this phenomenon and instead has primarily focused on privacy and\ndiscrimination concerns of OBA. This article redirects academic discourse and\nregulatory focus on consumer manipulation via OBA. In doing so, first, this\narticle elaborates on how OBA works. Second, it constructs an analytic\nframework for understanding manipulation. Third, it applies the theory of\nmanipulation to OBA. As a result, this article illustrates the extent to which\nOBA leads to consumer manipulation. Crucially, this article is purely analytic\nand avoids normative evaluation of consumer manipulation via OBA. Evaluating\nconsumer manipulation harms of OBA is an equally important but separate task\nand is pursued in another publication.",

To address this\nproblem, we present the Open Dataset of Audio Quality (ODAQ), a new dataset\ncontaining the results of a MUSHRA listening test conducted with expert\nlisteners from 2 international laboratories. ODAQ contains 240 audio samples\nand corresponding quality scores. Each audio sample is rated by 26 listeners.\nThe audio samples are stereo audio signals sampled at 44.1 or 48 kHz and are\nprocessed by a total of 6 method classes, each operating at different quality\nlevels. The processing method classes are designed to generate quality\ndegradations possibly encountered during audio coding and source separation,\nand the quality levels for each method class span the entire quality range. The\ndiversity of the processing methods, the large span of quality levels, the high\nsampling frequency, and the pool of international listeners make ODAQ\nparticularly suited for further research into subjective and objective audio\nquality. The dataset is released with permissive licenses, and the software\nused to conduct the listening test is also made publicly available.",

                "abstract": "Gas-particle flows are commonly simulated through two-fluid model at\nindustrial-scale. However, these simulations need very fine grid to have\naccurate flow predictions, which is prohibitively demanding in terms of\ncomputational resources. To circumvent this problem, the filtered two-fluid\nmodel has been developed, where large-scale flow field is numerically resolved\nand small-scale fluctuations are accounted for through subgrid-scale modeling.\nIn this study, we have performed fine-grid two-fluid simulations of dilute\ngas-particle flows in periodic domains and applied explicit filtering to\ngenerate datasets. Then, these datasets have been used to develop artificial\nneural network (ANN) models for closures such as the filtered drag force and\nsolid phase stress for the filtered two-fluid model. The set of input variables\nfor the subgrid drag force ANN model that has been found previously to work\nwell for dense flow regimes is found to work as well for the dilute regime. In\naddition, we present a Galilean invariant tensor basis neural network (TBNN)\nmodel for the filtered solid phase stress which can capture nicely the\nanisotropic nature of the solid phase stress arising from subgrid-scale\nvelocity fluctuations. Finally, the predictions provided by this new TBNN model\nare compared with those obtained from a simple eddy-viscosity ANN model.",

In this\npaper, we study a distinct direction on the propagation of model uncertainty\nand how it impacts the reliability of rare-event estimates. Specifically, we\nconsider the basic setup of the exceedance of i.i.d. sum, and investigate how\nthe lack of tail information of each input summand can affect the output\nprobability. We argue that heavy-tailed problems are much more vulnerable to\ninput uncertainty than light-tailed problems, reasoned through their large\ndeviations behaviors and numerical evidence.

                "abstract": "The hybrid neural differentiable models mark a significant advancement in the\nfield of scientific machine learning. These models, integrating numerical\nrepresentations of known physics into deep neural networks, offer enhanced\npredictive capabilities and show great potential for data-driven modeling of\ncomplex physical systems. However, a critical and yet unaddressed challenge\nlies in the quantification of inherent uncertainties stemming from multiple\nsources. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel method, DiffHybrid-UQ, for\neffective and efficient uncertainty propagation and estimation in hybrid neural\ndifferentiable models, leveraging the strengths of deep ensemble Bayesian\nlearning and nonlinear transformations. Specifically, our approach effectively\ndiscerns and quantifies both aleatoric uncertainties, arising from data noise,\nand epistemic uncertainties, resulting from model-form discrepancies and data\nsparsity. This is achieved within a Bayesian model averaging framework, where\naleatoric uncertainties are modeled through hybrid neural models. The unscented\ntransformation plays a pivotal role in enabling the flow of these uncertainties\nthrough the nonlinear functions within the hybrid model. In contrast, epistemic\nuncertainties are estimated using an ensemble of stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) trajectories. This approach offers a practical approximation to the\nposterior distribution of both the network parameters and the physical\nparameters. Notably, the DiffHybrid-UQ framework is designed for simplicity in\nimplementation and high scalability, making it suitable for parallel computing\nenvironments. The merits of the proposed method have been demonstrated through\nproblems governed by both ordinary and partial differentiable equations.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Progression of hip osteoarthritis (hip OA) leads to pain and disability,\nlikely leading to surgical treatment such as hip arthroplasty at the terminal\nstage. The severity of hip OA is often classified using the Crowe and\nKellgren-Lawrence (KL) classifications. However, as the classification is\nsubjective, we aimed to develop an automated approach to classify the disease\nseverity based on the two grades using digitally-reconstructed radiographs\n(DRRs) from CT images. Automatic grading of the hip OA severity was performed\nusing deep learning-based models. The models were trained to predict the\ndisease grade using two grading schemes, i.e., predicting the Crowe and KL\ngrades separately, and predicting a new ordinal label combining both grades and\nrepresenting the disease progression of hip OA. The models were trained in\nclassification and regression settings. In addition, the model uncertainty was\nestimated and validated as a predictor of classification accuracy. The models\nwere trained and validated on a database of 197 hip OA patients, and externally\nvalidated on 52 patients. The model accuracy was evaluated using exact class\naccuracy (ECA), one-neighbor class accuracy (ONCA), and balanced accuracy.The\ndeep learning models produced a comparable accuracy of approximately 0.65 (ECA)\nand 0.95 (ONCA) in the classification and regression settings. The model\nuncertainty was significantly larger in cases with large classification errors\n(P<6e-3). In this study, an automatic approach for grading hip OA severity from\nCT images was developed. The models have shown comparable performance with high\nONCA, which facilitates automated grading in large-scale CT databases and\nindicates the potential for further disease progression analysis.\nClassification accuracy was correlated with the model uncertainty, which would\nallow for the prediction of classification errors.",

While existing research has\nmainly focused on backdoor attacks in image classification, there has been\nlimited exploration into their implications for object detection. In this work,\nwe propose the first backdoor attack designed for object detection tasks in SSL\nscenarios, termed Object Transform Attack (SSL-OTA). SSL-OTA employs a trigger\ncapable of altering predictions of the target object to the desired category,\nencompassing two attacks: Data Poisoning Attack (NA) and Dual-Source Blending\nAttack (DSBA). NA conducts data poisoning during downstream fine-tuning of the\nobject detector, while DSBA additionally injects backdoors into the pre-trained\nencoder. We establish appropriate metrics and conduct extensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and utility of our proposed\nattack. Notably, both NA and DSBA achieve high attack success rates (ASR) at\nextremely low poisoning rates (0.5%).

Biopsy is invasive, which motivates the development of non-invasive,\nMRI-based machine learning (ML) models to quantify intra-tumoral genetic\nheterogeneity for each patient. This capability holds great promise for\nenabling better therapeutic selection to improve patient outcomes. We proposed\na novel Weakly Supervised Ordinal Support Vector Machine (WSO-SVM) to predict\nregional genetic alteration status within each GBM tumor using MRI. WSO-SVM was\napplied to a unique dataset of 318 image-localized biopsies with spatially\nmatched multiparametric MRI from 74 GBM patients. The model was trained to\npredict the regional genetic alteration of three GBM driver genes (EGFR,\nPDGFRA, and PTEN) based on features extracted from the corresponding region of\nfive MRI contrast images. For comparison, a variety of existing ML algorithms\nwere also applied. The classification accuracy of each gene was compared\nbetween the different algorithms.

                "abstract": "Effective monitoring of walnut water status and stress level across the whole\norchard is an essential step towards precision irrigation management of\nwalnuts, a significant crop in California. This study presents a machine\nlearning approach using Random Forest (RF) models to map stem water potential\n(SWP) by integrating high-resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery from\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights with weather data. From 2017 to 2018,\nfive flights of an UAV equipped with a seven-band multispectral camera were\nconducted over a commercial walnut orchard, paired with concurrent ground\nmeasurements of sampled walnut plants. The RF regression model, utilizing\nvegetation indices derived from orthomosaiced UAV imagery and weather data,\neffectively estimated ground-measured SWPs, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.63 and a\nmean absolute error (MAE) of 0.80 bars. The integration of weather data was\nparticularly crucial for consolidating data across various flight dates.\nSignificant variables for SWP estimation included wind speed and vegetation\nindices such as NDVI, NDRE, and PSRI.A reduced RF model excluding red-edge\nindices of NDRE and PSRI, demonstrated slightly reduced accuracy ($R^2$ =\n0.54). Additionally, the RF classification model predicted water stress levels\nin walnut trees with 85% accuracy, surpassing the 80% accuracy of the reduced\nclassification model. The results affirm the efficacy of UAV-based\nmultispectral imaging combined with machine learning, incorporating thermal\ndata, NDVI, red-edge indices, and weather data, in walnut water stress\nestimation and assessment. This methodology offers a scalable, cost-effective\ntool for data-driven precision irrigation management at an individual plant\nlevel in walnut orchards.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Both humans and social animals live in groups and are frequently faced to\nchoose between options with different qualities. When no leader agents are\ncontrolling the group decision, consensus can be achieved through repeated\ninteractions among group members. Various studies on CDM illustrate how the\ndynamics of opinions are determined by the structure of the social network and\nthe methods that individuals use to share and update their opinion upon a\nsocial interaction. In this paper, we are interested in further exploring how\ncognitive, social, and environmental factors interactively contribute to\ndetermining the outcome of a collective best-of-n decision process involving\nasymmetric options, i.e., different costs and/or benefits for each option. We\npropose and study a novel model capturing those different factors, i) the error\nin processing social information, ii) the number of zealots (i.e., asocial\nagents who never change their opinion), iii) the option qualities, iv) the\nsocial connectivity structure, and v) the degree centrality of the asocial\nagents. By using the HMF approach, we study the impact of the above-mentioned\nfactors in the decision dynamics. Our findings indicate that when susceptible\nagents use the voter model as a mechanism to update their opinion, both the\nnumber and the degree of connectivity of the zealots can lead the population to\nconverge towards the lowest quality option. Instead, when susceptible agents\nuse methods more cognitively demanding, the group is marginally impacted by the\npresence of zealots. The results of the analytical model are complemented and\nextended by agent-based simulations. Our analysis also shows that the network\ntopology can modulate the influence of zealots on group dynamics.",

For fundamental and practical reasons, it is\nhighly desirable to add to the existing data base of analytical functional\nforms for such pair statistics. Here, we design a plethora of such pair\nfunctions in direct and Fourier spaces across the first three Euclidean space\ndimensions that are realizable by diverse many-particle systems with varying\ndegrees of correlated disorder across length scales, spanning a wide spectrum\nof hyperuniform, typical nonhyperuniform and antihyperuniform ones. This is\naccomplished by utilizing an efficient inverse algorithm that determines\nequilibrium states with up to pair interactions at positive temperature that\nprecisely match targeted forms for both $g_2(r)$ and $S(k)$. Among other\nresults, we realize an example with the strongest hyperuniform property among\nknown positive-temperature equilibrium states, critical-point systems (implying\nunusual 1D systems with phase transitions) that are not in the Ising\nuniversality class, systems that attain self-similar pair statistics under\nFourier transformation, and an experimentally feasible polymer model. We show\nthat our pair functions enable one to achieve systems with a wide range of\ntranslational order and self-diffusion coefficients $\\cal D$, which are\ninversely related to one another.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "The rapid growth of the ride-hailing industry has revolutionized urban\ntransportation worldwide. Despite its benefits, equity concerns arise as\nunderserved communities face limited accessibility to affordable ride-hailing\nservices. A key issue in this context is the vehicle rebalancing problem, where\nidle vehicles are moved to areas with anticipated demand. Without equitable\napproaches in demand forecasting and rebalancing strategies, these practices\ncan further deepen existing inequities. In the realm of ride-hailing, three\nmain facets of fairness are recognized: algorithmic fairness, fairness to\ndrivers, and fairness to riders. This paper focuses on enhancing both\nalgorithmic and rider fairness through a novel vehicle rebalancing method. We\nintroduce an approach that combines a Socio-Aware Spatial-Temporal Graph\nConvolutional Network (SA-STGCN) for refined demand prediction and a\nfairness-integrated Matching-Integrated Vehicle Rebalancing (MIVR) model for\nsubsequent vehicle rebalancing. Our methodology is designed to reduce\nprediction discrepancies and ensure equitable service provision across diverse\nregions. The effectiveness of our system is evaluated using simulations based\non real-world ride-hailing data. The results suggest that our proposed method\nenhances both accuracy and fairness in forecasting ride-hailing demand,\nultimately resulting in more equitable vehicle rebalancing in subsequent\noperations. Specifically, the algorithm developed in this study effectively\nreduces the standard deviation and average customer wait times by 6.48% and\n0.49%, respectively. This achievement signifies a beneficial outcome for\nride-hailing platforms, striking a balance between operational efficiency and\nfairness.",

Due to its structural\nheterogeneity, a complex network generally acts as a disordered system.\nSpecifically, we study the synchronization and entrainment transitions in the\nnonequilibrium dynamics of the Kuramoto model and the phase transition of the\nequilibrium dynamics of the classical $XY$ model, thereby covering a broad\nspectrum from nonlinear dynamics to statistical and condensed matter physics.\nUsing linear theory, we obtain a general relationship between the dynamics\noccurring on the network and the underlying network properties. This yields the\nlower critical spectral dimension of the phase synchronization and entrainment\ntransitions in the Kuramoto model as $d_s=4$ and $d_s=2$ respectively, whereas\nfor the phase transition in the $XY$ model it is $d_s=2$. To test our\ntheoretical hypotheses, we employ a network where any two nodes on the network\nare connected with a probability proportional to a power law of the distance\nbetween the nodes; this realizes any desired $d_s\\in [1, \\infty)$. Our detailed\nnumerical study agrees well with the prediction of linear theory for the phase\nsynchronization transition in the Kuramoto model.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Seasonal influenza causes on average 425,000 hospitalizations and 32,000\ndeaths per year in the United States. Forecasts of influenza-like illness (ILI)\n-- a surrogate for the proportion of patients infected with influenza --\nsupport public health decision making. The goal of an ensemble forecast of ILI\nis to increase accuracy and calibration compared to individual forecasts and to\nprovide a single, cohesive prediction of future influenza. However, an ensemble\nmay be composed of models that produce similar forecasts, causing issues with\nensemble forecast performance and non-identifiability. To improve upon the\nabove issues we propose a novel Cluster-Aggregate-Pool or `CAP' ensemble\nalgorithm that first clusters together individual forecasts, aggregates\nindividual models that belong to the same cluster into a single forecast\n(called a cluster forecast), and then pools together cluster forecasts via a\nlinear pool. When compared to a non-CAP approach, we find that a CAP ensemble\nimproves calibration by approximately 10% while maintaining similar accuracy to\nnon-CAP alternatives. In addition, our CAP algorithm (i) generalizes past\nensemble work associated with influenza forecasting and introduces a framework\nfor future ensemble work, (ii) automatically accounts for missing forecasts\nfrom individual models, (iii) allows public health officials to participate in\nthe ensemble by assigning individual models to clusters, and (iv) provide an\nadditional signal about when peak influenza may be near.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "This article proposes a Reynolds number scaling of the required grid points\nto perform wall-modeled LES of turbulent flows encountering separation off a\nsolid surface. Based on comparisons between the various time scales in a\nnon-equilibrium (due to the action of an external pressure gradient) turbulent\nboundary layer, a simple definition of the near-wall ``under-equilibrium\" and\n``out-of-equilibrium\" scales is put forward (where ``under-equilibrium\" refers\nto scales governed by a quasi-balance between the viscous and the pressure\ngradient terms). It is shown that the former length scale varies with Reynolds\nnumber as lp Re^(-2/3). The same scaling is obtained from a simplified Green's\nfunction solution of the Poisson equation in the vicinity of the separation\npoint. A-priori analysis demonstrates that the resolution required to\nreasonably predict the wall-shear stress (for example, errors lower than\napproximately 10-15% in the entire domain) in several nonequilibrium flows is\nat least O(10) lp irrespective of the Reynolds number and the Clauser\nparameter. Further, a series of a-posteriori validation studies are performed\nto determine the accuracy of this scaling including the flow over the Boeing\nspeed bump, Song-Eaton diffuser, Notre-Dame Ramp, and the backward-facing step.\nThe results suggest that for these flows, scaling the computational grids ()\nsuch that / lp is independent of the Reynolds number results in accurate\npredictions of flow separation at the same ``nominal\" grid resolution across\ndifferent Reynolds numbers. Finally, it is suggested that in the vicinity of\nthe separation and reattachment points, the grid-point requirements for\nwall-modeled large eddy simulations may scale as Re^4/3, which is more\nrestrictive than the previously proposed flat-plate boundary layer-based\nestimates (Re1) of Choi and Moin (Phys. Fluids, 2012) and Yang and Griffin\n(Phys. Fluids, 2021).",

                "abstract": "Low-mass giants with large amounts of lithium (Li) have challenged stellar\nevolution for decades. One of the possibilities usually discussed to explain\nthem involves the interaction with a close binary companion. This predicts that\nwhen compared against their non-enriched counterparts, Li-rich giants should\npreferentially be found as part of binary systems. In order to test this\nscenario, we assemble a sample of 1418 giants with radial velocities (RVs) from\nRAVE, GALAH, and Gaia, as well as stellar parameters and Li abundances from\nGALAH. Evolutionary states can be determined for 1030 of these giants. We\ndevelop a method that quantifies the degree of RV variability, which we use as\na proxy for close binary companions. The method is tested and calibrated\nagainst samples of known RV standard stars and known spectroscopic binaries. We\nalso compare the results of our RV variability analysis with binarity\nindicators from Gaia. We find that the accuracy of the classification is\ncontrolled by the precision of the RVs, which for the set of RVs available for\nthe giants is 80-85%. Consistent with seismic studies, the resulting sample of\ngiants contains a fraction of Li-rich objects in the red clump (RC) that is\ntwice as large as that for first-ascent giants (RGB). Among RC giants, the\nfractions of Li-rich objects with high RV variability and with no RV\nvariability are the same as those for Li-normal objects, which argues against a\nbinary interaction scenario for the genesis of the bulk of Li-rich giants at\nthat evolutionary stage. On the other hand, Li-rich giants in the RGB appear to\nhave a small but detectable preference for higher RV variability, and thus\npossibly a larger close binary fraction, than the Li-normal giants at that\nstage. Additional measurements of the RVs of these giants at higher RV\nprecision would greatly help confirm and more robustly quantify these results.",

Its\ncoupling $h_q$ allows to smoothly interpolate between the O(2) model ($h_q=0$)\nand a $q$-state clock model ($h_q\\rightarrow\\infty$). In the latter case, a\n$q$-state clock model can also be defined for non-integer values of $q$. Thus,\nsuch a limit can also be considered as an analytic continuation of an ordinary\n$q$-state clock model to noninteger $q$. In previous work, we established the\nphase diagram of the model in the infinite coupling limit\n($h_q\\rightarrow\\infty$). We showed that for non-integer $q$, there is a\nsecond-order phase transition at low temperature and a crossover at high\ntemperature. In this work, we establish the phase diagram at finite values of\nthe coupling using Monte Carlo and tensor methods. We show that for non-integer\n$q$, the second-order phase transition at low temperature and crossover at high\ntemperature persist to finite coupling. For integer $q=2,3,4$, we know there is\na second-order phase transition at infinite coupling (i.e. the well-known clock\nmodels). At finite coupling, we find that the critical exponents for $q=3,4$\nvary with the coupling, and for $q=4$ the transition may turn into a BKT\ntransition at small coupling.

However, materials discovery and property optimization\nare typically time-consuming due to the limited throughput of traditional\nsynthesis methods. In this work, we use a high-throughput combinatorial\nsynthesis approach to fabricate lead-free ferroelectric superlattices and solid\nsolutions of (Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BCT) and Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 (BZT) phases with\ncontinuous variation of composition and layer thickness. High-resolution X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) and analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy\n(STEM) demonstrate high film quality and well-controlled compositional\ngradients. Ferroelectric and dielectric property measurements identify the\noptimal property point achieved at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) with a\ncomposition of 48BZT-52BCT. Displacement vector maps reveal that ferroelectric\ndomain sizes are tunable by varying {BCT-BZT}N superlattice geometry. This\nhigh-throughput synthesis approach can be applied to many other material\nsystems to expedite new materials discovery and properties optimization,\nallowing for the exploration of a large area of phase space within a single\ngrowth.",

The radiation off heavy quarks is predicted to be suppressed for large\nmomentum particles, as a consequence of the angular ``dead cone effect''. In\nthis paper, we studied this effect using data from Z boson decays to c- or\nb-quarks in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. The momentum spectra for charged particles\nare reconstructed in the momentum fraction variable $x$ or $\\xi=\\ln(1/x)$ by\nremoving the decays of the heavy hadrons. We find an increasing suppression of\nparticles with rising $x$ down to a fraction of $\\lesssim 1/10$ for particles\nwith $x\\gtrsim0.2$ in b-quark and $x\\gtrsim0.4$ in c-quark jets in comparison\nto light quark momentum spectra. The sensitivity to the dead cone effect in the\npresent momentum analysis is larger than in the recently presented angular\nanalysis. The suppression for c- and b-quark fragmentation is in good\nquantitative agreement with the expectations based on perturbative QCD within\nthe Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) in the central kinematic\nregion. The data also support a two parameter description in the MLLA of these\nphenomena (``Limiting Spectrum''). The sensitivity of these measurements to the\nheavy quark mass is investigated.",

Due to this asymmetry, nonlinear\nHall currents induced by Berry curvature in different Weyl nodes do not\nperfectly compensate.

                "abstract": "Subensemble Acceptance Method (SAM) [1,2] is an essential link between\nmeasured event-by-event fluctuations and their grand canonical theoretical\npredictions such as lattice QCD. The method allows quantifying the global\nconservation law effects in fluctuations. In its basic formulation, SAM\nrequires a sufficiently large system such as created in central nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions and sufficient space-momentum correlations. Directly in the spinodal\nregion of the First Order Phase Transition (FOPT) different approximations\nshould be used that account for finite size effects. Thus, we present the\ngeneralization of SAM applicable in both the pure phases, metastable and\nunstable regions of the phase diagram [3]. Obtained analytic formulas indicate\nthe enhancement of fluctuations due to crossing the spinodal region of FOPT and\nare tested using molecular dynamics simulations. A rather good agreement is\nobserved. Using transport model calculations with interaction potential we show\nthat the spinodal enhancement of fluctuations survives till the later stages of\ncollision via the memory effect [4]. However, at low collision energies the\nspace-momentum correlation is not strong enough for this signal to be\ntransferred to second and third order cumulants measured in momentum subspace.\nThis result agrees well with recent HADES data on proton number fluctuations at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$ GeV which are found to be consistent with the binomial\nmomentum space acceptance [5].",

TopCoW dataset was the\nfirst public dataset with voxel-level annotations for CoW's 13 vessel\ncomponents, made possible by virtual-reality (VR) technology. It was also the\nfirst dataset with paired MRA and CTA from the same patients.

The top performing\nteams managed to segment many CoW components to Dice scores around 90%, but\nwith lower scores for communicating arteries and rare variants.

In our work, we have predicted the\ntopological phase in Hg-based chalcopyrite compounds using the first principles\ndensity functional theory. The initial focus was on HgSnN 2 , revealing it to\nbe a nonmagnetic Weyl semimetal, while HgSnP 2 displayed characteristics of a\nstrong topological insulator. What makes our work truly unique is that despite\nboth compounds having the same SOC strength, arises from Hg, they exhibit\ndistinct topological phases due to the distinct hybridization effect of the\nHg-5d and X-p bands. This finding can address a significant factor, i.e., the\neffect of the band hybridization in deriving distinct topological phases,\nkeeping the symmetry aspect intact. Our results indicate that due to the\npresence of band hybridization between the dominant X-np orbitals n=2 and 3 for\nX=N and P respectively and a minor contribution from Hg-5d, we can tune the\ntopological phase by manipulating SOC strength, which equivalently achievable\nby chemical substitutions.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "As an important component of the detector localization branch, bounding box\nregression loss plays a significant role in object detection tasks. The\nexisting bounding box regression methods usually consider the geometric\nrelationship between the GT box and the predicted box, and calculate the loss\nby using the relative position and shape of the bounding boxes, while ignoring\nthe influence of inherent properties such as the shape and scale of the\nbounding boxes on bounding box regression. In order to make up for the\nshortcomings of existing research, this article proposes a bounding box\nregression method that focuses on the shape and scale of the bounding box\nitself. Firstly, we analyzed the regression characteristics of the bounding\nboxes and found that the shape and scale factors of the bounding boxes\nthemselves will have an impact on the regression results. Based on the above\nconclusions, we propose the Shape IoU method, which can calculate the loss by\nfocusing on the shape and scale of the bounding box itself, thereby making the\nbounding box regression more accurate. Finally, we validated our method through\na large number of comparative experiments, which showed that our method can\neffectively improve detection performance and outperform existing methods,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance in different detection tasks.Code is\navailable at https://github.com/malagoutou/Shape-IoU",

The data was obtained from a\npyranometer, strategically located in a high area of the campus. This\ninstrument continuously recorded solar irradiance data since 2020, offering a\ncomprehensive dataset encompassing various weather conditions and temporal\nvariations. After a correlation analysis, temperature and the time of day were\nidentified as the relevant meteorological variables that influenced the solar\nirradiance. Different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression,\nK-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting were compared using\nthe evaluation metrics Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error\n(RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination\n($R^2$). The study revealed that Gradient Boosting Regressor exhibited superior\nperformance, closely followed by the Random Forest Regressor. These models\neffectively captured the non-linear patterns in solar radiation, as evidenced\nby their low MSE and high $R^2$ values. With the aim of assess the performance\nof our ML models, we developed a web-based tool for the Solar Radiation\nForecasting in the UTEQ available at\nhttp://https://solarradiationforecastinguteq.streamlit.app/.

Visual autonomous driving\napplications require features encompassing semantics, 3D geometry, and temporal\ninformation simultaneously for joint perception, prediction, and planning,\nposing dramatic challenges for pre-training. To resolve this, we bring up a new\npre-training task termed as visual point cloud forecasting - predicting future\npoint clouds from historical visual input. The key merit of this task captures\nthe synergic learning of semantics, 3D structures, and temporal dynamics. Hence\nit shows superiority in various downstream tasks. To cope with this new\nproblem, we present ViDAR, a general model to pre-train downstream visual\nencoders. It first extracts historical embeddings by the encoder. These\nrepresentations are then transformed to 3D geometric space via a novel Latent\nRendering operator for future point cloud prediction. Experiments show\nsignificant gain in downstream tasks, e.g., 3.1% NDS on 3D detection, ~10%\nerror reduction on motion forecasting, and ~15% less collision rate on\nplanning.",

                "abstract": "Geoscientists use observed data to estimate properties of the Earth's\ninterior. This often requires non-linear inverse problems to be solved and\nuncertainties to be estimated. Bayesian inference solves inverse problems under\na probabilistic framework, in which uncertainty is represented by a so-called\nposterior probability distribution. Recently, variational inference has emerged\nas an efficient method to estimate Bayesian solutions. By seeking the closest\napproximation to the posterior distribution within any chosen family of\ndistributions, variational inference yields a fully probabilistic solution. It\nis important to define expressive variational families so that the posterior\ndistribution can be represented accurately. We introduce boosting variational\ninference (BVI) as a computationally efficient means to construct a flexible\napproximating family comprising all possible finite mixtures of simpler\ncomponent distributions. We use Gaussian mixture components due to their fully\nparametric nature and the ease with which they can be optimised. We apply BVI\nto seismic travel time tomography and full waveform inversion, comparing its\nperformance with other methods of solution. The results demonstrate that BVI\nachieves reasonable efficiency and accuracy while enabling the construction of\na fully analytic expression for the posterior distribution. Samples that\nrepresent major components of uncertainty in the solution can be obtained\nanalytically from each mixture component. We demonstrate that these samples can\nbe used to solve an interrogation problem: to assess the size of a subsurface\ntarget structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method in\ngeophysics that provides both analytic and reasonably accurate probabilistic\nsolutions to fully non-linear, high-dimensional Bayesian full waveform\ninversion problems.",

We conduct extensive\nexperiments on six datasets with five attribution methods, and also evaluate\nthe faithfulness in the out-of-domain setting.

With the event GW170817/GRB 170817A, we find\nthat the number of extra dimensions has an upper limit of $d\\leq9$.

Here we demonstrate the application of gate-driven\ncarrier modulation in the microdevice of magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2,\nfabricated from a bulk single crystal via focused ion beam (FIB). We discovered\na Li-intercalated phase LixCo3Sn2S2 featuring electron doping exceeding 5*1021\ncm-3, resulting in the Fermi energy shift of 200 meV. The carrier density\ndependent anomalous Hall conductivity shows fair agreement with density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculation, which also predicts intercalated Li+ ion\nstabilization within the anion layer while maintaining the kagome-lattice\nintact. This likely explains the observed rigid band behavior and constant\nCurie temperature, contrasting with magnetic site substitution experiments.

                "abstract": "Small-signal synchronization instability (SSI) may be triggered when a\ngrid-connected converter is operated in weak grids. This problem is highly\nrelated to the active and reactive power (referred to as complex power)\ngeneration or consumption of the converter. Such an instability phenomenon\nmanifests as power oscillations within the bandwidth frequency of phase-locked\nloop (PLL). However, in a multi-converter power system (MCPS), it is\nchallenging to characterize the role of each converter's complex power in SSI\nissues due to the high dimension of system dynamics. In this paper, we focus on\nthe impact regularity of complex power on the small-signal synchronization\nstability of the MCPS. Firstly, we formulate the modeling of the MCPS and\ndevelop a systematical stability indicator to explicitly quantify the stability\nmargin under various operating complex power. Then, based on the proposed\nstability indicator, the \"resultant force\" of complex power on the stability\nmargin of the MCPS can be analytically characterized into a weighted summation\nform. Furthermore, we elaborate on the impact of each converter's active power\nand reactive power, respectively. Notably, we demonstrate the cancellation\neffect between the active power generation and consumption on the stability\nmargin, which ultimately helps prevent SSI issues in the MCPS. The correctness\nof theoretical findings is well verified by simulations results.",

                "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of antiretroviral therapies for HIV-1 is a pressing\nclinical challenge, especially when the treatment regimen includes drugs for\nwhich limited effectiveness data is available. This scarcity of data can arise\neither due to the introduction of a new drug to the market or due to limited\nuse in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel joint\nfusion model, which combines features from a Fully Connected (FC) Neural\nNetwork and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The FC network employs tabular data\nwith a feature vector made up of viral mutations identified in the most recent\ngenotypic resistance test, along with the drugs used in therapy. Conversely,\nthe GNN leverages knowledge derived from Stanford drug-resistance mutation\ntables, which serve as benchmark references for deducing in-vivo treatment\nefficacy based on the viral genetic sequence, to build informative graphs. We\nevaluated these models' robustness against Out-of-Distribution drugs in the\ntest set, with a specific focus on the GNN's role in handling such scenarios.\nOur comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the proposed model consistently\noutperforms the FC model, especially when considering Out-of-Distribution\ndrugs. These results underscore the advantage of integrating Stanford scores in\nthe model, thereby enhancing its generalizability and robustness, but also\nextending its utility in real-world applications with limited data\navailability.

Recently, many mono-modal deep learning methods have\nbeen successfully applied to molecular property prediction. However, the\ninherent limitation of mono-modal learning arises from relying solely on one\nmodality of molecular representation, which restricts a comprehensive\nunderstanding of drug molecules and hampers their resilience against data\nnoise. To overcome the limitations, we construct multimodal deep learning\nmodels to cover different molecular representations. We convert drug molecules\ninto three molecular representations, SMILES-encoded vectors, ECFP\nfingerprints, and molecular graphs. To process the modal information,\nTransformer-Encoder, bi-directional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), and graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) are utilized for feature learning respectively,\nwhich can enhance the model capability to acquire complementary and naturally\noccurring bioinformatics information. We evaluated our triple-modal model on\nsix molecule datasets. Different from bi-modal learning models, we adopt five\nfusion methods to capture the specific features and leverage the contribution\nof each modal information better. Compared with mono-modal models, our\nmultimodal fused deep learning (MMFDL) models outperform single models in\naccuracy, reliability, and resistance capability against noise. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate its generalization ability in the prediction of binding constants\nfor protein-ligand complex molecules in the refined set of PDBbind.

                "abstract": "We present FerKD, a novel efficient knowledge distillation framework that\nincorporates partial soft-hard label adaptation coupled with a\nregion-calibration mechanism. Our approach stems from the observation and\nintuition that standard data augmentations, such as RandomResizedCrop, tend to\ntransform inputs into diverse conditions: easy positives, hard positives, or\nhard negatives. In traditional distillation frameworks, these transformed\nsamples are utilized equally through their predictive probabilities derived\nfrom pretrained teacher models. However, merely relying on prediction values\nfrom a pretrained teacher, a common practice in prior studies, neglects the\nreliability of these soft label predictions. To address this, we propose a new\nscheme that calibrates the less-confident regions to be the context using\nsoftened hard groundtruth labels. Our approach involves the processes of hard\nregions mining + calibration. We demonstrate empirically that this method can\ndramatically improve the convergence speed and final accuracy. Additionally, we\nfind that a consistent mixing strategy can stabilize the distributions of soft\nsupervision, taking advantage of the soft labels. As a result, we introduce a\nstabilized SelfMix augmentation that weakens the variation of the mixed images\nand corresponding soft labels through mixing similar regions within the same\nimage. FerKD is an intuitive and well-designed learning system that eliminates\nseveral heuristics and hyperparameters in former FKD solution. More\nimportantly, it achieves remarkable improvement on ImageNet-1K and downstream\ntasks. For instance, FerKD achieves 81.2% on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50,\noutperforming FKD and FunMatch by remarkable margins. Leveraging better\npre-trained weights and larger architectures, our finetuned ViT-G14 even\nachieves 89.9%. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/szq0214/FKD/tree/main/FerKD.",

We start with an observation that\nthe true optimal value function must be nonsmooth ($i.e.$, not globally $C^1$)\ndue to the symmetry of the problem. We then give a result that can certify the\noptimality of a candidate $\\textit{piece-wise}$ $C^1$ value function. Further,\nfor a candidate value function obtained via numerical approximation, we provide\na bound of suboptimality based on its Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation\nresiduals. Inspired by Holzhuter (2004), we then design an algorithm that\nsolves backward the Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) ODE from terminal\nconditions provided by the locally optimal LQR value function. This numerical\nprocedure leads to a piece-wise $C^1$ value function whose nonsmooth region\ncontains periodic $\\textit{spiral lines}$ and smooth regions attain HJB\nresiduals about $10^{-4}$, hence certified to be the optimal value function up\nto minor numerical inaccuracies. This optimal value function checks the power\nof optimality: (i) it sits above a polynomial lower bound; (ii) its induced\ncontroller globally swings up and stabilizes the pendulum, and (iii) attains\nlower trajectory cost than baseline methods such as energy shaping, model\npredictive control (MPC), and proximal policy optimization (with MPC attaining\nalmost the same cost).

The theory\npredicts presheath-like perturbations to the plasma that result from the free\nstreaming of electrons and an effusion loss process from the chamber at the\nelectrode. For these situations, a loss-cone-like velocity distribution\nfunction for electrons is predicted where the loss angle of the depletion\nregion corresponds to the angular size of the electrode at a specified\ndistance. The angle of the loss cone becomes 180 degrees at the sheath edge. In\ncomparison to a previous collisional electron presheath model that required\nelectrons satisfy a Bohm criterion at the sheath edge [B. Scheiner et al. Phys.\nPlasmas 22, 123520 (2015)], the present work suggests that no such condition is\nneeded for collisionless low pressure plasmas in the $\\lesssim$10 mTorr range.\nThe theory predicts the generation of a density depletion of roughly 0.5$n_e$\nand an electron velocity moment of 10s of percent of the electron thermal speed\nby the sheath edge in a presheath with a potential drop of less than $T_i/e$.\nThe range of this presheath perturbation is determined by the electrode\ngeometry instead of the collisional mean free path.

We propose a unified framework\nthat distinguishes the sources of prediction errors into a set of key measures\nthat quantify the various types of system-induced effects, both at the\nindividual and collective levels. Based on our measuring framework, we examine\nthe most widely adopted algorithms in the context of movie recommendation. Our\nresearch reveals three important findings: (1) Differences between algorithms:\nrecommendations generated by simpler algorithms tend to be more stereotypical\nbut less biased than those generated by more complex algorithms. (2) Disparate\nimpact on groups and individuals: system-induced biases and stereotypes have a\ndisproportionate effect on atypical users and minority groups (e.g., women and\nolder users). (3) Mitigation opportunity: using structural equation modeling,\nwe identify the interactions between user characteristics (typicality and\ndiversity), system-induced effects, and miscalibration. We further investigate\nthe possibility of mitigating system-induced effects by oversampling\nunderrepresented groups and individuals, which was found to be effective in\nreducing stereotypes and improving recommendation quality.

Thus, we introduce\na plug-and-play method named CITrans, which iteratively trains SGG models with\nprogressively enhanced data. First, we introduce Context-Restricted Transfer\n(CRT), which imposes subject-object constraints within predicates' semantic\nspace to achieve fine-grained data transfer. Subsequently, Efficient Iterative\nLearning (EIL) iteratively trains models and progressively generates enhanced\nlabels which are consistent with model's learning state, thereby accelerating\nthe training process. Finally, extensive experiments show that CITrans achieves\nstate-of-the-art and results with high efficiency.",

In this work, we study Krylov complexity\n$\\mathcal{K}(t)$ in Random Matrix Theory (RMT). In large $N$ limit: (1) For\ninfinite temperature, we analytically show that the Lanczos coefficient\n$\\{b_n\\}$ saturate to constant plateau $\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}b_n=b$,\nrendering a linear growing complexity $\\mathcal{K}(t)\\sim t$, in contrast to\nthe exponential-in-time growth in chaotic local systems in thermodynamic limit.\nAfter numerically comparing this plateau value $b$ to a large class of chaotic\nlocal quantum systems, we find that up to small fluctuations, it actually\nbounds the $\\{b_n\\}$ in chaotic local quantum systems. Therefore we conjecture\nthat in chaotic local quantum systems after scrambling time, the speed of\nlinear growth of Krylov complexity cannot be larger than that in RMT. (2) For\nlow temperature, we analytically show that $b_n$ will first exhibit linear\ngrowth with $n$, whose slope saturates the famous chaos bound. After hitting\nthe same plateau $b$, $b_n$ will then remain constant. This indicates\n$\\mathcal{K}(t)\\sim e^{2\\pi t/\\beta}$ before scrambling time $t_*\\sim\nO(\\beta\\log\\beta)$, and after that it will grow linearly in time, with the same\nspeed as in infinite temperature.

                "abstract": "Missing data are inevitable in longitudinal studies. Traditional methods,\nsuch as the full information maximum likelihood (FIML), are commonly used to\nhandle ignorable missing data. However, they may lead to biased model\nestimation due to missing not at random data that often appear in longitudinal\nstudies. Recently, machine learning methods, such as random forests (RF) and\nK-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation methods, have been proposed to cope with\nmissing values. Although machine learning imputation methods have been gaining\npopularity, few studies have investigated the tenability and utility of these\nmethods in longitudinal research. Through Monte Carlo simulations, this study\nevaluates and compares the performance of traditional and machine learning\napproaches (FIML, RF, and KNN) in growth curve modeling. The effects of sample\nsize, the rate of missingness, and the missing data mechanism on model\nestimation are investigated. Results indicate that FIML is a better choice than\nthe two machine learning imputation methods in terms of model estimation\naccuracy and efficiency.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Phrase mining is a fundamental text mining task that aims to identify quality\nphrases from context. Nevertheless, the scarcity of extensive gold labels\ndatasets, demanding substantial annotation efforts from experts, renders this\ntask exceptionally challenging. Furthermore, the emerging, infrequent, and\ndomain-specific nature of quality phrases presents further challenges in\ndealing with this task. In this paper, we propose LMPhrase, a novel\nunsupervised context-aware quality phrase mining framework built upon large\npre-trained language models (LMs). Specifically, we first mine quality phrases\nas silver labels by employing a parameter-free probing technique called\nPerturbed Masking on the pre-trained language model BERT (coined as Annotator).\nIn contrast to typical statistic-based or distantly-supervised methods, our\nsilver labels, derived from large pre-trained language models, take into\naccount rich contextual information contained in the LMs. As a result, they\nbring distinct advantages in preserving informativeness, concordance, and\ncompleteness of quality phrases. Secondly, training a discriminative span\nprediction model heavily relies on massive annotated data and is likely to face\nthe risk of overfitting silver labels. Alternatively, we formalize phrase\ntagging task as the sequence generation problem by directly fine-tuning on the\nSequence-to-Sequence pre-trained language model BART with silver labels (coined\nas Generator). Finally, we merge the quality phrases from both the Annotator\nand Generator as the final predictions, considering their complementary nature\nand distinct characteristics. Extensive experiments show that our LMPhrase\nconsistently outperforms all the existing competitors across two different\ngranularity phrase mining tasks, where each task is tested on two different\ndomain datasets.",

At the heart of our\napproach is STanHop, a novel Hopfield-based neural network block, which\nsparsely learns and stores both temporal and cross-series representations in a\ndata-dependent fashion. In essence, STanHop sequentially learn temporal\nrepresentation and cross-series representation using two tandem sparse Hopfield\nlayers. In addition, StanHop incorporates two additional external memory\nmodules: a Plug-and-Play module and a Tune-and-Play module for train-less and\ntask-aware memory-enhancements, respectively. They allow StanHop-Net to swiftly\nrespond to certain sudden events. Methodologically, we construct the\nStanHop-Net by stacking STanHop blocks in a hierarchical fashion, enabling\nmulti-resolution feature extraction with resolution-specific sparsity.\nTheoretically, we introduce a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model\n(Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model) and show that it endows a tighter\nmemory retrieval error compared to the dense counterpart without sacrificing\nmemory capacity. Empirically, we validate the efficacy of our framework on both\nsynthetic and real-world settings.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "This paper addresses the task of counting human actions of interest using\nsensor data from wearable devices. We propose a novel exemplar-based framework,\nallowing users to provide exemplars of the actions they want to count by\nvocalizing predefined sounds ''one'', ''two'', and ''three''. Our method first\nlocalizes temporal positions of these utterances from the audio sequence. These\npositions serve as the basis for identifying exemplars representing the action\nclass of interest. A similarity map is then computed between the exemplars and\nthe entire sensor data sequence, which is further fed into a density estimation\nmodule to generate a sequence of estimated density values. Summing these\ndensity values provides the final count. To develop and evaluate our approach,\nwe introduce a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of real-world data from\n37 subjects and 50 action categories, encompassing both sensor and audio data.\nThe experiments on this dataset demonstrate the viability of the proposed\nmethod in counting instances of actions from new classes and subjects that were\nnot part of the training data. On average, the discrepancy between the\npredicted count and the ground truth value is 7.47, significantly lower than\nthe errors of the frequency-based and transformer-based methods.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "The LHC analyses of processes containing two or more leptons and missing\nenergy, possibly in association with b-jets, show strong tensions with the\nStandard Model predictions and are known as multi-lepton anomalies. In\nparticular, top-quark differential distributions point towards the associated\nproduction of new Higgs bosons decaying into bottom quarks and W bosons\n($>5\\sigma$) with masses consistent with the di-photon excesses at 95GeV and\n152GeV ($3.8\\sigma$ and $4.9\\sigma$, respectively). Furthermore, CMS found\nindications for resonant top-quark pair production at 400GeV ($3.5\\sigma$) and\nboth ATLAS and CMS reported elevated four-top and ttW cross-sections. In this\narticle, we propose a combined explanation of these excesses by supplementing\nthe SM Higgs with a second scalar doublet, a real scalar singlet ($S$) and a\nHiggs triplet with $Y=0$ ($\\Delta$); the $\\Delta$2HDMS. We fix the masses of\nthe neutral triplet-like and the singlet-like scalars by the di-photon\nexcesses, i.e. $m_{\\Delta^0}=152$GeV and $m_S=95$GeV, respectively. Here, H,\nthe CP-even component of the second doublet, is produced via gluon fusion from\na top-loop and decays dominantly to $S+\\Delta^0$ whose subsequent decays to WW\nand bb explain the differential top-quark distributions for $\\sigma(pp\\to H\\to\nS\\Delta^0)\\approx6$pb. Fixing the top-Yukawa accordingly, the CP-odd Higgs\nboson A turns out to have the right production cross-section to account for the\nresonant top-pair excess at 400GeV, while the top-associated production of H\nand A results in new physics pollution of Standard Model ttW and four-top cross\nsections, as preferred by the data. Furthermore, a positive shift in the W mass\nis naturally induced by the vacuum expectation value of the triplet and we show\nthat the most relevant signal strengths of the 152GeV boson are compatible with\nthe process $pp\\to H\\to \\Delta^0S$ if S is allowed to decay invisibly.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "We formulate a renormalisation procedure for IR divergences of tree-level\nin-in late-time de Sitter correlators. These divergences are due to the\ninfinite volume of spacetime and are analogous to the divergences that appear\nin AdS dealt with by holographic renormalisation. Regulating the theory using\ndimensional regularisation, we show that one can remove all infinities by\nadding local counterterms at the future boundary of dS in the Schwinger-Keldysh\npath integral. The counterterms amount to renormalising the late-time bulk\nfield. We frame the discussion in terms of bulk scalar fields in dS, using\ntree-level correlators of massless and conformal scalars for illustration. The\nrelation to AdS via analytic continuation is discussed, and we show that\ndifferent versions of the analytic continuation appearing in the literature are\nequivalent to each other. In AdS, one needs to add counterterms that are\nrelated to conformal anomalies, and also to renormalise the source part of the\nbulk field. The analytic continuation to dS projects out the traditional AdS\ncounterterms, and links the renormalisation of the sources to the\nrenormalisation of the late-time bulk field. We use these results to establish\nholographic formulae that relate tree-level dS in-in correlators to CFT\ncorrelators at up to four points, and we provide two proofs: one using the\nconnection between the dS wavefunction and the partition function of the dual\nCFT, and a second by direct evaluation of the in-in correlators using the\nSchwinger-Keldysh formalism. The renormalisation of the bulk IR divergences is\nmapped by these formulae to UV renormalisation of the dual CFT via local\ncounterterms, providing structural support for a possible duality. We also\nrecast the regulated holographic formulae in terms of the AdS amplitudes of\nshadow fields, but show that this relation breaks down when renormalisation is\nrequired.",

In\ncontrast, we use 3D data to establish an automatic pipeline to determine\nauthentic ground truth amodal masks for partially occluded objects in real\nimages. This pipeline is used to construct an amodal completion evaluation\nbenchmark, MP3D-Amodal, consisting of a variety of object categories and\nlabels. To better handle the amodal completion task in the wild, we explore two\narchitecture variants: a two-stage model that first infers the occluder,\nfollowed by amodal mask completion; and a one-stage model that exploits the\nrepresentation power of Stable Diffusion for amodal segmentation across many\ncategories.

                "abstract": "We present connections between the recent literature on multigroup fairness\nfor prediction algorithms and classical results in computational complexity.\nMultiaccurate predictors are correct in expectation on each member of an\narbitrary collection of pre-specified sets. Multicalibrated predictors satisfy\na stronger condition: they are calibrated on each set in the collection.\n  Multiaccuracy is equivalent to a regularity notion for functions defined by\nTrevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan (2009). They showed that, given a class $F$ of\n(possibly simple) functions, an arbitrarily complex function $g$ can be\napproximated by a low-complexity function $h$ that makes a small number of\noracle calls to members of $F$, where the notion of approximation requires that\n$h$ cannot be distinguished from $g$ by members of $F$. This\ncomplexity-theoretic Regularity Lemma is known to have implications in\ndifferent areas, including in complexity theory, additive number theory,\ninformation theory, graph theory, and cryptography. Starting from the stronger\nnotion of multicalibration, we obtain stronger and more general versions of a\nnumber of applications of the Regularity Lemma, including the Hardcore Lemma,\nthe Dense Model Theorem, and the equivalence of conditional pseudo-min-entropy\nand unpredictability. For example, we show that every boolean function\n(regardless of its hardness) has a small collection of disjoint hardcore sets,\nwhere the sizes of those hardcore sets are related to how balanced the function\nis on corresponding pieces of an efficient partition of the domain.",

In contrast to existing methods that regularize neural network\nparameters directly, this objective allows parameters to vary widely during\ntraining, enabling better adaptation to new tasks. Compared to objectives that\ndirectly regularize neural network predictions, the proposed objective allows\nfor more flexible variational distributions and more effective regularization.\nWe demonstrate that, across a range of task sequences, neural networks trained\nvia sequential function-space variational inference achieve better predictive\naccuracy than networks trained with related methods while depending less on\nmaintaining a set of representative points from previous tasks.",

While most FQH states are\nbelieved to have Abelian anyons, the Moore-Read type states with even\ndenominators, appearing at half filling of a Landau level (LL), are predicted\nto possess non-Abelian excitations with appealing potentials in topological\nquantum computation. These states, however, depend sensitively on the orbital\ncontents of the single-particle LL wavefunction and the mixing between\ndifferent LLs. Although they have been observed in a few materials, their\nnon-Abelian statistics still awaits experimental confirmation. Here we show\nmagnetotransport measurements on Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene (TLG), whose\nunique multiband structure facilitates the interlaced LL mixing, which can be\ncontrolled by external magnetic and displacement fields. We observe a series of\nrobust FQH states including even-denominator ones at filling factors\n$\\nu=-9/2$, $-3/2$, $3/2$ and $9/2$. In addition, we are able to finetune the\nLL mixing and crossings to drive quantum phase transitions of these\nhalf-filling states and their neighboring odd-denominator ones, exhibiting a\nrelated emerging and waning behavior. Our results establish TLG as a\ncontrollable system for tuning the weights of LL orbitals and mixing strength,\nand a fresh platform to seek for non-Abelian quasi-particles.",

Recognizing\nthat the primary object of interest in most settings is the distribution over\nfunctions induced by the posterior distribution over neural network parameters,\nwe frame Bayesian inference in neural networks explicitly as inferring a\nposterior distribution over functions and propose a scalable function-space\nvariational inference method that allows incorporating prior information and\nresults in reliable predictive uncertainty estimates.

We evaluate the\nutility of this regularization technique empirically and demonstrate that the\nproposed method leads to near-perfect semantic shift detection,\nhighly-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates, successful task adaption\nfrom pre-trained models, and improved generalization under covariate shift.",

Furthermore, existing low-rank tensor\nmethods lack the capability for statistical inference in an online fashion,\nwhich is essential for real-time predictions and informed decision-making. This\npaper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel online inference\nframework for low-rank tensor learning. Our approach employs Stochastic\nGradient Descent (SGD) to enable efficient real-time data processing without\nextensive memory requirements, thereby significantly reducing computational\ndemands. We establish a non-asymptotic convergence result for the online\nlow-rank SGD estimator, nearly matches the minimax optimal rate of estimation\nerror in offline models that store all historical data. Building upon this\nfoundation, we propose a simple yet powerful online debiasing approach for\nsequential statistical inference in low-rank tensor learning. The entire online\nprocedure, covering both estimation and inference, eliminates the need for data\nsplitting or storing historical data, making it suitable for on-the-fly\nhypothesis testing.

                "abstract": "In mobile robot navigation, despite advancements, the generation of optimal\npaths often disrupts pedestrian areas. To tackle this, we propose three key\ncontributions to improve human-robot coexistence in shared spaces. Firstly, we\nhave established a comprehensive framework to understand disturbances at\nindividual and flow levels. Our framework provides specialized computational\nstrategies for in-depth studies of human-robot interactions from both micro and\nmacro perspectives. By employing novel penalty terms, namely Flow Disturbance\nPenalty (FDP) and Individual Disturbance Penalty (IDP), our framework\nfacilitates a more nuanced assessment and analysis of the robot navigation's\nimpact on pedestrians. Secondly, we introduce an innovative sampling-based\nnavigation system that adeptly integrates a suite of safety measures with the\npredictability of robotic movements. This system not only accounts for\ntraditional factors such as trajectory length and travel time but also actively\nincorporates pedestrian awareness. Our navigation system aims to minimize\ndisturbances and promote harmonious coexistence by considering safety\nprotocols, trajectory clarity, and pedestrian engagement. Lastly, we validate\nour algorithm's effectiveness and real-time performance through simulations and\nreal-world tests, demonstrating its ability to navigate with minimal pedestrian\ndisturbance in various environments.",

In this paper, we highlight\nthe inherent limitations of cross-validation when employed to discern the\nstructure of a Gaussian graphical model. We provide finite-sample bounds on the\nprobability that the Lasso estimator for the neighborhood of a node within a\nGaussian graphical model, optimized using a prediction oracle, misidentifies\nthe neighborhood. Our results pertain to both undirected and directed acyclic\ngraphs, encompassing general, sparse covariance structures. To support our\ntheoretical findings, we conduct an empirical investigation of this\ninconsistency by contrasting our outcomes with other commonly used information\ncriteria through an extensive simulation study. Given that many algorithms\ndesigned to learn the structure of graphical models require hyperparameter\nselection, the precise calibration of this hyperparameter is paramount for\naccurately estimating the inherent structure.

For each sensing\nplatform, pinpointing the optimal controls to enhance the sensor's precision\nremains a challenging task. While an analytical solution might be out of reach,\nmachine learning offers a promising avenue for many systems of interest,\nespecially given the capabilities of contemporary hardware. We have introduced\na versatile procedure capable of optimizing a wide range of problems in quantum\nmetrology, estimation, and hypothesis testing by combining model-aware\nreinforcement learning (RL) with Bayesian estimation based on particle\nfiltering. To achieve this, we had to address the challenge of incorporating\nthe many non-differentiable steps of the estimation in the training process,\nsuch as measurements and the resampling of the particle filter. Model-aware RL\nis a gradient-based method, where the derivatives of the sensor's precision are\nobtained through automatic differentiation (AD) in the simulation of the\nexperiment. Our approach is suitable for optimizing both non-adaptive and\nadaptive strategies, using neural networks or other agents. We provide an\nimplementation of this technique in the form of a Python library called\nqsensoropt, alongside several pre-made applications for relevant physical\nplatforms, namely NV centers, photonic circuits, and optical cavities. This\nlibrary will be released soon on PyPI. Leveraging our method, we've achieved\nresults for many examples that surpass the current state-of-the-art in\nexperimental design. In addition to Bayesian estimation, leveraging model-aware\nRL, it is also possible to find optimal controls for the minimization of the\nCram\\'er-Rao bound, based on Fisher information.",

Contrastive\nmethods are a prominent family of SSL that extract similar representations of\ntwo augmented views of an image while pushing away others in the representation\nspace as negatives. However, the state-of-the-art contrastive methods require\nlarge batch sizes and augmentations designed for natural images that are\nimpractical for 3D medical images. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnew longitudinal SSL method, 3DTINC, based on non-contrastive learning. It is\ndesigned to learn perturbation-invariant features for 3D optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) volumes, using augmentations specifically designed for OCT. We\nintroduce a new non-contrastive similarity loss term that learns temporal\ninformation implicitly from intra-patient scans acquired at different times.\nOur experiments show that this temporal information is crucial for predicting\nprogression of retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration\n(AMD). After pretraining with 3DTINC, we evaluated the learned representations\nand the prognostic models on two large-scale longitudinal datasets of retinal\nOCTs where we predict the conversion to wet-AMD within a six months interval.\nOur results demonstrate that each component of our contributions is crucial for\nlearning meaningful representations useful in predicting disease progression\nfrom longitudinal volumetric scans.",

Although lots of adversarial attack algorithms\nhave been developed, it is still challenging in the practical scenario that the\nmodel's parameters and architectures are inaccessible to the\nattacker/evaluator, i.e., black-box adversarial attacks. Due to the practical\nimportance, there has been rapid progress from recent algorithms, reflected by\nthe quick increase in attack success rate and the quick decrease in query\nnumbers to the target model. However, there is a lack of thorough evaluations\nand comparisons among these algorithms, causing difficulties of tracking the\nreal progress, analyzing advantages and disadvantages of different technical\nroutes, as well as designing future development roadmap of this field. Thus, in\nthis work, we aim at building a comprehensive benchmark of black-box\nadversarial attacks, called BlackboxBench. It mainly provides: 1) a unified,\nextensible and modular-based codebase, implementing 25 query-based attack\nalgorithms and 30 transfer-based attack algorithms; 2) comprehensive\nevaluations: we evaluate the implemented algorithms against several\nmainstreaming model architectures on 2 widely used datasets (CIFAR-10 and a\nsubset of ImageNet), leading to 14,106 evaluations in total; 3) thorough\nanalysis and new insights, as well analytical tools.

Our two calculations\nagree with each other and conclude that including the exact fermion mass\ncontribution typically increases the size of the NLO corrections. Moreover, we\nfind that the exact result converges slowly to the massless limit of the\nhigh-energy regime, thus emphasizing the importance of including the full mass\ndependence at NLO.

The disease is manifested by a drop in dopamine\nproduction, symptoms are cognitive and behavioural and include a wide range of\npersonality changes, depressive disorders, memory problems, and emotional\ndysregulation, which can occur as the disease progresses. Early diagnosis and\naccurate staging of the disease are essential to apply the appropriate\ntherapeutic approaches to slow cognitive and motor decline.\n  Currently, there is not a single blood test or biomarker available to\ndiagnose Parkinson's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging has been used for the\npast three decades to diagnose and distinguish between PD and other\nneurological conditions. However, in recent years new possibilities have\narisen: several AI algorithms have been developed to increase the precision and\naccuracy of differential diagnosis of PD at an early stage.\n  To our knowledge, no AI tools have been designed to identify the stage of\nprogression. This paper aims to fill this gap. Using the \"Parkinson's\nProgression Markers Initiative\" dataset, which reports the patient's MRI and an\nindication of the disease stage, we developed a model to identify the level of\nprogression. The images and the associated scores were used for training and\nassessing different deep-learning models. Our analysis distinguished four\ndistinct disease progression levels based on a standard scale (Hoehn and Yah\nscale). The final architecture consists of the cascading of a 3DCNN network,\nadopted to reduce and extract the spatial characteristics of the RMI for\nefficient training of the successive LSTM layers, aiming at modelling the\ntemporal dependencies among the data.\n  Our results show that the proposed 3DCNN + LSTM model achieves\nstate-of-the-art results by classifying the elements with 91.90\\% as macro\naveraged OVR AUC on four classes",

                "abstract": "The angular momentum of molecular cloud cores plays a key role in the star\nformation process. However, the evolution of the angular momentum of molecular\ncloud cores formed in magnetized molecular filaments is still unclear. In this\npaper, we perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations to reveal\nthe effect of the magnetic field on the evolution of the angular momentum of\nmolecular cloud cores formed through filament fragmentation. As a result, we\nfind that the angular momentum decreases by 30% and 50% at the mass scale of\n1Msun in the case of weak and strong magnetic field, respectively. By analyzing\nthe torques exerted on fluid elements, we identify the magnetic tension as the\ndominant process for angular momentum transfer for mass scales < 3Msun for the\nstrong magnetic field case. This critical mass scale can be understood\nsemi-analytically as the timescale of magnetic braking. We show that the\nanisotropy of the angular momentum transfer due to the presence of strong\nmagnetic field changes the resultant angular momentum of the core only by a\nfactor of two. We also find that the distribution of the angle between the\nrotation axis and the magnetic field does not show strong alignment even just\nbefore the first core formation. Our results also indicate that the variety of\nthe angular momentum of the cores are inherited from the difference of the\nphase of the initial turbulent velocity field. The variety could contribute to\nthe diversity in size and other properties of protoplanetary disks recently\nreported by observations.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Numerous point-cloud understanding techniques focus on whole entities and\nhave succeeded in obtaining satisfactory results and limited sparsity\ntolerance. However, these methods are generally sensitive to incomplete point\nclouds that are scanned with flaws or large gaps. To address this issue, in\nthis paper, we propose an end-to-end architecture that compensates for and\nidentifies partial point clouds on the fly. First, we propose a cascaded\nsolution that integrates both the upstream and downstream networks\nsimultaneously, allowing the task-oriented downstream to identify the points\ngenerated by the completion-oriented upstream. These two streams complement\neach other, resulting in improved performance for both completion and\ndownstream-dependent tasks. Second, to explicitly understand the predicted\npoints' pattern, we introduce hierarchical self-distillation (HSD), which can\nbe applied to arbitrary hierarchy-based point cloud methods. HSD ensures that\nthe deepest classifier with a larger perceptual field and longer code length\nprovides additional regularization to intermediate ones rather than simply\naggregating the multi-scale features, and therefore maximizing the mutual\ninformation between a teacher and students. We show the advantage of the\nself-distillation process in the hyperspaces based on the information\nbottleneck principle. On the classification task, our proposed method performs\ncompetitively on the synthetic dataset and achieves superior results on the\nchallenging real-world benchmark when compared to the state-of-the-art models.\nAdditional experiments also demonstrate the superior performance and generality\nof our framework on the part segmentation task.",

                "abstract": "We study a problem of designing replication-proof bandit mechanisms when\nagents strategically register or replicate their own arms to maximize their\npayoff. We consider Bayesian agents who are unaware of ex-post realization of\ntheir own arms' mean rewards, which is the first to study Bayesian extension of\nShin et al. (2022). This extension presents significant challenges in analyzing\nequilibrium, in contrast to the fully-informed setting by Shin et al. (2022)\nunder which the problem simply reduces to a case where each agent only has a\nsingle arm. With Bayesian agents, even in a single-agent setting, analyzing the\nreplication-proofness of an algorithm becomes complicated. Remarkably, we first\nshow that the algorithm proposed by Shin et al. (2022), defined H-UCB, is no\nlonger replication-proof for any exploration parameters. Then, we provide\nsufficient and necessary conditions for an algorithm to be replication-proof in\nthe single-agent setting. These results centers around several analytical\nresults in comparing the expected regret of multiple bandit instances, which\nmight be of independent interest. We further prove that exploration-then-commit\n(ETC) algorithm satisfies these properties, whereas UCB does not, which in fact\nleads to the failure of being replication-proof. We expand this result to\nmulti-agent setting, and provide a replication-proof algorithm for any problem\ninstance. The proof mainly relies on the single-agent result, as well as some\nstructural properties of ETC and the novel introduction of a restarting round,\nwhich largely simplifies the analysis while maintaining the regret unchanged\n(up to polylogarithmic factor). We finalize our result by proving its sublinear\nregret upper bound, which matches that of H-UCB.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Figure drawing is often used as part of dementia screening protocols. The\nSurvey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) has adopted three\ndrawing tests from Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III as part of its\nquestionnaire module on cognition. While the drawings are usually scored by\ntrained clinicians, SHARE uses the face-to-face interviewers who conduct the\ninterviews to score the drawings during fieldwork. This may pose a risk to data\nquality, as interviewers may be less consistent in their scoring and more\nlikely to make errors due to their lack of clinical training. This paper\ntherefore reports a first proof of concept and evaluates the feasibility of\nautomating scoring using deep learning. We train several different\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) models using about 2,000 drawings from the\n8th wave of the SHARE panel in Germany and the corresponding interviewer\nscores, as well as self-developed 'gold standard' scores. The results suggest\nthat this approach is indeed feasible. Compared to training on interviewer\nscores, models trained on the gold standard data improve prediction accuracy by\nabout 10 percentage points. The best performing model, ConvNeXt Base, achieves\nan accuracy of about 85%, which is 5 percentage points higher than the accuracy\nof the interviewers. While this is a promising result, the models still\nstruggle to score partially correct drawings, which are also problematic for\ninterviewers. This suggests that more and better training data is needed to\nachieve production-level prediction accuracy. We therefore discuss possible\nnext steps to improve the quality and quantity of training examples.",

The FGSM attack is simulated on three pre-trained image classifier\nCNN architectures, ResNet-101, AlexNet, and RegNetY 400MF using randomly chosen\nimages from the ImageNet dataset. The classification accuracies of the models\nare computed in the absence and presence of the attack to demonstrate the\ndetrimental effect of the attack on the performances of the classifiers.\nFinally, a mechanism is proposed to defend against the FGSM attack based on a\nmodified defensive distillation-based approach.

To\nsimplify the calculations, we employ the Karmarkar condition and derive a\ndifferential equation that establishes a relationship between two crucial\ncomponents of the spacetime namely $e^\\nu$ and $e^\\lambda$. Additionally, we\nincorporate the well-known Finch-Skea structure as the component representing\n$g_{rr}$ and subsequently find the resulting form of the component $g_{tt}$\nfrom the relation of metric functions to formulate the precise solutions for\nthe stellar structure. To assess the behavior of the anisotropic fluid and\nstability of the compact star, we use the observed values of mass and radius\nfor the compact star model $PSR J0437-4715$. The graphical analysis depicts\nthat the stellar structure possesses physical viability and exhibits intriguing\nproperties. Furthermore, we predicted the mass-radius relation along with the\nmaximum mass limit of several objects for different parameter values by\nassuming two different surface densities. It is discovered that the compactness\nrises when density increases.",

More and more recent works employ\ndifferent graph-based models for MPP, which have made considerable progress in\nimproving prediction performance.

For this\nsake, in this paper we propose a graph structure learning (GSL) based MPP\napproach, called GSL-MPP.

Finally, we use these molecular embeddings to\nperform MPP.

This research uniquely\ndelves into the varied efficacy of existing vaccines and the pivotal role of\nvaccination timing in the context of COVID-19. Departing from conventional\nmodeling, we introduce two models that account for the impact of vaccines on\ninfections, reinfections, and deaths. Recognizing the intricacy of these\nmodels, we use the Bayesian framework and specifically utilize the\nMetropolis-Hastings Sampler for estimation of model parameters. The study\nconducts scenario analyses on two models, quantifying the duration during which\nthe healthcare system in Qatar could have potentially been overwhelmed by an\ninflux of new COVID-19 cases surpassing the available hospital beds.\nAdditionally, the research explores similarities in predictive probability\ndistributions of cumulative infections, reinfections, and deaths, employing the\nHellinger distance metric. Comparative analysis, employing the Bayes factor,\nunderscores the plausibility of a model assuming a different susceptibility\nrate to reinfection, as opposed to assuming the same susceptibility rate for\nboth infections and reinfections. Results highlight the adverse outcomes\nassociated with delayed vaccination, emphasizing the efficacy of early\nvaccination in reducing infections, reinfections, and deaths.

In\nrecent years, several methods have been developed to address this problem.\nHowever, the need for more effective and specialized approaches grows with the\nproduction of graph data with diverse characteristics. In particular,\nreal-world multiplex graphs may exhibit a high number of dimensions, making it\ndifficult to construct a single consensus representation. Furthermore,\nimportant information can be hidden in complex latent structures scattered in\nmultiple dimensions. To address these issues, we propose HMGE, a novel\nembedding method based on hierarchical aggregation for high-dimensional\nmultiplex graphs. Hierarchical aggregation consists of learning a hierarchical\ncombination of the graph dimensions and refining the embeddings at each\nhierarchy level. Non-linear combinations are computed from previous ones, thus\nuncovering complex information and latent structures hidden in the multiplex\ngraph dimensions. Moreover, we leverage mutual information maximization between\nlocal patches and global summaries to train the model without supervision.

                "abstract": "The optimization problem associated to fitting two-layer ReLU networks having\n$d$~inputs, $k$~neurons, and labels generated by a target network, is\nconsidered. Two categories of infinite families of minima, giving one minimum\nper $d$ and $k$, were recently found. The loss at minima belonging to the first\ncategory converges to zero as $d$ increases. In the second category, the loss\nremains bounded away from zero. That being so, how may one avoid minima\nbelonging to the latter category? Fortunately, such minima are never detected\nby standard optimization methods. Motivated by questions concerning the nature\nof this phenomenon, we develop methods to study distinctive analytic properties\nof hidden minima.\n  By existing analyses, the Hessian spectrum of both categories agree modulus\n$O(d^{-1/2})$-terms -- not promising. Thus, rather, our investigation proceeds\nby studying curves along which the loss is minimized or maximized, referred to\nas tangency arcs. We prove that pure, seemingly remote, group\nrepresentation-theoretic considerations concerning the arrangement of subspaces\ninvariant to the action of subgroups of $S_d$, the symmetry group over $d$\nsymbols, relative to ones fixed by the action yield a precise description of\nall finitely many admissible types of tangency arcs. The general results\napplied for the loss function reveal that arcs emanating from hidden minima\ndiffer, characteristically, by their structure and symmetry, precisely on\naccount of the $O(d^{-1/2})$-eigenvalue terms absent in previous work,\nindicating the subtly of the analysis.

                "abstract": "This paper studies modulation spectrum features ($\\Phi$) and mel-frequency\ncepstral coefficients ($\\Psi$) in joint speaker diarization and identification\n(JSID). JSID is important as speaker diarization on its own to distinguish\nspeakers is insufficient for many applications, it is often necessary to\nidentify speakers as well. Machine learning models are set up using\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) on $\\Phi$ and recurrent neural networks\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ long short-term memory (LSTMs) on $\\Psi$, then concatenating\ninto fully connected layers.\n  Experiment 1 shows models on both $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ have better diarization\nerror rates (DERs) than models on either alone; a CNN on $\\Phi$ has DER\n29.09\\%, compared to 27.78\\% for a LSTM on $\\Psi$ and 19.44\\% for a model on\nboth. Experiment 1 also investigates aleatoric uncertainties and shows the\nmodel on both $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ has mean entropy 0.927~bits (out of 4~bits) for\ncorrect predictions compared to 1.896~bits for incorrect predictions which,\nalong with entropy histogram shapes, shows the model helpfully indicates where\nit is uncertain.\n  Experiment 2 investigates epistemic uncertainties as well as aleatoric using\nMonte Carlo dropout (MCD). It compares models on both $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ with\nmodels trained on x-vectors ($X$), before applying Kalman filter smoothing on\nepistemic uncertainties for resegmentation and model ensembles. While the two\nmodels on $X$ (DERs 10.23\\% and 9.74\\%) outperform those on $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$\n(DER 17.85\\%) after their individual Kalman filter smoothing, combining them\nusing a Kalman filter smoothing method improves the DER to 9.29\\%. Aleatoric\nuncertainties are higher for incorrect predictions.\n  Both Experiments show models on $\\Phi$ do not distinguish overlapping\nspeakers as well as anticipated. However, Experiment 2 shows model ensembles do\nbetter with overlapping speakers than individual models do.",

                "abstract": "First principles-based predictions of lattice thermal conductivity (TC) from\nperturbation theory have achieved significant success. In general, it only\nincludes three-phonon (3ph) scattering. However, recent studies have revealed\nthat four-phonon (4ph) scattering, treated under single-mode relaxation time\napproximation (RTA), has a comparable impact to 3ph scattering at medium and\nhigh temperatures in various materials, particularly in two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials. Nonetheless, the influence of 4ph scattering on TC at low\ntemperatures has not been explored so far, owing to the assumption that 4ph\nprocesses are generally insignificant at low temperatures. By combining the\nfirst-principles calculations, machine learning techniques, Boltzmann transport\nequation (BTE), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that there are\nunusually strong 4ph processes in the low-frequency range of 2D materials such\nas h-XN (X=B, Al, Ga), which have remarkable influence on the low-temperature\nTC. We also find that the strong 4ph processes are originated from the flexural\nout-of-plane acoustic (ZA) phonon mode of 2D materials. We further discover the\nremarkable normal (N) processes of 4ph scattering in 2D materials, which make\nthe conventionally adopted perturbation methods for TC calculation far from\nsufficient at low temperatures. Finally, we find that the intensity of 4ph\nscattering and thus TC can be effectively manipulated by changing the\ndispersion of ZA phonon mode, which can be easily achieved through strain\nengineering. Our study provides new insights into low-temperature phonon\ntransport and its manipulation in 2D materials.",

This\nmotivates us to investigate lower bounds of the outage threshold, and it is\nfound that the one derived from the Chernoff inequality (named Cher-LB) is the\nmost effective lower bound.

We evaluate the effectiveness of\nFairCompass for fairness auditing in a real-world scenario, and the findings\ndemonstrate the system's potential for real-world deployability.

Here equivalence in law does not capture relevant properties of\nprocesses such as the solutions to stochastic control or multistage decision\nproblems. This motivates Aldous to introduce the stronger notion of synonymity\nbased on prediction processes. Stronger still, Hoover--Keisler formalize what\nit means that $X^i$, $i=1,2$ have the same probabilistic properties. We\nestablish that canonical representatives of the Hoover--Keisler equivalence\nclasses are given precisely by the set of all Markov-martingale laws on a\nspecific nested path space $\\mathsf M_\\infty$. As a consequence we obtain that,\nmodulo Hoover--Keisler equivalence, the class of stochastic processes forms a\nPolish space.\n  On this space, processes are topologically close iff they model similar\nprobabilistic phenomena.

This paper describes a novel dynamic model of tissue\nelectroporation which also includes tissue dispersion and temperature. We\ndescribed the biological dispersion of potato tubers in a commercial finite\nelement method software. A cell electroporation model was adapted to account\nfor the increase in tissue conductivity. The model yielded twelve parameters,\ndivided into three dynamic states of electroporation. Thermal analysis\ndescribes the dependence of tissue conductivity on temperature. The model\nparameters were evaluated through experiments with vegetal tissue (Solanum\ntuberosum) under electrochemotherapy protocols. The proposed model can\naccurately predict the conductivity of tissue under electroporation from 10\nkV/m to 100 kV/m. A negligible thermal effect was observed at 100 kV/m, with a\n0.89 {\\deg}C increase.

On the scientific side, comparing the HAP's capabilities to\nsingle-hydrophone and nonspatialized recordings yields new insights into the\nspatial information that allows animals to thrive in complex acoustic\nenvironments.

Popular multi-modal learning\napproach Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) has popularized\ncontrastive symmetric loss using batch construction technique by applying it to\nmulti-modal domains of text and image. We apply this approach to the domains of\n2D image and 3D LiDAR points on the task of cross-modal localization. Our\nmethod is explained as follows: A batch of N (image, LiDAR) pairs is\nconstructed so as to predict what is the right match between N X N possible\npairings across the batch by jointly training an image encoder and LiDAR\nencoder to learn a multi-modal embedding space. In this way, the cosine\nsimilarity between N positive pairings is maximized, whereas that between the\nremaining negative pairings is minimized. Finally, over the obtained similarity\nscores, a symmetric cross-entropy loss is optimized. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to apply batched loss approach to a\ncross-modal setting of image & LiDAR data and also to show Zero-shot transfer\nin a visual localization setting. We conduct extensive analyses on standard\nautonomous driving datasets such as KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art recall@1 accuracy on the KITTI-360 dataset by\n22.4%, using only perspective images, in contrast to the state-of-the-art\napproach, which utilizes the more informative fisheye images. Additionally,\nthis superior performance is achieved without resorting to complex\narchitectures. Moreover, we demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of our model\nand we beat SOTA by 8% without even training on it. Furthermore, we establish\nthe first benchmark for cross-modal localization on the KITTI dataset.",

We solve the spring optimal\ncontrol problem and obtain analytical expressions for the impulses, the\ndurations of the zero control intervals and the singular control, which are the\nelements composing the optimal pulse sequence. We also derive suboptimal\nsolutions for the spring problem, one with less impulses than the optimal and\nothers with smoother polynomial controls. We then apply the solutions derived\nfor the spring system to the original system, and compare the population\ntransfer efficiency with that obtained for the original system using numerical\noptimal control. For all dissipation rates used, the efficiency of the optimal\nspring control approaches that of the numerical optimal solution for longer\ndurations, with the approach accomplished earlier for smaller decay rates. The\nefficiency achieved with the suboptimal spring control with less impulses is\nvery close to that of the optimal spring control in all cases, while that\nobtained with polynomial controls lies below, and this is the price paid for\nnot using impulses, which can quickly build a nonzero population in the\nintermediate state.

We proposed a non-linear model\npredictive control (NMPC) based visual servoing to achieves the desired\nautonomous docking task. The proposed method is implemented on a four-wheel\nelectric wheelchair platform, with two independent rear driving wheels and two\nfront castor wheels. The NMPC-based visual servoing technique leverages the\ninformation extracted from a visual sensor as a real-time feedback for the NMPC\nto control the motion of the vehicle achieving the desired autonomous docking\ntask. To evaluate the performance of the proposed controller method, a number\nof experiments both in simulation and in the actual setting. The controller\nperformance is then evaluated based on the controller design requirement. The\nsimulation results on autonomous docking experiments show that the proposed\ncontroller has been successfully achieve the desired controller design\nrequirement to generate realtime trajectory for the vehicle performing\nautonomous docking tasks in several different scenarios.",

To shelter the covert\ncommunications, Alice transmits additional dual-functional artificial noise\n(DFAN) with a varying power not only to create uncertainty at Willie's signal\nreception to confuse Willie but also to sense the targets simultaneously. Based\non this framework, the weighted sum of the sensing beampattern means square\nerror (MSE) and cross correlation is minimized by jointly optimizing the covert\ncommunication and DFAN signals subject to the minimum covert rate requirement.\nThe robust design considers both cases of imperfect Willie's CSI (WCSI) and\nstatistical WCSI. Under the worst-case assumption that Willie can adaptively\nadjust the detection threshold to achieve the best detection performance, the\nminimum detection error probability (DEP) at Willie is analytically derived in\nthe closed-form expression.

To elucidate the long-living bi-soliton complex\nnature we apply an analytical-numerical approach based on the perturbation\ntheory and the inverse scattering transform (IST) for the one-dimensional\nfocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation model. We observe a periodic energy\nand momentum exchange between solitons and continuous spectrum radiation\nresulting in repetitive oscillations of the coherent structure. We find that\nsoliton eigenvalues oscillate on stable trajectories experiencing a slight\ndrift on a scale of hundreds of the structure oscillation periods so that the\neigenvalue dynamic is in good agreement with predictions of the IST\nperturbation theory.

                "abstract": "In today's urban landscape, traffic congestion poses a critical challenge,\nespecially during outlier scenarios. These outliers can indicate abrupt traffic\npeaks, drops, or irregular trends, often arising from factors such as\naccidents, events, or roadwork. Moreover, Given the dynamic nature of traffic,\nthe need for real-time traffic modeling also becomes crucial to ensure accurate\nand up-to-date traffic predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce\nthe Outlier Weighted Autoencoder Modeling (OWAM) framework. OWAM employs\nautoencoders for local outlier detection and generates correlation scores to\nassess neighboring traffic's influence. These scores serve as a weighted factor\nfor neighboring sensors, before fusing them into the model. This information\nenhances the traffic model's performance and supports effective real-time\nupdates, a crucial aspect for capturing dynamic traffic patterns. OWAM\ndemonstrates a favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, rendering\nit highly suitable for real-world applications. The research findings\ncontribute significantly to the development of more efficient and adaptive\ntraffic prediction models, advancing the field of transportation management for\nthe future.

We have studied theoretically a single\n$S$-$T_{0}$ qubit in free induction decay and spin echo experiments. We have\nobtained analytical expressions for time dependence of components of its Bloch\nvector for quasistatical fluctuations of $\\Delta B_{z}$ and quasistatical or\ndynamical $1/f^{\\beta}$-type fluctuations of $J$. We have then considered the\nimpact of fluctuations of these parameters on the efficiency of the entangling\nprocedure which uses an Ising-type coupling between two $S$-$T_{0}$ qubits.\nParticularly, we have obtained an analytical expression for evolution of two\nqubits affected by $1/f^{\\beta}$-type fluctuations of $J$. This expression\nindicates the maximal level of entanglement that can be generated by performing\nthe entangling procedure. Our results deliver also an evidence that in the\nabove-mentioned experiment, the $S$-$T_{0}$ qubits were affected by\nuncorrelated $1/f^{\\beta}$ charge noises.",

In this paper, we reveal that the inherent\nlinear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem of a moving agent can be reconstructed\nbased on its trajectory observations only, which enables one to learn the\noptimal control law of the agent autonomously. Specifically, the reconstruction\nof the optimization problem requires estimation of three unknown parameters\nincluding the target state, weighting matrices in the objective function and\nthe control horizon. Our algorithm considers two types of objective function\nsettings and identifies the weighting matrices with proposed novel inverse\noptimal control methods, providing the well-posedness and identifiability\nproof. We obtain the optimal estimate of the control horizon using binary\nsearch and finally reconstruct the LQR problem with above estimates. The\nstrength of learning control law with optimization problem recovery lies in\nless computation consumption and strong generalization ability.

                "abstract": "Long-range interactions are essential for the correct description of complex\nsystems in many scientific fields. The price to pay for including them in the\ncalculations, however, is a dramatic increase in the overall computational\ncosts. Recently, deep graph networks have been employed as efficient,\ndata-driven surrogate models for predicting properties of complex systems\nrepresented as graphs. These models rely on a local and iterative message\npassing strategy that should, in principle, capture long-range information\nwithout explicitly modeling the corresponding interactions. In practice, most\ndeep graph networks cannot really model long-range dependencies due to the\nintrinsic limitations of (synchronous) message passing, namely oversmoothing,\noversquashing, and underreaching. This work proposes a general framework that\nlearns to mitigate these limitations: within a variational inference framework,\nwe endow message passing architectures with the ability to freely adapt their\ndepth and filter messages along the way. With theoretical and empirical\narguments, we show that this simple strategy better captures long-range\ninteractions, by surpassing the state of the art on five node and graph\nprediction datasets suited for this problem. Our approach consistently improves\nthe performances of the baselines tested on these tasks.

                "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to recommend the most suitable items to users from a\nlarge number of candidates. Their computation cost grows as the number of user\nrequests and the complexity of services (or models) increases. Under the\nlimitation of computation resources (CRs), how to make a trade-off between\ncomputation cost and business revenue becomes an essential question. The\nexisting studies focus on dynamically allocating CRs in queue truncation\nscenarios (i.e., allocating the size of candidates), and formulate the CR\nallocation problem as an optimization problem with constraints. Some of them\nfocus on single-phase CR allocation, and others focus on multi-phase CR\nallocation but introduce some assumptions about queue truncation scenarios.\nHowever, these assumptions do not hold in other scenarios, such as retrieval\nchannel selection and prediction model selection. Moreover, existing studies\nignore the state transition process of requests between different phases,\nlimiting the effectiveness of their approaches.\n  This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based Multi-Phase\nComputation Allocation approach (RL-MPCA), which aims to maximize the total\nbusiness revenue under the limitation of CRs. RL-MPCA formulates the CR\nallocation problem as a Weakly Coupled MDP problem and solves it with an\nRL-based approach. Specifically, RL-MPCA designs a novel deep Q-network to\nadapt to various CR allocation scenarios, and calibrates the Q-value by\nintroducing multiple adaptive Lagrange multipliers (adaptive-$\\lambda$) to\navoid violating the global CR constraints. Finally, experiments on the offline\nsimulation environment and online real-world recommender system validate the\neffectiveness of our approach.",

One such manifestation is majority label bias, which arises when the\ndistribution of labeled examples in the in-context samples is skewed towards\none or more specific classes making Large Language Models (LLMs) more prone to\npredict those labels. Such discrepancies can arise from various factors,\nincluding logistical constraints, inherent biases in data collection methods,\nlimited access to diverse data sources, etc. which are unavoidable in a\nreal-world industry setup. In this work, we study the robustness of in-context\nlearning in LLMs to shifts that occur due to majority label bias within the\npurview of text classification tasks. Prior works have shown that in-context\nlearning with LLMs is susceptible to such biases. In our study, we go one level\ndeeper and show that the robustness boundary varies widely for different models\nand tasks, with certain LLMs being highly robust (~90%) to majority label bias.\nAdditionally, our findings also highlight the impact of model size and the\nrichness of instructional prompts contributing towards model robustness.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) ushered in a new era of machine learning with\ninterconnected datasets. While traditional neural networks can only be trained\non independent samples, GNN allows for the inclusion of inter-sample\ninteractions in the training process. This gain, however, incurs additional\nmemory cost, rendering most GNNs unscalable for real-world applications\ninvolving vast and complicated networks with tens of millions of nodes (e.g.,\nsocial circles, web graphs, and brain graphs). This means that storing the\ngraph in the main memory can be difficult, let alone training the GNN model\nwith significantly less GPU memory. While much of the recent literature has\nfocused on either mini-batching GNN methods or quantization, graph reduction\nmethods remain largely scarce. Furthermore, present graph reduction approaches\nhave several drawbacks. First, most graph reduction focuses only on the\ninference stage (e.g., condensation and distillation) and requires full graph\nGNN training, which does not reduce training memory footprint. Second, many\nmethods focus solely on the graph's structural aspect, ignoring the initial\npopulation feature-label distribution, resulting in a skewed post-reduction\nlabel distribution. Here, we propose a Feature-Label COnstrained graph Net\ncollapse, FALCON, to address these limitations. Our three core contributions\nlie in (i) designing FALCON, a topology-aware graph reduction technique that\npreserves feature-label distribution; (ii) implementation of FALCON with other\nmemory reduction methods (i.e., mini-batched GNN and quantization) for further\nmemory reduction; (iii) extensive benchmarking and ablation studies against\nSOTA methods to evaluate FALCON memory reduction. Our extensive results show\nthat FALCON can significantly collapse various public datasets while achieving\nequal prediction quality across GNN models. Code:\nhttps://github.com/basiralab/FALCON",

The famous zero-threshold case was solved in the sixties of the\nlast century (see, \\cite{Wendel62,Winder,Cover65}) through the high-dimensional\ncombinatorial considerations. The general threshold, $\\kappa$, case though\nturned out to be much harder and stayed out of reach for the following several\ndecades. A substantial progress was then made in \\cite{SchTir02} and\n\\cite{StojnicGardGen13} where the \\emph{positive} threshold ($\\kappa\\geq 0$)\nscenario was finally fully settled. While the negative counterpart ($\\kappa\\leq\n0$) remained out of reach, \\cite{StojnicGardGen13} did show that the random\nduality theory (RDT) is still powerful enough to provide excellent upper\nbounds. Moreover, in \\cite{StojnicGardSphNeg13}, a \\emph{partially lifted} RDT\nvariant was considered and it was shown that the upper bounds of\n\\cite{StojnicGardGen13} can be lowered. After recent breakthroughs in studying\nbilinearly indexed (bli) random processes in\n\\cite{Stojnicsflgscompyx23,Stojnicnflgscompyx23}, \\emph{fully lifted} random\nduality theory (fl RDT) was developed in \\cite{Stojnicflrdt23}. We here first\nshow that the \\emph{negative spherical perceptrons} can be fitted into the\nframe of the fl RDT and then employ the whole fl RDT machinery to characterize\nthe capacity. To be fully practically operational, the fl RDT requires a\nsubstantial numerical work. We, however, uncover remarkable closed form\nanalytical relations among key lifting parameters. Such a discovery enables\nperforming the needed numerical calculations to obtain concrete capacity\nvalues. We also observe that an excellent convergence (with the relative\nimprovement $\\sim 0.1\\%$) is achieved already on the third (second non-trivial)\nlevel of the \\emph{stationarized} full lifting.",

Although deep ReLU networks can approximate polynomials effectively, deep\nReLU$^k$ networks have the capability to represent higher-degree polynomials\nprecisely. Our initial contribution is a comprehensive, constructive proof for\npolynomial representation using deep ReLU$^k$ networks. This allows us to\nestablish an upper bound on both the size and count of network parameters.\nConsequently, we are able to demonstrate a suboptimal approximation rate for\nfunctions from Sobolev spaces as well as for analytic functions. Additionally,\nthrough an exploration of the representation power of deep ReLU$^k$ networks\nfor shallow networks, we reveal that deep ReLU$^k$ networks can approximate\nfunctions from a range of variation spaces, extending beyond those generated\nsolely by the ReLU$^k$ activation function. This finding demonstrates the\nadaptability of deep ReLU$^k$ networks in approximating functions within\nvarious variation spaces.",

In the literature, several algorithms were\nproposed to approximately compute the capacity of a discrete memoryless\nchannel, being an analytical solution unavailable for the general discrete\nmemoryless channel. This paper presents a novel approach to compute the\ncapacity, which is based on a continuous-time dynamical system. Such a\ndynamical system can indeed be regarded as a continuous-time version of the\nBlahut-Arimoto algorithm. In fact, the updating map appearing in the\nBlahut-Arimoto algorithm is here obtained as a suitable discretization of the\nvector flow presented, using an analogy with some game-theoretical models.\nFinally, this analogy suggests a high-level hardware circuit design enabling\nanalog computation to estimate the capacity.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is a challenging task in many\nreal-world non-stationary dynamic scenarios. In addition to intra-series\ntemporal signals, the inter-series dependency also plays a crucial role in\nshaping future trends. How to enable the model's awareness of dependency\ninformation has raised substantial research attention. Previous approaches have\neither presupposed dependency constraints based on domain knowledge or imposed\nthem using real-time feature similarity. However, MTS data often exhibit both\nenduring long-term static relationships and transient short-term interactions,\nwhich mutually influence their evolving states. It is necessary to recognize\nand incorporate the complementary dependencies for more accurate MTS\nprediction. The frequency information in time series reflects the evolutionary\nrules behind complex temporal dynamics, and different frequency components can\nbe used to well construct long-term and short-term interactive dependency\nstructures between variables. To this end, we propose FCDNet, a concise yet\neffective framework for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically,\nFCDNet overcomes the above limitations by applying two light-weight dependency\nconstructors to help extract long- and short-term dependency information\nadaptively from multi-level frequency patterns. With the growth of input\nvariables, the number of trainable parameters in FCDNet only increases\nlinearly, which is conducive to the model's scalability and avoids\nover-fitting. Additionally, adopting a frequency-based perspective can\neffectively mitigate the influence of noise within MTS data, which helps\ncapture more genuine dependencies. The experimental results on six real-world\ndatasets from multiple fields show that FCDNet significantly exceeds strong\nbaselines, with an average improvement of 6.82% on MAE, 4.98% on RMSE, and\n4.91% on MAPE.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Masked time series modeling has recently gained much attention as a\nself-supervised representation learning strategy for time series. Inspired by\nmasked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and\npartially mask out time series, and then train Transformers to capture the\ndependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked\npatches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be\nan optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning\nto embed patches independently results in better time series representations.\nSpecifically, we propose to use 1) the simple patch reconstruction task, which\nautoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and 2) the simple\npatch-wise MLP that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce\ncomplementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time\nseries information efficiently. Our proposed method improves time series\nforecasting and classification performance compared to state-of-the-art\nTransformer-based models, while it is more efficient in terms of the number of\nparameters and training/inference time.

Previous methods that use implicit neural\nrepresentations to recover the geometry of a generic hand-held object from\nmulti-view images achieved compelling results in the visible part of the\nobject. However, these methods falter in accurately capturing the shape within\nthe hand-object contact region due to occlusion. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method that deals with surface reconstruction under occlusion by\nincorporating priors of 2D occlusion elucidation and physical contact\nconstraints. For the former, we introduce an object amodal completion network\nto infer the 2D complete mask of objects under occlusion. To ensure the\naccuracy and view consistency of the predicted 2D amodal masks, we devise a\njoint optimization method for both amodal mask refinement and 3D\nreconstruction. For the latter, we impose penetration and attraction\nconstraints on the local geometry in contact regions. We evaluate our approach\non HO3D and HOD datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction surface quality, with an\nimprovement of $52\\%$ on HO3D and $20\\%$ on HOD.

While the first\nsub-path is mandatory for hierarchical feature learning, the other is optimized\nto incur minimal performance degradation even if it is skipped. Unlike previous\nadaptive networks, our approach does not iteratively self-distill a fixed set\nof sub-networks, resulting in significantly shorter training time. However,\nonce deployed on devices, it can instantly construct sub-networks of varying\ndepths to provide various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs in a single model. We\nprovide a formal rationale for why the proposed architectural pattern and\ntraining method can reduce overall prediction errors while minimizing the\nimpact of skipping selected sub-paths.

A\nconstraint criterion based on heat release rate is then employed to remove the\nnonphysical perturbed states for improved accuracy.Without specific tuning,\nthree DNNs are consistently trained for three representative fuels, i.e.,\nhydrogen, ethylene and Jet-A. Comprehensive validations are conducted using 1-D\nlaminar flames and two typical turbulent premixed flames. The DNN model\npredictions on various physical characteristics, including laminar and\nturbulent flame speeds, dynamic flame structures influenced by\nturbulence-chemistry interactions, and conditional scalar profiles, all exhibit\ngood agreement with the results obtained from direct integration. This\ndemonstrates the exceptional accuracy and generalisation ability of the\nproposed DNN approach.

For high-mobility environments, severe Doppler shifts cause the\nCFO to extend well beyond the subcarrier spacing. Traditional algorithms\ngenerally estimate the integer and fractional parts of the CFO separately,\nwhich is time-consuming and requires high additional computations. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a Chinese remainder theorem-based CFO Maximum\nLikelihood Estimation (CCMLE) approach for jointly estimating the integer and\nfractional parts. With CCMLE, the MLE of the CFO can be obtained directly from\nmultiple estimates of sequences with varying lengths. This approach can achieve\na wide estimation range up to the total number of subcarriers, without\nsignificant additional computations. Furthermore, we show that the CCMLE can\napproach the Cram$\\acute{\\text{e}}$r-Rao Bound (CRB), and give an analytic\nexpression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold approaching the CRB,\nenabling an efficient waveform design. Accordingly, a parameter configuration\nguideline for the CCMLE is presented to achieve a better MSE performance and a\nlower SNR threshold.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "High precision mapping of H2O megamaser emissions from active galaxies have\nrevealed more than a dozen of Keplerian H2O aser disks that enable a ~4% Hubble\nconstant measurement and provide accurate black hole masses. The maser disks\nthat allow for these important astrophysical applications usually display clear\ninner and outer edges at sub-parsec scales. It is still unclear what causes\nthese boundaries and how their radii are determined. To understand whether the\nphysical conditions favorable for population inversion of H2O molecules can\ndetermine the inner and outer radii of a maser disk, we examine the\ndistributions of gas density and X-ray heating rate in a warped molecular disk\ndescribed by power-law surface density profile. With a suitable choice of the\ndisk mass, we find that the outer radius R_out of the maser disk predicted from\nour model can match the observed value, with R_out mainly determined by the\nmaximum heating rate or the minimum density for efficient maser action,\ndepending on the combination of the Eddington ratio, black hole mass and disk\nmass. Our analysis also suggests that the inner edge of a maser disk often lie\nclose to the dust sublimation radius, suggesting that the physical conditions\nof the dusts may play a role in defining inner boundary of the disk. Finally,\nour model predicts that H2O \"gigamaser\" disks could possibly exist at the\ncenter of high-z quasars, with disk size of >~10-30 pc.",

There is a dire need to\nobserve learners' behavior in these online courses, similar to what instructors\ndo in a face-to-face classroom. Learners' strategies and activities become\ncrucial to understanding their behavior. One major challenge in online courses\nis predicting and preventing dropout behavior. While several studies have tried\nto perform such analysis, there is still a shortage of studies that employ\ndifferent data streams to understand and predict the drop rates. Moreover,\nstudies rarely use a fully online team-based collaborative environment as their\ncontext. Thus, the current study employs an online longitudinal problem-based\nlearning (PBL) collaborative robotics competition as the testbed. Through\nmethodological triangulation, the study aims to predict dropout behavior via\nthe contributions of Discourse discussion forum 'activities' of participating\nteams, along with a self-reported Online Learning Strategies Questionnaire\n(OSLQ). The study also uses Qualitative interviews to enhance the ground truth\nand results. The OSLQ data is collected from more than 4000 participants.\nFurthermore, the study seeks to establish the reliability of OSLQ to advance\nresearch within online environments. Various Machine Learning algorithms are\napplied to analyze the data.

DLOT offers customizable time\nintervals, cross-platform compatibility, and data saving and sharing options.\nThe tool empowers observers to log timestamped data and is available on GitHub.\nThe DLOT was validated through two studies. The first study predicted students'\naffective states using real-time annotations collected via DLOT, observing 30\nstudents in each class.

Traditional MTNN training faces\nchallenges in managing conflicting loss gradients, often yielding sub-optimal\nperformance. The proposed alternate training method updates shared and\ntask-specific weights alternately, exploiting the multi-head architecture of\nthe model. This approach reduces computational costs, enhances training\nregularization, and improves generalization. Convergence properties similar to\nthose of the classical stochastic gradient method are established. Empirical\nexperiments demonstrate delayed overfitting, improved prediction, and reduced\ncomputational demands. In summary, our alternate training procedures offer a\npromising advancement for the training of hard-parameter sharing MTNNs.",

                "abstract": "Real-world datasets may contain multiple features that explain the training\ndata equally well, i.e., learning any of them would lead to correct predictions\non the training data. However, many of them can be spurious, i.e., lose their\npredictive power under a distribution shift and fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recently developed ``diversification'' methods\napproach this problem by finding multiple diverse hypotheses that rely on\ndifferent features. This paper aims to study this class of methods and identify\nthe key components contributing to their OOD generalization abilities.\n  We show that (1) diversification methods are highly sensitive to the\ndistribution of the unlabeled data used for diversification and can\nunderperform significantly when away from a method-specific sweet spot. (2)\nDiversification alone is insufficient for OOD generalization. The choice of the\nused learning algorithm, e.g., the model's architecture and pretraining, is\ncrucial, and using the second-best choice leads to an up to 20% absolute drop\nin accuracy.(3) The optimal choice of learning algorithm depends on the\nunlabeled data, and vice versa.Finally, we show that the above pitfalls cannot\nbe alleviated by increasing the number of diverse hypotheses, allegedly the\nmajor feature of diversification methods.\n  These findings provide a clearer understanding of the critical design factors\ninfluencing the OOD generalization of diversification methods. They can guide\npractitioners in how to use the existing methods best and guide researchers in\ndeveloping new, better ones.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "A key goal of current mechanistic interpretability research in NLP is to find\nlinear features (also called \"feature vectors\") for transformers: directions in\nactivation space corresponding to concepts that are used by a given model in\nits computation. Present state-of-the-art methods for finding linear features\nrequire large amounts of labelled data -- both laborious to acquire and\ncomputationally expensive to utilize. In this work, we introduce a novel\nmethod, called \"observable propagation\" (in short: ObsProp), for finding linear\nfeatures used by transformer language models in computing a given task -- using\nalmost no data. Our paradigm centers on the concept of observables, linear\nfunctionals corresponding to given tasks. We then introduce a mathematical\ntheory for the analysis of feature vectors: we provide theoretical motivation\nfor why LayerNorm nonlinearities do not affect the direction of feature\nvectors; we also introduce a similarity metric between feature vectors called\nthe coupling coefficient which estimates the degree to which one feature's\noutput correlates with another's. We use ObsProp to perform extensive\nqualitative investigations into several tasks, including gendered occupational\nbias, political party prediction, and programming language detection. Our\nresults suggest that ObsProp surpasses traditional approaches for finding\nfeature vectors in the low-data regime, and that ObsProp can be used to better\nunderstand the mechanisms responsible for bias in large language models.

On such scales, the statistical\nsensitivity of optical surveys is also limited by their finite sky coverage. By\ncontrast, gravitational wave (GW) sources appear to be relatively free of these\nissues, provided the angular sensitivity of GW experiments can be accurately\ncharacterized. We quantify the expected cosmological information gain from\ncombining the forecast LSST 3$\\times$2pt analysis (combination of three 2-point\ncorrelations of galaxy density and weak lensing shear fields) with the\nlarge-scale auto-correlation of GW sources from proposed next-generation GW\nexperiments. We find that in $\\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM models, there is no\nsignificant improvement in cosmological constraints from combining GW with LSST\n3$\\times$2pt over LSST alone, due to the large shot noise for the former;\nhowever, this combination does enable a $\\sim6\\%$ constraint on the linear\ngalaxy bias of GW sources. More interestingly, the optical-GW data combination\nprovides tight constraints on models with primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), due\nto the predicted scale-dependent bias in PNG models on large scales. Assuming\nthat the largest angular scales that LSST will probe are comparable to those in\nStage III surveys ($\\ell_{\\rm min}\\sim50$), the inclusion of next-generation GW\nmeasurements could improve constraints on the PNG parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$ by up\nto a factor of $\\simeq6.6$ compared to LSST alone, yielding $\\sigma(f_{\\rm\nNL})=8.5$.

Yet, existing models\noften fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously\ncommunicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce\nSocial-Transmotion, a generic model that exploits the power of transformers to\nhandle diverse and numerous visual cues, capturing the multi-modal nature of\nhuman behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can\nbe a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes or body poses.\nThis, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory\nprediction. Our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing\nspatiotemporal interactions between pedestrians based on the available visual\ncues, whether they are poses, bounding boxes, or a combination thereof. By the\nmasking technique, we ensure our model's effectiveness even when certain visual\ncues are unavailable, although performance is further boosted with the presence\nof comprehensive visual data. We delve into the merits of using 2d versus 3d\nposes, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and\ntemporal attention map to identify which keypoints and frames of poses are\nvital for optimizing human trajectory prediction.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Quantifying the uncertainty of predictions is a core problem in modern\nstatistics. Methods for predictive inference have been developed under a\nvariety of assumptions, often -- for instance, in standard conformal prediction\n-- relying on the invariance of the distribution of the data under special\ngroups of transformations such as permutation groups. Moreover, many existing\nmethods for predictive inference aim to predict unobserved outcomes in\nsequences of feature-outcome observations. Meanwhile, there is interest in\npredictive inference under more general observation models (e.g., for partially\nobserved features) and for data satisfying more general distributional\nsymmetries (e.g., rotationally invariant or coordinate-independent observations\nin physics). Here we propose SymmPI, a methodology for predictive inference\nwhen data distributions have general group symmetries in arbitrary observation\nmodels. Our methods leverage the novel notion of distributional equivariant\ntransformations, which process the data while preserving their distributional\ninvariances. We show that SymmPI has valid coverage under distributional\ninvariance and characterize its performance under distribution shift,\nrecovering recent results as special cases. We apply SymmPI to predict\nunobserved values associated to vertices in a network, where the distribution\nis unchanged under relabelings that keep the network structure unchanged. In\nseveral simulations in a two-layer hierarchical model, and in an empirical data\nanalysis example, SymmPI performs favorably compared to existing methods.",

Combining these specific heat data with existing\nlongitudinal thermopower data measuring the entropy in the clean limit we find\nthat, unless a phase transition/crossover gives rise to large specific heat\nanomaly, both datasets point towards a large effective mass in the FL phase of\nCFs at 5/2.

                "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach for comparing out-of-sample multi-step\nforecasts obtained from a pair of nested models that is based on the forecast\nencompassing principle. Our proposed approach relies on an alternative way of\ntesting the population moment restriction implied by the forecast encompassing\nprinciple and that links the forecast errors from the two competing models in a\nparticular way. Its key advantage is that it is able to bypass the variance\ndegeneracy problem afflicting model based forecast comparisons across nested\nmodels. It results in a test statistic whose limiting distribution is standard\nnormal and which is particularly simple to construct and can accommodate both\nsingle period and longer-horizon prediction comparisons. Inferences are also\nshown to be robust to different predictor types, including stationary,\nhighly-persistent and purely deterministic processes. Finally, we illustrate\nthe use of our proposed approach through an empirical application that explores\nthe role of global inflation in enhancing individual country specific inflation\nforecasts.",

These\nspectral features are consistent with predictions of the magnetically-powered\ncorona model, and we argue that NGC 4945 is among the brightest neutrino active\ngalaxies detectable for KM3Net and Baikal-GVD. On the other hand, in contrast\nto other reported results, we do not detect gamma rays from NGC 4151, which\nconstrains neutrino emission from the accretion shock model.

                "abstract": "Serrations are commonly employed to mitigate the turbulent boundary layer\ntrailing-edge noise. However, significant discrepancies persist between model\npredictions and experimental observations. In this paper, we show that this\nresults from the frozen turbulence assumption. A fully-developed turbulent\nboundary layer over a flat plate is first simulated using the large eddy\nsimulation (LES) method, with the turbulence at the inlet generated using the\ndigital filter method (DFM). The space-time correlations and spectral\ncharacteristics of wall pressure fluctuations are examined. The simulation\nresults demonstrate that the coherence function decays in the streamwise\ndirection, deviating from the constant value of unity assumed in the frozen\nturbulence assumption. By considering an exponential decay function, we relax\nthe frozen turbulence assumption and develop a prediction model that accounts\nfor the intrinsic non-frozen nature of turbulent boundary layers. To facilitate\na direct comparison with frozen models, a correction coefficient is introduced\nto account for the influence of non-frozen turbulence. The comparison between\nthe new and original models demonstrates that the new model predicts lower\nnoise reductions, aligning more closely with the experimental observations. The\nphysical mechanism underlying the overprediction of the noise model assuming\nfrozen turbulence is discussed. The overprediction is due to the decoherence of\nthe phase variation along the serrated trailing edge. Consequently, the ratio\nof the serration amplitude to the streamwise frequency-dependent correlation\nlength is identified as a crucial parameter in determining the correct\nprediction of far-field noise.",

Furthermore, we also\ndesign optimal synthetic datasets to train the model for overcoming the\nground-truth deficiency of the CHER problem. While trained with synthetic data,\nthe physics-informed optimization enables our model to capture the detrimental\neffect of the thermal fluctuations on nonclassicality.

Validation experiments have been performed under the cases of\n\\emph{None}, \\emph{Light}, \\emph{Moderate}, \\emph{Heavy} and \\emph{Violent} on\na large-scale precipitation benchmark named TIGGE. Finally, the average\nmean-absolute error (MAE) and average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the\nproposed AdaNAS model are 0.98 and 2.04 mm/day, respectively. Additionally, the\nproposed AdaNAS model is compared with other neural architecture search methods\nand previous studies. Compared results reveal the satisfactory performance and\nsuperiority of the proposed AdaNAS model in terms of precipitation amount\nprediction and intensity classification. Concretely, the proposed AdaNAS model\noutperformed previous best-performing manual methods with MAE and RMSE\nimproving by 80.5\\% and 80.3\\%, respectively.",

                "abstract": "Context. The Galactic centre is hazardous for stellar clusters because of the\nstrong tidal force. Supposedly, many clusters were destroyed and contributed\nstars to the crowded stellar field of the bulge and the nuclear stellar\ncluster. However, it is hard to develop a realistic model to predict the\nlong-term evolution of the complex inner Galaxy, and observing surviving\nclusters in the central region would provide crucial insights into destruction\nprocesses. Aims. Among hitherto-known Galactic globular clusters, VVV CL002 is\nthe closest to the centre, 0.4 kpc, but has a very high transverse velocity,\n400 km s$^{-1}$. The nature of this cluster and its impact on Galactic\nastronomy need to be addressed with spectroscopic follow-up. Methods. Here we\nreport the first measurements of its radial velocity and chemical abundance\nbased on near-infrared high-resolution spectroscopy. Results. We found that\nthis cluster has a counterrotating orbit constrained within 1.0\\,kpc of the\ncentre, as close as 0.2 kpc at the perigalacticon, confirming that the cluster\nis not a passerby from the halo but a genuine survivor enduring the harsh\nconditions of the Galactic mill's tidal forces. In addition, its metallicity\nand $\\alpha$ abundance ([$\\alpha$/Fe] $\\simeq +0.4$ and [Fe/H]$=-0.54$) are\nsimilar to some globular clusters in the bulge. Recent studies suggest that\nstars with such $\\alpha$-enhanced stars were more common at 3 - 6 kpc from the\ncentre around 10 Gyrs ago. Conclusions. We infer that VVV CL002 was formed\noutside but is currently falling down to the centre, exhibiting a real-time\nevent that must have occurred to many clusters a long time ago.",

                "abstract": "Near-field radar imaging systems are recently used in a wide range of\napplications, such as medical diagnosis, through-wall imaging, concealed weapon\ndetection, and nondestructive evaluation. In this paper, we consider the\nproblem of reconstructing the three-dimensional (3D) complex-valued\nreflectivity distribution of the near-field scene from sparse multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) array measurements. Using the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we solve this inverse problem by\nenforcing regularization on the magnitude of the complex-valued reflectivity\ndistribution. For this, we provide a general expression for the proximal\nmapping associated with such regularization functionals. This equivalently\ncorresponds to the solution of a complex-valued denoising problem which\ninvolves regularization on the magnitude. By utilizing this expression, we\ndevelop a novel and efficient plug-and-play (PnP) reconstruction method that\nconsists of simple update steps. Due to the success of data-adaptive deep\npriors in various imaging problems, we also train a 3D deep denoiser to exploit\nwithin the developed PnP framework for MIMO imaging. The effectiveness of the\ndeveloped learning-based PnP approach is illustrated under various compressive\nand noisy observation scenarios using both simulated data and experimental\nmeasurements. The performance is also compared with sparsity priors and the\ncommonly used analytical approaches such as back-projection and Kirchhoff\nmigration. The results demonstrate that the developed technique not only\nprovides state-of-the-art reconstruction performance for 3D real-world targets,\nbut also enables fast computation. Our approach provides a unified general\nframework to effectively handle arbitrary regularization on the magnitude of a\ncomplex-valued unknown and is equally applicable to other radar image formation\nproblems (including SAR).",

In this work we develop a formalism for the bispectrum\nin the Spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) basis - a natural basis for computing\ncorrelation functions on the curved sky, as it diagonalizes the Laplacian\noperator in spherical coordinates. Working in the SFB basis allows for\nline-of-sight effects such as redshift space distortions (RSD) and GR to be\naccounted for exactly, i.e without having to resort to perturbative expansions\nto go beyond the plane-parallel approximation. Only analytic results for the\nSFB bispectrum exist in the literature given the intensive computations needed.\nWe numerically calculate the SFB bispectrum for the first time, enabled by a\nfew techniques: We implement a template decomposition of the redshift-space\nkernel $Z_2$ into Legendre polynomials, and separately treat the PNG and\nvelocity-divergence terms. We derive an identity to integrate a product of\nthree spherical harmonics connected by a Dirac delta function as a simple sum,\nand use it to investigate the limit of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe.\nMoreover, we present a formalism for convolving the signal with separable\nwindow functions, and use a toy spherically symmetric window to demonstrate the\ncomputation and give insights into the properties of the observed bispectrum\nsignal.

To\novercome this limitation, our approach takes a different approach by inferring\nthe fundamental shape of the garment through sewing patterns from a single\nimage, rather than directly reconstructing 3D garments. Our method consists of\ntwo stages. Firstly, given a single image of a posed user, it predicts the\ngarment image worn on a T-pose, representing the baseline form of the garment.\nThen, it estimates the sewing pattern parameters based on the T-pose garment\nimage. By simulating the stitching and draping of the sewing pattern using\nphysics simulation, we can generate 3D garments that can adaptively deform to\narbitrary poses. The effectiveness of our method is validated through ablation\nstudies on the major components and a comparison with other approaches.",

Our empirical study reveals that a\nlarge part of the movements of the at-the-money-forward implied volatility for\nup to two years maturities can be explained using the past returns and their\nsquares. Moreover, we show that up to four years of the past evolution of the\nunderlying price should be used for the prediction and that this feedback\neffect gets weaker when the maturity increases. Building on this new stylized\nfact, we fit to historical data a parsimonious version of the SSVI\nparameterization (Gatheral and Jacquier, 2014) of the implied volatility\nsurface relying on only four parameters and show that the two parameters ruling\nthe at-the-money-forward implied volatility as a function of the maturity\nexhibit a path-dependent behavior with respect to the underlying asset price.\nFinally, we propose a model for the joint dynamics of the implied volatility\nsurface and the underlying asset price. The latter is modelled using a variant\nof the path-dependent volatility model of Guyon and Lekeufack and the former is\nobtained by adding a feedback effect of the underlying asset price onto the two\nparameters ruling the at-the-money-forward implied volatility in the\nparsimonious SSVI parameterization and by specifying a hidden semi-Markov\ndiffusion model for the residuals of these two parameters and the two other\nparameters.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Fast and accurate predictions for complex physical dynamics are a significant\nchallenge across various applications. Real-time prediction on\nresource-constrained hardware is even more crucial in real-world problems. The\ndeep operator network (DeepONet) has recently been proposed as a framework for\nlearning nonlinear mappings between function spaces. However, the DeepONet\nrequires many parameters and has a high computational cost when learning\noperators, particularly those with complex (discontinuous or non-smooth) target\nfunctions. This study proposes HyperDeepONet, which uses the expressive power\nof the hypernetwork to enable the learning of a complex operator with a smaller\nset of parameters. The DeepONet and its variant models can be thought of as a\nmethod of injecting the input function information into the target function.\nFrom this perspective, these models can be viewed as a particular case of\nHyperDeepONet. We analyze the complexity of DeepONet and conclude that\nHyperDeepONet needs relatively lower complexity to obtain the desired accuracy\nfor operator learning. HyperDeepONet successfully learned various operators\nwith fewer computational resources compared to other benchmarks.",

                "abstract": "The task of music-driven dance generation involves creating coherent dance\nmovements that correspond to the given music. While existing methods can\nproduce physically plausible dances, they often struggle to generalize to\nout-of-set data. The challenge arises from three aspects: 1) the high diversity\nof dance movements and significant differences in the distribution of music\nmodalities, which make it difficult to generate music-aligned dance movements.\n2) the lack of a large-scale music-dance dataset, which hinders the generation\nof generalized dance movements from music. 3) The protracted nature of dance\nmovements poses a challenge to the maintenance of a consistent dance style. In\nthis work, we introduce the EnchantDance framework, a state-of-the-art method\nfor dance generation. Due to the redundancy of the original dance sequence\nalong the time axis, EnchantDance first constructs a strong dance latent space\nand then trains a dance diffusion model on the dance latent space. To address\nthe data gap, we construct a large-scale music-dance dataset, ChoreoSpectrum3D\nDataset, which includes four dance genres and has a total duration of 70.32\nhours, making it the largest reported music-dance dataset to date. To enhance\nconsistency between music genre and dance style, we pre-train a music genre\nprediction network using transfer learning and incorporate music genre as extra\nconditional information in the training of the dance diffusion model. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on dance quality, diversity, and consistency.",

Despite the rapid development\nof various correlation research methodologies, including machine learning, the\nexploration into mining causal correlations between variables remains ongoing.\nEmpirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) emerges as a data-driven framework for\nmodeling dynamic systems, distinguishing itself by eschewing traditional\nformulaic methods in data analysis. Instead, it reconstructs dynamic system\nbehavior directly from time series data. The fundamental premise of EDM is that\ndynamic systems can be conceptualized as processes where a set of states,\ngoverned by specific rules, evolve over time in a high-dimensional space. By\nreconstructing these evolving states, dynamic systems can be effectively\nmodeled. Using EDM, this paper explores the detection of causal relationships\nbetween variables within dynamic systems through their time series data. It\nposits that if variable X causes variable Y, then the information about X is\ninherent in Y and can be extracted from Y's data.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies,\nsuch as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians\nand vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic\nsafety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social\ninteractions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has\nlimitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph\nTransformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph\nConvolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution\npseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and\ninterception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to\nhandle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed\npedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and\nTransformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary\nnumber of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data\nprocessing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle,\nand mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model\nminimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces\nthe likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively\nreduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to\npredict for a long time.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "In this paper, we first investigate a visual quality degradation problem\nobserved in recent high-resolution virtual try-on approach. The tendency is\nempirically found that the textures of clothes are squeezed at the sleeve, as\nvisualized in the upper row of Fig.1(a). A main reason for the issue arises\nfrom a gradient conflict between two popular losses, the Total Variation (TV)\nand adversarial losses. Specifically, the TV loss aims to disconnect boundaries\nbetween the sleeve and torso in a warped clothing mask, whereas the adversarial\nloss aims to combine between them. Such contrary objectives feedback the\nmisaligned gradients to a cascaded appearance flow estimation, resulting in\nundesirable squeezing artifacts. To reduce this, we propose a Sequential\nDeformation (SD-VITON) that disentangles the appearance flow prediction layers\ninto TV objective-dominant (TVOB) layers and a task-coexistence (TACO) layer.\nSpecifically, we coarsely fit the clothes onto a human body via the TVOB\nlayers, and then keep on refining via the TACO layer. In addition, the bottom\nrow of Fig.1(a) shows a different type of squeezing artifacts around the waist.\nTo address it, we further propose that we first warp the clothes into a\ntucked-out shirts style, and then partially erase the texture from the warped\nclothes without hurting the smoothness of the appearance flows. Experimental\nresults show that our SD-VITON successfully resolves both types of artifacts\nand outperforms the baseline methods.

The number of scatterings in random\nwalk processes is commonly approximated as $\\tau+\\tau^2$ in the literature,\nwhere $\\tau$ is the optical thickness measured from the center of the medium.\nHowever, it is found that this formula is not accurate. In this study,\nanalytical solutions in sphere and slab geometries are derived for both\noptically thin and optically thick limits, assuming isotropic scattering. These\nsolutions are verified using Monte Carlo simulations. In the optically thick\nlimit, the number of scatterings is found to be $0.5\\tau^2$ and $1.5\\tau^2$ in\na sphere and slab, respectively. In the optically thin limit, the number of\nscatterings is $\\approx\\tau$ in a sphere and\n$\\approx\\tau(1-\\gamma-\\ln\\tau+\\tau)$ in a slab, where $\\gamma\\simeq 0.57722$ is\nthe Euler-Mascheroni constant.

Our methodology involves training the smaller\nstudent model using the prediction probabilities of the LLM, which serves as a\nteacher model. This is achieved through a specialized loss function tailored to\nlearn from the LLM's output probabilities, ensuring that the student model\nclosely mimics the teacher's performance. To test this approach, we utilized a\nlarge dataset, 7T, containing 6,684 student-written responses to science\nquestions and three other datasets with student-written responses. We also\ncompared performance with original neural network (NN) models to validate the\naccuracy. Results have shown that the NN and distilled student models have\ncomparable accuracy to the teacher model for the 7T dataset; however, other\ndatasets have shown significantly lower accuracy (28% on average) for NN,\nthough our proposed distilled model is still able to achieve 12\\% higher\naccuracy than NN. Furthermore, the student model size ranges from 0.1M to\n0.02M, 100 times smaller in terms of parameters and ten times smaller compared\nwith the original output model size.

This study aims to show that the use of fractional\nHill coefficients actually indicates the presence of intermediate processes or,\nin some cases, the effect of noise on these systems. The deterministic\napproximation of enzymatic processes leads to the derivation of the Hill\nfunction, which can be expanded around the noise magnitude to derive mesoscopic\ncorrections. This study establishes relationships between the intermediate\nprocesses and the decimal Hill coefficient, both with and without fluctuations.\nThis outcome contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying processes\nassociated with the fractional Hill coefficient, while also enabling the\nprediction of an effective value of the Hill coefficient from the underlying\nmechanism, allowing us to have a simplified description of complex systems.",

                "abstract": "A macroion with a strongly charged negative surface in 3:1 salt water\nsolution becomes net positive due to adsorption of an excessive number of\npositive 3-ions. The widely accepted theory of such charge inversion is based\non the idea that adsorbed at the macroion surface 3-ions form a two-dimensional\nstrongly correlated liquid which attracts excessive 3-ions by their negative\nimages (correlation holes). In the absence of 1:1 salt this theory reasonably\nagrees with experiments and numerical simulations. However, the same theory\npredicts that adding a large concentration of 1:1 salt increases the net\npositive charge, while experiments and simulations show that the charge\ndecreases. In this paper we argue that the theory was aiming at the case of a\nvery large macroion surface charge and ignored the effect of the competing\nattraction of 3-ion to its screening atmosphere in the bulk of the solution. We\nshow that for parameters of experiments and simulations this effect makes\ncharge inversion weak and extremely sensitive to screening by large\nconcentration of 1:1 salt. As a result charge inversion decreases with addition\nof 1:1 salt in agreement with experiments and simulations.",

However,\nmany studies employed simplified dark matter density models, which makes it\nvery hard to give a precise prediction on the dark matter effects in real\nastrophysical galaxies. In this work, to more accurately describe the\ndistribution of dark matter in real astrophysical galaxies, we study the\ngravitational lensing of black holes in astrophysical dark matter halo models\n(Beta, Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore). The deflection angle is obtained using\na generalized Gibbons-Werner approach. The visual angular positions and the\nEinstein rings are also calculated by adopting the gravitational lens equation.\nSpecifically, we choose the supermassive black holes in Milky Way Galaxy,\nAndromeda galaxy (M31), Virgo galaxy (M87), and ESO138-G014 galaxy as examples,\nincluding the corresponding fitted value of dark matter halos. The results\nsuggest that the dark matter halo described by the Beta model has\nnon-negligible influences on the gravitational deflection angle and\ngravitational lensing observations.

                "abstract": "High-definition (HD) cameras for surveillance and road traffic have\nexperienced tremendous growth, demanding intensive computation resources for\nreal-time analytics. Recently, offloading frames from the front-end device to\nthe back-end edge server has shown great promise. In multi-stream competitive\nenvironments, efficient bandwidth management and proper scheduling are crucial\nto ensure both high inference accuracy and high throughput. To achieve this\ngoal, we propose BiSwift, a bi-level framework that scales the concurrent\nreal-time video analytics by a novel adaptive hybrid codec integrated with\nmulti-level pipelines, and a global bandwidth controller for multiple video\nstreams. The lower-level front-back-end collaborative mechanism (called\nadaptive hybrid codec) locally optimizes the accuracy and accelerates\nend-to-end video analytics for a single stream. The upper-level scheduler aims\nto accuracy fairness among multiple streams via the global bandwidth\ncontroller. The evaluation of BiSwift shows that BiSwift is able to real-time\nobject detection on 9 streams with an edge device only equipped with an NVIDIA\nRTX3070 (8G) GPU. BiSwift improves 10%$\\sim$21% accuracy and presents\n1.2$\\sim$9$\\times$ throughput compared with the state-of-the-art video\nanalytics pipelines.",

Specifically, our set prediction consists of two synergistic\ntasks, i.e., caption generation and an auxiliary task of concept combination\nprediction providing extra semantic supervision. Each caption in the set is\nattached to a concept combination indicating the primary semantic content of\nthe caption and facilitating element alignment in set prediction. Furthermore,\nwe apply a diversity regularization term on concepts to encourage the model to\ngenerate semantically diverse captions with various concept combinations. These\ntwo tasks share multiple semantics-specific encodings as input, which are\nobtained by iterative interaction between visual features and conceptual\nqueries. The correspondence between the generated captions and specific concept\ncombinations further guarantees the interpretability of our model.

This trade-off, however, varies across individuals, making the\nmodeling of these spatial-temporal dynamics a formidable challenge. To address\nthe problem, in this work, we introduce the \"Spatial-temporal Induced\nHierarchical Reinforcement Learning\" (STI-HRL) framework, for capturing the\ninterplay between spatial and temporal factors in human mobility\ndecision-making. Specifically, STI-HRL employs a two-tiered decision-making\nprocess: the low-level focuses on disentangling spatial and temporal\npreferences using dedicated agents, while the high-level integrates these\nconsiderations to finalize the decision. To complement the hierarchical\ndecision setting, we construct a hypergraph to organize historical data,\nencapsulating the multi-aspect semantics of human mobility. We propose a\ncross-channel hypergraph embedding module to learn the representations as the\nstates to facilitate the decision-making cycle. Our extensive experiments on\ntwo real-world datasets validate the superiority of STI-HRL over\nstate-of-the-art methods in predicting users' next visits across various\nperformance metrics.",

Surface flux transport models and dynamo models have\nbeen employed to simulate this mechanism, which also allows for physics-based\nsolar cycle forecasts.

The\nstimulus has been designed for use in BCI (Brain Computer Interface)\napplications that employ visually evoked potentials (VEPs) in an effort to\nmitigate discomfort associated with VEPs. The stimuli set included traditional\nVEP stimuli, already established in the literature, allowing comparative\nanalyses. We conducted analyses of signal distinction measures by calculating\nthe signal-to-noise ratio and the classification performance of its evoked\npotentials. Methods: Fourteen participants were seated in a dimly lit room\nfacing a display. Participants' fixation on the central stimulus was controlled\nby means of a desktop eye tracker. Participants attended a flicker-based\nsteady-state VEP (SSVEP) task, a motion-based steady-state-motion VEP (SSMVEP)\ntask, and the novel stimulus task (the imperceptible grating SSMVEP).\nParticipants were asked to complete behavioral fatigue scale tasks. Results: A\nsignificant effect of stimulus type was observed, accompanied by insignificant\ndifferences in prediction accuracy. Partially significant task effects were\nobtained in fatigue scale tasks. Conclusion: The study revealed that the\nimperceptible grating SSMVEP stimulus successfully evoked SSMVEP responses\nwithin acceptable margins in the related cortical regions. This novel stimulus\ncontributes to BCI research by providing an imperceptible interface, improving\nalready established stimuli design in the SSVEP and the SSMVEP literature.\nSignificance: The present paper provides a novel SSMVEP stimulus type that may\ninform the future design of effective VEP-based BCI paradigms that allow\nseamless interaction with computer interfaces.",

Previous\nmodel merging works focus on either CNNs or NLP models, leaving the ViTs\nmerging research untouched.

To\nfurther boost the performance of the merged model, especially when the\ndifficulty of merging tasks increases, we design a novel metric of model weight\nsimilarity, and utilize it to realize controllable and combined weight merging.\nComprehensive experiments on kinds of newly established benchmarks, validate\nthe superiority of the proposed ViT merging framework for different tasks and\ndomains.

They were first predicted for single-particle states, and\nbecame a general feature of many wave systems. In many-body quantum physics, it\nis still unclear what would be a close analog of BICs, and whether\ninterparticle interaction may induce BICs. Here, we predict a novel type of\nmultiparticle states in the interaction-modulated Bose-Hubbard model that can\nbe associated with the BIC concept. Under periodic boundary conditions, a\nso-called quasi-BIC appears as a bounded pair residing in a standing wave\nformed by the third particle. Under open boundary conditions, such a hybrid\nstate becomes an eigenstate of the system. We demonstrate that the Thouless\npumping of the quasi-BICs can be realized by modulating the on-site\ninteractions in space and time. Surprisingly, while the center-of-mass of the\nquasi-BIC is shifted by a unit cell in one cycle, the bounded pair moves into\nthe opposite direction with the standing wave.",

                "abstract": "Device discovery has a great impact on the performance of Bluetooth low\nenergy (BLE). The performance of device discovery is highly related to the\nadvertising mode. BLE has two advertising modes: pseudo-random delay\nadvertising (RDA) and periodic deterministic advertising (PDA). Generally, PDA\nhas low discovery latency but is susceptible to persistent collisions, whereas\nRDA does not suffer persistent collisions but has much larger discovery\nlatency. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid advertising mode, called\nDeterministic and pseudo-Random delay Advertising (DRA), which has the\nadvantages of both PDA and RDA. We develop an analytical model for DRA mode\nbased on a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain, and analyze the expected\ndiscovery latency of DRA in a single-advertiser case and a multiple-advertiser\ncase.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Sign language translation (SLT) aims to convert continuous sign language\nvideos into textual sentences. As a typical multi-modal task, there exists an\ninherent modality gap between sign language videos and spoken language text,\nwhich makes the cross-modal alignment between visual and textual modalities\ncrucial. However, previous studies tend to rely on an intermediate sign gloss\nrepresentation to help alleviate the cross-modal problem thereby neglecting the\nalignment across modalities that may lead to compromised results. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel framework based on Conditional Variational\nautoencoder for SLT (CV-SLT) that facilitates direct and sufficient cross-modal\nalignment between sign language videos and spoken language text. Specifically,\nour CV-SLT consists of two paths with two Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences to\nregularize the outputs of the encoder and decoder, respectively. In the prior\npath, the model solely relies on visual information to predict the target text;\nwhereas in the posterior path, it simultaneously encodes visual information and\ntextual knowledge to reconstruct the target text. The first KL divergence\noptimizes the conditional variational autoencoder and regularizes the encoder\noutputs, while the second KL divergence performs a self-distillation from the\nposterior path to the prior path, ensuring the consistency of decoder outputs.\nWe further enhance the integration of textual information to the posterior path\nby employing a shared Attention Residual Gaussian Distribution (ARGD), which\nconsiders the textual information in the posterior path as a residual component\nrelative to the prior path. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets\n(PHOENIX14T and CSL-daily) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,\nachieving new state-of-the-art results while significantly alleviating the\ncross-modal representation discrepancy.",

Its efficacy was appraised\nusing ESG reports from 166 companies across various sectors listed on the Hong\nKong Stock Exchange in 2022, ensuring comprehensive industry and market\ncapitalization representation. Utilizing ESGReveal unearthed significant\ninsights into ESG reporting with GPT-4, demonstrating an accuracy of 76.9% in\ndata extraction and 83.7% in disclosure analysis, which is an improvement over\nbaseline models. This highlights the framework's capacity to refine ESG data\nanalysis precision. Moreover, it revealed a demand for reinforced ESG\ndisclosures, with environmental and social data disclosures standing at 69.5%\nand 57.2%, respectively, suggesting a pursuit for more corporate transparency.\nWhile current iterations of ESGReveal do not process pictorial information, a\nfunctionality intended for future enhancement, the study calls for continued\nresearch to further develop and compare the analytical capabilities of various\nLLMs. In summary, ESGReveal is a stride forward in ESG data processing,\noffering stakeholders a sophisticated tool to better evaluate and advance\ncorporate sustainability efforts.

KGE remains a vital research topic within the\nsemantic web community. RDF-star introduces the concept of a quoted triple\n(QT), a specific form of triple employed either as the subject or object within\nanother triple.

While various methods have emerged\nfor constructing KGs, existing techniques often lack statistical certainty\nconcerning the presence of links between entities, especially in scenarios\nwhere the utilization of patient-level EHR data is limited due to privacy\nconcerns. In this paper, we propose the first inferential framework for\nderiving a sparse KG with statistical guarantee based on the dynamic log-linear\ntopic model proposed by \\cite{arora2016latent}. Within this model, the KG\nembeddings are estimated by performing singular value decomposition on the\nempirical pointwise mutual information matrix, offering a scalable solution. We\nthen establish entrywise asymptotic normality for the KG low-rank estimator,\nenabling the recovery of sparse graph edges with controlled type I error. Our\nwork uniquely addresses the under-explored domain of statistical inference\nabout non-linear statistics under the low-rank temporal dependent models, a\ncritical gap in existing research.

Many studies have contributed to developing effective\nmodels while often suffering from data shortage and low generalization to\nvarious institutions due to the privacy-protection issue. To this end, this\nstudy proposes a distributed grade prediction model, dubbed FecMap, by\nexploiting the federated learning (FL) framework that preserves the private\ndata of local clients and communicates with others through a global generalized\nmodel. FecMap considers local subspace learning (LSL), which explicitly learns\nthe local features against the global features, and multi-layer privacy\nprotection (MPP), which hierarchically protects the private features, including\nmodel-shareable features and not-allowably shared features, to achieve\nclient-specific classifiers of high performance on LOP per institution. FecMap\nis then achieved in an iteration manner with all datasets distributed on\nclients by training a local neural network composed of a global part, a local\npart, and a classification head in clients and averaging the global parts from\nclients on the server. To evaluate the FecMap model, we collected three\nhigher-educational datasets of student academic records from engineering\nmajors. Experiment results manifest that FecMap benefits from the proposed LSL\nand MPP and achieves steady performance on the task of LOP, compared with the\nstate-of-the-art models. This study makes a fresh attempt at the use of\nfederated learning in the learning-analytical task, potentially paving the way\nto facilitating personalized education with privacy protection.",

In classical wave optics, there has long been studies on\nmethods of measuring or retrieving the phase of a wave function. We here\npresent that one of those methods, the analytic phase retrieval based on the\nproperties of entire functions, has a close connection with weak measurements\nin quantum physics. We explain such a connection for two emblematic optical\nweak-measurements that have the same mathematical formalism as quantum systems:\none is a system for weak measurements of polarized light displacement in a\nbirefringent crystal, and the other is a system for the direct measurement of a\nwave function by weakly coupling it to a pointer. In those two systems, we show\nthat the pre- and post-selection of polarized light provides a filtering effect\nsimilar to that utilized in the analytic phase retrieval.",

To\nbegin, we examine the grid resolution requirements and introduce a length scale\nthat considers both the tip vortex strength and the core radius, which is then\nemployed to non-dimensionalize the spatial resolution in the tip vortex region\nand establish mesh requirements for large eddy simulation of tip vortex\ncavitation. We next perform simulations to analyze the dynamical modes of\ncavity oscillation at different cavitation numbers and compare them with the\nsemi-analytical solution. The breathing mode of cavity surface oscillation is\nextracted from the results through the definition of an effective radius. The\ntime-averaged effective radius demonstrates that the cavity experiences a\ngrowth region followed by decay as it progresses away from the tip. Further\nexamination of the local breathing mode oscillations in these regions indicates\nthe different behavior of cavity oscillations in the growth and decay regions,\nwith the oscillations within the former being characterized by lower\nfrequencies. For representative cavitation numbers $\\sigma \\in [1.2,2.6]$, we\nfind that pressure fluctuations exhibit a shift of spectrum towards lower\nfrequencies as the cavitation number decreases, similar to its influence on\nbreathing mode oscillations. The results indicate the correlations between the\nbreathing mode oscillations and the pressure fluctuations, with the\nlow-frequency and relatively higher-frequency pressure fluctuations being\ncorrelated with the growth and decay regions, respectively.",

                "abstract": "The challenges inherent to long-horizon tasks in robotics persist due to the\ntypical inefficient exploration and sparse rewards in traditional reinforcement\nlearning approaches. To alleviate these challenges, we introduce a novel\nalgorithm, Variational Autoencoder-based Subgoal Inference (VAESI), to\naccomplish long-horizon tasks through a divide-and-conquer manner. VAESI\nconsists of three components: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based Subgoal\nGenerator, a Hindsight Sampler, and a Value Selector. The VAE-based Subgoal\nGenerator draws inspiration from the human capacity to infer subgoals and\nreason about the final goal in the context of these subgoals. It is composed of\nan explicit encoder model, engineered to generate subgoals, and an implicit\ndecoder model, designed to enhance the quality of the generated subgoals by\npredicting the final goal. Additionally, the Hindsight Sampler selects valid\nsubgoals from an offline dataset to enhance the feasibility of the generated\nsubgoals. The Value Selector utilizes the value function in reinforcement\nlearning to filter the optimal subgoals from subgoal candidates. To validate\nour method, we conduct several long-horizon tasks in both simulation and the\nreal world, including one locomotion task and three manipulation tasks. The\nobtained quantitative and qualitative data indicate that our approach achieves\npromising performance compared to other baseline methods.

                "abstract": "Dense retrieval needs to learn discriminative text embeddings to represent\nthe semantic relationship between query and document. It may benefit from the\nusing of large language models (LLMs), given LLMs' strong capability on\nsemantic understanding. However, the LLMs are pre-trained by text generation\ntasks, whose working pattern is completely different from representing texts as\nembeddings. As a result, it is imperative to study how to adapt LLMs properly\nso that they can be effectively initialized as the backbone encoder for dense\nretrieval.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called LLaRA (LLM adapted for\ndense RetrievAl), which works as a post-hoc adaptation of LLM for the dense\nretrieval application. LLaRA consists of two pretext tasks: EBAE\n(Embedding-Based Auto-Encoding) and EBAR (Embedding-Based Auto-Regression),\nwhere the text embeddings from LLM are used to reconstruct the tokens for the\ninput sentence and predict the tokens for the next sentence, respectively.\nLLaRA turns out to be simple, lightweight, and highly effective. It is applied\nto adapt LLaMA-2-7B (base) on the Wikipedia corpus, where it substantially\nimproves the model's fine-tuned performances on a variety of dense retrieval\nbenchmarks, like MSMARCO and BEIR.

Supporting a user-friendly 2D interface, which\ncan ease the cognitive burden of exploring 3D space to provide click\ninteractions, iDet3D enables users to annotate the entire objects in each scene\nwith minimal interactions. Taking the sparse nature of 3D point clouds into\naccount, we design a negative click simulation (NCS) to improve accuracy by\nreducing false-positive predictions. In addition, iDet3D incorporates two click\npropagation techniques to take full advantage of user interactions: (1) dense\nclick guidance (DCG) for keeping user-provided information throughout the\nnetwork and (2) spatial click propagation (SCP) for detecting other instances\nof the same class based on the user-specified objects.

                "abstract": "Atomic sensors have shown great promise for density and pressure metrology in\nthe high, ultra-high, and extremely-high vacuum regimes. Specifically, the\ndensity of background gas particles in vacuum can be determined by measuring\nthe collision rate between the particles and an ensemble of sensor atoms. This\nrequires preparing the sensor atoms in a particular quantum state, observing\nthe rate of changes of that state, and using the cross section coefficient for\nstate-changing collisions to convert the rate into a corresponding density. The\ncross section can be known by various methods including by quantum scattering\ncalculations using an ansatz for the interaction potential between the\ncollision pair, by measurements of the post-collision sensor-atom momentum\nrecoil distribution, or by empirical calibration of the sensor atom at a known\ndensity. Identifying systematic errors in the results of these methods can be\naided by direct comparisons between them. Alternatively, measurements of\ndifferent sensor atoms exposed to the same background gas offers another point\nof comparison free of the systematic errors inherent in creating a background\ngas at a known density. Here, we present such measurements for two sensor\natoms, $^{87}$Rb and $^6$Li, and a variety of atomic and molecular background\ngases including H$_2$, N$_2$, Ar, Ne, Kr, and Xe. We find results consistent\nwith, yet statistically different at the level of 3.5(5)%, from recent\ntheoretical and experiment measurements. This work demonstrates a model-free\nmethod for transferring the primacy of one atomic standard to another sensor\natom and highlights the utility of sensor-atom cross-calibration experiments to\ncheck the validity of direct measurements and theoretical predictions.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) has been suggested in the\nliterature to eliminate conventional renormalization scheme-and-scale\nambiguities in precision test of the QCD theory. It has been shown that by\napplying the PMC single-scale-setting approach (PMCs), all non-conformal\n$\\{\\beta_i\\}$-terms of the perturbative QCD series will be resummed into strong\ncoupling constant $\\alpha_s$, which then sets the correct magnitude of\n$\\alpha_s$ and results in a scale-fixed and scheme-invariant prediction. In\nthis paper, by applying the PMCs, we present an improved analysis of the\ntop-quark pair production via the process $e^{+}e^{-}\\to \\gamma^{*}\\to\nt\\bar{t}$ near the threshold region up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order\n(N$^3$LO) QCD corrections. Near the threshold region, the top-quark velocity\n$v$ tends to zero, leading to Coulomb singularity. For the purpose, we first\nreconstruct the analytical expression for the Coulomb-terms up to N$^{3}$LO\naccuracy by using the PSLQ algorithm. We then apply the PMCs to deal with the\nCoulomb and non-Coulomb parts separately, and two effective coupling are fixed\naccordingly. After that, the Coulomb part is resummed into a\nSommerfeld-Gamow-Sakharov factor, which leads to a more reasonable behavior\nnear the threshold region. We thus achieve a more precise and a better\nunderstanding of the top-quark pair production near the threshold region.",

                "abstract": "The Emergence Proposal is the idea that all kinetic terms for fields in\nquantum gravity are emergent in the infrared from integrating out towers of\nstates. It predicts that in a supersymmetric string theory context, the\ntree-level prepotential terms can be recovered precisely by integrating out a\ntower of non-perturbative states. In this note we present a new perspective,\nand associated quantitative evidence, for this proposal. We argue that the\ntree-level kinetic terms arise from integrating out the ultraviolet physics of\neach of the states in the tower. This ultraviolet physics is associated to\nextended objects, and cannot be captured by a standard particle Schwinger\nintegral. Instead, we argue that it should be captured by a Schwinger-like\nintegral where the proper time is analytically continued, and a contour is\ntaken around the origin. This maps to certain integral representations for the\nmoduli space periods, and indeed one recovers the tree-level prepotential\nexactly. This interpretation suggests that the ultraviolet physics which gives\nthe leading contribution to the prepotential is localised on point\nintersections of the extended objects. We also argue that over special loci in\nmoduli space there can exist a particle picture of the states, and an\nassociated simple particle Schwinger integral, which leads to the full\ntree-level prepotential. These are loci with special degenerations, such as the\nsingular limit of the resolved conifold.",

                "abstract": "User attribute prediction is a crucial task in various industries. However,\nsharing user data across different organizations faces challenges due to\nprivacy concerns and legal requirements regarding personally identifiable\ninformation. Regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nin the European Union and the Personal Information Protection Law of the\nPeople's Republic of China impose restrictions on data sharing. To address the\nneed for utilizing features from multiple clients while adhering to legal\nrequirements, federated learning algorithms have been proposed. These\nalgorithms aim to predict user attributes without directly sharing the data.\nHowever, existing approaches typically rely on matching users across companies,\nwhich can result in dishonest partners discovering user lists or the inability\nto utilize all available features. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm\nfor predicting user attributes without requiring user matching. Our approach\ninvolves training deep matrix factorization models on different clients and\nsharing only the item vectors. This allows us to predict user attributes\nwithout sharing the user vectors themselves. The algorithm is evaluated using\nthe publicly available MovieLens dataset and demonstrate that it achieves\nsimilar performance to the FedAvg algorithm, reaching 96% of a single model's\naccuracy.

We assume that the disk is geometrically thin and\ngas-pressure dominant and explicitly take into account magnetic braking as well\nas turbulent viscosity by an extended alpha viscosity prescription. We find a\nparticular wind solution for a set of basic equations that satisfies the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for vertically unbound MHD flows. The\nsolution demonstrates that the disk evolves with losing mass due to wind and\naccretion from the initial Gaussian density distribution. We confirm that the\nmass accretion rate follows the power law of time $t^{-19/16}$ at late times if\nthe wind is absent, which corresponds to the classical solution of Cannizzo et\nal. (1990). We find that the mass accretion rate is steeper than the\n$t^{-19/16}$ curve if the disk wind is present. This is because the wind\nremoves a significant fraction of the mass and angular momentum. Mass accretion\nis further induced by magnetic braking, known as a wind-driven accretion\nmechanism, resulting in more rapid decay with time in both the mass accretion\nand loss rates. The ultraviolet (UV) luminosity is the highest among the\noptical, UV, and X-ray luminosities from early to late evolutionary phases,\nsuggesting optical and X-ray emissions from the disk are observationally\ninsignificant due to magnetically driven winds in TDEs.

                "abstract": "Deep learning has had remarkable success at analyzing handheld imagery such\nas consumer photos due to the availability of large-scale human annotations\n(e.g., ImageNet). However, remote sensing data lacks such extensive annotation\nand thus potential for supervised learning. To address this, we propose a\nhighly effective semi-supervised approach tailored specifically to remote\nsensing data. Our approach encompasses two key contributions. First, we adapt\nthe FixMatch framework to remote sensing data by designing robust strong and\nweak augmentations suitable for this domain. Second, we develop an effective\nsemi-supervised learning method by removing bias in imbalanced training data\nresulting from both actual labels and pseudo-labels predicted by the model. Our\nsimple semi-supervised framework was validated by extensive experimentation.\nUsing 30\\% of labeled annotations, it delivers a 7.1\\% accuracy gain over the\nsupervised learning baseline and a 2.1\\% gain over the supervised\nstate-of-the-art CDS method on the remote sensing xView dataset.",

However, to date, no technically viable sensor solution exists\nthat meets the corresponding response time targets set by stakeholders at\ntechnically relevant conditions. Here, we demonstrate how a tailored Long\nShort-term Transformer Ensemble Model for Accelerated Sensing (LEMAS)\naccelerates the response of a state-of-the-art optical plasmonic hydrogen\nsensor by up to a factor of 40 in an oxygen-free inert gas environment, by\naccurately predicting its response value to a hydrogen concentration change\nbefore it is physically reached by the sensor hardware. Furthermore, it\neliminates the pressure dependence of the response intrinsic to metal\nhydride-based sensors, while leveraging their ability to operate in\noxygen-starved environments that are proposed to be used for inert gas\nencapsulation systems of hydrogen installations. Moreover LEMAS provides a\nmeasure for the uncertainty of the predictions that is pivotal for\nsafety-critical sensor applications. Our results thus advertise the use of deep\nlearning for the acceleration of sensor response, also beyond the realm of\nplasmonic hydrogen detection.",

However, existing work is constrained to explaining the\nbehavior of individual model predictions, and lacks the ability to transfer the\nexplanation across various models and tasks. This limitation results in\nexplaining various tasks being time- and resource-consuming. To address this\nproblem, we develop a pre-trained, DNN-based, generic explainer on large-scale\nimage datasets, and leverage its transferability to explain various vision\nmodels for downstream tasks. In particular, the pre-training of generic\nexplainer focuses on LEarning Transferable Attribution (LETA). The transferable\nattribution takes advantage of the versatile output of the target backbone\nencoders to comprehensively encode the essential attribution for explaining\nvarious downstream tasks. LETA guides the pre-training of the generic explainer\ntowards the transferable attribution, and introduces a rule-based adaptation of\nthe transferable attribution for explaining downstream tasks, without the need\nfor additional training on downstream data. Theoretical analysis demonstrates\nthat the pre-training of LETA enables minimizing the explanation error bound\naligned with the conditional $\\mathcal{V}$-information on downstream tasks.\nEmpirical studies involve explaining three different architectures of vision\nmodels across three diverse downstream datasets.

Currently, available\nmethods are performed retrospectively using the CT images themselves, which can\nonly be done after the scan. To optimize CT acquisitions before scanning, rapid\nprediction of patient-specific organ dose is needed prospectively, using\navailable scout images. We, therefore, devise an end-to-end, fully-automated\ndeep learning solution to perform real-time, patient-specific, organ-level\ndosimetric estimation of CT scans.\n  Approach: We propose the Scout-Net model for CT dose prediction at six\ndifferent organs as well as for the overall patient body, leveraging the\nroutinely obtained frontal and lateral scout images of patients, before their\nCT scans. To obtain reference values of the organ doses, we used Monte Carlo\nsimulation and 3D segmentation methods on the corresponding CT images of the\npatients.\n  Results: We validate our proposed Scout-Net model against real patient CT\ndata and demonstrate the effectiveness in estimating organ doses in real-time\n(only 27 ms on average per scan). Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency\n(real-time execution), sufficiency (reasonable error rates), and robustness\n(consistent across varying patient sizes) of the Scout-Net model.\n  Conclusions: An effective, efficient, and robust Scout-Net model, once\nincorporated into the CT acquisition plan, could potentially guide the\nautomatic exposure control for balanced image quality and radiation dose.",

We discuss recent results in spectral regularization\nmethods and regularization by projection, exploring both approaches within the\ncontext of Hilbert scales and presenting new insights particularly in\nregularization by projection. Additionally, we overview recent advancements in\nregularization using convex penalties. Convergence rates are analyzed in terms\nof the sample size in a probabilistic sense, yielding minimax rates in both\nexpectation and probability. To achieve these results, the structure of\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is leveraged to establish minimax rates in\nthe statistical learning setting.

However, DNNs are becoming computationally intensive and\nenergy hungry at an exponential pace, while at the same time, there is a vast\ndemand for running sophisticated DNN-based services on resource constrained\nembedded devices. In this paper, we target energy-efficient inference on\nembedded DNN accelerators. To that end, we propose an automated framework to\ncompress DNNs in a hardware-aware manner by jointly employing pruning and\nquantization. We explore, for the first time, per-layer fine- and\ncoarse-grained pruning, in the same DNN architecture, in addition to low\nbit-width mixed-precision quantization for weights and activations.\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is used to explore the associated design space and\nidentify the pruning-quantization configuration so that the energy consumption\nis minimized whilst the prediction accuracy loss is retained at acceptable\nlevels. Using our novel composite RL agent we are able to extract\nenergy-efficient solutions without requiring retraining and/or fine tuning. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation over widely used DNNs and the CIFAR-10/100\nand ImageNet datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves $39\\%$ average\nenergy reduction for $1.7\\%$ average accuracy loss and outperforms\nsignificantly the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Addressing\nthis diagnostic odyssey thus have substantial clinical, psychosocial, and\neconomic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features,\nwhich can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical\ndiagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab\ntests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of\ngenome/exome sequencing data. However, existing methods using frontal facial\nphoto were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely\nexclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits\nand demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we\nintroduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based\non the Transformer architecture. It integrates the facial images, demographic\ninformation (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes of patients to improve\nprediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also introduce GestaltGPT, a GPT-based\nmethodology with few-short learning capacities that exclusively harnesses\ntextual inputs using a range of large language models (LLMs) including Llama 2,\nGPT-J and Falcon. We evaluated these methods on a diverse range of datasets,\nincluding 449 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house\ndatasets on Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, NAA10-related syndrome\n(neurodevelopmental syndrome) and others. Our results suggest that\nGestaltMML/GestaltGPT effectively incorporate multiple modalities of data,\ngreatly narrow down candidate genetic diagnosis of rare diseases, and may\nfacilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data.",

However, standard LLMs may\nignore crucial paralinguistic information, such as sentiment, emotion, and\nspeaking style, which are essential for achieving natural, human-like spoken\nconversation, especially when such information is conveyed by acoustic cues. We\ntherefore propose Paralinguistics-enhanced Generative Pretrained Transformer\n(ParalinGPT), an LLM utilizes text and speech modality to better model the\nlinguistic content and paralinguistic attribute of spoken response. The model\ntakes the conversational context of text, speech embeddings, and paralinguistic\nattributes as input prompts within a serialized multitasking multi-modal\nframework. Specifically, our framework serializes tasks in the order of current\nparalinguistic attribute prediction, response paralinguistic attribute\nprediction, and response text generation with autoregressive conditioning. We\nutilize the Switchboard-1 corpus, including its sentiment labels to be the\nparalinguistic attribute, as our spoken dialogue dataset. Experimental results\nindicate the proposed serialized multitasking method outperforms typical\nsequence classification techniques on current and response sentiment\nclassification. Furthermore, leveraging conversational context and speech\nembeddings significantly improves both response text generation and sentiment\nprediction.

                "abstract": "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, bright ($\\sim$Jy)\nextragalactic bursts, whose production mechanism is still unclear. Recently, a\npersistent radio source (PRS) of non-thermal origin was discovered to be\nphysically associated to two of the repeating FRB sources. These two sources\nhave unusually large Rotation Measure (RM) values likely tracing a dense\nmagneto-ionic medium, consistent with a synchrotron radiation originating from\na nebula surrounding the FRB source. Recent theoretical arguments predict that,\nif the observed RM mostly arises from the PRS region, there should be a simple\nrelation between the luminosity of the PRS and the RM 8, 6. We report here the\ndetection of a third, less luminous PRS associated with the nearby FRB\n20201124A at a distance of 413 Mpc, significantly expanding the predicted\nrelation into the low luminosity-low RM regime (<1000 rad/m2). At lower values\nof the RM, the radio luminosity falls below the limit of detection threshold\nfor nowadays radio telescopes. These findings support the idea that the PRS is\ngenerated by a nebula in the FRB environment, and that most FRBs do not show a\nPRS because of a weaker magneto-ionic medium. This is generally consistent with\nmodels foreseeing a young magnetar as the central engine of the FRB, where the\nsurrounding ionized nebula powers the PRS.",

                "abstract": "Dengue incidence forecasting using hybrid models has been surging in the data\nrich world. Hybridization of statistical time series forecasting models and\nmachine learning models are explored for dengue forecasting with different\ndegrees of success. In this paper, we propose a multivariate expansion of the\nhybrid ARIMA-ARNN model. The main motivation is to propose a novel\nhybridization and apply it to dengue outbreak prediction. The asymptotic\nstationarity of the proposed model has been established. We check the\nforecasting capability and robustness of the forecasts through numerical\nexperiments. State-of-the-art forecasting models for multivariate time series\ndata are compared with the proposed model using accuracy metrics. Dengue\nincidence data from San Juan and Iquitos are utilized along with rainfall as an\nexogenous variable. Results indicate that the proposed model improves the\nARIMAX forecasts in some situations and closely follows it otherwise. The\ntheoretical as well as experimental results reinforce that the proposed model\nhas the potential to act as a candidate for early warning of dengue outbreaks.\nThe proposed model can be readily generalized to incorporate more exogenous\nvariables and also applied to other time series forecasting problems wherever\nexogenous variable(s) are available.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Depth completion, aiming to predict dense depth maps from sparse depth\nmeasurements, plays a crucial role in many computer vision related\napplications. Deep learning approaches have demonstrated overwhelming success\nin this task. However, high-precision depth completion without relying on the\nground-truth data, which are usually costly, still remains challenging. The\nreason lies on the ignorance of 3D structural information in most previous\nunsupervised solutions, causing inaccurate spatial propagation and mixed-depth\nproblems. To alleviate the above challenges, this paper explores the\nutilization of 3D perceptual features and multi-view geometry consistency to\ndevise a high-precision self-supervised depth completion method. Firstly, a 3D\nperceptual spatial propagation algorithm is constructed with a point cloud\nrepresentation and an attention weighting mechanism to capture more reasonable\nand favorable neighboring features during the iterative depth propagation\nprocess. Secondly, the multi-view geometric constraints between adjacent views\nare explicitly incorporated to guide the optimization of the whole depth\ncompletion model in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets of NYU-Depthv2 and VOID demonstrate that the proposed model\nachieves the state-of-the-art depth completion performance compared with other\nunsupervised methods, and competitive performance compared with previous\nsupervised methods.",

                "abstract": "Before the seasonal polar ice cap starts to expand towards lower latitudes on\nMars, small frost patches may condensate out during the cold night and they may\nremain on the surface even during the day in shady areas. If ice in these areas\ncan persist before the arrival of the contiguous ice cap, they may remain after\nthe recession of it too, until the irradiation increases and the ice is met\nwith direct sunlight. In case these small patches form periodically at the same\nlocation, slow chemical changes might occur as well. To see the spatial and\ntemporal occurrence of such ice patches, large number of optical images should\nbe searched for and checked. The aim of this study is to survey the ice\ncondensation period on the surface with an automatized method using a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied to High-Resolution Imaging Science\nExperiment (HiRISE) imagery from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. The\nCNN trained to recognise small ice patches is automatizing the search, making\nit feasible to analyse large datasets. Previously a manual image analysis was\nconducted on 110 images from the southern hemisphere, captured by the HiRISE\ncamera. Out of these, 37 images were identified with smaller ice patches, which\nwere used to train the CNN. This approach is applied now to find further images\nwith potential water ice patches in the latitude band between -40{\\deg} and\n-60{\\deg}, but contrarily to the training dataset recorded between\n140-200{\\deg} solar longitude, the images were taken from the condensation\nperiod between Ls = 0{\\deg} to 90{\\deg}. The model was ran on 171 new HiRISE\nimages randomly picked from the given period between -40{\\deg} and -60{\\deg}\nlatitude band, creating 73155 small image chunks. The model classified 2 images\nthat show small, probably recently condensed frost patches and 327 chunks were\npredicted to show ice with more than 60% probability.",

Despite extensive efforts have been invested in\npredicting novel DTIs, existing approaches still suffer from insufficient\nlabeled data and cold start problems. More importantly, there is currently a\nlack of studies focusing on elucidating the mechanism of action (MoA) between\ndrugs and targets. Distinguishing the activation and inhibition mechanisms is\ncritical and challenging in drug development. Here, we introduce a unified\nframework called DTIAM, which aims to predict interactions, binding affinities,\nand activation/inhibition mechanisms between drugs and targets. DTIAM learns\ndrug and target representations from large amounts of label-free data through\nself-supervised pre-training, which accurately extracts the substructure and\ncontextual information of drugs and targets, and thus benefits the downstream\nprediction based on these representations. DTIAM achieves substantial\nperformance improvement over other state-of-the-art methods in all tasks,\nparticularly in the cold start scenario. Moreover, independent validation\ndemonstrates the strong generalization ability of DTIAM. All these results\nsuggested that DTIAM can provide a practically useful tool for predicting novel\nDTIs and further distinguishing the MoA of candidate drugs.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Neural Networks can be efficiently compressed through pruning, significantly\nreducing storage and computational demands while maintaining predictive\nperformance. Simple yet effective methods like Iterative Magnitude Pruning\n(IMP, Han et al., 2015) remove less important parameters and require a costly\nretraining procedure to recover performance after pruning. However, with the\nrise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining has become infeasible due\nto memory and compute constraints. In this study, we challenge the practice of\nretraining all parameters by demonstrating that updating only a small subset of\nhighly expressive parameters is often sufficient to recover or even improve\nperformance compared to full retraining. Surprisingly, retraining as little as\n0.27%-0.35% of the parameters of GPT-architectures (OPT-2.7B/6.7B/13B/30B)\nachieves comparable performance to One Shot IMP across various sparsity levels.\nOur method, Parameter-Efficient Retraining after Pruning (PERP), drastically\nreduces compute and memory demands, enabling pruning and retraining of up to 30\nbillion parameter models on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU within minutes. Despite\nmagnitude pruning being considered as unsuited for pruning LLMs, our findings\nshow that PERP positions it as a strong contender against state-of-the-art\nretraining-free approaches such as Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT\n(Frantar & Alistarh, 2023), opening up a promising alternative to avoiding\nretraining.",

                "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many domains, including\nimage generation, time series prediction, and reinforcement learning. The\nalgorithm demonstrates superior performance over the traditional GAN and\ntransformer based methods. However, the model's capability to follow natural\nlanguage instructions (e.g., spatial relationships between objects, generating\ncomplex scenes) is still unsatisfactory. This has been an important research\narea to enhance such capability. Prior works adopt reinforcement learning to\nadjust the behavior of the diffusion models. However, RL methods not only\nrequire careful reward design and complex hyperparameter tuning, but also fails\nto incorporate rich natural language feedback. In this work, we propose\niterative prompt relabeling (IP-RLDF), a novel algorithm that aligns images to\ntext through iterative image sampling and prompt relabeling. IP-RLDF first\nsamples a batch of images conditioned on the text, then relabels the text\nprompts of unmatched text-image pairs with classifier feedback. We conduct\nthorough experiments on three different models, including SDv2, GLIGEN, and\nSDXL, testing their capability to generate images following instructions. With\nIP-RLDF, we improved up to 15.22% (absolute improvement) on the challenging\nspatial relation VISOR benchmark, demonstrating superior performance compared\nto previous RL methods.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Practical employment of Bayesian trial designs has been rare, in part due to\nthe regulators' requirement to calibrate such designs with an upper bound for\nType 1 error rate. This has led to an internally inconsistent hybrid\nmethodology, where important advantages from applying the Bayesian principles\nare lost. To present an alternative approach, we consider the prototype case of\na 2-arm superiority trial with binary outcomes. The design is adaptive,\napplying block randomization for treatment assignment and using error tolerance\ncriteria based on sequentially updated posterior probabilities, to conclude\nefficacy of the experimental treatment or futility of the trial. The method\nalso contains the option of applying a decision rule for terminating the trial\nearly if the predicted costs from continuing would exceed the corresponding\ngains. We propose that the control of Type 1 error rate be replaced by a\ncontrol of false discovery rate (FDR), a concept that lends itself to both\nfrequentist and Bayesian interpretations. Importantly, if the regulators and\nthe investigators can agree on a consensus distribution to represent their\nshared understanding on the effect sizes, the selected level of risk tolerance\nagainst false conclusions during the data analysis will also be a valid bound\nfor the FDR. The approach can lower the ultimately unnecessary barriers from\nthe practical application of Bayesian trial designs. This can lead to more\nflexible experimental protocols and more efficient use of trial data while\nstill effectively guarding against falsely claimed discoveries.",

This paper proposes an evolutionary\nreinforcement learning agent, integrated within a coarse-to-fine object\ndetection framework, to optimize the scale for more effective detection of\nobjects in such images. Specifically, a set of patches potentially containing\nobjects are first generated. A set of rewards measuring the localization\naccuracy, the accuracy of predicted labels, and the scale consistency among\nnearby patches are designed in the agent to guide the scale optimization. The\nproposed scale-consistency reward ensures similar scales for neighboring\nobjects of the same category. Furthermore, a spatial-semantic attention\nmechanism is designed to exploit the spatial semantic relations between\npatches. The agent employs the proximal policy optimization strategy in\nconjunction with the evolutionary strategy, effectively utilizing both the\ncurrent patch status and historical experience embedded in the agent. The\nproposed model is compared with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark\ndatasets for object detection on drone imagery. It significantly outperforms\nall the compared methods.",

The study reveals that\ndespite minor differences between the MLPs, their agreement on observables such\nas the diffusion constant and pair-correlation functions is excellent,\nespecially for the large training dataset. Variations in the predicted density\nisobars, albeit somewhat larger, are also acceptable, particularly given the\nerrors inherent to approximate density functional theory.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "In district-based multi-party elections, electors cast votes in their\nrespective districts. In each district, the party with maximum votes wins the\ncorresponding seat in the governing body. Election Surveys try to predict the\nelection outcome (vote shares and seat shares of parties) by querying a random\nsample of electors. However, the survey results are often inconsistent with the\nactual results, which could be due to multiple reasons. The aim of this work is\nto estimate a posterior distribution over the possible outcomes of the\nelection, given one or more survey results. This is achieved using a prior\ndistribution over vote shares, election models to simulate the complete\nelection from the vote share, and survey models to simulate survey results from\na complete election. The desired posterior distribution over the space of\npossible outcomes is constructed using Synthetic Dirichlet Likelihoods, whose\nparameters are estimated from Monte Carlo sampling of elections using the\nelection models. We further show the same approach can also use be used to\nevaluate the surveys - whether they were biased or not, based on the true\noutcome once it is known. Our work offers the first-ever probabilistic model to\nanalyze district-based election surveys. We illustrate our approach with\nextensive experiments on real and simulated data of district-based political\nelections in India.",

The proposed\nmethod takes into account the statistics of the process noise, the measurement\nnoise and the uncertain initial condition, following an analogous framework to\nStochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC), but does not rely on the use of a\nparametric system model. As such, our receding-horizon algorithm produces a\nsequence of closed-loop control policies for predicted time steps, as opposed\nto a sequence of open-loop control actions. Under certain conditions, we\nestablish that our proposed data-driven control method produces identical\ncontrol inputs as that produced by the associated model-based SMPC.

This paper investigates the\nfeasibility and potential of model-specific spatial acceleration for LLM\ninference on FPGAs. Our approach involves the specialization of distinct\nhardware units for specific operators or layers, facilitating direct\ncommunication between them through a dataflow architecture while minimizing\noff-chip memory accesses. We introduce a comprehensive analytical model for\nestimating the performance of a spatial LLM accelerator, taking into account\nthe on-chip compute and memory resources available on an FPGA. Through our\nanalysis, we can determine the scenarios in which FPGA-based spatial\nacceleration can outperform its GPU-based counterpart. To enable more\nproductive implementations of an LLM model on FPGAs, we further provide a\nlibrary of high-level synthesis (HLS) kernels that are composable and reusable.\nThis library will be made available as open-source. To validate the\neffectiveness of both our analytical model and HLS library, we have implemented\nBERT and GPT2 on an AMD Alveo U280 FPGA device. Experimental results\ndemonstrate our approach can achieve up to 16.1x speedup when compared to\nprevious FPGA-based accelerators for the BERT model. For GPT generative\ninference, we attain a 2.2x speedup compared to DFX, an FPGA overlay, in the\nprefill stage, while achieving a 1.9x speedup and a 5.7x improvement in energy\nefficiency compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU in the decode stage.",

The model considers a regular\n(two-dimensional) network of structural elements mimicking a discrete number of\nparallel collagen lamellae connected by proteoglycan-based chemical bonds\n(crosslinks). Since the thickness of each collagen lamella is small compared to\nthe overall corneal thickness, we upscale the discrete force balance into a\ncontinuum system of partial differential equations and deduce the corresponding\nmacroscopic stress tensor and strain energy function for the micro-structured\ncorneal tissue. We demonstrate that, for physiological values of the IOP, the\npredictions of the discrete model converge to those of the continuum model. We\nuse the continuum model to simulate the progression of the degenerative disease\nknown as keratoconus, characterized by a localized bulging of the corneal\nshell. We assign a spatial distribution of damage (i. e., reduction of the\nstiffness) to the mechanical properties of the structural elements and predict\nthe resulting macroscopic shape of the cornea, showing that a large reduction\nin the element stiffness results in substantial corneal thinning and a\nsignificant increase in the curvature of both the anterior and posterior\nsurfaces.",

Previous methods typically split a sparse point cloud into several\nlocal patches, upsample patch points, and merge all upsampled patches. However,\nthese methods often produce holes, outliers or nonuniformity due to the\nsplitting and merging process which does not maintain consistency among local\npatches. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an\nunsigned distance field guided by local priors for point cloud upsampling.\nSpecifically, we train a local distance indicator (LDI) that predicts the\nunsigned distance from a query point to a local implicit surface. Utilizing the\nlearned LDI, we learn an unsigned distance field to represent the sparse point\ncloud with patch consistency. At inference time, we randomly sample queries\naround the sparse point cloud, and project these query points onto the\nzero-level set of the learned implicit field to generate a dense point cloud.\nWe justify that the implicit field is naturally continuous, which inherently\nenables the application of arbitrary-scale upsampling without necessarily\nretraining for various scales.

As\na cautionary note on scalability, we identify four sources that can lead to the\nexponential concentration of the observables as the system size grows\n(randomness, hardware noise, entanglement, and global measurements) and show\nhow this can turn QELMs into useless input-agnostic oracles.

However, selecting the\nappropriate time for an intervention is still an open question due to the\ninherent difficulty of implementing on-site monitoring in real-time. This\ndecision is even more critical with insect species that can abruptly increase\npopulation size. A possible solution to enhance decision-making is to apply\nforecasting methods to predict insect abundance. However, another layer of\ncomplexity is added when other covariates are considered in the forecasting,\nsuch as climate time series collected along the monitoring system. Multiple\npossible combinations of climate time series and their lags can be used to\nbuild a forecasting method. Therefore, this research paper proposes a new\napproach to address this problem by combining statistics, machine learning, and\ntime series embedding. We used two datasets containing a time series of aphids\nand climate data collected weekly in Coxilha and Passo Fundo municipalities in\nSouthern Brazil for eight years. We conduct a simulation study based on a\nprobabilistic autoregressive model with exogenous time series based on Poisson\nand negative binomial distributions to check the influence of incorporating\nclimate time series on the performance of our approach. We pre-processed the\ndata using our newly proposed approach and more straightforward approaches\ncommonly used to train machine learning algorithms in time series problems. We\nevaluate the performance of the selected machine algorithms by looking at the\nRoot Mean Squared Error obtained using one-step-ahead forecasting. Based on\nRandom Forests, Lasso-regularised linear regression, and LightGBM regression\nalgorithms, our novel approach yields competitive forecasts while automatically\nselecting insect abundances, climate time series and their lags to aid\nforecasting.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Many factors influence the yielding result of a driver-pedestrian\ninteraction, including traffic volume, vehicle speed, roadway characteristics,\netc. While individual aspects of these interactions have been explored,\ncomprehensive, naturalistic studies, particularly those considering the built\nenvironment's influence on driver-yielding behavior, are lacking. To address\nthis gap, our study introduces an extensive open-source dataset, compiled from\nvideo data at 18 unsignalized intersections across Minnesota. Documenting more\nthan 3000 interactions, this dataset provides a detailed view of\ndriver-pedestrian interactions and over 50 distinct contextual variables. The\ndata, which covers individual driver-pedestrian interactions and contextual\nfactors, is made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/tianyi17/pedestrian_yielding_data_MN.\n  Using logistic regression, we developed a classification model that predicts\ndriver yielding based on the identified variables. Our analysis indicates that\nvehicle speed, the presence of parking lots, proximity to parks or schools, and\nthe width of major road crossings significantly influence driver yielding at\nunsignalized intersections. This study contributes to one of the most\ncomprehensive driver-pedestrian datasets in the US, offering valuable insights\nfor traffic safety improvements. By making this information available, our\nstudy will support communities across Minnesota and the United States in their\nongoing efforts to improve road safety for pedestrians.",

                "abstract": "Knowledge distillation aims to train a compact student network using soft\nsupervision from a larger teacher network and hard supervision from ground\ntruths. However, determining an optimal knowledge fusion ratio that balances\nthese supervisory signals remains challenging. Prior methods generally resort\nto a constant or heuristic-based fusion ratio, which often falls short of a\nproper balance. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptive method for\nlearning a sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio, exploiting both the correctness\nof teacher and student, as well as how well the student mimics the teacher on\neach sample. Our method naturally leads to the intra-sample trilateral\ngeometric relations among the student prediction ($S$), teacher prediction\n($T$), and ground truth ($G$). To counterbalance the impact of outliers, we\nfurther extend to the inter-sample relations, incorporating the teacher's\nglobal average prediction $\\bar{T}$ for samples within the same class. A simple\nneural network then learns the implicit mapping from the intra- and\ninter-sample relations to an adaptive, sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio in a\nbilevel-optimization manner. Our approach provides a simple, practical, and\nadaptable solution for knowledge distillation that can be employed across\nvarious architectures and model sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nconsistent improvements over other loss re-weighting methods on image\nclassification, attack detection, and click-through rate prediction.",

However, considering the enormous\nscale and complex nature of infrastructure, automation is essential for\nimproving the efficiency and quality of inspection operations. One of the core\nproblems in this regard is electing an optimal automated flight path that can\nachieve the mission objectives while minimizing flight time. This paper\npresents an effective formulation for the path planning problem in the context\nof structural inspections. Coverage is guaranteed as a constraint to ensure\ndamage detectability and path length is minimized as an objective, thus\nmaximizing efficiency while ensuring inspection quality. A two-stage algorithm\nis then devised to solve the path planning problem, composed of a genetic\nalgorithm for determining the positions of viewpoints and a greedy algorithm\nfor calculating the poses. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to\ndemonstrate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness and range of applicability.\nApplied examples of the algorithm, including partial space inspection with\nno-fly zones and focused inspection, are also presented, demonstrating the\nflexibility of the proposed method to meet real-world structural inspection\nrequirements.

Fix-Con is capable of\ndetecting and fixing faults introduced in model input, parameters,\nhyperparameters, and the model graph during conversion.\n  Fix-Con uses a set of fault types mined from surveying conversion issues\nraised to localize potential conversion faults in the converted target model,\nand then repairs them appropriately, e.g. replacing the parameters of the\ntarget model with those from the source model. This is done iteratively for\nevery image in the dataset with output label differences between the source\nmodel and the converted target model until all differences are resolved. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of Fix-Con in fixing model conversion bugs of three\nwidely used image recognition models converted across four different deep\nlearning frameworks.

In\nthis paper, we formalise this problem, which we name recourse-aware ensembling,\nand identify several desirable properties which methods for solving it should\nsatisfy. We show that existing ensembling methods, naturally extended in\ndifferent ways to provide CEs, fail to satisfy these properties. We then\nintroduce argumentative ensembling, deploying computational argumentation to\nguarantee robustness of CEs to MM, while also accommodating customisable user\npreferences.

Mud flows\nare modeled as complex fluids akin to gels, where yielding and shear-thinning\nbehaviors arise from inter-particle attraction and clustering. Here we show\nthat the full range of complex flow behaviors previously reported for natural\ndebris flows - dense slurries of soil and water - can be reproduced with\nsuspensions made only of water, sand and clay. Going from sand-rich to\nclay-rich suspensions, we observe a continuous transition from brittle\n(Coulomb-like) to ductile (perfect plastic) yielding that is characterized by\n(i) a decrease in the stress drop associated with yielding, (ii) an increase in\nthe shear-thinning exponent from zero to 1/2, and (iii) a decrease in the\nnormal force.

These procedures, also known\nas randomization tests, provide several important advantages. First, for the\nglobal null hypothesis of significance, our test is valid in finite samples. It\nis also simple to implement and comes with finite-sample guarantees on\nstatistical power. Remarkably, despite its simplicity, this testing idea has\nescaped the attention of earlier analytical work, which mainly concentrated on\ncomplex high-dimensional asymptotic methods. Under an additional assumption of\nGaussian design, we show that this test also achieves the minimax optimal rate\nagainst certain nonsparse alternatives, a type of result that is rare in the\nliterature. Second, for partial null hypotheses, we propose residual-based\ntests and derive theoretical conditions for their validity. These tests can be\nmade powerful by constructing the test statistic in a way that, first, selects\nthe important covariates (e.g., through Lasso) and then orthogonalizes the\nnuisance parameters. We illustrate our results through extensive simulations\nand applied examples. One consistent finding is that the strong finite-sample\nguarantees associated with our procedures result in added robustness when it\ncomes to handling multicollinearity and heavy-tailed covariates.",

The symmetry of the superconducting order\nparameter of this material is still debated, and local odd-frequency states\nhave been proposed to explain some experimental discrepancies. In the\ntemperature range studied, we find that the leading eigenvectors are\nodd-frequency intra-orbital spin-triplet states, while the eigenvectors with\nthe highest predicted transition temperature correspond to even-frequency\nintra-orbital spin-singlet states.

Commonly used implicit backbones to establish accurate\nmodels, however, require many input views and additional annotations such as\nhuman masks, UV maps and depth maps. In this work, we propose ParDy-Human\n(Parameterized Dynamic Human Avatar), a fully explicit approach to construct a\ndigital avatar from as little as a single monocular sequence. ParDy-Human\nintroduces parameter-driven dynamics into 3D Gaussian Splatting where 3D\nGaussians are deformed by a human pose model to animate the avatar. Our method\nis composed of two parts: A first module that deforms canonical 3D Gaussians\naccording to SMPL vertices and a consecutive module that further takes their\ndesigned joint encodings and predicts per Gaussian deformations to deal with\ndynamics beyond SMPL vertex deformations. Images are then synthesized by a\nrasterizer. ParDy-Human constitutes an explicit model for realistic dynamic\nhuman avatars which requires significantly fewer training views and images. Our\navatars learning is free of additional annotations such as masks and can be\ntrained with variable backgrounds while inferring full-resolution images\nefficiently even on consumer hardware.

These models are useful for sequences where each event is associated with\na single item (a single type of event or a \"mark\") -- but such models are not\nsuited for the practical situation where each event is associated with a set of\nitems. In this work, we develop a general framework for modeling set-valued\ndata in continuous-time, compatible with any intensity-based recurrent neural\npoint process model. In addition, we develop inference methods that can use\nsuch models to answer probabilistic queries such as \"the probability of item\n$A$ being observed before item $B$,\" conditioned on sequence history. Computing\nexact answers for such queries is generally intractable for neural models due\nto both the continuous-time nature of the problem setting and the\ncombinatorially-large space of potential outcomes for each event. To address\nthis, we develop a class of importance sampling methods for querying with\nset-based sequences and demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements in\nefficiency over direct sampling via systematic experiments with four real-world\ndatasets.

Most studies\nreported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered\ncontrolled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of\nLADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels.\nSimilarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared modest, with\nonly a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects. Small sample sizes in\nthese studies highlight the need for larger-scale investigations to validate\nthese findings. Notably, LADs showed a relatively substantial impact on student\nparticipation. Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes,\nsuggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning\nenvironments. However, methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on\ntraditional evaluation methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access\nequates to usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as\nrecurring issues.

First, we derive new exact results expressed in the form of\ngeneral formulas: for the average pressure-drop through the pipe as a function\nof the wall shear rate and the viscoelastic axial normal extra-stress, for the\nviscoelastic extra-stress tensor at the axis of symmetry and the Trouton ratio\nof the fluid as function of the fluid velocity at the axis, and for the\nviscoelastic extra-stress tensor along the wall in terms of the tangential\nshear rate at the wall. We then proceed by exploiting the classic lubrication\napproximation, valid for small values of the square of the aspect ratio of the\npipe, to simplify the original governing equations. The final equations are\nsolved analytically using a regular perturbation scheme in terms of the Deborah\nnumber, De, up to eight order in De. For the specific case of a hyperbolic\npipe, we reveal that the pressure-drop and the Trouton ratio (when reduced by\ntheir corresponding Newtonian values) can be recast in terms of a modified\nDeborah number, Dem, and the polymer viscosity ratio, {\\eta}, only.\nFurthermore, we enhance the convergence and accuracy of the eight-order\nsolutions by deriving transformed analytical formulas using Pad\\'e diagonal\napproximants. The results show the decrease of the pressure drop and the\nenhancement of the Trouton ratio with increasing Dem and/or increasing {\\eta}.\nComparison of the transformed solutions with numerical simulations of the\nlubrication equations using pseudospectral methods shows excellent agreement\nbetween the results revealing the robustness, validity and efficiency of the\ntheoretical methods and techniques developed in this work.",

                "abstract": "The $^{16}$Ne nucleus is a two-proton ($2p$) emitter, where an interference\nof two resonances is expected since its core-proton subsystem,\n$^{15}$F$=^{14}$O$+p$, has separate resonances in the $s_{1/2}$ and $d_{5/2}$\nchannels. We theoretically investigate the $2p$ emission from the unbound\n$0^{+}$ state of $^{16}$Ne. To investigate the $2p$-emitting process, we\nperform the time-dependent calculations based on the three-body model of\n$^{14}$O$+p+p$. By evaluating the survival probability, a deviation from the\nexponential decay is obtained. In correspondence, the $2p$-energy spectrum of\n$^{16}$Ne is not of the single resonance, but an interference of the main\nnarrow and the second broad resonances is obtained. In time-dependent\ncalculations, the sequential $1p$-$1p$ emission from $^{16}$Ne is relatively\ndominant as long as the manifest $s_{1/2}$ resonance in $^{15}$F exists. The\ndiproton-correlating emission becomes active only if the $s_{1/2}$ resonance is\nbroad. As conclusion, the $2p$ emission of $^{16}$Ne is one example of the\nmulti-resonance interference in open-quantum systems. The $s_{1/2}$\nintermediate resonance is essential to realize this interference, and induces\nthe sequential emission. The $2p$-decaying state is predicted to have the\nspin-singlet entanglement independently of whether the emission is sequential\nor correlating.",

                "abstract": "This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for generating 3D human pose\ndatasets using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Public datasets generally have\nlimited diversity in terms of human poses and camera viewpoints, largely due to\nthe resource-intensive nature of collecting 3D human pose data. As a result,\npose estimators trained on public datasets significantly underperform when\napplied to unseen out-of-distribution samples. Previous works proposed\naugmenting public datasets by generating 2D-3D pose pairs or rendering a large\namount of random data. Such approaches either overlook image rendering or\nresult in suboptimal datasets for pre-trained models. Here we propose PoseGen,\nwhich learns to generate a dataset (human 3D poses and images) with a feedback\nloss from a given pre-trained pose estimator. In contrast to prior art, our\ngenerated data is optimized to improve the robustness of the pre-trained model.\nThe objective of PoseGen is to learn a distribution of data that maximizes the\nprediction error of a given pre-trained model. As the learned data distribution\ncontains OOD samples of the pre-trained model, sampling data from such a\ndistribution for further fine-tuning a pre-trained model improves the\ngeneralizability of the model. This is the first work that proposes NeRFs for\n3D human data generation. NeRFs are data-driven and do not require 3D scans of\nhumans. Therefore, using NeRF for data generation is a new direction for\nconvenient user-specific data generation. Our extensive experiments show that\nthe proposed PoseGen improves two baseline models (SPIN and HybrIK) on four\ndatasets with an average 6% relative improvement.",

However, by most accounts,\nthe current rate of progress toward accurate and predictive ML-RANS (Reynolds\nAveraged Navier-Stokes) closure models has been much slower than initially\nprojected. The slower-than-expected rate of progress can be attributed to two\nreasons: high initial expectations without a complete comprehension of the\ncomplexity of the turbulence phenomenon, and the use of ML techniques in a\nmanner that may be inconsistent with turbulence physics. To do full justice to\nthe potential of data-driven approaches in turbulence modeling, this article\nseeks to identify the foundational physics challenges underlying turbulence\nclosure modeling and assess whether machine learning techniques can effectively\ntackle them. Drawing analogies with statistical mechanics and stochastic\nsystems, the key physical phenomena and mathematical limitations that render\nturbulence closure modeling complicated are first identified. The inherent\ncapability of ML to overcome each of the identified challenges is then\ninvestigated. The conclusions drawn highlight the limitations of ML-based\nclosures and pave the way for a more judicious framework for the use of ML in\nturbulence modeling. As ML methods evolve (which is happening at a rapid pace)\nand our understanding of the turbulence phenomenon improves, the inferences\nexpressed here should be suitably modified.",

Since sub-series\ncan be generated using fewer steps, SutraNets effectively reduce error\naccumulation and signal path distances. We find SutraNets to significantly\nimprove forecasting accuracy over competitive alternatives on six real-world\ndatasets, including when we vary the number of sub-series and scale up the\ndepth and width of the underlying sequence models.",

                "abstract": "Within the field of complicated multivariate time series forecasting (TSF),\npopular techniques frequently rely on intricate deep learning architectures,\nranging from transformer-based designs to recurrent neural networks. However,\nrecent findings suggest that simple Linear models can surpass sophisticated\nconstructs on diverse datasets. These models directly map observation to\nmultiple future time steps, thereby minimizing error accumulation in iterative\nmulti-step prediction. Yet, these models fail to incorporate spatial and\ntemporal information within the data, which is critical for capturing patterns\nand dependencies that drive insightful predictions. This oversight often leads\nto performance bottlenecks, especially under specific sequence lengths and\ndataset conditions, preventing their universal application. In response, we\nintroduce the SpatioTemporal-Linear (STL) framework. STL seamlessly integrates\ntime-embedded and spatially-informed bypasses to augment the Linear-based\narchitecture. These extra routes offer a more robust and refined regression to\nthe data, particularly when the amount of observation is limited and the\ncapacity of simple linear layers to capture dependencies declines. Empirical\nevidence highlights STL's prowess, outpacing both Linear and Transformer\nbenchmarks across varied observation and prediction durations and datasets.\nSuch robustness accentuates its suitability across a spectrum of applications,\nincluding but not limited to, traffic trajectory and rare disease progression\nforecasting. Through this discourse, we not only validate the STL's distinctive\ncapacities to become a more general paradigm in multivariate time-series\nprediction using deep-learning techniques but also stress the need to tackle\ndata-scarce prediction scenarios for universal application.

Here, each agent can\nbe in one of three states (susceptible, infected, or recovered), and\ntransitions between these states follow a stochastic process. The probability\nof an agent becoming infected depends on the number of its infected neighbors,\nhence all agents are correlated. A common mean-field theory of the same\nstochastic process however, assumes that the agents are statistically\nindependent. This leads to a self-feedback effect in the approximation: when an\nagent infects its neighbors, this infection may subsequently travel back to the\noriginal agent at a later time, leading to a self-infection of the agent which\nis not present in the underlying stochastic process. We here compute the first\norder correction to the mean-field assumption, which takes fluctuations up to\nsecond order in the interaction strength into account. We find that it cancels\nthe self-feedback effect, leading to smaller infection rates. In the SIR model\nand in the SIRS model, the correction significantly improves predictions. In\nparticular, it captures how sparsity dampens the spread of the disease: this\nindicates that reducing the number of contacts is more effective than predicted\nby mean-field models.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Purpose: One of the major reasons that totally implantable cochlear\nmicrophones are not readily available is the lack of good implantable\nmicrophones. An implantable microphone has the potential to provide a range of\nbenefits over external microphones for cochlear implant users including the\nfiltering ability of the outer ear, cosmetics, and usability in all situations.\nThis paper presents results from experiments in human cadaveric ears of a\npiezofilm microphone concept under development as a possible component of a\nfuture implantable microphone system for use with cochlear implants. This\nmicrophone is referred to here as a drum microphone (DrumMic) that senses the\nrobust and predictable motion of the umbo, the tip of the malleus. Methods: The\nperformance was measured of five DrumMics inserted in four different human\ncadaveric temporal bones. Sensitivity, linearity, bandwidth, and equivalent\ninput noise were measured during these experiments using a sound stimulus and\nmeasurement setup. Results: The sensitivity of the DrumMics was found to be\ntightly clustered across different microphones and ears despite differences in\numbo and middle ear anatomy. The DrumMics were shown to behave linearly across\na large dynamic range (46 dB SPL to 100 dB SPL) across a wide bandwidth (100 Hz\nto 8 kHz). The equivalent input noise (0.1-10 kHz) of the DrumMic and amplifier\nreferenced to the ear canal was measured to be 54 dB SPL and estimated to be 46\ndB SPL after accounting for the pressure gain of the outer ear. Conclusion: The\nresults demonstrate that the DrumMic behaves robustly across ears and\nfabrication. The equivalent input noise performance was shown to approach that\nof commercial hearing aid microphones. To advance this demonstration of the\nDrumMic concept to a future prototype implantable in humans, work on\nencapsulation, biocompatibility, connectorization will be required.",

                "abstract": "Lagrangian relaxation is a versatile mathematical technique employed to relax\nconstraints in an optimization problem, enabling the generation of dual bounds\nto prove the optimality of feasible solutions and the design of efficient\npropagators in constraint programming (such as the weighted circuit\nconstraint). However, the conventional process of deriving Lagrangian\nmultipliers (e.g., using subgradient methods) is often computationally\nintensive, limiting its practicality for large-scale or time-sensitive\nproblems. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative unsupervised\nlearning approach that harnesses the capabilities of graph neural networks to\nexploit the problem structure, aiming to generate accurate Lagrangian\nmultipliers efficiently. We apply this technique to the well-known Held-Karp\nLagrangian relaxation for the travelling salesman problem. The core idea is to\npredict accurate Lagrangian multipliers and to employ them as a warm start for\ngenerating Held-Karp relaxation bounds. These bounds are subsequently utilized\nto enhance the filtering process carried out by branch-and-bound algorithms. In\ncontrast to much of the existing literature, which primarily focuses on finding\nfeasible solutions, our approach operates on the dual side, demonstrating that\nlearning can also accelerate the proof of optimality. We conduct experiments\nacross various distributions of the metric travelling salesman problem,\nconsidering instances with up to 200 cities. The results illustrate that our\napproach can improve the filtering level of the weighted circuit global\nconstraint, reduce the optimality gap by a factor two for unsolved instances up\nto a timeout, and reduce the execution time for solved instances by 10%.",

These, together with demographic fluctuations (birth and\ndeath events), have been recognised to drastically alter the population size\nand strain coexistence, as well as the ability of one strain to fixate and take\nover the entire population. Motivated by the need to better understand the\nevolution of AMR, we study a population of time-varying size consisting of two\ncompeting strains, one drug-resistant and one drug-sensitive, subject to\ndemographic and environmental variability. This is modelled by a binary\ncarrying capacity randomly switching between mild and harsh environmental\nconditions, and driving the fluctuating volume (total amount of nutrients and\nantimicrobials at fixed concentration), and thus the size of the community\n(number of resistant and sensitive cells). We assume that AMR is a shared\npublic good when the concentration of resistant cells exceeds a fixed\n\"concentration cooperation threshold\", above which the sensitive strain has a\ngrowth advantage, whereas resistant cells dominate below it. Using\ncomputational means, and devising an analytical treatment (built on suitable\nquenched and annealed averaging procedures), we fully characterise the\ninfluence of fluctuations on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of AMR, and notably\nobtain specific strain fixation and long-lasting coexistence probabilities as a\nfunction of the environmental variation rate and cooperation threshold.",

Recently, deep neural networks\n(DNNs) have been shown to achieve top results in estimating Ki67 expression and\nsimultaneous determination of intratumoral TILs score in breast cancer cells.\nHowever, in the last ten years the extraordinary progress induced by deep\nmodels proliferated at least as much as their resource demand.

To this end, we propose\na resource consumption-aware DNN for the effective estimate of the percentage\nof Ki67-positive cells in breast cancer screenings.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Our online lives generate a wealth of behavioral records -'digital\nfootprints'- which are stored and leveraged by technology platforms. This data\ncan be used to create value for users by personalizing services. At the same\ntime, however, it also poses a threat to people's privacy by offering a highly\nintimate window into their private traits (e.g., their personality, political\nideology, sexual orientation). Prior work has proposed a potential remedy: The\ncloaking of users' footprints. That is, platforms could allow users to hide\nportions of their digital footprints from predictive algorithms to avoid\nundesired inferences. While such an approach has been shown to offer privacy\nprotection in the moment, there are two open questions. First, it remains\nunclear how well cloaking performs over time. As people constantly leave new\ndigital footprints, the algorithm might regain the ability to predict\npreviously cloaked traits. Second, cloaking digital footprints to avoid one\nundesirable inference may degrade the performance of models for other,\ndesirable inferences (e.g., those driving desired personalized content). In the\nlight of these research gaps, our contributions are twofold: 1) We propose a\nnovel cloaking strategy that conceals 'metafeatures' (automatically generated\nhigher-level categories) and compares its effectiveness against existing\ncloaking approaches, and 2) we test the spill-over effects of cloaking one\ntrait on the accuracy of inferences on other traits. A key finding is that the\neffectiveness of cloaking degrades over times, but the rate at which it\ndegrades is significantly smaller when cloaking metafeatures rather than\nindividual footprints. In addition, our findings reveal the expected trade-off\nbetween privacy and personalization: Cloaking an undesired trait also partially\nconceals other desirable traits.",

In this paper we\npropose a novel SVM model in which misclassification costs are considered by\nincorporating performance constraints in the problem formulation.

Such maximal margin\nhyperplane is obtained by solving a quadratic convex problem with linear\nconstraints and integer variables.

Our efforts target the extent of review\nrequired to achieve predefined agreement levels, examining both in-domain and\nout-of-domain data, and considering subjects diagnoses.

We leveraged a comprehensive clinical\ndatabase of additional 8832 PSGs, covering a full spectrum of ages and\nsleep-disorders, to refine the U-Sleep, and to evaluate different\nuncertainty-quantification approaches, including our novel confidence network.\nThe ID data consisted of PSGs scored by over 50 physicians, and the two OOD\nsets comprised recordings each scored by a unique senior physician. Results:\nU-Sleep demonstrated robust performance, with Cohen's kappa (K) at 76.2% on ID\nand 73.8-78.8% on OOD data. The confidence network excelled at identifying\nuncertain predictions, achieving AUROC scores of 85.7% on ID and 82.5-85.6% on\nOOD data. Independently of sleep-disorder status, statistical evaluations\nrevealed significant differences in confidence scores between aligning vs\ndiscording predictions, and significant correlations of confidence scores with\nclassification performance metrics.

Recent discoveries of very-high-energy (VHE, $\\gtrsim\n100$ GeV) afterglow emission from GRB 180720B and GRB 190829A by H.E.S.S. have\nraised questions regarding the emission mechanism responsible. We interpret\nthese observed late-time emission to be the result of inverse Compton emission\nof ultra-relativistic electrons in the GRB blastwave in an external radiation\nfield, i.e., external Compton (EC), considering both the wind and interstellar\nmedium scenarios. We present predictions of multiwavelength light curves and\nenergy spectra, ranging from optical to VHE, and include the synchrotron and\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation mechanisms as well. We corrected the\nEC and SSC model for the $\\gamma$-ray attenuation by absorption of photons\nthrough their interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL). We\ncompared our results to multiwavelength data and found that EC gives a\nsatisfactory fit for a given set of fixed model parameters for GRB 180720B,\nwhereas SSC result in a better fit for GRB 190829A. For both GRBs a wind\nenvironment is preferred over constant density inter-stellar medium, and the\nCosmic Microwave Background as the external radiation field. However, with more\ndata and an effective optimisation tool we can find a more robust fit of the\nmodel, implying better constraints on the GRB environment and the particle\nenergy requirements for the emission observed at late times. This has\nconsequences for future observations of GRBs at these extreme energies.",

This phenomenon refers to the relaxation of observables to\nstationary, non-thermal, values on a finite timescale, despite their long-time\ndynamics being dominated by mean-field effects in the thermodynamic limit.\nHere, we analyze the ``quantum\" violent relaxation by studying the dynamics of\ngeneric many-body systems with two-body, all-to-all, interactions in the\nthermodynamic limit. We show that, in order for violent relaxation to occur\nvery specific conditions on the spectrum of the mean-field effective\nHamiltonian have to be met. These conditions are hardly met and ``quantum\"\nviolent relaxation is observed rarely with respect to its classical\ncounterpart. Our predictions are validated by the study of a spin model which,\ndepending on the value of the coupling, shows a transition between\nviolent-relaxation and a generic prethermal phase. We also analyze a spin\nversion of the quantum Hamiltonian-Mean-Field model, which is shown not to\nexhibit violent-relaxation. Finally, we discuss how the violent-relaxation\npicture emerges back in the classical limit. Our results demonstrate how, even\nin the mean-field regime, quantum effects have a rather dramatic impact on the\ndynamics, paving the way to a better understanding of light-matter coupled\nsystems.",

                "abstract": "Implantable wireless bioelectronic devices enable communication and/or power\ntransfer through RF wireless connections with external nodes. These devices\nencounter notable design challenges due to the lossy nature of the host body,\nwhich significantly diminishes the radiation efficiency of the implanted\nantenna and tightens the wireless link budget. Prior research has yielded\nclosed-form approximate expressions for estimating losses occurring within the\nlossy host body, known as the in-body path loss. To assess the total path loss\nbetween the implanted transmitter and external receiver, this paper focuses on\nthe free-space path loss of the implanted antenna, from the body-air interface\nto the external node. This is not trivial, as in addition to the inherent\nradial spreading of spherical electromagnetic waves common to all antennas,\nimplanted antennas confront additional losses arising from electromagnetic\nscattering at the interface between the host body and air. Employing analytical\nmodeling, we propose closed-form approximate expressions for estimating this\nfree-space path loss. The approximation is formulated as a function of the\nfree-space distance, the curvature radius of the body-air interface, and the\npermittivity of the lossy medium. This proposed method undergoes thorough\nvalidation through numerical calculations, simulations, and measurements for\ndifferent implanted antenna scenarios. This study contributes to a\ncomprehensive understanding of the path loss in implanted antennas and provides\na reliable analytical framework for their efficient design and performance\nevaluation.",

At zero detuning, a parity symmetry renders the TQRM\nreducible to a quantum Rabi model.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "In the fields of computer graphics, computer vision and photogrammetry,\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are a major topic driving current research and\ndevelopment. However, the quality of NeRF-generated 3D scene reconstructions\nand subsequent surface reconstructions, heavily relies on the network output,\nparticularly the density. Regarding this critical aspect, we propose to utilize\nNeRF-Ensembles that provide a density uncertainty estimate alongside the mean\ndensity. We demonstrate that data constraints such as low-quality images and\nposes lead to a degradation of the training process, increased density\nuncertainty and decreased predicted density. Even with high-quality input data,\nthe density uncertainty varies based on scene constraints such as acquisition\nconstellations, occlusions and material properties. NeRF-Ensembles not only\nprovide a tool for quantifying the uncertainty but exhibit two promising\nadvantages: Enhanced robustness and artifact removal. Through the utilization\nof NeRF-Ensembles instead of single NeRFs, small outliers are removed, yielding\na smoother output with improved completeness of structures. Furthermore,\napplying percentile-based thresholds on density uncertainty outliers proves to\nbe effective for the removal of large (foggy) artifacts in post-processing. We\nconduct our methodology on 3 different datasets: (i) synthetic benchmark\ndataset, (ii) real benchmark dataset, (iii) real data under realistic recording\nconditions and sensors.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Cognitive maps are a proposed concept on how the brain efficiently organizes\nmemories and retrieves context out of them. The entorhinal-hippocampal complex\nis heavily involved in episodic and relational memory processing, as well as\nspatial navigation and is thought to built cognitive maps via place and grid\ncells. To make use of the promising properties of cognitive maps, we set up a\nmulti-modal neural network using successor representations which is able to\nmodel place cell dynamics and cognitive map representations. Here, we use\nmulti-modal inputs consisting of images and word embeddings. The network learns\nthe similarities between novel inputs and the training database and therefore\nthe representation of the cognitive map successfully. Subsequently, the\nprediction of the network can be used to infer from one modality to another\nwith over $90\\%$ accuracy. The proposed method could therefore be a building\nblock to improve current AI systems for better understanding of the environment\nand the different modalities in which objects appear. The association of\nspecific modalities with certain encounters can therefore lead to context\nawareness in novel situations when similar encounters with less information\noccur and additional information can be inferred from the learned cognitive\nmap. Cognitive maps, as represented by the entorhinal-hippocampal complex in\nthe brain, organize and retrieve context from memories, suggesting that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could harness similar architectures to\nfunction as a high-level processing center, akin to how the hippocampus\noperates within the cortex hierarchy. Finally, by utilizing multi-modal inputs,\nLLMs can potentially bridge the gap between different forms of data (like\nimages and words), paving the way for context-awareness and grounding of\nabstract concepts through learned associations, addressing the grounding\nproblem in AI.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "An intense low-energy broad luminescence peak (L-peak) is usually observed in\n2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at low temperatures. L-peak has\nearlier been attributed to bound excitons, but its origins are widely debated\nwith direct consequences on optoelectronic properties. To decouple the\ncontributions of physisorbed and chemisorbed oxygen, organic adsorbates, and\nstrain on L-peak, we measured a series of monolayer (ML) MoS2 samples\n(mechanically exfoliated (ME), synthesized by oxygen-assisted chemical vapour\ndeposition (O-CVD), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) covered and hBN\nencapsulated). Emergence of L-peak below 150 K and saturation of\nphotoluminescence (PL) intensity with laser power confirm bound nature of\nL-peak. Anomalously at room temperature, O-CVD samples show high A-exciton PL\n(c.f. ME), but reduced PL at low temperatures, which is attributed to\nstrain-induced direct-to-indirect bandgap change in low defect O-CVD MoS2.\nFurther, L-peak redshifts dramatically ~ 130 meV for O-CVD samples (c.f. ME).\nThese observations are fully consistent with our predictions from density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations, considering effects of both strain and\ndefects, and supported by Raman spectroscopy. In ME samples, charged oxygen\nadatoms are identified as thermodynamically favourable defects which can create\nin-gap states, and contribute to the L-peak. The useful effect of hBN is found\nto originate from reduction of charged oxygen adatoms and hydrocarbon\ncomplexes. This combined experimental-theoretical study allows an enriched\nunderstanding of L-peak and beneficial impact of hBN, and motivates collective\nstudies of strain and defects with direct impact on optoelectronics and quantum\ntechnologies.",

The main innovation is twofold:\nFirstly, we generalize the results of Steinberger and Leeb (2023) for the\nJackknife to a non-continuous response distribution and to the case of\nnon-linear models. Secondly, we show that under a stability assumption the\nprediction intervals via a Jackknife+-approach are closely related to their\nJackknife analogues and therefore share a similar conditional coverage\nprobability. More specifically, this work is split into four parts: in the\nfirst part we introduce the $\\varepsilon$-variational divergence in order to\nlink the prediction interval's coverage probability to the accuracy of\nestimating the distribution of the prediction error. In the second part, we\ndefine an approach based on the Jackknife for the estimation of the prediction\nerror's distribution conditional on the training data. We show that the\nprediction error's distribution can be estimated consistently if two conditions\nare fulfilled: the prediction error should be bounded in probability and the\nprediction algorithm should satisfy a stability condition. In particular, we\nshow that under these two conditions the prediction intervals based on the\nJackknife are asymptotically valid. In the fourth part we draw a connection\nbetween the Jackknife and the Jackknife+ and show that corresponding prediction\nintervals are closely related to each other given the stability condition. In\nthe last part we show that under mild assumptions the conditions for\nasymptotically valid prediction intervals based on the Jackknife or the\nJackknife+ are fulfilled for several predictors.",

In particular, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of this\nclass of functionals by establishing a central limit theorem that allows us to\ndescribe their asymptotic statistical law. In order to account for the fact\nthat the sample sizes of two SCMs are of the same order of magnitude as their\nobservation dimension, results are provided by assuming that these parameters\ngrow to infinity while their quotients converge to fixed quantities.

Event attribute data has mostly been used to predict event\noccurrences and process outcome, but the state of the art neglects to mine\nsuccinct and interpretable rules how event attribute data changes during\nprocess execution. Subgroup discovery and rule-based classification approaches\nlack the ability to capture the sequential dependencies present in event logs,\nand thus lead to unsatisfactory results with limited insight into the process\nbehavior.\n  Given an event log, we are interested in finding accurate yet succinct and\ninterpretable if-then rules how the process modifies data. We formalize the\nproblem in terms of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, by which we\nchoose the model with the best lossless description of the data.

A\nkey element of our proposal involves computing development factors, which may\nbe influenced by both the accident date and other features. These development\nfactors serve as the basis for predictions. While we assume close to continuous\nobservations of accident date and reporting delay, the development factors can\nbe expressed at any level of granularity, such as months, quarters, or year and\npredictions across different granularity levels exhibit coherence. The\ncalculation of development factors relies on the estimation of a hazard\nfunction in reverse development time, and we present three distinct methods for\nestimating this function: the Cox proportional hazard model, a feed-forward\nneural network, and xgboost (eXtreme gradient boosting). In all three cases,\nestimation is based on the same partial likelihood that accommodates left\ntruncation and ties in the data.

Qualitative\nagreement between model results and PDG as well as LQCD data is obtained.\nVarious predictions for the radiative decays can be tested in e.g., GlueX and\nCLAS12 experiments at Jefferson Lab. After applying the chiral model for\nwell-established spin-2 mesons (with $J^{PC}=2^{++}$), I move on to their\nchiral partners (the axial-tensor mesons with $J^{PC}=2^{++}$), where the\nresonances are still missing. Large decay widths are predicted in the chiral\nmodel as well as in LQCD simulations.Furthermore, I describe the decays of the\nspin-2 tensor glueball $G_2(???)$ within the eLSM, which can be helpful in\nfuture experimental searches e.g., BESIII and LHCb experiments. Some isoscalar\ntensor resonances of PDG with a mass of around 2 GeV are studied, and at\npresent, the best tensor glueball candidate turns out to be the broad resonance\n$f_2(1950)$. In the case of the ground-state spin-3 mesons ($J^{PC}=3^{--}$),\nour chiral model is limited to the $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry because of the yet\nunknown chiral partners ($J^{PC}=3^{++}$). The effective model results are in\ngood agreement with the PDG data and LQCD results, and the predictions for the\nradiative decays can be interesting for photoproduction experiments such as\nGlueX and CLAS12. Additional estimates for the decay ratios of the $G_3(???)$\ntensor glueball with $J^{PC}=3^{--}$ are also presented. The role of the\nglueball spectrum at non-zero temperature is explored within the Glueball\nResonance Gas model below the critical temperature of the pure Yang-Mills\nsector of the QCD phase diagram. It turns out that the latest glueball spectrum\nfrom LQCD can well describe the pressure up to almost the critical temperature.",

Further,\nthe two-equation model formulations cannot capture the intricacies of vortex\nflow and its interaction with the surroundings in confined swirling flows.\nLPS-RSM, which considers turbulence anisotropy, showed some promise, although\noverpredicted results follow the trend with experimental values at the primary\nholes plane. However, at dilution holes plane, the model overpredicted the\nvelocity field and underestimated turbulence field, including turbulent kinetic\nenergy and shear stress. These observed discrepancies can be ascribed to the\npressure-strain correlation in the LPS-RSM, which assumes the pressure is a\nlinear function of the strain-rate tensor. However, for complex flows, this\nlinear assumption is quite simplistic. Hence, this study suggests that more\nadvanced turbulence models such as non-LPS-RSM are needed to accurately predict\nthe confined swirling flow in combustors.",

This\nhybrid model exhibits high predictive accuracy at a low computational cost and\nwas used to implement hybrid MPC, which optimizes the throttle, pitch angle,\nand roll angle for position tracking. The controller performance was validated\nin real-world experiments, which obtained a 57% tracking error reduction\ncompared with conventional nonlinear MPC.

Despite the memorizing of historical samples, the\nrequest of unlearning, i.e., to remove the effect of certain training samples,\nalso occurs for reasons such as user privacy or model fidelity. However,\nexisting studies on unlearning are not tailored for the session-based\nrecommendation. On the one hand, these approaches cannot achieve satisfying\nunlearning effects due to the collaborative correlations and sequential\nconnections between the unlearning item and the remaining items in the session.\nOn the other hand, seldom work has conducted the research to verify the\nunlearning effectiveness in the session-based recommendation scenario. In this\npaper, we propose SRU, a session-based recommendation unlearning framework,\nwhich enables high unlearning efficiency, accurate recommendation performance,\nand improved unlearning effectiveness in session-based recommendation.\nSpecifically, we first partition the training sessions into separate sub-models\naccording to the similarity across the sessions, then we utilize an\nattention-based aggregation layer to fuse the hidden states according to the\ncorrelations between the session and the centroid of the data in the sub-model.\nTo improve the unlearning effectiveness, we further propose three extra data\ndeletion strategies, including collaborative extra deletion (CED), neighbor\nextra deletion (NED), and random extra deletion (RED). Besides, we propose an\nevaluation metric that measures whether the unlearning sample can be inferred\nafter the data deletion to verify the unlearning effectiveness.

Existing techniques predominantly emphasize either the feature\nrepresentation space or the gradient norms computed with respect to DNN\nparameters, yet they overlook the intricate gradient distribution and the\ntopology of classification regions. To address this gap, we introduce\nGRadient-aware Out-Of-Distribution detection in interpolated manifolds (GROOD),\na novel framework that relies on the discriminative power of gradient space to\ndistinguish between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. To build this space,\nGROOD relies on class prototypes together with a prototype that specifically\ncaptures OOD characteristics. Uniquely, our approach incorporates a targeted\nmix-up operation at an early intermediate layer of the DNN to refine the\nseparation of gradient spaces between ID and OOD samples. We quantify OOD\ndetection efficacy using the distance to the nearest neighbor gradients derived\nfrom the training set, yielding a robust OOD score. Experimental evaluations\nsubstantiate that the introduction of targeted input mix-upamplifies the\nseparation between ID and OOD in the gradient space, yielding impressive\nresults across diverse datasets.

                "abstract": "This article deals with the location problem for balancing the service\nefficiency and equality. In public service systems, some people may feel envy\nin case that they need longer travel distance to access services than others.\nThe strength of the envy can be measured by comparing one's travel distance to\nservice facility with a threshold distance. Using the total envy function, four\nextended p-median problems are proposed for trade-off between service\nefficiency and equality. Five analytical properties of the new problems are\nmathematically proven. The new problems were tested on three sets of\nwell-designed instances. The experimentation shows that the equality measures,\nsuch as the standard deviation, the mean absolute deviation, and the Gini\ncoefficient between travel distances, can be substantially improved by\nminimizing the travel cost and the spatial envy. The experimentation also shows\nthat, when the service supply is given in terms of the number of facilities,\nthe service equality can be considerably improved by slightly increasing the\ntravel distance. When the service supply is increased in terms of the number of\nfacilities, both the service efficiency and spatial equality can be\nsignificantly improved.",

Despite the promising advances, existing studies all\nfollow the assumption that data distribution observed during model learning\nmatches that encountered in real-world deployments. However, this assumption\noften does not hold in practice, as inherent distribution shifts might exist in\nthe mobility patterns for deployment environments, thus leading to poor domain\ngeneralization and performance degradation. Consequently, it is appealing to\nleverage trajectories from multiple source domains to mitigate such\ndiscrepancies for multi-agent trajectory prediction task. However, the\ndevelopment of multi-source domain generalization in this task presents two\nnotable issues: (1) negative transfer; (2) inadequate modeling for external\nfactors. To address these issues, we propose a new causal formulation to\nexplicitly model four types of features: domain-invariant and domain-specific\nfeatures for both the focal agent and neighboring agents. Building upon the new\nformulation, we propose AdapTraj, a multi-source domain generalization\nframework specifically tailored for multi-agent trajectory prediction.

In this study, we disregard the spin characteristic of the twisted\nparticle, modeling it as a massless complex twisted scalar wave packet to\nsimplify its interaction with gravitational fields. Building on this\nsimplification, we investigate the gravitational birefringence of the twisted\nparticle by analyzing the center of its energy density. We demonstrate that the\ngravitational birefringence induced by OAM can potentially exceed that induced\nby spin by several orders of magnitude, significantly enhancing its\ndetectability. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the nonminimal coupling\nterm $\\lambda R|\\phi|^2$ on the propagation of the twisted particle through the\ninternal gravitational field of a star. Contrary to the predictions of the\nMathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, our findings show that the trajectory of\nthe twisted particle under nonminimal coupling differs from that in the minimal\ncoupling scenario. Specifically, we find that for a positive nonminimal\ncoupling constant, the trajectory of the twisted particle is expected to\ndeviate away from the stellar center, compared to the minimal coupling\nscenario, and this deviation is independent of the particle's OAM.

Visible watermark removal aims to eliminate\nthe interference of watermarks and restore the background content. However,\nexisting methods often implement watermark component removal and background\nrestoration tasks within a singular branch, leading to residual watermarks in\nthe predictions and ignoring cases where watermarks heavily obscure the\nbackground. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Removing\nInterference and Recovering Content Imaginatively (RIRCI) framework.

To achieve meticulous background restoration,\nour proposed model employs a dual-path network capable of fully exploring the\nintrinsic background information beneath semi-transparent watermarks and\nperipheral contextual information from unaffected regions. Moreover, a Global\nand Local Context Interaction module is built upon multi-layer perceptrons and\nbidirectional feature transformation for comprehensive representation modeling\nin the background restoration phase.

                "abstract": "A data-driven model for predicting the surface temperature using neural\nnetworks was proposed to alleviate the computational burden of numerical\nweather prediction (NWP). Our model, named TPTNet uses only 2m temperature\nmeasured at the weather stations of the South Korean Peninsula as input to\npredict the local temperature at finite forecast hours. The turbulent\nfluctuation component of the temperature was extracted from the station\nmeasurements by separating the climatology component accounting for the yearly\nand daily variations. The effect of station altitude was then compensated by\nintroducing a potential temperature. The resulting turbulent potential\ntemperature data at irregularly distributed stations were used as input for\npredicting the turbulent potential temperature at forecast hours through three\ntrained networks based on convolutional neural network (CNN), Swin Transformer,\nand a graphic neural network (GNN). The prediction performance of our network\nwas compared with that of persistence and NWP, confirming that our model\noutperformed NWP for up to 12 forecast hours.",

In this paper, we have\nidentified the challenges involved in implementing CNNs for macroscale model\nclosure in the turbulent flow regime, particularly in the prediction of the\ndrag force components arising from the microscale level. We report that\nsignificant error is incurred in the crucial data preparation step when the\nReynolds averaged pressure and velocity distributions are interpolated from\nunstructured stretched grids used for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to the\nstructured uniform grids used by the CNN model. We show that the range of the\nmicroscale velocity values is 10 times larger than the range of the pressure\nvalues. This invalidates the use of the mean squared error loss function to\ntrain the CNN model for multivariate prediction. We have developed a CNN model\nframework that addresses these challenges by proposing a conservative\ninterpolation method and a normalized mean squared error loss function. We\nsimulated a model dataset to train the CNN for turbulent flow prediction in\nperiodic porous media composed of cylindrical solid obstacles with square\ncross-section by varying the porosity in the range 0.3 to 0.88. We demonstrate\nthat the resulting CNN model predicts the pressure and viscous drag forces with\nless than 10% mean absolute error when compared to LES while offering a speedup\nof O(10^6).",

                "abstract": "Typical investors start off the day by going through the daily news to get an\nintuition about the performance of the market. The speculations based on the\ntone of the news ultimately shape their responses towards the market. Today,\ncomputers are being trained to compute the news sentiment so that it can be\nused as a variable to predict stock market movements and returns. Some\nresearchers have even developed news-based market indices to forecast stock\nmarket returns. Majority of the research in the field of news sentiment\nanalysis has focussed on using libraries like Vader, Loughran-McDonald (LM),\nHarvard IV and Pattern. However, are the popular approaches for measuring\nfinancial news sentiment really approaching the problem of sentiment analysis\ncorrectly? Our experiments suggest that measuring sentiments using these\nlibraries, especially for financial news, fails to depict the true picture and\nhence may not be very reliable. Therefore, the question remains: What is the\nmost effective and accurate approach to measure financial news sentiment? Our\npaper explores these questions and attempts to answer them through SENTInews: a\none-of-its-kind financial news sentiment analyzer customized to the Indian\ncontext",

This can lead to incorrect predictions by\neven the best forecasting models. Using more training data is one way to\nimprove the accuracy, but this source is often limited. In contrast, we are\nbuilding on successful denoising approaches for image generation by advocating\nfor an end-to-end forecasting and denoising paradigm.\n  We propose an end-to-end forecast-blur-denoise forecasting framework by\nencouraging a division of labors between the forecasting and the denoising\nmodels. The initial forecasting model is directed to focus on accurately\npredicting the coarse-grained behavior, while the denoiser model focuses on\ncapturing the fine-grained behavior that is locally blurred by integrating a\nGaussian Process model. All three parts are interacting for the best end-to-end\nperformance. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach\nis able to improve the forecasting accuracy of several state-of-the-art\nforecasting models as well as several other denoising approaches.",

Tags provide a\nconcise feature dimension for users to locate their interested posts and for\nsearch engines to index the most relevant posts according to the queries.\nHowever, most tags are only focused on the technical perspective (e.g., program\nlanguage, platform, tool). In most cases, forum posts in online developer\ncommunities reveal the author's intentions to solve a problem, ask for advice,\nshare information, etc. The modeling of the intentions of posts can provide an\nextra dimension to the current tag taxonomy. By referencing previous studies\nand learning from industrial perspectives, we create a refined taxonomy for the\nintentions of technical forum posts. Through manual labeling and analysis on a\nsampled post dataset extracted from online forums, we understand the relevance\nbetween the constitution of posts (code, error messages) and their intentions.\nFurthermore, inspired by our manual study, we design a pre-trained\ntransformer-based model to automatically predict post intentions.

Although purely\nreactive controllers work well with single neurons and other simple neural\nsystems, more sophisticated techniques are likely to be needed to control\ncomplex circuits and systems with nonlinear recurrent dynamics, high levels of\nexogenous noise, and limited information about the connectivity and state of\nthe network. One potential approach is model predictive control (MPC), which\nuses a dynamical model to find optimal control inputs by forecasting how the\nsystem will respond. However, the challenge still remains of selecting the\nright model, constraining its parameters, and synchronizing to the neural\nsystem. As a proof of principle, we used recent advances in data-driven\nforecasting to construct a nonlinear machine-learning model of a Hodgkin-Huxley\ntype neuron when only the membrane voltage is observable and there are an\nunknown number of intrinsic currents. We show that this approach is able to\nlearn the dynamics of different neuron types and can be used with MPC to force\nthe neuron to engage in arbitrary, researcher-defined spiking behaviors.",

Towards this goal, we generalize the recently\nproposed stochastic gates (STG) Yamada et al.

Our new scheme, termed\nconditional-STG (c-STG), comprises two networks: a hypernetwork that\nestablishes the mapping between contextual variables and probabilistic feature\nselection parameters and a prediction network that maps the selected feature to\nthe response variable. Training the two networks simultaneously ensures the\ncomprehensive incorporation of context and feature selection within a unified\nmodel. We provide a theoretical analysis to examine several properties of the\nproposed framework. Importantly, our model leads to improved flexibility and\nadaptability of feature selection and, therefore, can better capture the\nnuances and variations in the data. We apply c-STG to simulated and real-world\ndatasets, including healthcare, housing, and neuroscience, and demonstrate that\nit effectively selects contextually meaningful features, thereby enhancing\npredictive performance and interpretability.",

A\nDark Sink transports energy density from the DM into light dark-sector states\nthat do not appreciably contribute to the DM density. As an example, we\nconsider a light, neutral fermion $\\psi$ which interacts solely with DM $\\chi$\nvia the exchange of a heavy scalar $\\Phi$. We illustrate the impact of a Dark\nSink by adding one to a DM freeze-in model in which $\\chi$ couples to a light\ndark photon $\\gamma '$ which kinetically mixes with the Standard Model (SM)\nphoton. This freeze-in model (absent the sink) is itself a benchmark for\nongoing experiments. In some cases, the literature for this benchmark has\ncontained errors; we correct the predictions and provide them as a public code.\nWe then analyze how the Dark Sink modifies this benchmark, solving coupled\nBoltzmann equations for the dark-sector energy density and DM yield. We check\nthe contribution of the Dark Sink $\\psi$'s to dark radiation; consistency with\nexisting data limits the maximum attainable cross section. For DM with a mass\nbetween $\\text{MeV} -\\mathcal{O}(10\\text{ GeV})$, adding the Dark Sink can\nincrease predictions for the direct detection cross section all the way up to\nthe current limits.",

While recent approaches adapt VLMs to driving\nvia single-round visual question answering (VQA), human drivers reason about\ndecisions in multiple steps. Starting from the localization of key objects,\nhumans estimate object interactions before taking actions. The key insight is\nthat with our proposed task, Graph VQA, where we model graph-structured\nreasoning through perception, prediction and planning question-answer pairs, we\nobtain a suitable proxy task to mimic the human reasoning process. We\ninstantiate datasets (DriveLM-Data) built upon nuScenes and CARLA, and propose\na VLM-based baseline approach (DriveLM-Agent) for jointly performing Graph VQA\nand end-to-end driving. The experiments demonstrate that Graph VQA provides a\nsimple, principled framework for reasoning about a driving scene, and\nDriveLM-Data provides a challenging benchmark for this task. Our DriveLM-Agent\nbaseline performs end-to-end autonomous driving competitively in comparison to\nstate-of-the-art driving-specific architectures.

                "abstract": "Dual-unitary quantum circuits have recently attracted attention as an\nanalytically tractable model of many-body quantum dynamics. Consisting of a\n1+1D lattice of 2-qudit gates arranged in a 'brickwork' pattern, these models\nare defined by the constraint that each gate must remain unitary under swapping\nthe roles of space and time. This dual-unitarity restricts the dynamics of\nlocal operators in these circuits: the support of any such operator must grow\nat the effective speed of light of the system, along one or both of the edges\nof a causal light cone set by the geometry of the circuit. Using this property,\nit is shown here that for 1+1D dual-unitary circuits the set of width-$w$\nconserved densities (constructed from operators supported over $w$ consecutive\nsites) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of width-$w$ solitons -\noperators which, up to a multiplicative phase, are simply spatially translated\nat the effective speed of light by the dual-unitary dynamics. A number of ways\nto construct these many-body solitons (explicitly in the case where the local\nHilbert space dimension $d=2$) are then demonstrated: firstly, via a simple\nconstruction involving products of smaller, constituent solitons; and secondly,\nvia a construction which cannot be understood as simply in terms of products of\nsmaller solitons, but which does have a neat interpretation in terms of\nproducts of fermions under a Jordan-Wigner transformation. This provides\npartial progress towards a characterisation of the microscopic structure of\ncomplex many-body solitons (in dual-unitary circuits on qubits), whilst also\nestablishing a link between fermionic models and dual-unitary circuits,\nadvancing our understanding of what kinds of physics can be explored in this\nframework.",

Driven by the need to fill this gap, we develop a framework\nthat learns mathematical expressions modeling complex dynamical behaviors by\nidentifying differential equations from noisy and sparse observable data. We\ntrain a small neural network to learn the dynamics of a system, its rate of\nchange in time, and missing model terms, which are used as input for a symbolic\nregression algorithm to autonomously distill the explicit mathematical terms.\nThis, in turn, enables us to predict the future evolution of the dynamical\nbehavior. The performance of this framework is validated by recovering the\nright-hand sides and unknown terms of certain complex, chaotic systems such as\nthe well-known Lorenz system, a six-dimensional hyperchaotic system, and the\nnon-autonomous Sprott chaotic system, and comparing them with their known\nanalytical expressions.",

                "abstract": "Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to localize action\ninstances in videos with only video-level action labels. Existing methods\nmainly embrace a localization-by-classification pipeline that optimizes the\nsnippet-level prediction with a video classification loss. However, this\nformulation suffers from the discrepancy between classification and detection,\nresulting in inaccurate separation of foreground and background (F\\&B)\nsnippets. To alleviate this problem, we propose to explore the underlying\nstructure among the snippets by resorting to unsupervised snippet clustering,\nrather than heavily relying on the video classification loss. Specifically, we\npropose a novel clustering-based F\\&B separation algorithm. It comprises two\ncore components: a snippet clustering component that groups the snippets into\nmultiple latent clusters and a cluster classification component that further\nclassifies the cluster as foreground or background. As there are no\nground-truth labels to train these two components, we introduce a unified\nself-labeling mechanism based on optimal transport to produce high-quality\npseudo-labels that match several plausible prior distributions. This ensures\nthat the cluster assignments of the snippets can be accurately associated with\ntheir F\\&B labels, thereby boosting the F\\&B separation.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "In 1984, 't Hooft famously used a brickwall (aka stretched horizon) to\ncompute black hole entropy up to a numerical pre-factor. This calculation is\nsometimes interpreted as due to the entanglement of the modes across the\nhorizon, but more operationally, it is simply an indirect count of the\nsemi-classical modes trapped between the stretched horizon and the angular\nmomentum barrier. Because the calculation was indirect, it needed both the mass\nand the temperature of the black hole as inputs, to reproduce the area. A more\nconventional statistical mechanics calculation should be able to get the\nentropy, once the ensemble is specified (say via the energy, in a\nmicrocanonical setting). In this paper, we explicitly compute black hole normal\nmodes in various examples, numerically as well as (in various regimes)\nanalytically. The explicit knowledge of normal modes allows us to reproduce\n$both$ the Hawking temperature as well as the entropy, once the charges are\nspecified, making this a conventional statistical mechanics calculation. A\nquasi-degeneracy in the angular quantum numbers is directly responsible for the\narea scaling of the entropy, and is the key distinction between the Planckian\nblack body calculation (volume scaling) and the 't Hooftian calculation (area\nscaling). We discuss the (rotating) BTZ case in detail and match the\nthermodynamic quantities $exactly$. Schwarzschild and Kerr normal modes are\ndiscussed in less detail using near-horizon approximations. Our calculations\nreveal a new hierarchy in the angular quantum numbers, which we speculate is\nrelated to string theory.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Recent observations on type III algebras in AdS/CFT raise the possibility\nthat smoothness of the black hole horizon is an emergent feature of the\nlarge-$N$ limit. In this paper, we present a $bulk$ toy model for the\nfinite-$N$ mechanism underlying this transition. We quantize a free scalar\nfield on a BTZ black hole with a Planckian stretched horizon placed as a\nDirichlet boundary for the field. This is a tractable model for the stretched\nhorizon that does not ignore the angular directions, and it defines a black\nhole vacuum which has similarities to (but is distinct from) the Boulware\nstate. Using analytic approximations for the normal modes, we first improve\nupon 't Hooft's brick wall calculation: we are able to match $both$ the entropy\nand the temperature, $exactly$. Emboldened by this, we compute the boundary\nWightman function of the scalar field in a typical pure state built on our\nstretched horizon vacuum, at an energy sliver at the mass of the black hole. A\nkey result is that despite the manifest lack of smoothness, this single-sided\npure state calculation yields precisely the Hartle-Hawking thermal correlator\nassociated to the smooth horizon, in the small-$G_N$ limit. At finite $G_N$,\nthere are variance corrections that are suppressed as\n$\\mathcal{O}(e^{-S_{BH}/2})$. They become important at late times and resolve\nMaldacena's information paradox. Highly excited typical pure states on the\nstretched horizon vacuum are therefore models for black hole microstates, while\nthe smooth horizon describes the thermal state. We note that heavy excited\nstates on the stretched horizon are better defined than the vacuum itself.\nThese results suggest that complementarity in the bulk EFT could arise from a\nUV complete bulk description in which the black hole interior is not manifest.",

The corresponding functional model is determined by a function living\non a dense subspace of the RKHS of interest, which has a tractable parametric\nform based on linear combinations of the kernel. By imposing a suitable prior\ndistribution on this functional space, we can naturally perform data-driven\ninference via standard Bayes methodology, estimating the posterior distribution\nthrough Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In this context, our\ncontribution is two-fold. First, we derive a theoretical result that guarantees\nposterior consistency in these models, based on an application of a classic\ntheorem of Doob to our RKHS setting.

This process is understood in\nfully ionized, magnetohydrodynamic plasmas. However, many plasma environments,\nsuch as star-forming molecular clouds and the solar chromosphere, are poorly\nionized. We use theory and computation to study tearing-mediated reconnection\nin such poorly ionized systems. In this paper, we focus on the onset and linear\nevolution of this process. In poorly ionized plasmas, magnetic nulls on scales\nbelow $v_{\\rm A,n0}/\\nu_{\\rm ni0}$, with $v_{\\rm A,n0}$ the neutral Alfv\\'{e}n\nspeed and $\\nu_{\\rm ni0}$ the neutral-ion collision frequency, will\nself-sharpen via ambipolar diffusion. This sharpening occurs at an increasing\nrate, inhibiting the onset of reconnection. Once the CS becomes thin enough,\nhowever, ions decouple from neutrals and thinning of the CS slows, allowing\ntearing to onset in a time of order $\\nu_{\\rm ni0}^{-1}$. We find that the\nwavelength and growth rate of the mode that first disrupts the forming sheet\ncan be predicted from a poorly ionized tearing dispersion relation; as the\nplasma recombination rate increases and ionization fraction decreases, the\ngrowth rate becomes an increasing multiple of $\\nu_{ni0}$ and the wavelength\nbecomes a decreasing fraction of $v_{\\rm A,n0}/\\nu_{\\rm ni0}$.",

From the obtained\nresults, we have observed that BOPINN can accurately estimate wave velocities\nwith lower MSE, even in the presence of noisy conditions. The proposed\nalgorithm shows robust predictions in limited iterations across different runs.",

For two or\nmore sensors this algorithm finds a set of sensor locations (design point)\nwhich predicts angle of attack to within 0.10 degrees and ranks within the top\n1% of all possible design points found by brute force search. We demonstrate\nthis algorithm on several variations of airfoil sections of infinite and finite\nwings in clean and noisy data, evaluate model sensitivities, and show that the\nalgorithm can be used to identify an appropriate number of sensors for a given\naccuracy requirement.

They are common in dense environments and they have a relatively shallow\npotential well, making them prone to heating by interactions. When an\ninteraction induces bar formation, the bar should rotate slowly. They reside in\nmassive and centrally-concentrated dark matter halos, which slow down the bar\nrotation through dynamical friction. While predictions suggest that slow bars\nshould be common, measurements of bar pattern speed, using the\nTremaine-Weinberg method, show that bars are mostly fast in the local Universe.\nWe present a photometric and kinematic characterisation of bars hosted by two\ndwarf galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, NGC 4483 and NGC 4516. We derive the bar\nlength and strength using the Next Generation Virgo Survey imaging and the\ncircular velocity, bar pattern speed, and rotation rate using spectroscopy from\nthe Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. Including the previously studied galaxy\nIC 3167, we compare the bar properties of the three dwarf galaxies with those\nof their massive counterparts from literature. Bars in the dwarf galaxies are\nshorter and weaker, and rotate slightly slower with respect to those in massive\ngalaxies. This could be due to a different bar formation mechanism and/or to a\nlarge dark matter fraction in the centre of dwarf galaxies. We show that it is\npossible to push the application of the Tremaine-Weinberg method to the galaxy\nlow mass regime.",

We motivate the hypothesis that LLMs capture topic structure by\nconnecting LLM optimization to implicit Bayesian inference. De Finetti's\ntheorem shows that exchangeable probability distributions can be represented as\na mixture with respect to a latent generating distribution. Although text is\nnot exchangeable at the level of syntax, exchangeability is a reasonable\nstarting assumption for topic structure. We thus hypothesize that predicting\nthe next token in text will lead LLMs to recover latent topic distributions.

Sulfur, being one of the most abundant elements in\nplanet-forming environments, is of great significance, and now observable in\nexoplanets with JWST. However, planetary formation models currently lack vital\nknowledge regarding sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks. Developing a\ndeeper understanding of the major volatile sulfur carriers in disks is\nessential to building models that can meaningfully predict planetary\natmospheric composition, and reconstruct planetary formation pathways. In this\nwork, we combine archival observations with new data from ALMA and APEX,\ncovering a range of sulfur-bearing species/isotopologs. We interpret this data\nusing the DALI thermo-chemical code, for which our model is highly refined and\ndisk-specific. We find that volatile sulfur is heavily depleted from the cosmic\nvalue by a factor of 1000, with a disk-averaged abundance of S/H = 1e-8. We\nshow that the gas-phase sulfur abundance varies radially by 3 orders of\nmagnitude, with the highest abundances inside the inner dust ring and\ncoincident with the outer dust ring at 150 to 230 au. Extracting chemical\nabundances from our models, we find OCS, H2CS, and CS to be the dominant\nmolecular carriers in the gas phase. We also infer the presence of a\nsubstantial OCS ice reservoir.

This mixed\nphase simultaneously possesses both confining and deconfining phases in thermal\nequilibrium. Unexpectedly, the local critical temperature of the phase\ntransition at the rotation axis does not depend on the angular frequency within\na few percent accuracy. Even more surprisingly, an analytic continuation of our\nresults to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates a profound breaking\nof the Tolman-Ehrenfest law in the vicinity of the phase transition, with the\nconfining (deconfining) phase appearing far (near) the rotation axis.",

Our framework consists of five core modules:\n(i) an object state estimator that learns object trajectory prediction, (ii) a\ncatching pose quality network that learns to score and rank object poses for\ncatching, (iii) a reaching control policy trained to move the robot hand to\npre-catch poses, (iv) a grasping control policy trained to perform soft\ncatching motions for safe and robust grasping, and (v) a gating network trained\nto synthesize the actions given by the reaching and grasping policy. The former\ntwo modules are trained via supervised learning and the latter three use deep\nreinforcement learning in a simulated environment. We conduct extensive\nevaluations of our framework in simulation for each module and the integrated\nsystem, to demonstrate high success rates of in-flight catching and robustness\nto perturbations and sensory noise.

                "abstract": "Metamaterials open up a new way to manipulate electromagnetic waves and\nrealize various functional devices. Metamaterials with high-quality (Q)\nresonance responses are widely employed in sensing, detection, and other\napplications. Traditional design of metamaterials involves laborious\nsimulation-optimization and limits the efficiency. The high-Q metamaterials\nwith abrupt spectral change are even harder to reverse design on-demand. In\nthis paper, we propose novel solutions for designing terahertz high-Q\nmetamaterials based on deep learning, including the forward prediction of\nspectral responses and the inverse design of structural parameters. For the\nforward prediction, we develop the Electromagnetic Response Transformer (ERT)\nmodel to establish the complex mapping relations between the highly sensitive\nstructural parameters and the abrupt spectra, and realize precise prediction of\nthe high-Q resonance in terahertz spectra from given structural parameters. For\nthe inverse design, we introduce the Visual Attention Network (VAN) model with\na large model capability to attentively learn the abrupt shifts in spectral\nresonances, which can efficiently reduce errors and achieve highly accurate\ninverse design of structural parameters according to the expected high-Q\nresonance responses. Both models exhibit outstanding performance, and the\naccuracy is improved one or two orders higher compared to the traditional\nmachine learning methods. Besides, our ERT model can be 4000 times faster than\nthe conventional full wave simulations in computation time. Our work provides\nnew avenues for the deep learning enabled design of terahertz high-Q\nmetamaterials, which holds potential applications in various fields, such as\nterahertz communication, sensing, imaging, and functional devices.",

In addition, their verification via hardware deployments is limited\nbecause these are costly and make difficult to try different architectures and\nconfigurations, thus delaying the design and development in this area.\nTherefore, verification at early stages in the design process is of great\nimportance and must be supported by simulation. In this context, this work\npresents an event-driven link level framework and simulator for the validation\nof avionics networks.

Achieving precise personalized treatment\nnecessitates feedback information on in situ thermal effects induced by the RFA\nprocedure.

In this paper, we\npropose a physics-guided neural network model, named PhysRFANet, to enable\nreal-time prediction of thermal effect during RFA treatment. The networks,\ndesigned for predicting temperature distribution and the corresponding ablation\nlesion, were trained using biophysical computational models that integrated\nelectrostatics, bio-heat transfer, and cell necrosis, alongside magnetic\nresonance (MR) images of breast cancer patients. Validation of the\ncomputational model was performed through experiments on ex vivo bovine liver\ntissue. Our model demonstrated a 96% Dice score in predicting the lesion volume\nand an RMSE of 0.4854 for temperature distribution when tested with foreseen\ntumor images. Notably, even with unforeseen images, it achieved a 93% Dice\nscore for the ablation lesion and an RMSE of 0.6783 for temperature\ndistribution.

SPC is an encoder-only\nprobabilistic coding technology with a structured regularization from the\ntarget label space. It can enhance the generalization ability of pre-trained\nlanguage models for better language understanding. Specifically, our\nprobabilistic coding technology simultaneously performs information encoding\nand task prediction in one module to more fully utilize the effective\ninformation from input data. It uses variational inference in the output space\nto reduce randomness and uncertainty. Besides, to better control the\nprobability distribution in the latent space, a structured regularization is\nproposed to promote class-level uniformity in the latent space. With the\nregularization term, SPC can preserve the Gaussian distribution structure of\nlatent code as well as better cover the hidden space with class uniformly.\nExperimental results on 12 natural language understanding tasks demonstrate\nthat our SPC effectively improves the performance of pre-trained language\nmodels for classification and regression. Extensive experiments show that SPC\ncan enhance the generalization capability, robustness to label noise, and\nclustering quality of output representations.",

                "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a model relevant to semantics-aware\ngoal-oriented communications, and we propose a new metric that incorporates the\nutilization of information in addition to its timelines. Specifically, we\nconsider the transmission of observations from an external process to a\nbattery-powered receiver through status updates. These updates inform the\nreceiver about the process status and enable actuation if sufficient energy is\navailable to achieve a goal. We focus on a wireless power transfer (WPT) model,\nwhere the receiver receives energy from a dedicated power transmitter and\noccasionally from the data transmitter when they share a common channel. We\nanalyze the Age of Information (AoI) and propose a new metric, the \\textit{Age\nof Actuation (AoA), which is relevant when the receiver utilizes the status\nupdates to perform actions in a timely manner}. We provide analytical\ncharacterizations of the average AoA and the violation probability of the AoA,\ndemonstrating that AoA generalizes AoI. Moreover, we introduce and analytically\ncharacterize the \\textit{Probability of Missing Actuation (PoMA)}; this metric\nbecomes relevant also \\textit{to quantify the incurred cost of a missed\naction}. We formulate unconstrained and constrained optimization problems for\nall the metrics and present numerical evaluations of our analytical results.\nThis proposed set of metrics goes beyond the traditional timeliness metrics\nsince the synergy of different flows is now considered.",

                "abstract": "Shortcut learning is when a model -- e.g. a cardiac disease classifier --\nexploits correlations between the target label and a spurious shortcut feature,\ne.g. a pacemaker, to predict the target label based on the shortcut rather than\nreal discriminative features. This is common in medical imaging, where\ntreatment and clinical annotations correlate with disease labels, making them\neasy shortcuts to predict disease. We propose a novel detection and\nquantification of the impact of potential shortcut features via a fast\ndiffusion-based counterfactual image generation that can synthetically remove\nor add shortcuts. Via a novel inpainting-based modification we spatially limit\nthe changes made with no extra inference step, encouraging the removal of\nspatially constrained shortcut features while ensuring that the shortcut-free\ncounterfactuals preserve their remaining image features to a high degree. Using\nthese, we assess how shortcut features influence model predictions.\n  This is enabled by our second contribution: An efficient diffusion-based\ncounterfactual explanation method with significant inference speed-up at\ncomparable image quality as state-of-the-art.

More importantly, the spin-triplet excitons with spin 1 and -1 can be\nswitched by electric fields in ferrimagnetic LiFe2F6 due to strong\nmagnetoelectric coupling. Due to the abundance of novel physical properties,\nLiFe2F6 will certainly attract a wide range of theoretical and experimental\ninterest.",

                "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have attracted significant attention in recent\nyears and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in\nimproving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, the widely adopted\nModel-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs\n(CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for\ntraining. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to\nlearning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in\nsample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag\nbehind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs\nare limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the\nperformance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to\naddress the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited\ncommunications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles\nwith Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better\ncapture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages\nProbabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples\namong neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory\nSampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this\nbasis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of\nagents within the communication range and mathematically validate that\nincorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent\nlearning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst\ncase. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms\nof the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.",

                "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles ought to predict the surrounding agents' trajectories to\nallow safe maneuvers in uncertain and complex traffic situations. As companies\nincreasingly apply trajectory prediction in the real world, security becomes a\nrelevant concern. In this paper, we focus on backdoors - a security threat\nacknowledged in other fields but so far overlooked for trajectory prediction.\nTo this end, we describe and investigate four triggers that could affect\ntrajectory prediction. We then show that these triggers (for example, a braking\nvehicle), when correlated with a desired output (for example, a curve) during\ntraining, cause the desired output of a state-of-the-art trajectory prediction\nmodel. In other words, the model has good benign performance but is vulnerable\nto backdoors. This is the case even if the trigger maneuver is performed by a\nnon-casual agent behind the target vehicle. As a side-effect, our analysis\nreveals interesting limitations within trajectory prediction models. Finally,\nwe evaluate a range of defenses against backdoors. While some, like simple\noffroad checks, do not enable detection for all triggers, clustering is a\npromising candidate to support manual inspection to find backdoors.",

Magnetization gradients and textures satisfy both requirements and\ntherefore also allow for superconducting diodes. We concretely demonstrate such\npossibilities in two-dimensional superconductors. We first consider\nsuperconducting Rashba metals in the presence of an inhomogeneous out-of-plane\nexchange field. Using analytical arguments, we reveal that such magnetization\ngradients stabilize a helical superconducting ground state, similar to\nhomogeneous in-plane magnetic fields. Our predictions are confirmed by\nemploying self-consistent real-space numerical lattice simulations exemplified\nthrough the cases of a uniform magnetization gradient or a ferromagnetic domain\nwall. Furthermore, by considering a phase difference, we determine the\nnonreciprocal current-phase relations and explore their parameter dependence.\nOur calculations show that planar devices with out-of-plane magnetization\ngradients may be as efficient supercurrent rectifiers as their analogs induced\nby uniform in-plane fields. In addition, they feature the advantage that by\nmeans of tailoring the spatial profile of the out-of-plane magnetization, one\nmay optimize and spatially control the diode effect. Finally, we show that\nsuperconducting diodes may become also accessible even in the absence of\nspin-orbit coupling by means of suitable spatially-varying magnetization\nfields.",

We investigate the use of Random Forest (RF)\nregression to estimate viscoelastic constitutive model parameters using Large\nAmplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) data. Specifically, we deploy the RF to\npredict constitutive model parameters using the spectra of Chebyshev\ncoefficients pertaining to the stress-strain-strain rate Lissajous curves. As\nfar as we know, this is the first time Machine Learning (ML) has been utilised\nfor this predictive task. We test three constitutive models: the linear and\nexponential Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) models, and the RoLiE-Poly model. For both\nPTT models, the RF estimator predicts the model parameters from the Chebyshev\nspectra with high accuracy. For the RoLiE-Poly model, the RF estimator\ndemonstrates lower accuracy in model validation, however the predicted\nparameters still accurately capture the rheological behaviour in both\noscillatory shear and oscillatory extensional flow. This is because multiple\nsets of RoLiE-Poly model parameters can yield very similar rheological\nresponses and indicates practical identifiability issues under the investigated\nconditions. This does not represent an inadequacy of the framework, but rather\na fundamental challenge in estimating model parameters using rheometric data.\nOverall, the study highlights the strong potential ML has to offer for\nselecting and parametrising constitutive models based on rheometry data.

As segmentation predictions play a crucial role, we propose to\nenhance both local and global sample validity detection by capturing key\naspects from visual semantics via three memory banks: class histograms,\ncomponent composition embeddings and patch-level representations. For effective\nLA detection, we propose an adaptive scaling strategy to standardize anomaly\nscores from different memory banks in inference. Extensive experiments on the\npublic benchmark MVTec LOCO AD reveal our method achieves 98.1% AUROC in LA\ndetection vs. 89.6% from competing methods.",

Besides being an\narchetypal system, the 2D Lennard-Jones system is a subject of long debate, as\nto whether its melting transition is continuous (infinite-order) or\ndiscontinious ( first-order) one. We have discovered that anomalies on the\nequation of state (the van-der-Waals or Myer-Wood loops) previously considered\na hallmark of first order phase transition, are at best at the level of noise,\nsince they have the same magnitude as the amplitude of pressure fluctuations.\nHaving calculated the dependence of temperature fluctuations on the number of\nparticles, we obtained another strong evidence of continuous character of this\nmelting transition, which manifests itself in continuous change of heat\ncapacity across the melting curve.

In this work, we deliver an in-depth\nanalysis of the behavior across different choices of learning methods from the\nperspective of both performance and calibration, as well as their interplay.\nThrough extensive controlled experiments, we find that simultaneous gains for\nboth task performance and calibration are difficult to achieve, and the problem\nof miscalibration exists across all learning methods in low-resource scenarios.\nTo address this challenging trade-off between performance and calibration, we\nthen investigate the potential of self-ensembling techniques applied at\ndifferent modeling stages (e.g., variations of in-context examples or\nvariations in prompts or different ensembling strategies). We justify the\nfeasibility of self-ensembling on SFT in addition to ICL, to make the\npredictions more calibrated and have comparable or even better performance.

                "abstract": "Airway-related quantitative imaging biomarkers are crucial for examination,\ndiagnosis, and prognosis in pulmonary diseases. However, the manual delineation\nof airway trees remains prohibitively time-consuming. While significant efforts\nhave been made towards enhancing airway modelling, current public-available\ndatasets concentrate on lung diseases with moderate morphological variations.\nThe intricate honeycombing patterns present in the lung tissues of fibrotic\nlung disease patients exacerbate the challenges, often leading to various\nprediction errors. To address this issue, the 'Airway-Informed Quantitative CT\nImaging Biomarker for Fibrotic Lung Disease 2023' (AIIB23) competition was\norganized in conjunction with the official 2023 International Conference on\nMedical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI). The airway\nstructures were meticulously annotated by three experienced radiologists.\nCompetitors were encouraged to develop automatic airway segmentation models\nwith high robustness and generalization abilities, followed by exploring the\nmost correlated QIB of mortality prediction. A training set of 120\nhigh-resolution computerised tomography (HRCT) scans were publicly released\nwith expert annotations and mortality status. The online validation set\nincorporated 52 HRCT scans from patients with fibrotic lung disease and the\noffline test set included 140 cases from fibrosis and COVID-19 patients. The\nresults have shown that the capacity of extracting airway trees from patients\nwith fibrotic lung disease could be enhanced by introducing voxel-wise weighted\ngeneral union loss and continuity loss. In addition to the competitive image\nbiomarkers for prognosis, a strong airway-derived biomarker (Hazard ratio>1.5,\np<0.0001) was revealed for survival prognostication compared with existing\nclinical measurements, clinician assessment and AI-based biomarkers.",

                "abstract": "Detection Transformer (DETR) and its variants have shown great potential for\naccurate object detection in recent years. The mechanism of object query\nenables DETR family to directly obtain a fixed number of object predictions and\nstreamlines the detection pipeline. Meanwhile, recent studies also reveal that\nwith proper architecture design, convolution networks (ConvNets) also achieve\ncompetitive performance with transformers, \\eg, ConvNeXt. To this end, in this\npaper we explore whether we could build a query-based end-to-end object\ndetection framework with ConvNets instead of sophisticated transformer\narchitecture. The proposed framework, \\ie, Detection ConvNet (DECO), is\ncomposed of a backbone and convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. We\ncarefully design the DECO encoder and propose a novel mechanism for our DECO\ndecoder to perform interaction between object queries and image features via\nconvolutional layers. We compare the proposed DECO against prior detectors on\nthe challenging COCO benchmark. Despite its simplicity, our DECO achieves\ncompetitive performance in terms of detection accuracy and running speed.\nSpecifically, with the ResNet-50 and ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone, DECO obtains\n$38.6\\%$ and $40.8\\%$ AP on COCO \\textit{val} set with $35$ and $28$ FPS\nrespectively and outperforms the DETR model. Incorporated with advanced\nmulti-scale feature module, our DECO+ achieves $47.8\\%$ AP with $34$ FPS. We\nhope the proposed DECO brings another perspective for designing object\ndetection framework.",

Many people\nwill intuitively answer the first question with \"1'234, of course\", and affirm\nthe second. Perhaps surprisingly, such grouping of data by outcome induces a\nbias in the evaluation. An evaluation procedure that is aimed at verifying the\nabsence of bias across velocities, when based on such segregation by outcome,\ntherefore fools forecast evaluators and incentivizes forecasters to produce\noverly exaggerated (extreme) forecasts. Such anticipatory adjustments\njeopardize forecast calibration and clearly worsen the forecast quality - this\nproblem was named the \"Forecaster's Dilemma\" by Lerch et al. in 2017\n(Statististical Science 32, 106). As a solution to check for bias across\nvelocities, forecast evaluators should group pairs of forecasts and outcomes by\nthe predicted values, and evaluate empirical mean outcomes per prediction\nbucket.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Recent advancements in offline reinforcement learning (RL) have underscored\nthe capabilities of Return-Conditioned Supervised Learning (RCSL), a paradigm\nthat learns the action distribution based on target returns for each state in a\nsupervised manner. However, prevailing RCSL methods largely focus on\ndeterministic trajectory modeling, disregarding stochastic state transitions\nand the diversity of future trajectory distributions. A fundamental challenge\narises from the inconsistency between the sampled returns within individual\ntrajectories and the expected returns across multiple trajectories.\nFortunately, value-based methods offer a solution by leveraging a value\nfunction to approximate the expected returns, thereby addressing the\ninconsistency effectively. Building upon these insights, we propose a novel\napproach, termed the Critic-Guided Decision Transformer (CGDT), which combines\nthe predictability of long-term returns from value-based methods with the\ntrajectory modeling capability of the Decision Transformer. By incorporating a\nlearned value function, known as the critic, CGDT ensures a direct alignment\nbetween the specified target returns and the expected returns of actions. This\nintegration bridges the gap between the deterministic nature of RCSL and the\nprobabilistic characteristics of value-based methods. Empirical evaluations on\nstochastic environments and D4RL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof CGDT over traditional RCSL methods. These results highlight the potential of\nCGDT to advance the state of the art in offline RL and extend the applicability\nof RCSL to a wide range of RL tasks.",

                "abstract": "Masked visual modeling has attracted much attention due to its promising\npotential in learning generalizable representations. Typical approaches urge\nmodels to predict specific contents of masked tokens, which can be intuitively\nconsidered as teaching a student (the model) to solve given problems\n(predicting masked contents). Under such settings, the performance is highly\ncorrelated with mask strategies (the difficulty of provided problems). We argue\nthat it is equally important for the model to stand in the shoes of a teacher\nto produce challenging problems by itself. Intuitively, patches with high\nvalues of reconstruction loss can be regarded as hard samples, and masking\nthose hard patches naturally becomes a demanding reconstruction task. To\nempower the model as a teacher, we propose Hard Patches Mining (HPM),\npredicting patch-wise losses and subsequently determining where to mask.\nTechnically, we introduce an auxiliary loss predictor, which is trained with a\nrelative objective to prevent overfitting to exact loss values. Also, to\ngradually guide the training procedure, we propose an easy-to-hard mask\nstrategy. Empirically, HPM brings significant improvements under both image and\nvideo benchmarks. Interestingly, solely incorporating the extra loss prediction\nobjective leads to better representations, verifying the efficacy of\ndetermining where is hard to reconstruct.

                "abstract": "$\\epsilon$-Differential privacy (DP) is a well-known privacy model that\noffers strong privacy guarantees. However, when applied to data releases, DP\nsignificantly deteriorates the analytical utility of the protected outcomes. To\nkeep data utility at reasonable levels, practical applications of DP to data\nreleases have used weak privacy parameters (large $\\epsilon$), which dilute the\nprivacy guarantees of DP. In this work, we tackle this issue by using an\nalternative formulation of the DP privacy guarantees, named\n$\\epsilon$-individual differential privacy (iDP), which causes less data\ndistortion while providing the same protection as DP to subjects. We enforce\niDP in data releases by relying on attribute masking plus a pre-processing step\nbased on data microaggregation. The goal of this step is to reduce the\nsensitivity to record changes, which determines the amount of noise required to\nenforce iDP (and DP). Specifically, we propose data microaggregation strategies\ndesigned for iDP whose sensitivities are significantly lower than those used in\nDP. As a result, we obtain iDP-protected data with significantly better utility\nthan with DP.

In order to\nfulfill this promise, the message-carrying signals must interact coherently at\nthe decoding stage via a joint-detection receiver (JDR), whose realization with\noptical technologies remains an outstanding open problem to date.\n  We introduce a supervised-learning framework for the systematic discovery of\nnew JDR designs based on parametrized photonic integrated circuits. Our\nframework relies on the synthesis of a training set comprising quantum\ncodewords and the corresponding classical message label; the codewords are\nprocessed by the JDR circuit and, after photo-detection, produce a guess for\nthe label. The circuit parameters are then updated by minimizing a suitable\nloss function, reaching an optimal JDR design for that specific architecture.\nWe showcase our method with coherent-state codes for the pure-loss bosonic\nchannel, modelling optical-fiber and space communication, with a circuit\narchitecture comprising linear optics, squeezing and threshold photo-detectors.\nWe train JDR circuits for several code families, varying energy and code-size.\n  We discover optical JDR circuit setups for maximum-size codes and small\nmessage-length that offer up to a $3$-fold enhancement in the bit decoding rate\nwith respect to the optimal single-symbol receiver, and less than $7\\%$-away\nfrom the theoretically optimal decoder, for which an explicit design is missing\nto date. Furthermore, the discovered receivers surpass previous JDR designs\nboth in terms of bit decoding and bit transmission rate.\n  Finally, we observe that the best-performing codes are those which can be\nmapped, via the JDR's optical processing, to modulations with different energy\nlevels on different symbols, making the message symbols more distinguishabile\nvia photo-detection.",

                "abstract": "We measure the bolometric luminosity of a complete and unbiased 12\nmicron-selected sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe.\nFor each galaxy we used a 10-band radio-to-X-ray Spectral Energy Distribution\n(SED) to isolate the genuine AGN continuum in each band, including\nsub-arcsecond measurements where available, and correcting those contaminated\nby the host galaxy. We derive the median SED of Seyfert type 1 AGN, Seyferts\nwith hidden broad-lines (HBL), Seyferts of type 2, and LINER nuclei in our\nsample. The median Seyfert 1 SED shows the characteristic blue bump feature in\nthe UV, but nevertheless the largest contribution to the bolometric luminosity\ncomes from the IR and X-ray continua. The median SEDs of both HBL and type 2\nAGN are affected by starlight contamination in the optical/UV. The median SED\nof HBL AGN is consistent with that of Seyfert 1's, when an extinction of Av =\n1.2 mag is applied. The comprehensive SEDs allowed us to measure accurate\nbolometric luminosities and derive robust bolometric corrections for the\ndifferent tracers. The 12 micron and the K-band nuclear luminosities have good\nlinear correlations with the bolometric luminosity, similar to those in the\nX-rays. We derive bolometric corrections for either continuum bands (K-band, 12\nmicron, 2-10 keV and 14-195 keV) and narrow emission lines (mid-IR high\nionization lines of [OIV] and [NeV] and optical [OIII]5007A) as well as for\ncombinations of IR continuum and line emission. A combination of continuum plus\nline emission accurately predicts the bolometric luminosity up to quasar\nluminosities.",

Undernutrition arises from a\ndisbalance between nutritional intake and energy expenditure, making its\ndiagnosis crucial. Advances in technology allowed a better precision and\nefficiency of biomarker measurements, making it easier to detect undernutrition\nin the elderly. This article introduces an innovative system developed as part\nof the CART initiative at Toulouse University Hospital in France. This system\ntakes a comprehensive approach to monitor health and well-being, collecting\ndata that can provide insights, shape health outcomes, and even predict them. A\nkey focus of this system is on identifying nutrition-related behaviors. By\nintegrating quantitative and clinical assessments, which include biannual\nnutritional evaluations, as well as physical and physiological measurements\nlike mobility and weight, this approach improves the diagnosis and prevention\nof undernutrition risks. It offers a more holistic perspective aligned with\nphysiological standards. An example is given with the data collection of an\nelderly person followed at home for 3 months.

To mitigate these challenges, distributed quantum neural\nnetworks have been proposed to make a prediction by approximating a large\ncircuit with multiple small circuits. However, the approximation of a large\ncircuit requires an exponential number of small circuit evaluations. Here, we\ninstead propose to distribute partitioned features over multiple small quantum\nneural networks and use the ensemble of their expectation values to generate\npredictions. To verify our distributed approach, we demonstrate multi-class\nclassifications of handwritten digit datasets. Especially for the MNIST\ndataset, we succeeded in ten class classifications of the dataset with\nexceeding 96% accuracy. Our proposed method not only achieved highly accurate\npredictions for a large dataset but also reduced the hardware requirements for\neach quantum neural network compared to a single quantum neural network. Our\nresults highlight distributed quantum neural networks as a promising direction\nfor practical quantum machine learning algorithms compatible with near-term\nquantum devices.

It\nis shown that for moderate particle imbalance each component maintains its\ndroplet flat-top or Gaussian type character depending on the intercomponent\nattraction. Importantly, large particle imbalance leads to a flat-top shape of\nthe majority component with the minority exhibiting spatially localized\nconfigurations. The latter imprint modulations on the majority component which\nbecome more pronounced for increasing interspecies attraction. The same holds\nfor larger mass or increasing repulsion of the minority species. Such\nstructural transitions are also evident in the underlying two-body correlation\nfunctions. To interpret the origin and characteristics of these droplet states\nwe derive an effective model based on the established Lee-Huang-Yang theory\nproviding adequate qualitative analytical predictions even away from its\nexpected parametric region of validity. In contrast, the droplet character is\nfound to vanish in the presence of fermionic minority atoms. Our results pave\nthe way for unveiling complex droplet phases of matter.",

To address this challenge, we develop a new\nWSSS framework tailored to driving scene datasets. Based on extensive analysis\nof dataset characteristics, we employ Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training\n(CLIP) as our baseline to obtain pseudo-masks. However, CLIP introduces two key\nchallenges: (1) pseudo-masks from CLIP lack in representing small object\nclasses, and (2) these masks contain notable noise. We propose solutions for\neach issue as follows. (1) We devise Global-Local View Training that seamlessly\nincorporates small-scale patches during model training, thereby enhancing the\nmodel's capability to handle small-sized yet critical objects in driving scenes\n(e.g., traffic light). (2) We introduce Consistency-Aware Region Balancing\n(CARB), a novel technique that discerns reliable and noisy regions through\nevaluating the consistency between CLIP masks and segmentation predictions. It\nprioritizes reliable pixels over noisy pixels via adaptive loss weighting.\nNotably, the proposed method achieves 51.8\\% mIoU on the Cityscapes test\ndataset, showcasing its potential as a strong WSSS baseline on driving scene\ndatasets.

Such a long, continuous action of model aggregations poses significant\nchallenges in reasoning about the origin and composition of such a global\nmodel. Regardless of the quality of the global model or if it has a fault,\nunderstanding the model's origin is equally important for debugging,\ninterpretability, and explainability in federated learning. FL application\ndevelopers often question: (1) what clients contributed towards a global model\nand (2) if a global model predicts a label, which clients are responsible for\nit?\n  We introduce, neuron provenance, a fine-grained lineage capturing mechanism\nthat tracks the flow of information between the individual participating\nclients in FL and the final global model. We operationalize this concept in\nProvFL that functions on two key principles. First, recognizing that monitoring\nevery neuron of every client's model statically is ineffective and noisy due to\nthe uninterpretable nature of individual neurons, ProvFL dynamically isolates\ninfluential and sensitive neurons in the global model, significantly reducing\nthe search space. Second, as multiple clients' models are fused in each round\nto form a global model, tracking each client's contribution becomes\nchallenging. ProvFL leverages the invertible nature of fusion algorithms to\nprecisely isolate each client's contribution derived from selected neurons.\nWhen asked to localize the clients responsible for the given behavior (i.e.,\nprediction) of the global model, ProvFL successfully localizes them with an\naverage provenance accuracy of 97%. Additionally, ProvFL outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art FL fault localization approach by an average margin of 50%.",

Foundation models pre-trained on separate\nlarge-scale datasets can improve the performance from scarce and heterogeneous\ndatasets. For functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while data may be\nabundantly available from healthy controls, clinical data is often scarce,\nlimiting the ability of foundation models to identify clinically-relevant\nfeatures. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel training strategy\nfor our foundation model by integrating meta-learning with self-supervised\nlearning to improve the generalization from normal to clinical features. In\nthis way we enable generalization to other downstream clinical tasks, in our\ncase prediction of PTE. To achieve this, we perform self-supervised training on\nthe control dataset to focus on inherent features that are not limited to a\nparticular supervised task while applying meta-learning, which strongly\nimproves the model's generalizability using bi-level optimization. Through\nexperiments on neurological disorder classification tasks, we demonstrate that\nthe proposed strategy significantly improves task performance on small-scale\nclinical datasets. To explore the generalizability of the foundation model in\ndownstream applications, we then apply the model to an unseen TBI dataset for\nprediction of PTE using zero-shot learning.

With the orbital decay driven by\ngravitational-wave (GW) radiation, the minimum orbital periods of detached sdB\nbinaries could be as short as ~20 minutes. However, only four sdB binaries with\norbital periods below an hour have been reported so far, while none of them has\nan orbital period approaching the above theoretical limit. Here we report the\ndiscovery of a 20.5-minute-orbital-period ellipsoidal binary, TMTS\nJ052610.43+593445.1, in which the visible star is being tidally deformed by an\ninvisible carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) companion. The visible component is\ninferred to be an sdB star with a mass of ~0.33 Msun, approaching that of\nhelium-ignition limit, although a He-core WD cannot be completely ruled out. In\nparticular, the radius of this low-mass sdB star is only 0.066 Rsun, about\nseven Earth radii, possibly representing the most compact nondegenerate star\never known. Such a system provides a key clue to map the binary evolution\nscheme from the second CE ejection to the formation of AM CVn stars having a\nhelium-star donor, and it will also serve as a crucial verification binary of\nspace-borne GW detectors in the future.",

It follows that a perfect\nBTRE can be reached with the increase of the ratios of the heat baths'\ntemperatures and of the radius of the outer edge to the inner edge of the disk.\nWe also show that, by introducing a potential barrier into the Corbino disk,\nthe RE can be greatly improved.

                "abstract": "Reaction-diffusion models are often used to describe biological invasion,\nwhere populations of individuals that undergo random motility and proliferation\nlead to moving fronts. Many models of biological invasion are extensions of the\nFisher-KPP model that describes the evolution of a 1D population density as a\nresult of linear diffusion and logistic growth. In 2020 Fadai introduced a new\nmodel of biological invasion that was formulated as a moving boundary problem\nwith a nonlinear degenerate diffusive flux. Fadai's model leads to travelling\nwave solutions with infinitely steep, well-defined fronts at the moving\nboundary, and the model has the mathematical advantage of being analytically\ntractable in certain parameter limits. We aim to provide general insight by\nfirst presenting two key extensions by considering: (i) generalised nonlinear\ndegenerate diffusion with flux; and, (ii) solutions describing both biological\ninvasion, and biological recession. We establish the existence of travelling\nwave solutions for these two extensions, and then consider stability of the\ntravelling wave solutions by introducing a lateral perturbation of the\ntravelling wavefront. Full 2D time-dependent level-set numerical solutions\nindicate that invasive travelling waves are stable to small lateral\nperturbations, whereas receding travelling waves are unstable. These\npreliminary numerical observations are corroborated through a linear stability\nanalysis that gives more formal insight into short time growth/decay of\nwavefront perturbation amplitude.",

                "abstract": "Identifying topological phases for a strongly correlated theory remains a\nnon-trivial task, as defining order parameters, such as Berry phases, is not\nstraightforward. Quantum information theory is capable of identifying\ntopological phases for a theory that exhibits quantum phase transition with a\nsuitable definition of order parameters that are related to different\nentanglement measures for the system. In this work, we study entanglement\nentropy for a bi-layer SSH model, both in the presence and absence of Hubbard\ninteraction and at varying interaction strengths. For the free theory, edge\nentanglement acts as an order parameter, which is supported by analytic\ncalculations and numerical (DMRG) studies. We calculate the symmetry-resolved\nentanglement and demonstrate the equipartition of entanglement for this model\nwhich itself acts as an order parameter when calculated for the edge modes. As\nthe DMRG calculation allows one to go beyond the free theory, we study the\nentanglement structure of the edge modes in the presence of on-site Hubbard\ninteraction for the same model. A sudden reduction of edge entanglement is\nobtained as interaction is switched on. The explanation for this lies in the\nchange in the size of the degenerate subspaces in the presence and absence of\ninteraction. We also study the signature of entanglement when the interaction\nstrength becomes extremely strong and demonstrate that the edge entanglement\nremains protected. In this limit, the energy eigenstates essentially become a\ntensor product state, implying zero entanglement. However, a remnant entropy\nsurvives in the non-trivial topological phase which is exactly due to the\nentanglement of the edge modes.",

To address\nthis challenge, we propose Anchoring Path Sentence Transformer (APST) by\nintroducing Anchoring Paths (APs) to alleviate the reliance of CPs.\nSpecifically, we develop a search-based description retrieval method to enrich\nentity descriptions and an assessment mechanism to evaluate the rationality of\nAPs. APST takes both APs and CPs as the inputs of a unified Sentence\nTransformer architecture, enabling comprehensive predictions and high-quality\nexplanations.

                "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, have emerged as a\ndisruptive technology with the potential to revolutionize operations across\nvarious industries. Drones are the fast-growing internet-of-things technology\nand are estimated to have a $100 billion market value in the next decade.\nExploring drone operations through research has the potential to yield\ninnovative academic insights and create significant practical effects in\ndiverse industries, offering a competitive edge. Drawing insights from both\nacademic and industry literature, this article describes how technological\nadvancements in UAVs may disrupt traditional operational practices in different\nindustries (e.g., commercial last-mile delivery, commercial pickup and\ndelivery, telecommunication, insurance, healthcare, humanitarian,\nenvironmental, urban planning, homeland security), identifies the value of this\nevolving disruptive technology from sustainability and operational innovation\nperspectives, argues the significance of this area for operations management by\nconceptualizing a research agenda. The current state of the art focuses on the\ncomputing aspect of analytical models to tackle a variety of synthetic\ndrone-related problems, with mixed integer optimization being the primary tool.\nThere is a very significant research gap that should focus on drone operations\nmanagement with industry know-how by partnering with actual stakeholders and\nusing a variety of tools (i.e., econometrics, field experiments, game theory,\noptimal control, utility functions). This article aims to promote research on\nUAVs from operations management and industry-specific point of view.",

                "abstract": "This molecular orbital analysis predicts that pure carbon graphene molecules\nwould play an important role on astronomically observed Diffuse Interstellar\nBands (DIB), rather than fullerene. Laboratory experiments precisely coincided\nwith observed DIB bands as studied by E. Cambell et al., which were considered\nto originate from mono-cation fullerene-(C$_{60}$)$^{1+}$. To check\ntheoretically a molecular orbital excitation of (C$_{60}$)$^{1+}$ was\ncalculated by the Time-Dependent DFT. Calculated two bands were close to\nobserved DIBs, but there were two problems, that the oscillator strength was\nzero, and that other three DIBs could not be reproduced. Laboratory experiments\nwas the mass spectroscopic one filtering m/e=724, to suggest\nfullerene-(C$_{60}$)$^{1+}$ combined with He. However, there were other\ncapabilities, as like He-atom intercalated 3D-graphite,\n[graphene(C$_{53}$)$^{1+}$--He--(C$_7$)],\n[graphene(C$_{51}$)$^{1+}$--He--(C$_9$)] and so on. A family of graphene\n(C$_{53}$), (C$_{52}$) and (C$_{51}$) was calculated. Results show that an\nastronomically observed 957.74nm band was reproduced well by calculated\n957.74nm, also confirmed by laboratory experiment of 957.75nm. Other observed\n963.26, 936.57 and 934.85nm bands were calculated to be 963.08, 935.89 and\n933.72nm. Moreover, experimental 922.27nm band was calculated to be 922.02nm,\nwhich is not yet astronomically observed. Similarly, experimental 925.96,\n912.80, 909.71 and 908.40nm bands were calculated to 926.01, 912.52, 910.32 and\n908.55nm.

                "abstract": "Improving the efficiency of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a challenging\nbut significant task that has received much attention. Previous works mainly\nadopted the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) and improved its search\nstrategies or modules to enhance search efficiency. Recently, some methods have\nstarted considering data reduction for speedup, but they are not tightly\ncoupled with the architecture search process, resulting in sub-optimal\nperformance. To this end, this work pioneers an exploration into the critical\nrole of dataset characteristics for DARTS bi-level optimization, and then\nproposes a novel Bi-level Data Pruning (BDP) paradigm that targets the weights\nand architecture levels of DARTS to enhance efficiency from a data perspective.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new progressive data pruning strategy that\nutilizes supernet prediction dynamics as the metric, to gradually prune\nunsuitable samples for DARTS during the search. An effective automatic class\nbalance constraint is also integrated into BDP, to suppress potential class\nimbalances resulting from data-efficient algorithms. Comprehensive evaluations\non the NAS-Bench-201 search space, DARTS search space, and MobileNet-like\nsearch space validate that BDP reduces search costs by over 50% while achieving\nsuperior performance when applied to baseline DARTS. Besides, we demonstrate\nthat BDP can harmoniously integrate with advanced DARTS variants, like PC-DARTS\nand \\b{eta}-DARTS, offering an approximately 2 times speedup with minimal\nperformance compromises.",

As\nthe number of hardware attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices continues to\nrapidly increase, we present the Hardware Vulnerability to Weakness Mapping\n(HW-V2W-Map) Framework, which is a Machine Learning (ML) framework focusing on\nhardware vulnerabilities and IoT security.

                "abstract": "Video view synthesis, allowing for the creation of visually appealing frames\nfrom arbitrary viewpoints and times, offers immersive viewing experiences.\nNeural radiance fields, particularly NeRF, initially developed for static\nscenes, have spurred the creation of various methods for video view synthesis.\nHowever, the challenge for video view synthesis arises from motion blur, a\nconsequence of object or camera movement during exposure, which hinders the\nprecise synthesis of sharp spatio-temporal views. In response, we propose a\nnovel dynamic deblurring NeRF framework for blurry monocular video, called\nDyBluRF, consisting of an Interleave Ray Refinement (IRR) stage and a Motion\nDecomposition-based Deblurring (MDD) stage. Our DyBluRF is the first that\naddresses and handles the novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video. The\nIRR stage jointly reconstructs dynamic 3D scenes and refines the inaccurate\ncamera pose information to combat imprecise pose information extracted from the\ngiven blurry frames. The MDD stage is a novel incremental latent sharp-rays\nprediction (ILSP) approach for the blurry monocular video frames by decomposing\nthe latent sharp rays into global camera motion and local object motion\ncomponents. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DyBluRF\noutperforms qualitatively and quantitatively the very recent state-of-the-art\nmethods.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Purpose: To assess Generative Pre-trained Transformer version 4's (GPT-4)\nability to classify articles containing functional evidence relevant to\nassessments of variant pathogenicity.\n  Results: GPT-4 settings and prompts were trained on a set of 45 articles and\ngenetic variants. A final test set of 72 manually classified articles and\ngenetic variants were then processed using two prompts. The prompts asked GPT-4\nto supply all functional evidence present in an article for a variant or\nindicate that no functional evidence is present. For articles with having\nfunctional evidence, a second prompt asked GPT-4 to classify the evidence into\npathogenic, benign, intermediate, and inconclusive categories. The first prompt\nidentified articles with variant-level functional evidence with 87% sensitivity\nand 89% positive predictive value (PPV). Five of 26 articles with no functional\ndata were indicated as having functional evidence by GPT-4. For variants with\nfunctional assays present as determined by both manual review and GPT-4, the\nsensitivity and PPV of GPT-4 prompt concordance was: Pathogenic (92% sensitive\nand 73% PPV), Intermediate or Inconclusive (67% sensitive and 93% PPV), Benign\n(100% sensitive and 73% PPV).\n  Conclusion: The GPT-4 prompts detected the presence or absence of a\nfunctional assay with high sensitivity and PPV, and articles with unambiguous\nevidence supporting a benign or pathogenic classification with high sensitivity\nand reasonable PPV. Our prompts detected papers with intermediate or\ninconclusive evidence with lower sensitivity but high PPV. Our results support\nthat GPT-4 may be useful in variant classification workflows by enabling\nprioritization of articles for review that are likely to have functional\nevidence supporting or refuting pathogenicity, but not that GPT-4 is capable of\nfully automating the genetics literature review component of variant\nclassification.",

As a result any dispersive representation for\nthe amplitude will involve contributions from these thresholds that are not\ncomputable from the IR theory, and thus invalidates general positivity bound.\nIndeed using toy models, we explicitly demonstrate that the four-derivative\ncouplings for unstable particles can become negative, violating positivity\nbounds even for non-gravitational theories.

At pore scale, the CO2 trapping\npotential depends on injection pressure, temperature, and the rock's\ninteraction with the surrounding fluids. Modeling this interaction requires\nadequate representations of both capillary volume and surface. For the lack of\nscalable representations, however, the prediction of a rock's CO2 storage\npotential has been challenging. Here, we report how to represent a rock's pore\nspace by statistically sampled capillary networks (ssCN) that preserve\nmorphological rock characteristics. We have used the ssCN method to simulate\nCO2 drainage within a representative sandstone sample at reservoir pressures\nand temperatures, exploring intermediate- and CO2-wet conditions. This wetting\nregime is often neglected, despite evidence of plausibility. By raising\npressure and temperature we observe increasing CO2 penetration within the\ncapillary network. For contact angles approaching 90 degrees, the CO2\nsaturation exhibits a pronounced maximum reaching 80 percent of the accessible\npore volume. This is about twice as high as the saturation values reported\npreviously. For enabling validation of our results and a broader application of\nour methodology, we have made available the rock tomography data, the digital\nrock computational workflows, and the ssCN models used in this study.",

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often\nrely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and\ntime-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient\naction assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network\n(MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The\nMR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of\npatient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple\nresidual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of\nabstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the\nnetwork, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This\nempowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the\npatient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body\nparts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to\nanalyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We\nevaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in\naccurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Han et al. (2021) first proposed a DNN-based approach to learn\nLagrangian representations and demonstrated accurate particle tracing for an\nanalytic 2D flow field. In this paper, we extend and build upon this prior work\nin significant ways. First, we evaluate the performance of DNN models to\naccurately trace particles in various settings, including 2D and 3D\ntime-varying flow fields, flow fields from multiple applications, flow fields\nwith varying complexity, as well as structured and unstructured input data.\nSecond, we conduct an empirical study to inform best practices with respect to\nparticle tracing model architectures, activation functions, and training data\nstructures. Third, we conduct a comparative evaluation against prior techniques\nthat employ flow maps as input for exploratory flow visualization.\nSpecifically, we compare our extended model against its predecessor by Han et\nal. (2021), as well as the conventional approach that uses triangulation and\nBarycentric coordinate interpolation. Finally, we consider the integration and\nadaptation of our particle tracing model with different viewers. We provide an\ninteractive web-based visualization interface by leveraging the efficiencies of\nour framework, and perform high-fidelity interactive visualization by\nintegrating it with an OSPRay-based viewer. Overall, our experiments\ndemonstrate that using a trained DNN model to predict new particle trajectories\nrequires a low memory footprint and results in rapid inference.

                "abstract": "While live 360 degree video streaming delivers immersive viewing experience,\nit poses significant bandwidth and latency challenges for content delivery\nnetworks. Edge servers are expected to play an important role in facilitating\nlive streaming of 360 degree videos. In this paper, we propose a novel\npredictive edge caching algorithm (Coffee) for live 360 degree video that\nemploy collaborative FoV prediction and predictive tile prefetching to reduce\nbandwidth consumption, streaming cost and improve the streaming quality and\nrobustness. Our light-weight caching algorithms exploit the unique tile\nconsumption patterns of live 360 degree video streaming to achieve high tile\ncaching gains. Through extensive experiments driven by real 360 degree video\nstreaming traces, we demonstrate that edge caching algorithms specifically\ndesigned for live 360 degree video streaming can achieve high streaming cost\nsavings with small edge cache space consumption. Coffee, guided by viewer FoV\npredictions, significantly reduces back-haul traffic up to 76% compared to\nstate-of-the-art edge caching algorithms. Furthermore, we develop a\ntranscoding-aware variant (TransCoffee) and evaluate it using comprehensive\nexperiments, which demonstrate that TransCoffee can achieve 63\\% lower cost\ncompared to state-of-the-art transcoding-aware approaches.",

                "abstract": "Interactions between genes and environmental factors may play a key role in\nthe etiology of many common disorders. Several regularized generalized linear\nmodels (GLMs) have been proposed for hierarchical selection of gene by\nenvironment interaction (GEI) effects, where a GEI effect is selected only if\nthe corresponding genetic main effect is also selected in the model. However,\nnone of these methods allow to include random effects to account for population\nstructure, subject relatedness and shared environmental exposure. In this\npaper, we develop a unified approach based on regularized penalized\nquasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation to perform hierarchical selection of GEI\neffects in sparse regularized mixed models. We compare the selection and\nprediction accuracy of our proposed model with existing methods through\nsimulations under the presence of population structure and shared environmental\nexposure. We show that for all simulation scenarios, compared to other\npenalized methods, our proposed method enforced sparsity by controlling the\nnumber of false positives in the model while having the best predictive\nperformance. Finally, we apply our method to a real data application using the\nOrofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study, and\nfound that our method retrieves previously reported significant loci.",

                "abstract": "Using high-resolution simulations of black hole formation from the direct\ncollapse of massive stars undergoing pulsational pair-instability supernovae\n(PPISN), we find a new phenomenon which significantly affects the explosion and\nleads to two peaks in the resulting black hole mass function (BHMF). Lighter\nstars experiencing the pair-instability can form a narrow shell in which alpha\nladder reactions take place, exacerbating the effect of the PPISN. The shell\ntemperature in higher mass stars ($>62 {\\rm M}_\\odot $ at the onset of helium\nburning for population-III stars with metallicity $Z=10^{-5}$) is too low for\nthis to occur. As a result, the spectrum of black holes $M_{\\rm BH} (M_i)$\nexhibits a shoulder feature whereby a large range of initial masses result in\nnear-identical black hole masses. PPISN therefore predict two peaks in the mass\nfunction of astrophysical black holes -- one corresponding to the location of\nthe upper black hole mass gap and a second corresponding to the location of the\nshoulder.

                "abstract": "Objective: To improve survival analysis using EHR data, we aim to develop a\nsupervised topic model called MixEHR-SurG to simultaneously integrate\nheterogeneous EHR data and model survival hazard.\n  Materials and Methods: Our technical contributions are three-folds: (1)\nintegrating EHR topic inference with Cox proportional hazards likelihood; (2)\ninferring patient-specific topic hyperparameters using the PheCode concepts\nsuch that each topic can be identified with exactly one PheCode-associated\nphenotype; (3) multi-modal survival topic inference. This leads to a highly\ninterpretable survival and guided topic model that can infer PheCode-specific\nphenotype topics associated with patient mortality. We evaluated MixEHR-G using\na simulated dataset and two real-world EHR datasets: the Quebec Congenital\nHeart Disease (CHD) data consisting of 8,211 subjects with 75,187 outpatient\nclaim data of 1,767 unique ICD codes; the MIMIC-III consisting of 1,458\nsubjects with multi-modal EHR records.\n  Results: Compared to the baselines, MixEHR-G achieved a superior dynamic\nAUROC for mortality prediction, with a mean AUROC score of 0.89 in the\nsimulation dataset and a mean AUROC of 0.645 on the CHD dataset. Qualitatively,\nMixEHR-G associates severe cardiac conditions with high mortality risk among\nthe CHD patients after the first heart failure hospitalization and critical\nbrain injuries with increased mortality among the MIMIC-III patients after\ntheir ICU discharge.\n  Conclusion: The integration of the Cox proportional hazards model and EHR\ntopic inference in MixEHR-SurG led to not only competitive mortality prediction\nbut also meaningful phenotype topics for systematic survival analysis.

                "abstract": "We perform a set of flow and reactive transport simulations within\nthree-dimensional fracture networks to learn the factors controlling mineral\nreactions. CO$_2$ mineralization requires CO$_2$-laden water, dissolution of a\nmineral that then leads to precipitation of a CO$_2$-bearing mineral. Our\ndiscrete fracture networks (DFN) are partially filled with quartz that\ngradually dissolves until it reaches a quasi-steady state. At the end of the\nsimulation, we measure the quartz remaining in each fracture within the domain.\nWe observe that a small backbone of fracture exists, where the quartz is fully\ndissolved which leads to increased flow and transport. However, depending on\nthe DFN topology and the rate of dissolution, we observe a large variability of\nthese changes, which indicates an interplay between the fracture network\nstructure and the impact of geochemical dissolution. In this work, we developed\na machine learning framework to extract the important features that support\nmineralization in the form of dissolution. In addition, we use structural and\ntopological features of the fracture network to predict the remaining quartz\nvolume in quasi-steady state conditions. As a first step to characterizing\ncarbon mineralization, we study dissolution with this framework. We studied a\nvariety of reaction and fracture parameters and their impact on the dissolution\nof quartz in fracture networks. We found that the dissolution reaction rate\nconstant of quartz and the distance to the flowing backbone in the fracture\nnetwork are the two most important features that control the amount of quartz\nleft in the system. For the first time, we use a combination of a finite-volume\nreservoir model and graph-based approach to study reactive transport in a\ncomplex fracture network to determine the key features that control\ndissolution.",

                "abstract": "Geometric transformations have been widely used to augment the size of\ntraining images. Existing methods often assume a unimodal distribution of the\nunderlying transformations between images, which limits their power when data\nwith multimodal distributions occur. In this paper, we propose a novel model,\nMultimodal Geometric Augmentation (MGAug), that for the first time generates\naugmenting transformations in a multimodal latent space of geometric\ndeformations. To achieve this, we first develop a deep network that embeds the\nlearning of latent geometric spaces of diffeomorphic transformations (a.k.a.\ndiffeomorphisms) in a variational autoencoder (VAE). A mixture of multivariate\nGaussians is formulated in the tangent space of diffeomorphisms and serves as a\nprior to approximate the hidden distribution of image transformations. We then\naugment the original training dataset by deforming images using randomly\nsampled transformations from the learned multimodal latent space of VAE. To\nvalidate the efficiency of our model, we jointly learn the augmentation\nstrategy with two distinct domain-specific tasks: multi-class classification on\n2D synthetic datasets and segmentation on real 3D brain magnetic resonance\nimages (MRIs). We also compare MGAug with state-of-the-art transformation-based\nimage augmentation algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed\napproach outperforms all baselines by significantly improved prediction\naccuracy.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "The study of diffusion with preferential returns to places visited in the\npast has attracted an increased attention in recent years. In these highly\nnon-Markov processes, a standard diffusive particle intermittently resets at a\ngiven rate to previously visited positions. At each reset, a position to be\nrevisited is randomly chosen with a probability proportional to the accumulated\namount of time spent by the particle at that position. These preferential\nrevisits typically generate a very slow diffusion, logarithmic in time, but\nstill with a Gaussian position distribution at late times. Here we consider an\nactive version of this model, where between resets the particle is\nself-propelled with constant speed and switches direction in one dimension\naccording to a telegraphic noise. Hence there are two sources of\nnon-Markovianity in the problem. We exactly derive the position distribution in\nFourier space, as well as the variance of the position at all times. The\ncrossover from the short-time ballistic regime, dominated by activity, to the\nlarge-time anomalous logarithmic growth induced by memory is studied. We also\nanalytically derive a large deviation principle for the position, which\nexhibits a logarithmic time-scaling instead of the usual algebraic form.\nInterestingly, at large distances, the large deviations become independent of\ntime and match the non-equilibrium steady state of a particle under resetting\nto its starting position only.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Global hunger levels have set new records in each of the last three years,\noutpacing aid budgets (WFP, 2023; FSIN, 2023). Most households experiencing\nfood insecurity crises are now in fragile states (Townsend et al., 2021),\nmaking it difficult to support vulnerable, hard-to-reach populations without\ninterference from oppressive governments and non-state actors (Kurtzer, 2019;\nCliffe et al., 2023). Despite growing interest in using digital payments for\ncrisis response (Suri and Jack, 2016; Pazarbasioglu et al., 2020; Aiken et al.,\n2022), there is limited causal evidence on their efficacy (Gentilini, 2022;\nWFP, 2023). We show that digital payments can address basic needs during a\nhumanitarian crisis. We conducted a randomized evaluation among very poor,\nmostly tech-illiterate, female-headed households in Afghanistan with digital\ntransfers of $45 every two weeks for two months. Digital aid led to significant\nimprovements in nutrition and in mental well-being. We find high usage rates,\nno evidence of diversion by the Taliban despite rigorous checks, and that 80%\nof recipients would prefer digital aid rather than pay a 2.5% fee to receive\naid in cash. Conservative assumptions put the cost of delivery under 7 cents\nper dollar, which is 10 cents per dollar less than the World Food Program's\nglobal figure for cash-based humanitarian assistance. These savings could help\nreduce hunger without additional resources. Asked to predict our findings,\npolicymakers and experts underestimated beneficiaries' ability to use digital\ntransfers and overestimated the likelihood of diversion and the costs of\ndelivery. Such misperceptions might impede the adoption of new technologies\nduring crises. These results highlight the potential for digital aid to\ncomplement existing approaches in supporting vulnerable populations during\ncrises.",

The data-driven\nnature of ML models makes them susceptible to uncertainties which are\nintroduced by sources such as noise in training data, incomplete coverage of\nthe domain, extrapolation and imperfect model architectures. To this end, we\nalso aim at quantifying the approximation uncertainties of the ML model\npredictions. Previous work using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been\nsuccessful for fuel assemblies in SAFARI-1, however, not as accurate for\ncontrol follower assemblies. The aim of this work is to improve the ML models\nfor the control assemblies by a combination of supervised and unsupervised ML\nalgorithms. The $k$-means and Affinity Propagation unsupervised ML algorithms\nare employed to identify clusters in the set of the measured axial neutron flux\nprofiles. Then, regression-based supervised ML models using DNN (with\nprediction uncertainties quantified with Monte Carlo dropout) and Gaussian\nProcess (GP) are trained for different clusters and the prediction uncertainty\nis estimated. It was found that applying the proposed procedure improves the\nprediction accuracy for the control assemblies and reduces the prediction\nuncertainty. Flux shapes predicted by DNN and GP are very close, and the\noverall accuracy became comparable to the fuel assemblies. The prediction\nuncertainty is however smaller for GP models.",

In the former regime, our computational\napproach both reproduces exact analytical results on the integrable dynamics of\nthe order parameter and generalizes those to the case of an initial thermal\nstate. The method also succeeds for the first time in describing both\nintegrable-to-thermalizing crossover and the late-time thermal decay, which is\nshown to be consistent with the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory (with the\nexponential decay time dependent on the density of quasiparticle excitations).\nWe observe the electron distribution function approaching the Fermi-Dirac\nthermal distribution at final stages. The details of two-time non-equilibrium\ndynamics depend on the density of quasiparticles in the initial state and the\nintegrability-breaking parameters, which under certain conditions may result in\na long-lived transient superconductivity consistent with experiment.",

                "abstract": "Recent work by Zanardi et al. (arXiv:2212.14340) has associated each possible\npartition of a quantum system with an operational subalgebra and proposed that\nthe short-time growth of the algebraic out-of-time-order-correlator\n(\"$\\mathcal{A}$-OTOC\") is a suitable criterion to determine which partition\narises naturally from the system's unitary dynamics. We extend this work to the\nlong-time regime. Specifically, the long-time average of the $\\mathcal{A}$-OTOC\nserves as our metric of subsystem emergence. Under this framework, natural\nsystem partitions are characterized by the tendency to minimally scramble\ninformation over long time scales. We derive an analytic expression for the\n$\\mathcal{A}$-OTOC long-time average under the non-resonance condition. We then\nconsider several physical examples and perform minimization of this quantity\nboth analytically and numerically over relevant families of algebras. For\nsimple cases subject to the non-resonant condition, minimal $\\mathcal{A}$-OTOC\nlong-time average is shown to be related to minimal entanglement of the\nHamiltonian eigenstates across the emergent system partition. Finally, we\nconjecture and provide evidence for a general structure of the algebra that\nminimizes the average for non-resonant Hamiltonians.",

                "abstract": "Radiation pressure can be used to enable optomechanical control and\nmanipulation of the quantum state of a mechanical oscillator. Optomechanical\ninteraction can also be mediated by photothermal effects which, although\nfrequently overlooked, may compete with radiation pressure interaction.\nUnderstanding of how these phenomena affect the coherent exchange of\ninformation between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom is often\nunderdeveloped, particularly in mesoscale high-power systems where photothermal\neffects can fully dominate the interaction. Here we report an effective\ntheoretical model to predict and successfully reconstruct the dynamics of a\nunique optomechanical system: a cavity-enhanced setup for macroscopic optical\nlevitation, where a free-standing mirror acts as the optomechanical oscillator.\nWe decompose the photothermal interaction into two opposing light-induced\neffects, photothermal expansion, and thermo-optic effects. We then reconstruct\na heuristic model that links the intracavity field to four types of cavity\nlength changes caused by acoustic ($x_\\textrm{ac}$), centre of mass\n($x_\\textrm{lev}$), photothermal ($x_\\textrm{ex}$) and thermo-optic\n($x_\\textrm{re}$) displacements. This offers refined predictions with a higher\ndegree of agreement with experimental results.

Here we study the topological properties of twisted\nfinite-thickness flakes of nodal superconductors under applied current,\nfocusing on the case of a $N$-layer flake with a single twisted top layer. At\nlow current bias and small twist angles, the average nodal topological gap is\nreduced with flake thickness as $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{N})$, but the Chern\nnumber grows $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(N)$. As a result, we find the thermal Hall\ncoefficient to be independent of $N$ at temperatures larger than the nodal gap.\nAt larger twist angles, we demonstrate that the nodal gap in the density of\nstates of the top layer is only weakly suppressed, allowing its detection in\nscanning tunneling microscopy experiments. These conclusions are demonstrated\nnumerically in an atomic-scale tight-binding model and analytically through the\nmodel's continuum limit, finding excellent agreement between the two. Finally,\nwe show that increasing the bias current leads to a sequence of topological\ntransitions, where the Chern number increases like $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$\nbeyond the additive effect of stacking $N$ layers. Our results show that\ntwisted superconductor flakes are \"$2.5$-dimensional\" materials, allowing to\nrealize new electronic properties due to synergy between two-dimensional layers\nextended to a finite thickness in a third dimension.",

However, reconstructing real-world captures of\ncomplex scenes still remains a challenge. Existing generic 3D reconstruction\nmethods often struggle to represent fine geometric details and do not\nadequately model reflective surfaces of large-scale scenes. Techniques that\nexplicitly focus on reflective surfaces can model complex and detailed\nreflections by exploiting better reflection parameterizations. However, we\nobserve that these methods are often not robust in real unbounded scenarios\nwhere non-reflective as well as reflective components are present. In this\nwork, we propose UniSDF, a general purpose 3D reconstruction method that can\nreconstruct large complex scenes with reflections. We investigate both\nview-based as well as reflection-based color prediction parameterization\ntechniques and find that explicitly blending these representations in 3D space\nenables reconstruction of surfaces that are more geometrically accurate,\nespecially for reflective surfaces. We further combine this representation with\na multi-resolution grid backbone that is trained in a coarse-to-fine manner,\nenabling faster reconstructions than prior methods. Extensive experiments on\nobject-level datasets DTU, Shiny Blender as well as unbounded datasets Mip-NeRF\n360 and Ref-NeRF real demonstrate that our method is able to robustly\nreconstruct complex large-scale scenes with fine details and reflective\nsurfaces.

                "abstract": "Neutrons and neutrinos are natural probes for new physics. Since they carry\nno conserved gauge quantum numbers, both can easily mix with the fermions from\nhidden sectors. A particularly interesting effect is the oscillation of a\nneutron or a neutrino into a fermion propagating in large extra dimensions. In\nfact, such a mixing has been identified as the possible origin of small\nneutrino mass. In this paper, we study neutron oscillations into an\nextra-dimensional fermion and show that this effect provides a resonance\nimaging of the Kaluza-Klein tower. The remarkable feature of this phenomenon is\nits generic nature: because of a fine spacing of the Kaluza-Klein tower,\nneutrons at a variety of energy levels, both free or within nuclei, find a bulk\noscillation partner. In particular, the partner can be a Kaluza-Klein mode of\nthe same species that gives mass to the neutrino. The existence of bulk states\nmatching the neutron energy levels of nuclear spectra gives rise to tight\nconstraints as well as to potentially observable effects. For a free neutron,\nwe predict recurrent resonant oscillations occurring with the values of the\nmagnetic field correlated with the KK levels. We derive bounds on extra\ndimensions from ultra-cold neutron experiments and suggest signatures for\nrefined measurements, which, in particular, can probe the parameter space\nmotivated by the Hierarchy Problem. Ultra-cold neutron experiments offer a\nunique way of Kaluza-Klein spectroscopy.",

                "abstract": "Low-light images often suffer from limited visibility and multiple types of\ndegradation, rendering low-light image enhancement (LIE) a non-trivial task.\nSome endeavors have been recently made to enhance low-light images using\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, they have low efficiency in\nlearning the structural information and diverse illumination levels at the\nlocal regions of an image. Consequently, the enhanced results are affected by\nunexpected artifacts, such as unbalanced exposure, blur, and color bias. To\nthis end, this paper proposes a novel framework, called ClassLIE, that combines\nthe potential of CNNs and transformers. It classifies and adaptively learns the\nstructural and illumination information from the low-light images in a holistic\nand regional manner, thus showing better enhancement performance. Our framework\nfirst employs a structure and illumination classification (SIC) module to learn\nthe degradation information adaptively. In SIC, we decompose an input image\ninto an illumination map and a reflectance map. A class prediction block is\nthen designed to classify the degradation information by calculating the\nstructure similarity scores on the reflectance map and mean square error on the\nillumination map. As such, each input image can be divided into patches with\nthree enhancement difficulty levels. Then, a feature learning and fusion (FLF)\nmodule is proposed to adaptively learn the feature information with CNNs for\ndifferent enhancement difficulty levels while learning the long-range\ndependencies for the patches in a holistic manner. Experiments on five\nbenchmark datasets consistently show our ClassLIE achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, with 25.74 PSNR and 0.92 SSIM on the LOL dataset.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Fraudulent transactions and how to detect them remain a significant problem\nfor financial institutions around the world. The need for advanced fraud\ndetection systems to safeguard assets and maintain customer trust is paramount\nfor financial institutions, but some factors make the development of effective\nand efficient fraud detection systems a challenge. One of such factors is the\nfact that fraudulent transactions are rare and that many transaction datasets\nare imbalanced; that is, there are fewer significant samples of fraudulent\ntransactions than legitimate ones. This data imbalance can affect the\nperformance or reliability of the fraud detection model. Moreover, due to the\ndata privacy laws that all financial institutions are subject to follow,\nsharing customer data to facilitate a higher-performing centralized model is\nimpossible. Furthermore, the fraud detection technique should be transparent so\nthat it does not affect the user experience. Hence, this research introduces a\nnovel approach using Federated Learning (FL) and Explainable AI (XAI) to\naddress these challenges. FL enables financial institutions to collaboratively\ntrain a model to detect fraudulent transactions without directly sharing\ncustomer data, thereby preserving data privacy and confidentiality. Meanwhile,\nthe integration of XAI ensures that the predictions made by the model can be\nunderstood and interpreted by human experts, adding a layer of transparency and\ntrust to the system. Experimental results, based on realistic transaction\ndatasets, reveal that the FL-based fraud detection system consistently\ndemonstrates high performance metrics. This study grounds FL's potential as an\neffective and privacy-preserving tool in the fight against fraud.",

                "abstract": "Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could explain some fraction of dark matter and\nshed light on many areas of early-universe physics. Despite over half a century\nof research interest, a PBH population has so far eluded detection. The most\ncompetitive constraints on the fraction of dark matter comprised of PBHs\n($f_{\\rm DM}$) in the $(10^{-9}-10)M_{\\odot}$ mass-ranges come from photometric\nmicrolensing and bound $f_{\\rm DM}\\lesssim10^{-2}-10^{-1}$. With the advent of\nthe Roman Space Telescope with its sub-milliarcsecond (mas) astrometric\ncapabilities and its planned Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS),\ndetecting astrometric microlensing signatures will become routine. Compared\nwith photometric microlensing, astrometric microlensing signals are sensitive\nto different lens masses-distance configurations and contains different\ninformation, making it a complimentary lensing probe. At sub-mas astrometric\nprecision, astrometric microlensing signals are typically detectable at larger\nlens-source separations than photometric signals, suggesting a microlensing\ndetection channel of pure astrometric events. We use a Galactic simulation to\npredict the number of detectable microlensing events during the GBTDS via this\npure astrometric microlensing channel. We find that the number of detectable\nevents peaks at $\\approx 10^{3} f_{\\rm DM}$ for a population of $ 1 M_{\\odot}$\nPBHs and tapers to $\\approx 10f_{\\rm DM}$ and $\\approx 100f_{\\rm DM}$ at\n$10^{-4}M_{\\odot}$ and $10^{3}M_{\\odot}$, respectively. Accounting for the\ndistinguishability of PBHs from Stellar lenses, we conclude the GBTDS will be\nsensitive and PBH population at $f_{\\rm DM}$ down to $\\approx10^{-1}-10^{-3}$\nfor $(10^{-1}-10^{2})M_{\\odot}$ likely yielding novel PBH constraints.",

                "abstract": "Stars can be ripped apart by tidal forces in the vicinity of a massive black\nhole, causing luminous flares classified as tidal disruption events (TDEs).\nThese events could be contributing to the mass growth of intermediate-mass\nblack holes, while new samples from ongoing transient surveys can provide\nuseful information on this otherwise undetectable growth channel. This work\naims to study the demographics of TDEs by modeling the co-evolution of black\nholes and their galactic environments in a cosmological framework. We use the\nsemi-analytic galaxy formation model L-Galaxies, which follows the evolution of\ngalaxies as well as of massive black holes, including multiple scenarios for\nblack hole seeds and growth, spin evolution, and binary black hole dynamics.\nTime-dependent TDE rates are associated with each black hole depending on the\ngalaxy environment, following the solutions to the 1-D Fokker Planck equation\nsolved with PhaseFlow. Our model produces TDE volumetric rates that are in\nagreement with the latest optical sample of 33 TDEs and previous X-ray samples.\nThis agreement requires a high occupation fraction of nuclear star clusters\nwith black holes since these star reservoirs host the majority of TDEs at all\nmass regimes. Unlike previous studies, we predict that TDE rates are an\nincreasing function of black hole mass up to a peak of ${\\sim}\\,\n10^{6.5}$M$_{\\odot}$, beyond which rates drop following a shallow power-law\ndistribution. We also discuss implications for the black hole spin distribution\nat the event horizon suppression and the cumulative growth due to TDEs.

                "abstract": "CMS and ATLAS have reported small excesses in the search for low-mass Higgs\nbosons in the di-photon decay channel at exactly the same mass, $95.4~$GeV.\nThese searches rely on improved analysis techniques, enhancing in particular\nthe discrimination against the $Z \\to e^+e^-$ background. In models beyond the\nStandard Model (SM) that extend the Higgs sector with triplets, doubly-charged\nHiggs bosons are predicted which can contribute substantially to the di-photon\ndecay rate of a light Higgs boson. The Georgi-Machacek (GM) Model is of\nparticular interest in this context, since despite containing Higgs triplets it\npreserves the electroweak $\\rho$-parameter to be$~$1 at the tree level. We show\nthat within the GM model, a Higgs boson with a mass of $\\sim 95~$GeV with a\ndi-photon decay rate as observed by CMS and ATLAS can be well described. We\ndiscuss the di-photon excess in conjunction with an excess in the $b \\bar b$\nfinal state observed at LEP and an excess observed by CMS in the di-tau final\nstate, which have been found at comparable masses with local significances of\nabout $2\\sigma$ and $3\\sigma$, respectively. The presence of a Higgs boson at\nabout $95~$GeV within the GM model would imply good prospects of the searches\nfor additional light Higgs bosons. In particular, the observed excess in the\ndi-photon channel would be expected to be correlated in the GM model with a\nlight doubly-charged Higgs boson in the mass range between $100~$GeV and\n$200~$GeV, which motivates dedicated searches in upcoming LHC Runs.",

                "abstract": "Public dataset limitations have significantly hindered the development and\nbenchmarking of learning to defer (L2D) algorithms, which aim to optimally\ncombine human and AI capabilities in hybrid decision-making systems. In such\nsystems, human availability and domain-specific concerns introduce\ndifficulties, while obtaining human predictions for training and evaluation is\ncostly. Financial fraud detection is a high-stakes setting where algorithms and\nhuman experts often work in tandem; however, there are no publicly available\ndatasets for L2D concerning this important application of human-AI teaming. To\nfill this gap in L2D research, we introduce the Financial Fraud Alert Review\nDataset (FiFAR), a synthetic bank account fraud detection dataset, containing\nthe predictions of a team of 50 highly complex and varied synthetic fraud\nanalysts, with varied bias and feature dependence. We also provide a realistic\ndefinition of human work capacity constraints, an aspect of L2D systems that is\noften overlooked, allowing for extensive testing of assignment systems under\nreal-world conditions. We use our dataset to develop a capacity-aware L2D\nmethod and rejection learning approach under realistic data availability\nconditions, and benchmark these baselines under an array of 300 distinct\ntesting scenarios. We believe that this dataset will serve as a pivotal\ninstrument in facilitating a systematic, rigorous, reproducible, and\ntransparent evaluation and comparison of L2D methods, thereby fostering the\ndevelopment of more synergistic human-AI collaboration in decision-making\nsystems.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "The Euclid mission is poised to make unprecedented measurements in cosmology\nfrom the distribution of galaxies with strong Halpha spectral emission lines.\nAccurately interpreting this data requires understanding the imprints imposed\nby the physics of galaxy formation and evolution on galaxy clustering. In this\nwork we utilize a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation (SAGE) to explore\nthe necessary components for accurately reproducing the clustering of\nEuclid-like samples of Halpha emitters. We focus on developing a Halo\nOccupation Distribution (HOD) prescription able to reproduce the clustering of\nSAGE galaxies. Typically, HOD models assume that satellite and central galaxies\nof a given type are independent events. We investigate the need for conformity,\ni.e. whether the average satellite occupation depends on the existence of a\ncentral galaxy of a given type. Incorporating conformity into HOD models is\ncrucial for reproducing the clustering in the reference galaxy sample. Another\naspect we investigate is the radial distribution of satellite galaxies within\nhaloes. The traditional density profile models, NFW and Einasto profiles, fail\nto accurately replicate the small-scale clustering measured for SAGE satellite\ngalaxies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a generalization of the NFW\nprofile, thereby enhancing our understanding of galaxy clustering.",

                "abstract": "Warning: This paper contains examples of the language that some people may\nfind offensive.\n  Detecting and reducing hateful, abusive, offensive comments is a critical and\nchallenging task on social media. Moreover, few studies aim to mitigate the\nintensity of hate speech. While studies have shown that context-level semantics\nare crucial for detecting hateful comments, most of this research focuses on\nEnglish due to the ample datasets available. In contrast, low-resource\nlanguages, like Indian languages, remain under-researched because of limited\ndatasets. Contrary to hate speech detection, hate intensity reduction remains\nunexplored in high-resource and low-resource languages. In this paper, we\npropose a novel end-to-end model, HCDIR, for Hate Context Detection, and Hate\nIntensity Reduction in social media posts. First, we fine-tuned several\npre-trained language models to detect hateful comments to ascertain the\nbest-performing hateful comments detection model. Then, we identified the\ncontextual hateful words. Identification of such hateful words is justified\nthrough the state-of-the-art explainable learning model, i.e., Integrated\nGradient (IG). Lastly, the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) model has been\nemployed to capture domain-specific nuances to reduce hate intensity. We masked\nthe 50\\% hateful words of the comments identified as hateful and predicted the\nalternative words for these masked terms to generate convincing sentences. An\noptimal replacement for the original hate comments from the feasible sentences\nis preferred. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several recent\ndatasets using automatic metric-based evaluation (BERTScore) and thorough human\nevaluation.

These solutions are validated by the simulations\nof the Gross-Pitaevskii equations for binary condensates.

                "abstract": "Traffic accidents, being a significant contributor to both human casualties\nand property damage, have long been a focal point of research for many scholars\nin the field of traffic safety. However, previous studies, whether focusing on\nstatic environmental assessments or dynamic driving analyses, as well as\npre-accident predictions or post-accident rule analyses, have typically been\nconducted in isolation. There has been a lack of an effective framework for\ndeveloping a comprehensive understanding and application of traffic safety. To\naddress this gap, this paper introduces AccidentGPT, a comprehensive accident\nanalysis and prevention multi-modal large model. AccidentGPT establishes a\nmulti-modal information interaction framework grounded in multi-sensor\nperception, thereby enabling a holistic approach to accident analysis and\nprevention in the field of traffic safety. Specifically, our capabilities can\nbe categorized as follows: for autonomous driving vehicles, we provide\ncomprehensive environmental perception and understanding to control the vehicle\nand avoid collisions. For human-driven vehicles, we offer proactive long-range\nsafety warnings and blind-spot alerts while also providing safety driving\nrecommendations and behavioral norms through human-machine dialogue and\ninteraction. Additionally, for traffic police and management agencies, our\nframework supports intelligent and real-time analysis of traffic safety,\nencompassing pedestrian, vehicles, roads, and the environment through\ncollaborative perception from multiple vehicles and road testing devices. The\nsystem is also capable of providing a thorough analysis of accident causes and\nliability after vehicle collisions. Our framework stands as the first large\nmodel to integrate comprehensive scene understanding into traffic safety\nstudies. Project page: https://accidentgpt.github.io",

                "abstract": "Reservoir computing is a machine learning framework where the readouts from a\nnonlinear system (the reservoir) are trained so that the output from the\nreservoir, when forced with an input signal, reproduces a desired output\nsignal. A common implementation of reservoir computers is to use a recurrent\nneural network as the reservoir. The design of this network can have\nsignificant effects on the performance of the reservoir computer. In this paper\nwe study the effect of the node activation function on the ability of reservoir\ncomputers to learn and predict chaotic time series. We find that the Forecast\nHorizon (FH), the time during which the reservoir's predictions remain\naccurate, can vary by an order of magnitude across a set of 16 activation\nfunctions used in machine learning. By using different functions from this set,\nand by modifying their parameters, we explore whether the entropy of node\nactivation levels or the curvature of the activation functions determine the\npredictive ability of the reservoirs. We find that the FH is low when the\nactivation function is used in a region where it has low curvature, and a\npositive correlation between curvature and FH. For the activation functions\nstudied we find that the largest FH generally occurs at intermediate levels of\nthe entropy of node activation levels. Our results show that the performance of\nreservoir computers is very sensitive to the activation function shape.\nTherefore, modifying this shape in hyperparameter optimization algorithms can\nlead to improvements in reservoir computer performance.",

In this paper,\nwe extend the scope of this effectiveness by showing that visual robot\nmanipulation can significantly benefit from large-scale video generative\npre-training. We introduce GR-1, a straightforward GPT-style model designed for\nmulti-task language-conditioned visual robot manipulation. GR-1 takes as inputs\na language instruction, a sequence of observation images, and a sequence of\nrobot states. It predicts robot actions as well as future images in an\nend-to-end manner. Thanks to a flexible design, GR-1 can be seamlessly\nfinetuned on robot data after pre-trained on a large-scale video dataset. We\nperform extensive experiments on the challenging CALVIN benchmark and a real\nrobot. On CALVIN benchmark, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline\nmethods and improves the success rate from 88.9% to 94.9%. In the setting of\nzero-shot unseen scene generalization, GR-1 improves the success rate from\n53.3% to 85.4%. In real robot experiments, GR-1 also outperforms baseline\nmethods and shows strong potentials in generalization to unseen scenes and\nobjects. We provide inaugural evidence that a unified GPT-style transformer,\naugmented with large-scale video generative pre-training, exhibits remarkable\ngeneralization to multi-task visual robot manipulation.

There are still two\nchallenges: (1) existing methods have limitations in rehabilitating subsection\nruptures in segmented vessel-like structures; (2) they are often overconfident\nin predicted segmentation results. To tackle these two challenges, this paper\nattempts to leverage the potential of spatial interconnection relationships\namong subsection ruptures from the structure rehabilitation perspective. Based\non this, we propose a novel Vessel-like Structure Rehabilitation Network\n(VSR-Net) to rehabilitate subsection ruptures and improve the model calibration\nbased on coarse vessel-like structure segmentation results. VSR-Net first\nconstructs subsection rupture clusters with Curvilinear Clustering Module\n(CCM). Then, the well-designed Curvilinear Merging Module (CMM) is applied to\nrehabilitate the subsection ruptures to obtain the refined vessel-like\nstructures. Extensive experiments on five 2D/3D medical image datasets show\nthat VSR-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) refinement\nsegmentation methods with lower calibration error. Additionally, we provide\nquantitative analysis to explain the morphological difference between the\nrehabilitation results of VSR-Net and ground truth (GT), which is smaller than\nSOTA methods and GT, demonstrating that our method better rehabilitates\nvessel-like structures by restoring subsection ruptures.",

                "abstract": "Using the in-in formalism, we generalize the recently constructed\nmagnetoelastic EFT arXiv:2112.13873 [hep-th] to describe the damping dynamics\nof ferromagnetic systems at long wavelengths. We find that the standard Gilbert\ndamping term naturally arises as the simplest leading-order symmetry-consistent\nnon-conservative contribution within the in-in framework. The EFT is easily\ngeneralized to scenarios with anisotropy and inhomogeneity. In particular, we\nfind the classic Landau-Lifshitz damping term emerges when isotropy is broken\nby a constant external background field. This provides a first principle\nexplanation for distinguishing the two types of damping dynamics that were\noriginally constructed phenomenologically. Furthermore, the EFT framework could\nalso incorporate intrinsic anisotropy of the material in a straightforward way\nusing the spurion method. For systems with inhomogeneity such as nontrivial\nspin textures, we find that the leading order derivative correction yields the\ngeneralized Gilbert damping equations that were found in condensed matter\nliterature. This shows that the EFT approach enables us to derive the form of\nhigher-derivative-order corrections in a systematic way. Lastly, using the\nphonon-magnon coupling deduced in the magnetoelastic EFT, we are able to make a\nprediction for the generic form of the phononic contribution to the damping\nequation.",

We perform a comparative study of the effects of aging on the\ncritical behavior of two standard opinion models with pairwise interactions.\nOne of them is the voter model, which is a two-state model with a dynamic that\nproceeds by simple social contagion, another is the so-called kinetic exchange\nmodel, which allows a third (neutral) state and the formed opinion depends on\nthe previous opinions of both interacting agents. Furthermore, in the noisy\nversion of both models, random opinion changes are also allowed, regardless of\nthe interactions. Due to aging, the probability of change diminishes with the\nage, and to take this into account we consider algebraic and exponential\nkernels. We investigate the situation where aging acts only on pairwise\ninteractions. Analytical predictions for the critical curves of the order\nparameters are obtained for the opinion dynamics on a complete graph, in good\nagreement with agent-based simulations.

However, current dynamic network approaches focus on discrete-time\nnetworks or treat links in continuous-time networks as instantaneous events.\nTherefore, these approaches have limitations in capturing the persistence or\nabsence of links that continuously emerge and disappear over time for\nparticular durations. To address this, we propose a novel stochastic process\nrelying on survival functions to model the durations of links and their\nabsences over time. This forms a generic new likelihood specification\nexplicitly accounting for intermittent edge-persistent networks, namely GraSSP:\nGraph Representation with Sequential Survival Process.

By further accounting for the interplay\nbetween quantum confinement, the external static electric field, the\nThomas-Fermi screening in the electron-phonon matrix element, and the effect of\nconfinement on the Coulomb repulsion parameter, the theory predicts the\ncritical value of the external electric field as a function of the film\nthickness, above which superconductivity is suppressed.

First, we propose\nto adopt the posterior Cram\\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) as the sensing performance\nmetric with prior information, which quantifies a lower bound of the\nmean-squared error (MSE). Since the PCRB is in a complicated form, we derive a\ntight upper bound of it to draw more insights.

                "abstract": "Automated machine learning (AutoML) streamlines the creation of ML models.\nWhile most methods select the \"best\" model based on predictive quality, it's\ncrucial to acknowledge other aspects, such as interpretability and resource\nconsumption. This holds particular importance in the context of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs), as these models are often perceived as computationally\nintensive black boxes. In the challenging domain of time series forecasting,\nDNNs achieve stunning results, but specialized approaches for automatically\nselecting models are scarce. In this paper, we propose AutoXPCR - a novel\nmethod for automated and explainable multi-objective model selection. Our\napproach leverages meta-learning to estimate any model's performance along PCR\ncriteria, which encompass (P)redictive error, (C)omplexity, and (R)esource\ndemand. Explainability is addressed on multiple levels, as our interactive\nframework can prioritize less complex models and provide by-product\nexplanations of recommendations. We demonstrate practical feasibility by\ndeploying AutoXPCR on over 1000 configurations across 114 data sets from\nvarious domains. Our method clearly outperforms other model selection\napproaches - on average, it only requires 20% of computation costs for\nrecommending models with 90% of the best-possible quality.",

BCIs\nuse predictive models to interpret brain signals for various high-stake\napplications. However, achieving explainability in these complex models is\nchallenging as it compromises accuracy. The field of XAI has emerged to address\nthe need for explainability across various stakeholders, but there is a lack of\nan integrated perspective in XAI for BCI (XAI4BCI) literature. It is necessary\nto differentiate key concepts like explainability, interpretability, and\nunderstanding in this context and formulate a comprehensive framework. To\nunderstand the need of XAI for BCI, we pose six key research questions for a\nsystematic review and meta-analysis, encompassing its purposes, applications,\nusability, and technical feasibility. We employ the PRISMA methodology --\npreferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses to review\n(n=1246) and analyze (n=84) studies published in 2015 and onwards for key\ninsights. The results highlight that current research primarily focuses on\ninterpretability for developers and researchers, aiming to justify outcomes and\nenhance model performance. We discuss the unique approaches, advantages, and\nlimitations of XAI4BCI from the literature. We draw insights from philosophy,\npsychology, and social sciences. We propose a design space for XAI4BCI,\nconsidering the evolving need to visualize and investigate predictive model\noutcomes customised for various stakeholders in the BCI development and\ndeployment lifecycle. This paper is the first to focus solely on reviewing\nXAI4BCI research articles.

                "abstract": "Recent growing interest in using machine learning for turbulence modelling\nhas led to many proposed data-driven turbulence models in the literature.\nHowever, most of these models have not been developed with overcoming\nnon-unique mapping (NUM) in mind, which is a significant source of training and\nprediction error. Only NUM caused by one-dimensional channel flow data has been\nwell studied in the literature, despite most data-driven models having been\ntrained on two-dimensional flow data. The present work aims to be the first\ndetailed investigation on NUM caused by two-dimensional flows. A method for\nquantifying NUM is proposed and demonstrated on data from a flow over periodic\nhills, and an impinging jet. The former is a wall-bounded separated flow, and\nthe latter is a shear flow containing stagnation and recirculation. This work\nconfirms that data from two-dimensional flows can cause NUM in data-driven\nturbulence models with the commonly used invariant inputs. This finding was\nverified with both cases, which contain different flow phenomena, hence showing\nthat NUM is not limited to specific flow physics. Furthermore, the proposed\nmethod revealed that regions containing low strain and rotation or near pure\nshear cause the majority of NUM in both cases - approximately 76% and 89% in\nthe flow over periodic hills and impinging jet, respectively. These results led\nto viscosity ratio being selected as a supplementary input variable (SIV),\ndemonstrating that SIVs can reduce NUM caused by data from two-dimensional\nflows.",

In this work, we propose\na novel multi-DrosoNet localization system, dubbed RegionDrosoNet, with\nsignificantly improved VPR performance, while preserving a low-computational\nprofile. Our approach relies on specializing distinct groups of DrosoNets on\ndifferently sliced partitions of the original image, increasing extrinsic model\ndifferentiation.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "The initial density of dark matter (DM) particles, otherwise secluded from\nthe standard model (SM), may be generated at reheating, with an initial\ntemperature ratio for internal thermalizations, $\\xi_i=T_{\\rm DM,i}/T_{\\rm\nSM,i}$. This scenario necessarily implies inflaton-mediated scatterings between\nDM and SM after reheating, with a rate fixed by the relic abundance of DM and\nthe reheat temperature. These scatterings can be important for an inflaton mass\nand reheat temperature as high as $\\mathcal{O}(10^7 {~\\rm GeV})$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^9{~\\rm GeV})$, respectively, since the thermally averaged\ncollision terms become approximately independent of the inflaton mass when the\nbath temperature is larger than the mass. The impact of these scatterings on DM\ncosmology is studied modeling the perturbative reheating physics by a\ngauge-invariant set of inflaton interactions upto dimension-5 with the SM gauge\nbosons, fermions and the Higgs fields. It is observed that an initially lower\n(higher) DM temperature will rapidly increase (decrease), even with very small\ncouplings to the inflaton. There is a sharp lower bound on the DM mass below\nwhich the relic abundance cannot be satisfied due to faster back-scatterings\ndepleting DM quanta to SM particles. For low DM masses, the CMB constraints\nbecome stronger due to the collisions for $\\xi_i<1$, probing values as small as\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, and weaker for $\\xi_i>1$. The BBN constraints become\nstronger due to the collisions for lower DM masses, probing $\\xi_i$ as small as\n$\\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, and weaker for higher DM mass. Thus inflaton-mediated\ncollisions with predictable rates, relevant even for high-scale inflation\nmodels, can significantly impact the cosmology of light DM.",

                "abstract": "The nature of the emission region around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the\nsupermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, remains under debate. A\nprediction of jet models is that a frequency-dependent shift in the position of\nthe radio core (core-shift) of active galactic nucleii occurs when observing\nemission dominated by a highly collimated relativistic outflow. We use\nmillimeter Very Long Baseline Interferometry to study the frequency-dependent\nposition of Sgr A*'s radio core, estimate the core-shift for different emission\nmodels, investigate the core-shift evolution as a function of viewing angle and\norientation, and study its behaviour in the presence of interstellar\nscattering. We simulate images of the emission around Sgr A* for accretion\ninflow models (disks) and relativistic outflow models (jets). They are based on\nthree-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We\ncreate flux density maps at 22, 43 and 86 GHz sampling different viewing angles\nand orientations, and examine the effects of scattering. Jet-dominated models\nshow significantly larger core-shifts (in some cases by a factor of 16) than\ndisk-dominated models, intermediate viewing angles (i=30, 45 degrees) show the\nlargest core-shifts. Our jet models follow a power-law relation for the\nfrequency dependent position of Sgr A*'s core. Their core-shifts decrease as\nthe position angle increases from 0 to 90 degrees. Disk models do not fit well\na power-law relation and their core-shifts are insensitive to changes in\nviewing angle. We place an upper limit of 241.65 +-1.93 microarcseconds per cm\nfor the core-shift of jet models including refractive scattering. Our jet\nmodels agree with earlier predictions of AGN with conical jets, and the\ncore-shift is retrievable even in the presence of interstellar scattering.",

                "abstract": "Accurate estimation of photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) is crucial in\nstudies of both galaxy evolution and cosmology using current and future large\nsky surveys. In this study, we employ Random Forest (RF), a machine learning\nalgorithm, to estimate photo-$z$ and investigate the systematic uncertainties\naffecting the results. Using galaxy flux and color as input features, we\nconstruct a mapping between input features and redshift by using a training set\nof simulated data, generated from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera\nfor Surveys (HST-ACS) and COSMOS catalogue, with the expected instrumental\neffects of the planned China Space Station Telescope (CSST). To improve the\naccuracy and confidence of predictions, we incorporate inverse variance\nweighting and perturb the catalog using input feature errors. Our results show\nthat weighted RF can achieve a photo-$z$ accuracy of $\\rm \\sigma_{NMAD}=0.025$\nand an outlier fraction of $\\rm \\eta=2.045\\%$, significantly better than the\nvalues of $\\rm \\sigma_{NMAD}=0.043$ and $\\rm \\eta=6.45\\%$ obtained by the\nwidely used Easy and Accurate Zphot from Yale (EAZY) software which uses\ntemplate-fitting method. Furthermore, we have calculated the importance of each\ninput feature for different redshift ranges and found that the most important\ninput features reflect the approximate position of the break features in galaxy\nspectra, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to extract physical information\nfrom data. Additionally, we have established confidence indices and error bars\nfor each prediction value based on the shape of the redshift probability\ndistribution function, suggesting that screening sources with high confidence\ncan further reduce the outlier fraction.",

                "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be the leading cause\nof mortality on a global scale. In recent years, the application of artificial\nintelligence (AI) techniques, particularly deep learning (DL), has gained\nconsiderable popularity for evaluating the various aspects of CVDs. Moreover,\nusing fundus images and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to\ndiagnose retinal diseases has been extensively studied. To better understand\nheart function and anticipate changes based on microvascular characteristics\nand function, researchers are currently exploring the integration of AI with\nnon-invasive retinal scanning. Leveraging AI-assisted early detection and\nprediction of cardiovascular diseases on a large scale holds excellent\npotential to mitigate cardiovascular events and alleviate the economic burden\non healthcare systems. Method: A comprehensive search was conducted across\nvarious databases, including PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of\nSciences, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, using specific keywords related\nto cardiovascular diseases and artificial intelligence. Results: A total of 87\nEnglish-language publications, selected for relevance were included in the\nstudy, and additional references were considered. This study presents an\noverview of the current advancements and challenges in employing retinal\nimaging and artificial intelligence to identify cardiovascular disorders and\nprovides insights for further exploration in this field. Conclusion:\nResearchers aim to develop precise disease prognosis patterns as the aging\npopulation and global CVD burden increase.

In\nthis paper, we propose a new approach named Graph ODE with factorized\nprototypes (GOAT) to address the problem. The core of GOAT is to incorporate\nfactorized prototypes from contextual knowledge into a continuous graph ODE\nframework. Specifically, GOAT employs representation disentanglement and system\nparameters to extract both object-level and system-level contexts from\nhistorical trajectories, which allows us to explicitly model their independent\ninfluence and thus enhances the generalization capability under system changes.\nThen, we integrate these disentangled latent representations into a graph ODE\nmodel, which determines a combination of various interacting prototypes for\nenhanced model expressivity. The entire model is optimized using an end-to-end\nvariational inference framework to maximize the likelihood. Extensive\nexperiments in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings validate\nthe superiority of GOAT.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Hospital readmission prediction is considered an essential approach to\ndecreasing readmission rates, which is a key factor in assessing the quality\nand efficacy of a healthcare system. Previous studies have extensively utilized\nthree primary modalities, namely electronic health records (EHR), medical\nimages, and clinical notes, to predict hospital readmissions. However, the\nmajority of these studies did not integrate information from all three\nmodalities or utilize the spatiotemporal relationships present in the dataset.\nThis study introduces a novel model called the Multimodal Spatiotemporal\nGraph-Transformer (MuST) for predicting hospital readmissions. By employing\nGraph Convolution Networks and temporal transformers, we can effectively\ncapture spatial and temporal dependencies in EHR and chest radiographs. We then\npropose a fusion transformer to combine the spatiotemporal features from the\ntwo modalities mentioned above with the features from clinical notes extracted\nby a pre-trained, domain-specific transformer. We assess the effectiveness of\nour methods using the latest publicly available dataset, MIMIC-IV. The\nexperimental results indicate that the inclusion of multimodal features in MuST\nimproves its performance in comparison to unimodal methods. Furthermore, our\nproposed pipeline outperforms the current leading methods in the prediction of\nhospital readmissions.",

                "abstract": "Recently, ChatGPT has attracted great attention from the code analysis\ndomain. Prior works show that ChatGPT has the capabilities of processing\nfoundational code analysis tasks, such as abstract syntax tree generation,\nwhich indicates the potential of using ChatGPT to comprehend code syntax and\nstatic behaviors. However, it is unclear whether ChatGPT can complete more\ncomplicated real-world vulnerability management tasks, such as the prediction\nof security relevance and patch correctness, which require an all-encompassing\nunderstanding of various aspects, including code syntax, program semantics, and\nrelated manual comments.\n  In this paper, we explore ChatGPT's capabilities on 6 tasks involving the\ncomplete vulnerability management process with a large-scale dataset containing\n78,445 samples. For each task, we compare ChatGPT against SOTA approaches,\ninvestigate the impact of different prompts, and explore the difficulties. The\nresults suggest promising potential in leveraging ChatGPT to assist\nvulnerability management. One notable example is ChatGPT's proficiency in tasks\nlike generating titles for software bug reports. Furthermore, our findings\nreveal the difficulties encountered by ChatGPT and shed light on promising\nfuture directions. For instance, directly providing random demonstration\nexamples in the prompt cannot consistently guarantee good performance in\nvulnerability management. By contrast, leveraging ChatGPT in a self-heuristic\nway -- extracting expertise from demonstration examples itself and integrating\nthe extracted expertise in the prompt is a promising research direction.\nBesides, ChatGPT may misunderstand and misuse the information in the prompt.\nConsequently, effectively guiding ChatGPT to focus on helpful information\nrather than the irrelevant content is still an open problem.",

Increased grey seal harvests have been suggested to improve\ncod survival, however, predicting the response of cod to seal abundance changes\nin the sGSL is complicated by a hypothesized triangular food web involving\nseals, cod, and small pelagic fishes, wherein the pelagic fishes are prey for\ncod and grey seals, but may also prey on young cod. Grey seals may therefore\nhave an indirect positive effect on prerecruit cod survival via predation on\npelagic fish.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "The double pulsar system, PSR J0737$-$3039A/B, consists of two neutron stars\nbound together in a highly relativistic orbit that is viewed nearly edge-on\nfrom the Earth. This alignment results in brief radio eclipses of the\nfast-rotating pulsar A when it passes behind the toroidal magnetosphere of the\nslow-rotating pulsar B. The morphology of these eclipses is strongly dependent\non the geometric orientation and rotation phase of pulsar B, and their\ntime-evolution can be used to constrain the geodetic precession rate of the\npulsar. We demonstrate a Bayesian inference framework for modelling eclipse\nlight-curves obtained with MeerKAT between 2019-2023. Using a hierarchical\ninference approach, we obtained a precession rate of $\\Omega_{\\rm SO}^{\\rm B} =\n{5.16^{\\circ}}^{+0.32^{\\circ}}_{-0.34^{\\circ}}$ yr$^{-1}$ for pulsar B,\nconsistent with predictions from General Relativity to a relative uncertainty\nof 6.5%. This updated measurement provides a 6.1% test of relativistic\nspin-orbit coupling in the strong-field regime. We show that a simultaneous fit\nto all of our observed eclipses can in principle return a $\\sim$1.5% test of\nspin-orbit coupling. However, systematic effects introduced by the current\ngeometric orientation of pulsar B along with inconsistencies between the\nobserved and predicted eclipse light curves result in difficult to quantify\nuncertainties. Assuming the validity of General Relativity, we definitively\nshow that the spin-axis of pulsar B is misaligned from the total angular\nmomentum vector by $40.6^{\\circ} \\pm 0.1^{\\circ}$ and that the orbit of the\nsystem is inclined by approximately $90.5^{\\circ}$ from the direction of our\nline of sight. Our measured geometry for pulsar B suggests the largely empty\nemission cone contains an elongated horseshoe shaped beam centered on the\nmagnetic axis, and that it may not be re-detected as a radio pulsar until\nearly-2035.",

                "abstract": "Control of a dynamical system without the knowledge of dynamics is an\nimportant and challenging task. Modern machine learning approaches, such as\ndeep neural networks (DNNs), allow for the estimation of a dynamics model from\ncontrol inputs and corresponding state observation outputs. Such data-driven\nmodels are often utilized for the derivation of model-based controllers.\nHowever, in general, there are no guarantees that a model represented by DNNs\nwill be controllable according to the formal control-theoretical meaning of\ncontrollability, which is crucial for the design of effective controllers. This\noften precludes the use of DNN-estimated models in applications, where formal\ncontrollability guarantees are required. In this proof-of-the-concept work, we\npropose a control-theoretical method that explicitly enhances models estimated\nfrom data with controllability. That is achieved by augmenting the model\nestimation objective with a controllability constraint, which penalizes models\nwith a low degree of controllability. As a result, the models estimated with\nthe proposed controllability constraint allow for the derivation of more\nefficient controllers, they are interpretable by the control-theoretical\nquantities and have a lower long-term prediction error. The proposed method\nprovides new insights on the connection between the DNN-based estimation of\nunknown dynamics and the control-theoretical guarantees of the solution\nproperties. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in two\nstandard classical control systems with state observation given by low\nresolution high-dimensional images.",

For that, a controller decides whether to pull\nan update at each slot, predicting what is probably occurring at the source and\nhow much effective impact that update could have at the endpoint. Thus,\ntemporal changes in the source evolution could modify the query arrivals so as\nto capture important updates.

In\norder to study these two aspects, five high-resource languages and two NLP\ntasks were chosen. ChatGPT was asked to perform both tasks in the five\nlanguages and to give a numerical confidence value for each answer. The results\nshow that all the selected high-resource languages perform similarly and that\nChatGPT does not have a good confidence calibration, often being overconfident\nand never giving low confidence values.",

A subject of ongoing debate, the capacity\nmarket is viewed by its proponents as a crucial mechanism to ensure system\nreliability, while critics highlight its drawbacks such as market distortion.\nUnder a novel analytical framework, we rigorously evaluate the impact of the\ncapacity market on generators' revenue and system reliability.

We also\ndevelop a leader-follower model to study market power. We show that the\ncapacity market incentivizes the investment of generators with lower net cost\nof new entry. It also facilitates reliability by preventing significant\nphysical withholding when the demand is relatively high. Nevertheless, the\ncapacity market may not provide enough revenue for peaking plants. Moreover, it\nis susceptible to market power, which necessitates tailored market power\nmitigation measures depending on market dynamics.

This promises both a closed-loop- and constraint satisfaction\nperformance equivalent to common Robustified NMPC approaches, while drastically\nreducing the computational complexity. The main idea lies in approximating the\nellipsoidal uncertainty sets propagation over the prediction horizon with the\nsystem dynamics' sensitivities inferred from the last optimal control problem\n(OCP) solution, and similarly for the gradients to robustify the constraints.\nThus, we do not require the decision variables related to the uncertainty\npropagation within the OCP, rendering it computationally tractable. Next, we\nillustrate the real-time control capabilities of our algorithm in handling a\ncomplex, high-dimensional, and highly nonlinear system, namely the trajectory\nfollowing of an autonomous passenger vehicle modeled with a dynamic nonlinear\nsingle-track model. Our experimental findings, alongside a comparative\nassessment against other Robust NMPC approaches, affirm the robustness of our\nmethod in effectively tracking an optimal racetrack trajectory while satisfying\nthe nonlinear constraints.

Recent\nstudies show that this will be difficult to do with just one learning model.\nThe problem can be more complex for companies of construction section, due to\nthe dependency of their behavior on more conditions. This study aims to provide\na hybrid model for improving the accuracy of prediction for stock price index\nof companies in construction section. The contribution of this paper can be\nconsidered as follows: First, a combination of several prediction models is\nused to predict stock price, so that learning models can cover each other's\nerror. In this research, an ensemble model based on Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Classification and Regression Tree\n(CART) is presented for predicting stock price index. Second, the optimization\ntechnique is used to determine the effect of each learning model on the\nprediction result. For this purpose, first all three mentioned algorithms\nprocess the data simultaneously and perform the prediction operation. Then,\nusing the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm, the output weight of each algorithm is\ndetermined as a coefficient. Finally, using the ensemble technique, these\nresults are combined and the final output is generated through weighted\naveraging on optimal coefficients. The results showed that using CS\noptimization in the proposed ensemble system is highly effective in reducing\nprediction error. Comparing the evaluation results of the proposed system with\nsimilar algorithms, indicates that our model is more accurate and can be useful\nfor predicting stock price index in real-world scenarios.",

In this work we argue that the speech\nrecognition input modality of ChatGPT provides a more intuitive and natural way\nfor policy makers to interact with the database of the server of an\nagricultural data processing system to which a large, dispersed network of\nautomated insect traps and sensors probes reports.

The output of the language model\ncan interact through Python code and Pandas with the entire database, visualize\nthe results and use speech synthesis to engage the user in an iterative and\nrefining discussion related to the data.

                "abstract": "Nature has always been our inspiration in the research, design and\ndevelopment of materials and has driven us to gain a deep understanding of the\nmechanisms that characterize anisotropy and inelastic behavior. All this\nknowledge has been accumulated in the principles of thermodynamics. Deduced\nfrom these principles, the multiplicative decomposition combined with pseudo\npotentials are powerful and universal concepts. Simultaneously, the tremendous\nincrease in computational performance enabled us to investigate and rethink our\nhistory-dependent material models to make the most of our predictions. Today,\nwe have reached a point where materials and their models are becoming\nincreasingly sophisticated. This raises the question: How do we find the best\nmodel that includes all inelastic effects to explain our complex data?\nConstitutive Artificial Neural Networks (CANN) may answer this question. Here,\nwe extend the CANNs to inelastic materials (iCANN). Rigorous considerations of\nobjectivity, rigid motion of the reference configuration, multiplicative\ndecomposition and its inherent non-uniqueness, restrictions of energy and\npseudo potential, and consistent evolution guide us towards the architecture of\nthe iCANN satisfying thermodynamics per design. We combine feed-forward\nnetworks of the free energy and pseudo potential with a recurrent neural\nnetwork approach to take time dependencies into account. We demonstrate that\nthe iCANN is capable of autonomously discovering models for artificially\ngenerated data, the response of polymers for cyclic loading and the relaxation\nbehavior of muscle data. As the design of the network is not limited to\nvisco-elasticity, our vision is that the iCANN will reveal to us new ways to\nfind the various inelastic phenomena hidden in the data and to understand their\ninteraction.

A specific model of $f(R)$ gravity is considered, allowing a\nperturbative approach to the problem. The Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem is\nused to analytically calculate the critical temperature and the condensation\noperator. An expression for the critical temperature in terms of the charge\ndensity including the correction from modified gravity is derived. It is seen\nthat the higher values of the Born-Infeld coupling parameter make the\ncondensation harder to form. In addition, the limiting values of this\nparameter, above which Born-Infeld electrodynamics cannot be applied, are found\nfor different dimensions. Another interesting property is that the increasing\nmodifications of $f(R)$ gravity lead to larger values of the critical\ntemperature and a decrease in the condensation gap, which means that the\ncondensation is easier to form.",

This study\ntherefore proposed two assessment styles based on theoretical perspectives and\nnormative positions. According to the case-by-case style, referees use many and\ndifferent criteria, weight criteria on a case-by-case basis, and integrate\ncriteria in a complex, non-mechanical way into their overall judgment.\nAccording to the uniform style, referees use a small fraction of the available\ncriteria, apply the same criteria, weight the criteria in the same way, and\nintegrate the criteria based on simple rules (i.e., fast-and-frugal\nheuristics). These two styles were examined using a unique dataset from a\ncareer funding scheme that contained a comparatively large number of evaluation\ncriteria. A heuristic (fast-and-frugal trees) and a complex procedure (logistic\nregression) were employed to describe how referees integrate the criteria into\ntheir overall judgment. The logistic regression predicted the referees' overall\nassessment with high accuracy and slightly more accurately than the\nfast-and-frugal trees. Overall, the results of this study support the uniform\nstyle but also indicate that the uniform style needs to be revised as follows:\nreferees use many criteria and integrate the criteria using complex rules.\nHowever, and most importantly, the revised style could describe most - but not\nall - of the referees' judgments. Future studies should therefore examine how\nreferees' judgments can be characterized in those cases where the uniform style\nfailed. Moreover, the evaluation process of referees should be studied in more\nempirical and theoretical detail.",

We consider 6 morphological classes -- point-like, uniform\ncircular disc, crescent, dual disc, crescent with elliptical accretion disc,\nand crescent with double jet lobes -- described by phenomenological parameters.\nUsing simple logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional\nneural network, and random forest models on closure invariants obtained from a\nsparse aperture coverage, we find that all models except logistic regression\nare able to classify the morphology with an $F_1$ score $\\gtrsim 0.8$. The\nclassification accuracy notably improves with greater aperture coverage. We\nalso estimate morphological parameters of uniform circular disc, crescent, and\ndual disc using simple MLP models, and perform a parametric image\nreconstruction. The reconstructed images do not retain information about\nabsolute position or intensity scale. The estimated parameters and\nreconstructed images are found to correspond well with the inputs.

In this work we study a dark\nmatter model in which freeze-out is triggered by a strong first-order phase\ntransition in a dark sector, and show that this phase transition must also\nhappen close to the electroweak scale, i.e. in the temperature range relevant\nfor gravitational wave searches with the LISA mission. Specifically, we\nconsider the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)^\\prime$ gauge symmetry through the\nvacuum expectation value of a scalar field, which generates the mass of a\nfermionic dark matter candidate that subsequently annihilates into dark Higgs\nand gauge bosons. In this set-up the peak frequency of the gravitational wave\nbackground is tightly correlated with the dark matter relic abundance, and\nimposing the observed value for the latter implies that the former must lie in\nthe milli-Hertz range. A peculiar feature of our set-up is that the dark sector\nis not necessarily in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model during the\nphase transition, and hence the temperatures of the two sectors evolve\nindependently. Nevertheless, the requirement that the universe does not enter\nan extended period of matter domination after the phase transition, which would\nstrongly dilute any gravitational wave signal, places a lower bound on the\nportal coupling that governs the entropy transfer between the two sectors. As a\nresult, the predictions for the peak frequency of gravitational waves in the\nLISA band are robust, while the amplitude can change depending on the initial\ndark sector temperature.",

The MTH is the simplest Neutral Naturalness solution\nto the little hierarchy problem and predicts the existence of a twin dark\nsector related to the Standard Model (SM) by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is\nonly softly broken by a higher twin Higgs vacuum expectation value. The\nasymmetric reheating cools the twin sector compared to the visible one, thus\nevading cosmological bounds on $\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The addition of\n(twin-)colored scalars allows for the generation of the visible baryon\nasymmetry and, by the virtue of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, also results in\nthe generation of a twin baryon asymmetry. We identify a unique scenario with\ntop-philic couplings for the new scalars that can satisfy all cosmological,\nproton decay and LHC constraints; yield the observed SM baryon asymmetry; and\ngenerate a wide range of possible twin baryon DM fractions, from negligible to\nunity.

In this study we examine the gas\nthermodynamics, kinematics, and the effects of SMBH feedback on the core of\nPerseus-like galaxy clusters with a new simulation suite: TNG-Cluster. We first\nmake a selection of simulated clusters similar to Perseus based on total mass\nand inner ICM properties, i.e. cool-core nature. We identify 30 Perseus-like\nsystems among the 352 TNG-Cluster halos at $z=0$. Many exhibit thermodynamical\nprofiles and X-ray morphologies with disturbed features such as ripples,\nbubbles and shock fronts that are qualitatively similar to X-ray observations\nof Perseus. To study observable gas motions, we generate XRISM mock X-ray\nobservations and conduct a spectral analysis of the synthetic data. In\nagreement with existing Hitomi measurements, TNG-Cluster predicts subsonic gas\nturbulence in the central regions of Perseus-like clusters, with a typical\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion of 200 km/s. This implies that turbulent\npressure contributes $< 10\\%$ to the dominant thermal pressure. In TNG-Cluster,\nsuch low (inferred) values of ICM velocity dispersion coexist with\nhigh-velocity outflows and bulk motions of relatively small amounts of\nsuper-virial hot gas, moving up to thousands of km/s. However, detecting these\noutflows observationally may prove challenging due to their anisotropic nature\nand projection effects. Driven by SMBH feedback, such outflows are responsible\nfor many morphological disturbances in the X-ray maps of cluster cores. They\nalso increase both the inferred, and intrinsic, ICM velocity dispersion. This\neffect is somewhat stronger when velocity dispersion is measured from\nhigher-energy lines.",

                "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning have been primarily driven by the use of\nlarge models trained on increasingly vast datasets. While neural scaling laws\nhave emerged to predict network performance given a specific level of\ncomputational resources, the growing demand for expansive datasets raises\nconcerns. To address this, a new research direction has emerged, focusing on\nthe creation of synthetic data as a substitute. In this study, we investigate\nhow neural networks exhibit shape bias during training on synthetic datasets,\nserving as an indicator of the synthetic data quality. Specifically, our\nfindings indicate three key points: (1) Shape bias varies across network\narchitectures and types of supervision, casting doubt on its reliability as a\npredictor for generalization and its ability to explain differences in model\nrecognition compared to human capabilities. (2) Relying solely on shape bias to\nestimate generalization is unreliable, as it is entangled with diversity and\nnaturalism. (3) We propose a novel interpretation of shape bias as a tool for\nestimating the diversity of samples within a dataset. Our research aims to\nclarify the implications of using synthetic data and its associated shape bias\nin deep learning, addressing concerns regarding generalization and dataset\nquality.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has shown great importance in\nnumerous industries. Current state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN)-based\nforecasting methods usually require both graph networks (e.g., GCN) and\ntemporal networks (e.g., LSTM) to capture inter-series (spatial) dynamics and\nintra-series (temporal) dependencies, respectively. However, the uncertain\ncompatibility of the two networks puts an extra burden on handcrafted model\ndesigns. Moreover, the separate spatial and temporal modeling naturally\nviolates the unified spatiotemporal inter-dependencies in real world, which\nlargely hinders the forecasting performance. To overcome these problems, we\nexplore an interesting direction of directly applying graph networks and\nrethink MTS forecasting from a pure graph perspective. We first define a novel\ndata structure, hypervariate graph, which regards each series value (regardless\nof variates or timestamps) as a graph node, and represents sliding windows as\nspace-time fully-connected graphs. This perspective considers spatiotemporal\ndynamics unitedly and reformulates classic MTS forecasting into the predictions\non hypervariate graphs. Then, we propose a novel architecture Fourier Graph\nNeural Network (FourierGNN) by stacking our proposed Fourier Graph Operator\n(FGO) to perform matrix multiplications in Fourier space. FourierGNN\naccommodates adequate expressiveness and achieves much lower complexity, which\ncan effectively and efficiently accomplish the forecasting. Besides, our\ntheoretical analysis reveals FGO's equivalence to graph convolutions in the\ntime domain, which further verifies the validity of FourierGNN. Extensive\nexperiments on seven datasets have demonstrated our superior performance with\nhigher efficiency and fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

                "abstract": "This thesis presents a formalization of martingales in arbitrary Banach\nspaces using Isabelle/HOL. We begin by examining formalizations in prominent\nproof repositories and extend the definition of the conditional expectation\noperator from the real numbers to general Banach spaces. The current\nformalization of conditional expectation in the Isabelle library is limited to\nreal-valued functions. To overcome this limitation, we use measure theoretic\narguments to construct the conditional expectation in Banach spaces using\nsuitable limits of simple functions. Subsequently, we define stochastic\nprocesses and introduce the concepts of adapted, progressively measurable and\npredictable processes using suitable locale definitions. We show the relation\n$$\\text{adapted} \\supseteq \\text{progressive} \\supseteq \\text{predictable}$$\nFurthermore, we show that progressive measurability and adaptedness are\nequivalent when the indexing set is discrete. We pay special attention to\npredictable processes in discrete-time, showing that $(X_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$\nis predictable if and only if $(X_{n + 1})_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is adapted.\n  We rigorously define martingales, submartingales, and supermartingales,\npresenting their first consequences and corollaries. Discrete-time martingales\nare given special attention in the formalization. In every step of our\nformalization, we make extensive use of the powerful locale system of Isabelle.\n  The formalization further contributes by generalizing concepts in Bochner\nintegration by extending their application from the real numbers to arbitrary\nBanach spaces equipped with a second-countable topology. Induction schemes for\nintegrable simple functions on Banach spaces are introduced. Additionally, we\nformalize a powerful result called the \"Averaging Theorem\" which allows us to\nshow that densities are unique in Banach spaces.",

While numerous deep learning strategies exist\nto capture this information, many make networks larger, require more data, are\nmore demanding to compute, and are difficult to interpret. This limits their\nusefulness in real-world applications facing even modest computational or data\nconstraints and can further complicate their translation into practice. We\npresent a minimal, computationally efficient Time Scale Network combining the\ntranslation and dilation sequence used in discrete wavelet transforms with\ntraditional convolutional neural networks and back-propagation. The network\nsimultaneously learns features at many time scales for sequence classification\nwith significantly reduced parameters and operations. We demonstrate advantages\nin Atrial Dysfunction detection including: superior accuracy-per-parameter and\naccuracy-per-operation, fast training and inference speeds, and visualization\nand interpretation of learned patterns in atrial dysfunction detection on ECG\nsignals. We also demonstrate impressive performance in seizure prediction using\nEEG signals. Our network isolated a few time scales that could be strategically\nselected to achieve 90.9% accuracy using only 1,133 active parameters and\nconsistently converged on pulsatile waveform shapes. This method does not rest\non any constraints or assumptions regarding signal content and could be\nleveraged in any area of time series analysis dealing with signals containing\nfeatures at many time scales.",

The aim is to aid medical practitioners\ndiagnose and treat the many ailments affecting the heart. Towards this,\nmodelling cardiac electrophysiology is crucial as the heart's electrical\nactivity underlies the contraction mechanism and the resulting pumping action.\nThe governing equations and the constitutive laws describing the electrical\nactivity in the heart are coupled, nonlinear, and involve a fast moving wave\nfront, which is generally solved by the finite element method. The simulation\nof this complex system as part of a virtual heart model is challenging due to\nthe necessity of fine spatial and temporal resolution of the domain. Therefore,\nefficient surrogate models are needed to predict the dynamics under varying\nparameters and inputs. In this work, we develop an adaptive, projection-based\nsurrogate model for cardiac electrophysiology. We introduce an a posteriori\nerror estimator that can accurately and efficiently quantify the accuracy of\nthe surrogate model. Using the error estimator, we systematically update our\nsurrogate model through a greedy search of the parameter space. Furthermore,\nusing the error estimator, the parameter search space is dynamically updated\nsuch that the most relevant samples get chosen at every iteration.

To\ncircumvent the potential imperfections of these approaches, a quantification of\nthe prediction confidence is crucial to guide decision-making systems that rely\non depth estimation. In this paper, we propose MonoProb, a new unsupervised\nmonocular depth estimation method that returns an interpretable uncertainty,\nwhich means that the uncertainty reflects the expected error of the network in\nits depth predictions. We rethink the stereo or the structure-from-motion\nparadigms used to train unsupervised monocular depth models as a probabilistic\nproblem. Within a single forward pass inference, this model provides a depth\nprediction and a measure of its confidence, without increasing the inference\ntime. We then improve the performance on depth and uncertainty with a novel\nself-distillation loss for which a student is supervised by a pseudo ground\ntruth that is a probability distribution on depth output by a teacher. To\nquantify the performance of our models we design new metrics that, unlike\ntraditional ones, measure the absolute performance of uncertainty predictions.\nOur experiments highlight enhancements achieved by our method on standard depth\nand uncertainty metrics as well as on our tailored metrics.\nhttps://github.com/CEA-LIST/MonoProb",

                "abstract": "Nowadays, deep-learning image coding solutions have shown similar or better\ncompression efficiency than conventional solutions based on hand-crafted\ntransforms and spatial prediction techniques. These deep-learning codecs\nrequire a large training set of images and a training methodology to obtain a\nsuitable model (set of parameters) for efficient compression. The training is\nperformed with an optimization algorithm which provides a way to minimize the\nloss function. Therefore, the loss function plays a key role in the overall\nperformance and includes a differentiable quality metric that attempts to mimic\nhuman perception. The main objective of this paper is to study the perceptual\nimpact of several image quality metrics that can be used in the loss function\nof the training process, through a crowdsourcing subjective image quality\nassessment study. From this study, it is possible to conclude that the choice\nof the quality metric is critical for the perceptual performance of the\ndeep-learning codec and that can vary depending on the image content.",

                "abstract": "In the field of intelligent multimedia analysis, ultra-fine-grained visual\ncategorization (Ultra-FGVC) plays a vital role in distinguishing intricate\nsubcategories within broader categories. However, this task is inherently\nchallenging due to the complex granularity of category subdivisions and the\nlimited availability of data for each category. To address these challenges,\nthis work proposes CSDNet, a pioneering framework that effectively explores\ncontrastive learning and self-distillation to learn discriminative\nrepresentations specifically designed for Ultra-FGVC tasks. CSDNet comprises\nthree main modules: Subcategory-Specific Discrepancy Parsing (SSDP), Dynamic\nDiscrepancy Learning (DDL), and Subcategory-Specific Discrepancy Transfer\n(SSDT), which collectively enhance the generalization of deep models across\ninstance, feature, and logit prediction levels. To increase the diversity of\ntraining samples, the SSDP module introduces augmented samples from different\nviewpoints to spotlight subcategory-specific discrepancies. Simultaneously, the\nproposed DDL module stores historical intermediate features by a dynamic memory\nqueue, which optimizes the feature learning space through iterative contrastive\nlearning. Furthermore, the SSDT module is developed by a novel\nself-distillation paradigm at the logit prediction level of raw and augmented\nsamples, which effectively distills more subcategory-specific discrepancies\nknowledge from the inherent structure of limited training data without\nrequiring additional annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDNet\noutperforms current state-of-the-art Ultra-FGVC methods, emphasizing its\npowerful efficacy and adaptability in addressing Ultra-FGVC tasks.",

By\norganically combining the FL framework with hypergraph neural networks, the\ninformation propagation process of the graph machine learning is able to be\ndivided into two stages distributed on the server and the clients,\nrespectively, so as to effectively protect user privacy while transmitting\nhigh-level information. Furthermore, it elaborately designs a differential\nprivacy perturbation mechanism as well as a plausible pseudo location\ngeneration approach to preserve user privacy in the graph structure. Besides,\nit introduces a cooperative coupling mechanism between the individual-level\nprediction model and an additional region-level model to mitigate the\ndetrimental impacts caused by the injected obfuscation mechanisms.

Yet, conventional optimization techniques usually consider\neither parameters or the shape separately. This work addresses this problem by\nproposing a simple yet powerful approach to combine parameter and shape\noptimization in a framework using Isogeometric Analysis (IGA). The optimization\nemploys sensitivity analysis by determining the gradients of an objective\nfunction with respect to parameters and control points that represent the\ngeometry. The gradients with respect to the control points are calculated in an\nanalytical way using the adjoint method, which enables straightforward shape\noptimization by altering of these control points. Given that a change in a\nsingle geometry parameter corresponds to modifications in multiple control\npoints, the chain rule is employed to obtain the gradient with respect to the\nparameters in an efficient semi-analytical way. The presented method is\nexemplarily applied to nonlinear 2D magnetostatic simulations featuring a\npermanent magnet synchronous motor and compared to designs, which were\noptimized using parameter and shape optimization separately. It is numerically\nshown that the permanent magnet mass can be reduced and the torque ripple can\nbe eliminated almost completely by simultaneously adjusting rotor parameters\nand shape.

The tails of the population distributions\nfollow a power-law distribution, a phenomenon observed in community structures\nof many real-world networks. The dynamics of the area distribution are mainly\ndetermined by the merging process, while the population distribution is also\ndriven by the natural population growth and migration across the municipality\nnetwork. Finally, we propose a model of the Dutch Municipality Network that\ncaptures population increase, population migration between municipalities and\nthe process of municipality merging. Our model allows for predictions of the\npopulation and area distributions over time.",

Unless the\nsignal time evolution is well predicted and its relevant parameters accurately\nknown, the search for CWs is typically based on semi-coherent methods, where\nthe full data set is divided in shorter chunks of given duration, which are\nproperly processed, and then incoherently combined. In this paper we present a\nsemi-coherent method, in which the so-called \\textit{5-vector} statistics is\ncomputed for the various data segments and then summed after the removal of the\nEarth Doppler modulation and signal intrinsic spin-down. The method can work\nwith segment duration of several days, thanks to a double stage procedure in\nwhich an initial rough correction of the Doppler and spin-down is followed by a\nrefined step in which the residual variations are removed. This method can be\nefficiently applied for directed searches, where the source position is known\nto a good level of accuracy, and in the candidate follow-up stage of\nwide-parameter space searches.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "Liver diseases pose a significant global health burden, impacting a\nsubstantial number of individuals and exerting substantial economic and social\nconsequences. Rising liver problems are considered a fatal disease in many\ncountries, such as Egypt, Molda, etc. The objective of this study is to\nconstruct a predictive model for liver illness using Basic Formal Ontology\n(BFO) and detection rules derived from a decision tree algorithm. Based on\nthese rules, events are detected through batch processing using the Apache Jena\nframework. Based on the event detected, queries can be directly processed using\nSPARQL. To make the ontology operational, these Decision Tree (DT) rules are\nconverted into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). Using this SWRL in the\nontology for predicting different types of liver disease with the help of the\nPellet and Drool inference engines in Protege Tools, a total of 615 records are\ntaken from different liver diseases. After inferring the rules, the result can\nbe generated for the patient according to the DT rules, and other\npatient-related details along with different precautionary suggestions can be\nobtained based on these results. Combining query results of batch processing\nand ontology-generated results can give more accurate suggestions for disease\nprevention and detection. This work aims to provide a comprehensive approach\nthat is applicable for liver disease prediction, rich knowledge graph\nrepresentation, and smart querying capabilities. The results show that\ncombining RDF data, SWRL rules, and SPARQL queries for analysing and predicting\nliver disease can help medical professionals to learn more about liver diseases\nand make a Decision Support System (DSS) for health care.",

                "abstract": "For a fixed analytic function g on the unit disc, we consider the analytic\nparaproducts induced by g, which are formally defined by\n$T_gf(z)=\\int_0^zf(\\zeta)g'(\\zeta)d\\zeta$,\n$S_gf(z)=\\int_0^zf'(\\zeta)g(\\zeta)d\\zeta$, and $M_gf(z)=g(z)f(z)$. We are\nconcerned with the study of the boundedness of operators in the algebra\n$\\mathcal{A}_g$ generated by the above operators acting on Hardy, or standard\nweighted Bergman spaces on the disc. The general question is certainly very\nchallenging, since operators in $\\mathcal{A}_g$ are finite linear combinations\nof finite products (words) of $T_g,S_g,M_g$ which may involve a large amount of\ncancellations to be understood. The results in the paper \"Composition of\nanalytic paraproducts, J. Math. Pures Appl. 158 (2022) 293--319\" show that\nboundedness of operators in a fairly large subclass of $\\mathcal{A}_g$ can be\ncharacterized by one of the conditions $g\\in H^\\infty$, or $g^n$ belongs to\n$BMOA$ or the Bloch space, for some integer $n>0$. However, it is also proved\nthat there are many operators, even single words in $\\mathcal{A}_g$ whose\nboundedness cannot be described in terms of these conditions. The present paper\nprovides a considerable progress in this direction. Our main result provides a\ncomplete quantitative characterization of the boundedness of an arbitrary word\nin $\\mathcal{A}_g$ in terms of a ``fractional power'' of the symbol $g$, that\nonly depends on the number of appearances of each of the letters $T_g,S_g,M_g$\nin the given word.",

Capabilities in forecasting the spatio-temporal\nevolution of plasma rapidly and accurately allow us to quickly iterate over\ndesign and control strategies on current Tokamak devices and future reactors.\nModelling plasma evolution using numerical solvers is often expensive,\nconsuming many hours on supercomputers, and hence, we need alternative\ninexpensive surrogate models. We demonstrate accurate predictions of plasma\nevolution both in simulation and experimental domains using deep learning-based\nsurrogate modelling tools, viz., Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). We show that\nFNO has a speedup of six orders of magnitude over traditional solvers in\npredicting the plasma dynamics simulated from magnetohydrodynamic models, while\nmaintaining a high accuracy (MSE $\\approx$ $10^{-5}$). Our modified version of\nthe FNO is capable of solving multi-variable Partial Differential Equations\n(PDE), and can capture the dependence among the different variables in a single\nmodel. FNOs can also predict plasma evolution on real-world experimental data\nobserved by the cameras positioned within the MAST Tokamak, i.e., cameras\nlooking across the central solenoid and the divertor in the Tokamak. We show\nthat FNOs are able to accurately forecast the evolution of plasma and have the\npotential to be deployed for real-time monitoring. We also illustrate their\ncapability in forecasting the plasma shape, the locations of interactions of\nthe plasma with the central solenoid and the divertor for the full duration of\nthe plasma shot within MAST. The FNO offers a viable alternative for surrogate\nmodelling as it is quick to train and infer, and requires fewer data points,\nwhile being able to do zero-shot super-resolution and getting high-fidelity\nsolutions.",

Our method\ndiffers from typical multi-view shape estimation approaches in two key ways.\nFirst, our surface is represented not as a volume but as a neural heightmap\nwhere heights of points on a surface are computed by a deep neural network.\nSecond, instead of predicting an average intensity as PS-NeRF or introducing\nlambertian material assumptions as Guo et al., we use a learnt BRDF and perform\nnear-field per point intensity rendering.\n  Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DiLiGenT-MV\ndataset adapted to binocular stereo setup as well as a new binocular\nphotometric stereo dataset - LUCES-ST.",

The superiority of the PGSP model in\ncapturing the structural characteristics of the South African wind data is\nevident. As opposed to the PGSP, the WGSP model is computationally less\ndemanding, allows for the use of less informative priors, and its parameters\nare more easily interpretable. The implications of this study are far-reaching,\noffering potential benefits ranging from the optimisation of renewable energy\nsystems to the informed decision-making in agriculture and climate adaptation\nstrategies.

                "abstract": "Large-scale language models have made great progress in the field of software\nengineering in recent years. They can be used for many code-related tasks such\nas code clone detection, code-to-code search, and method name prediction.\nHowever, these large-scale language models based on each code token have\nseveral drawbacks: They are usually large in scale, heavily dependent on\nlabels, and require a lot of computing power and time to fine-tune new\ndatasets.Furthermore, code embedding should be performed on the entire code\nsnippet rather than encoding each code token. The main reason for this is that\nencoding each code token would cause model parameter inflation, resulting in a\nlot of parameters storing information that we are not very concerned about. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, called TransformCode, that learns\nabout code embeddings in a contrastive learning manner. The framework uses the\nTransformer encoder as an integral part of the model. We also introduce a novel\ndata augmentation technique called abstract syntax tree transformation: This\ntechnique applies syntactic and semantic transformations to the original code\nsnippets to generate more diverse and robust anchor samples. Our proposed\nframework is both flexible and adaptable: It can be easily extended to other\ndownstream tasks that require code representation such as code clone detection\nand classification. The framework is also very efficient and scalable: It does\nnot require a large model or a large amount of training data, and can support\nany programming language.Finally, our framework is not limited to unsupervised\nlearning, but can also be applied to some supervised learning tasks by\nincorporating task-specific labels or objectives. To explore the effectiveness\nof our framework, we conducted extensive experiments on different software\nengineering tasks using different programming languages and multiple datasets.",

                "abstract": "We tackle the complex challenge of scheduling the charging of electric\nvehicles (EVs) equipped with solar panels and batteries, particularly under\nout-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. Traditional scheduling approaches, such\nas reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC), often fail\nto provide satisfactory results when faced with OOD data, struggling to balance\nrobustness (worst-case performance) and consistency (near-optimal average\nperformance). To address this gap, we introduce a novel learning-augmented\npolicy. This policy employs a dynamic robustness budget, which is adapted in\nreal-time based on the reinforcement learning policy's performance.\nSpecifically, it leverages the temporal difference (TD) error, a measure of the\nlearning policy's prediction accuracy, to assess the trustworthiness of the\nmachine-learned policy. This method allows for a more effective balance between\nconsistency and robustness in EV charging schedules, significantly enhancing\nadaptability and efficiency in real-world, unpredictable environments. Our\nresults demonstrate that this approach markedly improves scheduling\neffectiveness and reliability, particularly in OOD contexts, paving the way for\nmore resilient and adaptive EV charging systems.",

                "abstract": "Fast inverse kinematics (IK) is a central component in robotic motion\nplanning. For complex robots, IK methods are often based on root search and\nnon-linear optimization algorithms. These algorithms can be massively sped up\nusing a neural network to predict a good initial guess, which can then be\nrefined in a few numerical iterations. Besides previous work on learning-based\nIK, we present a learning approach for the fundamentally more complex problem\nof IK with collision avoidance. We do this in diverse and previously unseen\nenvironments. From a detailed analysis of the IK learning problem, we derive a\nnetwork and unsupervised learning architecture that removes the need for a\nsample data generation step. Using the trained network's prediction as an\ninitial guess for a two-stage Jacobian-based solver allows for fast and\naccurate computation of the collision-free IK. For the humanoid robot, Agile\nJustin (19 DoF), the collision-free IK is solved in less than 10 milliseconds\n(on a single CPU core) and with an accuracy of 10^-4 m and 10^-3 rad based on a\nhigh-resolution world model generated from the robot's integrated 3D sensor.\nOur method massively outperforms a random multi-start baseline in a benchmark\nwith the 19 DoF humanoid and challenging 3D environments.

The literature has developed\nmean-subsequence-reduced (MSR) algorithms for the MAS with F adversarial\nattacks and has shown that the consensus is achieved for the normal agents when\nthe communication network is at least (2F+1)-robust. However, such a stringent\nrequirement on the communication network needs to be relaxed to enable more\npractical applications. Our objective is, for the first time, to achieve less\nstringent conditions on the network, while ensuring the resilient consensus for\nthe general linear MAS subject to control input constraints. In this work, we\npropose a distributed resilient consensus framework, consisting of a\npre-designed consensus protocol and distributed model predictive control (DMPC)\noptimization, which can help significantly reduce the requirement on the\nnetwork robustness and effectively handle the general linear constrained MAS\nunder adversarial attacks. By employing a novel distributed adversarial attack\ndetection mechanism based on the history information broadcast by neighbors and\na convex set (i.e., resilience set), we can evaluate the reliability of\ncommunication links. Moreover, we show that the recursive feasibility of the\nassociated DMPC optimization problem can be guaranteed. The proposed consensus\nprotocol features the following properties: 1) by minimizing a group of control\nvariables, the consensus performance is optimized; 2) the resilient consensus\nof the general linear constrained MAS subject to F-locally adversarial attacks\nis achieved when the communication network is (F+1)-robust. Finally, numerical\nsimulation results are presented to verify the theoretical results.",

                "abstract": "A promising approach for improving the performance of vision-language models\nlike CLIP for image classification is to extend the class descriptions (i.e.,\nprompts) with related attributes, e.g., using brown sparrow instead of sparrow.\nHowever, current zero-shot methods select a subset of attributes regardless of\ncommonalities between the target classes, potentially providing no useful\ninformation that would have helped to distinguish between them. For instance,\nthey may use color instead of bill shape to distinguish between sparrows and\nwrens, which are both brown. We propose Follow-up Differential Descriptions\n(FuDD), a zero-shot approach that tailors the class descriptions to each\ndataset and leads to additional attributes that better differentiate the target\nclasses. FuDD first identifies the ambiguous classes for each image, and then\nuses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate new class descriptions that\ndifferentiate between them. The new class descriptions resolve the initial\nambiguity and help predict the correct label. In our experiments, FuDD\nconsistently outperforms generic description ensembles and naive LLM-generated\ndescriptions on 12 datasets. We show that differential descriptions are an\neffective tool to resolve class ambiguities, which otherwise significantly\ndegrade the performance. We also show that high quality natural language class\ndescriptions produced by FuDD result in comparable performance to few-shot\nadaptation methods.",

A particularly significant issue is that generic QML\nmodels suffer from so-called barren plateaus in their training landscapes --\nlarge regions where cost function gradients vanish exponentially in the number\nof qubits employed, rendering large models effectively untrainable. A leading\nstrategy for combating this effect is to build problem-specific models which\ntake into account the symmetries of their data in order to focus on a smaller,\nrelevant subset of Hilbert space. In this work, we introduce a family of\nrotationally equivariant QML models built upon the quantum Fourier transform,\nand leverage recent insights from the Lie-algebraic study of QML models to\nprove that (a subset of) our models do not exhibit barren plateaus. In addition\nto our analytical results we numerically test our rotationally equivariant\nmodels on a dataset of simulated scanning tunnelling microscope images of\nphosphorus impurities in silicon, where rotational symmetry naturally arises,\nand find that they dramatically outperform their generic counterparts in\npractice.",

We aim to\nexplore the possible emergence of dynamically cold disks in cosmological\nsimulations and to understand if different kinematic tracers can help reconcile\nthe tension between theory and observations. We use 3218 galaxies from the\nSERRA suite of zoom-in simulations, with $8<\\log(M_*/M_{\\odot})<10.3$ and\nSFR$<128\\,M_{\\odot}{yr}^{-1}$, within $4<z<9$ range.

Such a difference arises\nmostly for $M_*>10^9\\,M_{\\odot}$ galaxies, for which\n$\\sigma_{H\\alpha}>2\\sigma_{CII}$ for a significant fraction of the sample.\nRegardless of the tracer, our predictions suggest the existence of massive\n($M_*>10^{10}M_{\\odot}$) galaxies with $V_{rot}/\\sigma>10$ at $z>4$,\nmaintaining cold disks for >10 orbital periods (200Myr).

To\nfacilitate intelligent applications across edge devices, researchers have\nproposed partitioning a large model into several sub-models, and deploying each\nof them to a different edge device to collaboratively train a DNN model.\nHowever, the communication overhead caused by the large amount of data\ntransmitted from one device to another during training, as well as the\nsub-optimal partition point due to the inaccurate latency prediction of\ncomputation at each edge device can significantly slow down training. In this\npaper, we propose AccEPT, an acceleration scheme for accelerating the edge\ncollaborative pipeline-parallel training. In particular, we propose a\nlight-weight adaptive latency predictor to accurately estimate the computation\nlatency of each layer at different devices, which also adapts to unseen devices\nthrough continuous learning. Therefore, the proposed latency predictor leads to\nbetter model partitioning which balances the computation loads across\nparticipating devices. Moreover, we propose a bit-level computation-efficient\ndata compression scheme to compress the data to be transmitted between devices\nduring training.

First, we systematically\nstudy non-thermal leptogenesis with the least model dependence. We give a\ngeneral classification of the parameter space and find four characteristic\nlimits by carefully examining the interplay between inflaton decay into RHNs\nand the decay of RHNs into the standard-model particles. Three of the four\nlimits are truly non-thermal, with a final efficiency larger than that of\nthermal leptogenesis. Two analytic estimates for these three limits are\nprovided with working conditions to examine the validity. In particular, we\nfind that the {\\it strongly non-thermal RHNs} scenario occupies a large\nparameter space, including the oscillation-preferred $K$ range, and works well\nfor a relatively-low reheating temperature $T^{}_{\\rm RH} \\geq 10^3~{\\rm GeV}$,\nextending the lower bound on the RHN mass to $2\\times 10^{7}~{\\rm GeV}$. The\nlepton flavor effects are discussed. Second, we demonstrate that such a unified\npicture for inflation, neutrino masses, and baryon number asymmetry can be\nrealized by either a Coleman-Weinberg potential (for the real part of $\\phi$)\nor a natural inflation potential (for the imaginary part of $\\phi$). The\nallowed parameter ranges for successful inflation and non-thermal leptogenesis\nare much more constrained than those without inflationary observations. We find\nthat non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay offers a testable framework\nfor the early Universe. It can be further tested with upcoming cosmological and\nneutrino data. The model-independent investigation of non-thermal leptogenesis\nshould be useful in exploring this direction.",

                "abstract": "Several theoretical methods have been developed to approximate prevalence and\nthreshold of epidemics on networks. Among them, the recurrent dynamic\nmessage-passing (rDMP) theory offers a state-of-the-art performance by\npreventing the echo chamber effect in network edges. However, the rDMP theory\nwas derived in an intuitive ad-hoc way, lacking a solid theoretical foundation\nand resulting in a probabilistic inconsistency flaw. Furthermore, real-world\nnetworks are clustered and full of local loops like triangles, whereas rDMP is\nbased on the assumption of a locally tree-like network structure, which makes\nrDMP potentially inefficient on real applications. In this work, for the\nrecurrent-state epidemics, we first demonstrate that the echo chamber effect\nexits not only in edges but also in local loops, which rDMP-like method can not\navoid. We then correct the deficiency of rDMP in a principled manner, leading\nto the natural introduction of new higher-order dynamic messages, extending\nrDMP to handle local loops. By linearizing the extended message-passing\nequations, a new epidemic threshold estimation is given by the inverse of the\nleading eigenvalue of a matrix named triangular non-backtracking matrix.\nNumerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world networks to\nevaluate our method, the efficacy of which is validated in epidemic prevalence\nand threshold prediction tasks. In addition, our method has the potential to\nspeed up the solution of the immunization, influence maximization, and\nrobustness optimization problems in the networks.",

We are interested in uncertainty quantification for interdependent\nnode-level classification.

To address these limitations, we\ndevelop a challenging benchmark based on cluttered indoor scenes from OCID\ndataset, for which we generate referring expressions and connect them with\n4-DoF grasp poses.

Our results show that vanilla integration of\nCLIP with pretrained models transfers poorly in our challenging benchmark,\nwhile CROG achieves significant improvements both in terms of grounding and\ngrasping.

                "abstract": "Dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and\nsurface normal prediction, can be easily formulated as per-pixel classification\n(discrete outputs) or regression (continuous outputs). This per-pixel\nprediction paradigm has remained popular due to the prevalence of fully\nconvolutional networks. However, on the recent frontier of segmentation task,\nthe community has been witnessing a shift of paradigm from per-pixel prediction\nto cluster-prediction with the emergence of transformer architectures,\nparticularly the mask transformers, which directly predicts a label for a mask\ninstead of a pixel. Despite this shift, methods based on the per-pixel\nprediction paradigm still dominate the benchmarks on the other dense prediction\ntasks that require continuous outputs, such as depth estimation and surface\nnormal prediction. Motivated by the success of DORN and AdaBins in depth\nestimation, achieved by discretizing the continuous output space, we propose to\ngeneralize the cluster-prediction based method to general dense prediction\ntasks. This allows us to unify dense prediction tasks with the mask transformer\nframework. Remarkably, the resulting model PolyMaX demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks of NYUD-v2 dataset.

Shocks alter the plasma they propagate\nthrough and often exhibit complex evolution across multiple scales.\nInterplanetary (IP) traveling shocks have been recorded in-situ for over half a\ncentury and act as a natural laboratory for experimentally verifying various\naspects of large-scale collisionless shocks. A fundamentally interesting\nproblem in both helio and astrophysics is the acceleration of electrons to\nrelativistic energies (more than 300 keV) by traveling shocks. This letter\npresents first observations of field-aligned beams of relativistic electrons\nupstream of an IP shock observed thanks to the instrumental capabilities of\nSolar Orbiter. This study aims to present the characteristics of the electron\nbeams close to the source and contribute towards understanding their\nacceleration mechanism. On 25 July 2022, Solar Orbiter encountered an IP shock\nat 0.98 AU. The shock was associated with an energetic storm particle event\nwhich also featured upstream field-aligned relativistic electron beams observed\n14 minutes prior to the actual shock crossing. The distance of the beam's\norigin was investigated using a velocity dispersion analysis (VDA).\nPeak-intensity energy spectra were anaylzed and compared with those obtained\nfrom a semi-analytical fast-Fermi acceleration model. By leveraging Solar\nOrbiter's high-time resolution Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), we have\nsuccessfully showcased an IP shock's ability to accelerate relativistic\nelectron beams.

Our results indicate that the\nhydrodynamic interactions with the confining walls of the channel significantly\naffect the swimming speed and trajectory of the model microswimmer.\nSpecifically, pullers always display sliding motion inside the channel: weak\npullers slide through the channel centerline, while strong pullers slide\nthrough a path close to any of the walls.

Unlike pullers and pushers, the trajectories of\nneutral swimmers are not easy to generalize, and are sensitive to the initial\nconditions. Despite this diversity in the trajectories, the far-field\nexpressions capture the essential features of channel-confined swimmers.\nFinally, we propose a method based on the principle of superposition to\nunderstand the origin of the three-dimensional trajectories of channel confined\nswimmers.

                "abstract": "We propose a general method to break down a main complex task into a set of\nintermediary easier sub-tasks, which are formulated in natural language as\nbinary questions related to the final target task. Our method allows for\nrepresenting each example by a vector consisting of the answers to these\nquestions. We call this representation Natural Language Learned Features\n(NLLF). NLLF is generated by a small transformer language model (e.g., BERT)\nthat has been trained in a Natural Language Inference (NLI) fashion, using weak\nlabels automatically obtained from a Large Language Model (LLM). We show that\nthe LLM normally struggles for the main task using in-context learning, but can\nhandle these easiest subtasks and produce useful weak labels to train a BERT.\nThe NLI-like training of the BERT allows for tackling zero-shot inference with\nany binary question, and not necessarily the ones seen during the training. We\nshow that this NLLF vector not only helps to reach better performances by\nenhancing any classifier, but that it can be used as input of an\neasy-to-interpret machine learning model like a decision tree. This decision\ntree is interpretable but also reaches high performances, surpassing those of a\npre-trained transformer in some cases.We have successfully applied this method\nto two completely different tasks: detecting incoherence in students' answers\nto open-ended mathematics exam questions, and screening abstracts for a\nsystematic literature review of scientific papers on climate change and\nagroecology.",

First, a Feasibility Test\n(FT) algorithm that quickly desaturates overloaded cut-sets to prevent\ncascading line outages is integrated with the OPF problem. Then, the resulting\nformulation is combined with a data-driven transient stability analyzer that\npredicts the correction factors for eliminating dynamic insecurities.

A critical\noperating parameter in this facility is beam loss, which is the fraction of\nparticles deviating from the accelerated proton beam into a cascade of\nsecondary particles. Accelerators employ a large number of sensors to monitor\nbeam loss. The data from these sensors is monitored by human operators who\npredict the relative contribution of different sub-systems to the beam loss.\nUsing this information, they engage control interventions. In this paper, we\npresent a controller to track this phenomenon in real-time using edge-Machine\nLearning (ML) and support control with low latency and high accuracy. We\nimplemented this system on an Intel Arria 10 SoC. Optimizations at the\nalgorithm, high-level synthesis, and interface levels to improve latency and\nresource usage are presented. Our design implements a neural network, which can\npredict the main source of beam loss (between two possible causes) at speeds up\nto 575 frames per second (fps) (average latency of 1.74 ms). The practical\ndeployed system is required to operate at 320 fps, with a 3ms latency\nrequirement, which has been met by our design successfully.",

                "abstract": "We investigate the signature of magnetic surface anisotropy in nanoparticles\nin their spin-flip neutron scattering cross section. Taking into account the\nisotropic exchange interaction, an external magnetic field, a uniaxial or cubic\nmagnetic anisotropy for the particle's core, and several models for the surface\nanisotropy (N\\'eel, conventional, random), we compute the spin-flip small-angle\nneutron scattering (SANS) cross section from the equilibrium spin structures\nobtained using the Landau-Lifshitz equation. The sign of the surface anisotropy\nconstant, which is related to the appearance of tangential- or radial-like spin\ntextures, can be distinguished from the momentum-transfer dependence of the\nspin-flip signal. The data cannot be described by the well-known and often-used\nanalytical expressions for uniformly magnetized spherical or core-shell\nparticles, in particular at remanence or at the coercive field. Based on a\nsecond-order polynomial expansion for the magnetization vector field, we\ndevelop a novel minimal model for the azimuthally-averaged magnetic SANS cross\nsection. The theoretical expression considers a general magnetization\ninhomogeneity and is not restricted to the presence of surface anisotropy. It\nis shown that the model describes very well our simulation data as well as more\ncomplex spin patterns such as vortex-like structures. Only seven expansion\ncoefficients and some basis functions are sufficient to describe the scattering\nbehavior of a very large number of atomic spins.",

                "abstract": "Massive stars can explode in powerful supernovae (SNe) forming neutron stars\nbut they may also collapse directly into black holes (BHs). Understanding and\npredicting their final fate is increasingly important, e.g, in the context of\ngravitational-wave astronomy. The interior mixing of stars in general and\nconvective boundary mixing remain some of the largest uncertainties in their\nevolution. Here, we investigate the influence of convective boundary mixing on\nthe pre-SN structure and explosion properties of massive stars. Using the 1D\nstellar evolution code Mesa, we model single, non-rotating stars of solar\nmetallicity with initial masses of $5-70\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and convective core\nstep-overshooting of $0.05-0.50H_\\mathrm{P}$. Stars are evolved until the onset\nof iron core collapse, and the pre-SN models are exploded using a parametric,\nsemi-analytic SN code. We use the compactness parameter to describe the\ninterior structure of stars at core collapse. Larger convective core\novershooting shifts the location of the compactness peak by\n$1-2\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ to higher $M_\\mathrm{CO}$. As the luminosity of the\npre-SN progenitor is determined by $M_\\mathrm{CO}$, we predict BH formation for\nprogenitors with luminosities $5.35<\\log(L/\\mathrm{L_\\odot})<5.50$ and\n$\\log(L/\\mathrm{L_\\odot})>5.80$. The luminosity range of BH formation agrees\nwell with the observed luminosity of the red supergiant star N6946BH1 that\ndisappeared without a bright SN and likely collapsed into a BH. While some of\nour models in the luminosity range $\\log(L/\\mathrm{L_\\odot})=5.1-5.5$ indeed\ncollapse to form BHs, this does not fully explain the lack of observed SN~IIP\nprogenitors at these luminosities, ie the missing red-supergiant problem.\nConvective core overshooting affects the BH masses, the pre-SN location of\nstars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the plateau luminosity and duration\nof SN~IIP lightcurves.[Abridged]",

Contact force data\ndemonstrate an exchange in dominant stress contribution from large-large to\nsmall-small particle contacts as the mixing ratio of the species evolves.\nCombining a prior model for shear thickening with one for composition-dependent\njamming, we obtain a full description of the rheology of bidisperse\nnon-Brownian suspensions capable of predicting effects such as the viscosity\nreduction observed upon adding small particle fines to a suspension of large\nparticles.",

                "abstract": "Silicon carbide (SiC) emerges as a promising ceramic material for\nhigh-temperature structural applications, especially within the aerospace\nsector. The utilization of SiC-based ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) instead\nof superalloys in components like engine shrouds, combustors, and nozzles\noffers notable advantages, including a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency, over\n10% enhanced thrust, and the capability to withstand up to 500$^{\\circ}$C\nhigher operating temperatures. Employing a CALPHAD-reinforced multi-phase-field\nmodel, our study delves into the evolution of the SiC layer under isothermal\nsolidification conditions. By modeling the growth of SiC between liquid Si and\nsolid C at 1450$^{\\circ}$C, we compared results with experimental\nmicrostructures and quantitatively examined the evolution of SiC thickness over\ntime. Efficient sampling across the entire model space mitigated uncertainty in\nhigh-temperature kinetic parameters, allowing us to predict a range of growth\nrates and morphologies for the SiC layer. The model accounts for parameter\nuncertainty stemming from limited experimental knowledge and successfully\npredicts relevant morphologies for the system. Experimental results validated\nthe kinetic parameters of the simulations, offering valuable insights and\npotential constraints on the reaction kinetics. We further explored the\nsignificance of multi-phase-field model parameters on two key outputs, and\nfound that the diffusion coefficient of liquid Si emerges as the most crucial\nparameter significantly impacting the SiC average layer thickness and grain\ncount over time. This study provides valuable insights into the microstructure\nevolution of the Si-C binary system, offering pertinent information for the\nengineering of CMCs in industrial applications.",

Motivated by analyses of cool material in hydrodynamical simulations\nof turbulent, multiphase media, we model individual cool gas structures as\nassemblies of cloudlets with a power-law distribution of cloudlet mass $\\propto\nm_{\\rm cl}^{-\\alpha}$ and relative velocities drawn from a turbulent velocity\nfield. The user may specify $\\alpha$, the lower limit of the cloudlet mass\ndistribution ($m_{\\rm cl,min}$), and several other parameters that set the\ntotal mass, size, and velocity distribution of the complex. We then calculate\nthe MgII 2796 absorption profiles induced by the cloudlets along pencil-beam\nlines of sight. We demonstrate that at fixed metallicity, the covering fraction\nof sightlines with equivalent widths $W_{2796} < 0.3$ Ang increases\nsignificantly with decreasing $m_{\\rm cl,min}$, cool cloudlet number density\n($n_{\\rm cl}$), and cloudlet complex size.

We thereby extend the related\nseminal works in spinor quantum electrodynamics, while contrasting the\nsimilarities and differences in the two cases. We investigate in detail the\nefficacy of resurgent extrapolations starting from just a finite number of\nterms in the weak-field expansions of the 1-loop and 2-loop scalar quantum\nelectrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. While we re-derive some of the\nwell-known 1-loop and 2-loop contributions in representations suitable for\nPad\\'{e}-Borel analyses, other contributions have been derived for the first\ntime. For instance, we find a closed analytic form for the one-particle\nreducible contribution at 2-loop, which until recently was thought to be\nunimportant. It is pointed out that there could be an interesting interplay\nbetween the one-particle irreducible and one-particle reducible terms in the\nstrong-field limit. For the 1-loop contribution, the resurgent analysis may be\nmapped effectively into two copies of the spinor quantum electrodynamics\nweak-field expansions, differing only in their prefactors and masses. This\nsimple mapping is no longer true at 2-loops. The singularity structures in the\nPad\\'{e}-Borel transforms at 1-loop and 2-loop are examined in some detail.\nAnalytic continuation to the electric field case and the generation of an\nimaginary part is also studied. We compare the Pad\\'{e}-Borel reconstructions\nto closed analytic forms or to numerically computed values in the full theory.\nIt is seen that Pad\\'{e}-Borel resummations based on even a small number of\nterms from the weak-field expansions can accurately approximate the\nstrong-field behaviour.",

As a concrete example,\nwe propose a grand unified embedding of the tri-hypercharge model $U(1)_Y^3$\nbased on an $SU(5)^{3}$ framework with cyclic symmetry. We discuss a minimal\ntri-hypercharge example which can account for all the quark and lepton\n(including neutrino) masses and mixing parameters.

                "abstract": "Jellyfish galaxies are promising laboratories for studying radiative cooling\nand magnetic fields in multiphase gas flows. Their long, dense tails are\nobserved to be magnetised, and they extend up to 100 kpc into the intracluster\nmedium (ICM), suggesting that their gas is thermally unstable so that the cold\ngas mass grows with time rather than being fully dissolved in the hot wind as a\nresult of hydrodynamical interface instabilities. In this paper we use the\nAREPO code to perform magnetohydrodynamical windtunnel simulations of a\njellyfish galaxy experiencing ram-pressure stripping by interacting with an ICM\nwind. The ICM density, temperature and velocity that the galaxy encounters are\ntime-dependent and comparable to what a real jellyfish galaxy experiences while\norbiting the ICM. In simulations with a turbulent magnetised wind we reproduce\nobservations, which show that the magnetic field is aligned with the jellyfish\ntails. During the galaxy infall into the cluster with a near edge-on geometry,\nthe gas flow in the tail is fountain-like, implying preferential stripping of\ngas where the rotational velocity vectors add up with the ram pressure while\nfall-back occurs in the opposite case. Hence, the tail velocity shows a memory\nof the rotation pattern of the disc. At the time of the nearest cluster\npassage, ram-pressure stripping is so strong that the fountain flow is\ndestroyed and instead the tail is dominated by removal of gas. We show that gas\nin the tail is very fragmentative, which is a prediction of shattering due to\nradiative cooling.",

We consider that\nsudden magnetic energy dissipation creates a thin high-pressure shell above a\nportion of the NS surface, which drives a relativistic shockwave into the\ncrust, heating a fraction of these layers to sufficiently high energies to\nbecome unbound along directions unconfined by the magnetic field. We explore\nthis process by means of spherically-symmetric relativistic hydrodynamical\nsimulations. For an initial shell pressure $P_{\\rm GF}$ we find that the total\nunbound ejecta mass roughly obeys the relation $M_{\\rm ej}\\sim4-9\\times\n10^{24}$ g $(P_{\\rm GF}/10^{30}$ ergs cm$^{-3})^{1.43}$. For $P_{\\rm\nGF}\\sim10^{30}-10^{31}$ ergs cm$^{-3}$ corresponding to the dissipation of a\nmagnetic field of strength $\\sim10^{15.5}-10^{16}$ G, we find $M_{\\rm\nej}\\sim10^{25}-10^{26}$ g with asymptotic velocities $v_{\\rm ej}/c\\sim 0.3-0.6$\ncompatible with the ejecta properties inferred from the radio afterglow of the\nGF from SGR 1806-20.

We predict that GFs are accompanied by short\nminutes long, luminous $\\sim 10^{39}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ optical transients powered\nby $r$-process decay (\"nova brevis\"), akin to scaled-down kilonovae.

For the Milky Way's classical dwarfs, we provide inferred\nvalues (with associated uncertainties) for the maximum circular velocity\n$v_{max}$ and the radius $r_{max}$ at which it occurs, varying over two choices\nof feedback model and two prescriptions for the SMHM relation that populate\ndark matter halos with physically distinct galaxies. While simple empirical\nscaling relations can recover the median inferred value for $v_{max}$ and\n$r_{max}$, this approach provides realistic correlated uncertainties and aids\ninterpretability through variation of the model. For these different models, we\nalso demonstrate how the internal properties of a satellite's dark matter\nprofile correlate with its orbit, and we show that it is difficult to reproduce\nobservations of the Fornax dwarf without strong baryonic feedback. The\ntechnique developed in this work is flexible in its application of\nobservational data and can leverage arbitrary information about the satellite\ngalaxies to make inferences about their dark matter halos and population\nstatistics.",

                "abstract": "We study how structural properties of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies\nare linked to their orbits in the Milky Way halo. From the inner to the outer\nhalo, orbital energy increases and stellar-systems gradually move out of\ninternal equilibrium: in the inner halo, high-surface brightness globular\nclusters are at pseudo-equilibrium, while further away, low-surface brightness\nclusters and dwarfs appear more tidally disturbed. Dwarf galaxies are the\nlatest to arrive into the halo as indicated by their large orbital energies and\npericenters, and have no time for more than one orbit. Their (gas-rich)\nprogenitors likely lost their gas during their recent arrival in the Galactic\nhalo. If dwarfs are at equilibrium with their dark matter (DM) content, the DM\ndensity should anti-correlate with pericenter. However, the transformation of\nDM dominated dwarfs from gas-rich rotation-supported into gas-poor\ndispersion-supported systems is unlikely accomplished during a single orbit. We\nsuggest instead that the above anti-correlation is brought by the combination\nof ram-pressure stripping and of Galactic tidal shocks. Recent gas removal\nleads to an expansion of their stellar content caused by the associated gravity\nloss, making them sufficiently fragile to be transformed near pericenter\npassage. Out of equilibrium dwarfs would explain the observed anti-correlation\nof kinematics-based DM density with pericenter without invoking DM density\nitself, questioning its previous estimates. Ram-pressure stripping and tidal\nshocks may contribute to the dwarf velocity dispersion excess. It predicts the\npresence of numerous stars in their outskirts and a few young stars in their\ncores.",

Quantum machine learning\narchitectures, despite their theoretically predicted advantages in terms of\nspeed and the representational capacity, have so far not been considered for\nthis problem nor for tasks involving 3D data in general. This paper thus\nintroduces the first quantum auto-encoder for 3D point clouds. Our 3D-QAE\napproach is fully quantum, i.e. all its data processing components are designed\nfor quantum hardware. It is trained on collections of 3D point clouds to\nproduce their compressed representations. Along with finding a suitable\narchitecture, the core challenges in designing such a fully quantum model\ninclude 3D data normalisation and parameter optimisation, and we propose\nsolutions for both these tasks. Experiments on simulated gate-based quantum\nhardware demonstrate that our method outperforms simple classical baselines,\npaving the way for a new research direction in 3D computer vision.

We\nsimulate novel 1D merger models of binaries consisting of supergiants with\nhydrogen-free cores (primaries) and main-sequence companions (secondaries) and\nconsider the effects of interaction of the secondary with the core of the\nprimary. We follow the evolution of the new-born $16-40$ M$_{\\odot}$ stars\nuntil core-carbon depletion, close to their final pre-explosion structure.\nUnlike stars which are born alone, stars born from such stellar mergers are\nblue throughout their core helium-burning phase and reproduce the surface\ngravities and Hertzsprung-Russel diagram positions of most of our sample. This\nindicates that the observed blue supergiants are structurally similar to\nmerger-born stars.

We claim a novel ansatz for\nmodeling the non-symmetric magnetization that can be implied for both analytics\nand numerical simulations. Our theory accounts for changes in the size skyrmion\nparameters and also includes deformations from the centrally symmetric shape.\nThe ansatz streamlines the analytic calculation of the skyrmion free energy,\nenhancing the efficiency of the minimizing process. Performing the minimization\nin two stages, one can find all the minima, global and local, of the free\nenergy, discovering the stable and metastable states. We apply the developed\nmethodology to investigate the (meta)stable configurations of skyrmions\ninfluenced by the stray field of a Pearl vortex. Our study reveals the\ndependence of skyrmion spatial parameters on the vortex field effective\nstrength and presents a phase diagram identifying regions where metastable\nconfigurations are predicted. Corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, our\nfindings offer a detailed perspective on the interaction between magnetic\nskyrmions and superconducting vortices.",

Thus, different functionals in the\nfield of DFT (e.g., PBE, PBE0, PBESOL, PBESOL0, BLYP, WC1LYP and B3LYP) using a\ntriple-zeta valence plus polarization basis set were assessed to accurate\nprediction their fundamental properties. Among all DFT functionals tested in\nthis study, in particular, the PBE was the one that showed the best agreement\nwith the experimental data available in the literature. Our results also reveal\nthat the [PbO$_5$] clusters are formed with three different Pb--O bond lengths,\nwith values of about 2.32, 2.59 and 2.84\\AA, respectively, and the [SO$_4$]\nclusters have the same S--O bond length of 1.57\\AA. We then performed a\ncomplete topological analysis of this system to better understand these\nstructural differences. Additionally, the PSO structure has an indirect band\ngap energy of 2.9 eV and an effective mass ratio of about 0.415 (using PBE\ncalculations) which may, in principle, indicate a low recombination of\nelectro-hole pairs in the lanarkite structure.

                "abstract": "Recent experiments on rhombohedral pentalayer graphene flakes with a\nsubstrate induced moir\\'e potential have identified both Chern insulators and\nfractional Quantum Hall states in the absence of an applied magnetic field.\nSurprisingly, these states are observed in strong displacement fields where the\neffects of the moir\\'e lattice are weak, and seem to be readily accessed\nwithout fine-tuning. To address these experimental puzzles we study an\ninteracting model of electrons in this geometry, first within the\nself-consistent Hartree-Fock (SCHF) approximation. We find an isolated Chern\nband with Chern number $|C|=1$, that moreover is relatively flat and shows good\nquantum geometry. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization\ngroup methods at fractional filling establish the presence of fractional\nquantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states. The $|C|=1$ band in SCHF is remarkably\nrobust to varying microscopic parameters, and is also found in the $N_L=4$ and\n$N_L=6$ layer systems. Remarkably, it appears stable even to switching off the\nmoir\\'e potential, pointing to spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry. We\nterm this topological crystalline state the ``anomalous Hall crystal\" (AHC),\nand argue that it constitutes a general mechanism for creating stable Chern\nbands in rhombohedral graphene. Our work elucidates the physics behind the\nrecent rhombohedral pentalayer graphene observations, predicts the appearance\nof the same phase in other systems, and opens the door to studying the\ninterplay between electronic topology and spontaneous translation symmetry\nbreaking.",

                "abstract": "The horizontal grid spacing of numerical weather prediction models keeps\ndecreasing towards the hectometric range. Although topography, land-use, and\nother static parameters are well-resolved, models have to be evaluated, because\nit cannot be assumed that higher horizontal resolution automatically yields\nbetter model performance. In this study, we perform limited-area simulations\nwith the ICON model across horizontal grid spacings (1 km, 500 m, 250 m, 125 m)\nin the Inn Valley, Austria. Simulations are ran with two turbulence schemes - a\n1D parameterization and a 3D Smagorinsky-type scheme. We evaluate the model\nacross scales with observations of the valley boundary layer from the CROSSINN\nmeasurement campaign. This allows us to investigate whether increasing the\nhorizontal resolution automatically improves the representation of the\nthermally-induced circulation, surface exchange, and other mountain boundary\nlayer processes. The two turbulence schemes produce quite similar results\nacross grid spacings, while differences are mostly found in the representation\nof the thermal structure of the valley atmosphere. The model keeps facing\nchallenges for the correct simulation of scale interactions, and the 3D\nSmagorinsky scheme simulates a delayed evening transition of the up-valley\nflow. It is argued that the major difference between schemes actually emerges\nfrom the different surface transfer schemes, and the choice of boundary layer\nparameterization is secondary.",

We have named the\ngeneral implementation as PNOF-ERPA, and we refer to specific cases as\nPNOF-ERPA0, PNOF-ERPA1 and PNOF-ERPA2, according to how the excitation operator\nis built. The approaches have been tested in the first excited states of H2,\nHeH+, LiH and Li2, showing good results compared with the full configuration\ninteraction (FCI) method. As expected, an increase in accuracy is observed when\ngoing from ERPA0 to ERPA1 and ERPA2. We have also studied the effect of\nelectron correlation included by PNOF5, PNOF7 and the recently proposed global\nNOF (GNOF) on the predicted excited states. PNOF5 appears to be good and may\neven provide better results in very small systems, but including more electron\ncorrelation becomes important as the system size increases, where PNOF7 and\nGNOF provide better results. This effect can already be seen in the excitation\nenergies of the neon atom, where GNOF provides more accurate values than PNOF5\nand PNOF7. Overall, the extension of PNOF to excited states has been\nsuccessful, making the PNOF-ERPA method promising for further applications.",

However, there\nare so many degradation mechanisms in LIBs that any truly comprehensive model\nwill have at least four fitting parameters, casting doubts on models validated\nagainst only one or two metrics.

We show that three models with\ndifferent levels of complexity can all fit well the remaining capacity and\nresistance of cells cycled at 70%~85% state of charge at three different\ntemperatures, but only the two models with mechanisms to induce loss of active\nmaterial (LAM) can fit LAM of both electrodes.

We began by empirically evaluating 6 modern machine learning-based\noutlier detection algorithms on the task of identifying irregular data in 838\ndatasets from 7 real-world MCRCTs with a total of 77,001 patients from over 44\ncountries. Our results reinforce key findings from prior work in the outlier\ndetection literature on data from other domains. Existing algorithms often\nsucceed at identifying irregularities without any supervision, with at least\none algorithm exhibiting positive performance 70.6% of the time. However,\nperformance across datasets varies substantially with no single algorithm\nperforming consistently well, motivating new techniques for unsupervised model\nselection or other means of aggregating potentially discordant predictions from\nmultiple candidate models. We propose the Meta-learned Probabilistic Ensemble\n(MePE), a simple algorithm for aggregating the predictions of multiple\nunsupervised models, and show that it performs favourably compared to recent\nmeta-learning approaches for outlier detection model selection. While\nmeta-learning shows promise, small ensembles outperform all forms of\nmeta-learning on average, a negative result that may guide the application of\ncurrent outlier detection approaches in healthcare and other real-world\ndomains.",

While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous\nphases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale\nnumerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed\nin any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets. The swap phase is\ndestroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of\ndiscrete spiral defects, but stabilized in three dimensions where\nnon-reciprocity changes the universality class from Ising to XY giving rise to\nrobust spatially-distributed clocks.",

Lithium-ion\nelectrolytes are essential to battery operation and normally contain at least\ntwo solvents to satisfy performance requirements. The widely used\nDoyle-Fuller-Newman battery model assumes that the electrolyte comprises a salt\ndissolved in a single effective solvent, however. This single-solvent\napproximation has been disproved experimentally and may hinder accurate battery\nmodelling. Here, we present a two-solvent model that resolves the transport of\nethylene carbonate (EC) and lithium salt in a background linear carbonate. EC\nconcentration polarization opposes that of Li+ during cycling, affecting local\nelectrolyte properties and cell-level overpotentials. Concentration gradients\nof Li+ can be affected by cross-diffusion, whereby EC gradients enhance or\nimpede salt flux. A rationally parametrized model that includes EC transport\npredicts 6% more power loss at 4.5C discharge and ~0.32% more capacity loss\nafter a thousand 1C cycles than its single-solvent equivalent. This work\nprovides a tool to model more transport behaviour in the electrolyte that may\naffect degradation and enables the transfer of microscopic knowledge about\nsolvation structure-dependent performance to the macroscale.",

Here, a multi-layer analytic expression is postulated for two lengths\n(stress and kinetic energy lengths), yielding an analytic solution for the\nk-{\\omega} model equations in pipe flow. Approximate local balance equations\nare analyzed to determine key parameters in the solution, which are shown to be\nrather close to the empirically-measured values from numerical solution of the\nWilcox k-{\\omega} model, hence the analytic construction is fully validated.\nFurthermore, the predictions of three critical locations in the model's three\ntransition functions are validated, which enables an in-depth understanding of\nthe parameter setting of the model. These results provide clear evidence that\nthe k-{\\omega} model sets in it a multi-layer structure, which is similar to\nbut different, in some insignificant details, from the Navier-Stokes\nturbulence. This finding explains why the k-{\\omega} model is so popular,\nespecially in computing the near-wall flow.

                "abstract": "The risk of collision between resident space objects has significantly\nincreased in recent years. As a result, spacecraft collision avoidance\nprocedures have become an essential part of satellite operations. To ensure\nsafe and effective space activities, satellite owners and operators rely on\nconstantly updated estimates of encounters. These estimates include the\nuncertainty associated with the position of each object at the expected TCA.\nThese estimates are crucial in planning risk mitigation measures, such as\ncollision avoidance manoeuvres. As the TCA approaches, the accuracy of these\nestimates improves, as both objects' orbit determination and propagation\nprocedures are made for increasingly shorter time intervals. However, this\nimprovement comes at the cost of taking place close to the critical decision\nmoment. This means that safe avoidance manoeuvres might not be possible or\ncould incur significant costs. Therefore, knowing the evolution of this\nvariable in advance can be crucial for operators. This work proposes a machine\nlearning model based on diffusion models to forecast the position uncertainty\nof objects involved in a close encounter, particularly for the secondary object\n(usually debris), which tends to be more unpredictable. We compare the\nperformance of our model with other state-of-the-art solutions and a na\\\"ive\nbaseline approach, showing that the proposed solution has the potential to\nsignificantly improve the safety and effectiveness of spacecraft operations.",

                "abstract": "Ferroelectric materials are of practical interest for non-volatile data\nstorage due to their reorientable, crystallographically defined polarization\nstates, yet efforts to integrate perovskite-based materials into ultrathin\nnon-volatile memories have been frustrated by film-thickness scaling\nconstraints, which limit ferroelectric switching under low voltage. Wurtzite\nmaterials, including magnesium-substituted zinc oxide [(Zn,Mg)O], have recently\nbeen shown to exhibit scalable ferroelectricity as thin films. While accurate\nfirst-principles calculations predict that a biaxial tension of a few percent\nmay promote ferroelectricity in wurtzites, biaxial strains are found not to\nexceed 0.3% in (Zn,Mg)O thin films at the solubility limit of Mg in ZnO. In\nthis work, this major discrepancy is resolved and the observations of\nferroelectricity in (Zn,Mg)O are explained by examining the influence of Mg\nsubstitution on interatomic bonding and ferroelectric switching. Large strain\nfluctuations emerge locally around individual Zn and Mg cations in (Zn,Mg)O,\ncausing a reduction of up to 45% in the local coercive fields via a sequential\nmechanism of polarization reversal.

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "A dataset of 3D-GRE and 3D-TSE brain 3T post contrast T1-weighted images as\npart of a quality improvement project were collected and shown to five\nneuro-radiologists who evaluated each sequence for both image quality and\nimaging artifacts. The same scans were processed using the MRQy tool for\nobjective, quantitative image quality metrics. Using the combined radiologist\nand quantitative metrics dataset, a decision tree classifier with a bagging\nensemble approach was trained to predict radiologist assessment using the\nquantitative metrics. A machine learning model was developed for the following\nthree tasks: (1) determine the best model / performance for each MRI sequence\nand evaluation metric, (2) determine the best model / performance across all\nMRI sequences for each evaluation metric, and (3) determine the best general\nmodel / performance across all MRI sequences and evaluations. Model performance\nfor imaging artifact was slightly higher than image quality, for example, the\nfinal generalized model AUROC for image quality was 0.77 (0.41 - 0.84, 95% CI)\nwhile imaging artifact was 0.78 (0.60 - 0.93, 95% CI). Further, it was noted\nthat the generalized model performed slightly better than the individual models\n(AUROC 0.69 for 3D-GRE image quality, for example), indicating the value in\ncomprehensive training data for these applications. These models could be\ndeployed in the clinic as automatic checks for real-time image acquisition to\nprevent patient re-scanning requiring another appointment after retrospective\nradiologist analysis or improve reader confidence in the study. Further work\nneeds to be done to validate the model described here on an external dataset.\nThe results presented here suggest that MRQy could be used as a foundation for\nquantitative metrics as a surrogate for radiologist assessment.",

Specifically, generative models can\nswiftly propose promising materials for targeted applications. However, the\npredicted properties of materials through the generative models often do not\nmatch with calculated properties through ab initio calculations. This\ndiscrepancy can arise because the generated coordinates are not fully relaxed,\nwhereas the many properties are derived from relaxed structures. Neural\nnetwork-based potentials (NNPs) can expedite the process by providing relaxed\nstructures from the initially generated ones. Nevertheless, acquiring data to\ntrain NNPs for this purpose can be extremely challenging as it needs to\nencompass previously unknown structures. This study utilized extended ensemble\nmolecular dynamics (MD) to secure a broad range of liquid- and solid-phase\nconfigurations in one of the metallic systems, nickel. Then, we could\nsignificantly reduce them through active learning without losing much accuracy.\nWe found that the NNP trained from the distilled data could predict different\nenergy-minimized closed-pack crystal structures even though those structures\nwere not explicitly part of the initial data. Furthermore, the data can be\ntranslated to other metallic systems (aluminum and niobium), without repeating\nthe sampling and distillation processes.

These\nmodels are used to predict the available consumption flexibility while\nincorporating a description of uncertainty and being risk-aware with a\npre-defined risk level. A Mixed-integer Linear Program (MILP) is formulated to\nschedule the activation of the buildings in order to best respond to an\nexternal consumption request. An aggregated consumption request is dispatched\nto the active individual buildings by an algorithm, based on the previously\ndetermined schedule. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by\ncoordinating up to 500 simulated buildings using the Energym Python library and\nobserving about 1.5 times peak power reduction in comparison with a baseline\napproach while maintaining comfort more robustly.

Arteries appear at many scales and\nlevels of tortuosity, and determining their exact orientation is challenging.\nRecent works have used 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this\npurpose, but CNNs are sensitive to varying vessel sizes and orientations. We\npresent SIRE: a scale-invariant, rotation-equivariant estimator for local\nvessel orientation. SIRE is modular and can generalise due to symmetry\npreservation.\n  SIRE consists of a gauge equivariant mesh CNN (GEM-CNN) operating on multiple\nnested spherical meshes with different sizes in parallel. The features on each\nmesh are a projection of image intensities within the corresponding sphere.\nThese features are intrinsic to the sphere and, in combination with the\nGEM-CNN, lead to SO(3)-equivariance. Approximate scale invariance is achieved\nby weight sharing and use of a symmetric maximum function to combine\nmulti-scale predictions. Hence, SIRE can be trained with arbitrarily oriented\nvessels with varying radii to generalise to vessels with a wide range of\ncalibres and tortuosity.\n  We demonstrate the efficacy of SIRE using three datasets containing vessels\nof varying scales: the vascular model repository (VMR), the ASOCA coronary\nartery set, and a set of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). We embed SIRE in a\ncenterline tracker which accurately tracks AAAs, regardless of the data SIRE is\ntrained with. Moreover, SIRE can be used to track coronary arteries, even when\ntrained only with AAAs.\n  In conclusion, by incorporating SO(3) and scale symmetries, SIRE can\ndetermine the orientations of vessels outside of the training domain, forming a\nrobust and data-efficient solution to geometric analysis of blood vessels in 3D\nmedical images.",

P1 centers serve as a polarization\nsource for DNP quantum sensing and play a significant role in the relaxation of\nNV centers. Additionally, the distribution of NV centers correlates with the\ndistribution of P1 centers, as NV centers are formed through the conversion of\nP1 centers. We utilized dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and pulsed electron\nparamagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques that revealed strong clustering of a\nsignificant population of P1 centers that exhibit exchange coupling and produce\nasymmetric lineshapes. The $^{13}$C DNP frequency profile at high magnetic\nfield revealed a pattern that requires an asymmetric EPR lineshape of the P1\nclusters with electron-electron (e-e) coupling strengths exceeding the $^{13}$C\nnuclear Larmor frequency. EPR and DNP characterization at high magnetic fields\nwas necessary to resolve energy contributions from different e-e couplings. We\nemployed a two-frequency pump-probe pulsed Electron Double Resonance (ELDOR)\ntechnique to show crosstalk between the isolated and clustered P1 centers. This\nfinding implies that the clustered P1 centers affect all P1 populations. Direct\nobservation of clustered P1 centers and their asymmetric lineshape is a novel\nand crucial insight into understanding magnetic noise sources for quantum\ninformation applications of diamonds and for designing diamond-based polarizing\nagents with optimized DNP efficiency for $^{13}$C and other nuclear spins of\nanalytes.

In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution\nof Population III star clusters, including models with a primordial binary\nfraction of $f_{\\rm b}=0$ and 1, using the $N$-body simulation code\n\\textsc{petar}. We comprehensively examine the phenomenon of hierarchical\ntriple black holes in the clusters, specifically focusing on the merging of\ntheir inner binary black holes (BBHs), with post-Newtonian correction, by using\nthe \\textsc{tsunami} code. Our findings suggest a high likelihood of the inner\nBBHs containing IMBHs with masses on the order of $\\mathcal{O}(100)M_{\\odot}$,\nand as a result, their merger rate could be up to $0.1{\\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\\rm\nyr}^{-3}$. In the model with $f_{\\rm b}=0$, the evolution of these merging\ninner BBHs is predominantly driven by their gravitational wave radiation at an\nearly time, but their evolutionary dynamics are dominated by the interaction\nbetween them and tertiary BHs in the case with $f_{\\rm b}=1$. The orbital\neccentricities of some merging inner BBHs oscillate over time periodically,\nknown as the Kozai-Lidov oscillation, due to dynamical perturbations.\nFurthermore, the merging inner BBHs tend to have highly eccentric orbits at low\nfrequency range, some of them with low redshift would be detected by\nLISA/TianQin.

Basic building blocks of the model are bare\nresonance states such as $\\eta(1405/1475)$ and $f_1(1420)$, and $\\pi K$,\n$K\\bar{K}$, and $\\pi\\eta$ two-body interactions that generate resonances such\nas $K^*(892)$, $K^*_0(700)$, and $a_0(980)$. This model reasonably fits\n$K_SK_S\\pi^0$ Dalitz plot pseudo data generated from the BESIII's\n$J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ amplitude for $J/\\psi\\to\\gamma K_SK_S\\pi^0$.

Our $0^{-+}$ amplitude is analytically\ncontinued to find three poles, two of which correspond to $\\eta(1405)$ on\ndifferent Riemann sheet of the $K^*\\bar{K}$ channel, and the third one for\n$\\eta(1475)$. This is the first pole determination of $\\eta(1405/1475)$ and,\nfurthermore, the first-ever pole determination from analyzing experimental\nDalitz plot distributions with a manifestly three-body unitary coupled-channel\nframework. Process-dependent $\\eta\\pi\\pi$, $\\gamma\\pi^+\\pi^-$, and $\\pi\\pi\\pi$\nlineshapes of $J/\\psi\\to\\gamma(0^{-+})\\to \\gamma(\\eta\\pi\\pi)$,\n$\\gamma(\\gamma\\rho)$, and $\\gamma(\\pi\\pi\\pi)$ are predicted, and are in\nreasonable agreement with data. A triangle singularity is shown to play a\ncrucial role to cause the large isospin violation of\n$J/\\psi\\to\\gamma(\\pi\\pi\\pi)$.",

Combining the Coulomb gas method\nwith numerical simulations using a matrix variant of the Wang-Landau algorithm,\nwe found that, in the limit of $N\\to \\infty$, the rate function of\n$\\mathcal{P}(A,m)$ exhibits phase transitions of different characters. The\nphase diagram of the system on the $(A,m)$ plane is surprisingly rich, as it\nincludes three regions: (i) a region with a single-interval support of the\noptimal spectrum of eigenvalues, (ii) a region emerging for $m<2$ where the\noptimal spectrum splits into two separate intervals, and (iii) a region\nemerging for $m>2$ where the maximum or minimum eigenvalue ``evaporates\" from\nthe rest of eigenvalues and dominates the statistics of $A$. The phase\ntransition between regions (i) and (iii) is of second order. Analytical\narguments and numerical simulations strongly suggest that the phase transition\nbetween regions (i) and (ii) is of (in general) fractional order $p=1+1/|m-1|$,\nwhere $0<m<2$.

A common scenario involves using a fixed training set\nto train models, with the goal of designing new samples that outperform those\npresent in the training data. A major challenge in this setting is distribution\nshift, where the distributions of training and design samples are different.\nWhile some shift is expected, as the goal is to create better designs, this\nchange can negatively affect model accuracy and subsequently, design quality.\nDespite the widespread nature of this problem, addressing it demands deep\ndomain knowledge and artful application. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nstraightforward method for design practitioners that detects distribution\nshifts. This method trains a binary classifier using knowledge of the unlabeled\ndesign distribution to separate the training data from the design data. The\nclassifier's logit scores are then used as a proxy measure of distribution\nshift. We validate our method in a real-world application by running offline\nMBO and evaluate the effect of distribution shift on design quality. We find\nthat the intensity of the shift in the design distribution varies based on the\nnumber of steps taken by the optimization algorithm, and our simple approach\ncan identify these shifts. This enables users to constrain their search to\nregions where the model's predictions are reliable, thereby increasing the\nquality of designs.",

Traditional penalized\nregularizations techniques, primarily designed for promoting sparsity, are\ninadequate to capture the optimal solutions in such scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces a novel algorithm named Non-sparse Iteration\n(NSI). The NSI algorithm allows for the existence of both sparse and non-sparse\nstructures and estimates them simultaneously and accurately. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees that the proposed algorithm converges to the oracle\nsolution and achieves the optimal rate for the upper bound of the $l_2$-norm\nerror. Through simulations and practical applications, NSI consistently\nexhibits superior statistical performance in terms of estimation accuracy,\nprediction efficacy, and variable selection compared to several existing\nmethods. The proposed method is also applied to breast cancer data, revealing\nrepeated selection of specific genes for in-depth analysis.",

However, these techniques still\nface limitations when confronted with challenging scenarios, including\nocclusion, diverse appearances, variations in illumination, and overlap. To\ncope with such drawbacks, we present the Spatial Attention-based Distribution\nIntegration Network (SADI-NET) to improve the accuracy of localization in such\nsituations. Our network consists of three efficient models: the receptive\nfortified module (RFM), spatial fusion module (SFM), and distribution learning\nmodule (DLM). Building upon the classic HourglassNet architecture, we replace\nthe basic block with our proposed RFM. The RFM incorporates a dilated residual\nblock and attention mechanism to expand receptive fields while enhancing\nsensitivity to spatial information. In addition, the SFM incorporates\nmulti-scale characteristics by employing both global and local attention\nmechanisms. Furthermore, the DLM, inspired by residual log-likelihood\nestimation (RLE), reconfigures a predicted heatmap using a trainable\ndistribution weight. For the purpose of determining the efficacy of our model,\nwe conducted extensive experiments on the MPII and LSP benchmarks.\nParticularly, our model obtained a remarkable $92.10\\%$ percent accuracy on the\nMPII test dataset, demonstrating significant improvements over existing models\nand establishing state-of-the-art performance.",

Assuming a locally treelike backbone we derive exact\nexpressions for the expected number of various small, loopy motifs (triangles,\nfour-loops, diamonds and four-cliques) as a function of moments of the backbone\ndegree distribution. In this way we determine how transitivity and its suitably\ndefined generalizations for higher-order motifs depend on the heterogeneity of\nthe original network, revealing the existence of transitions due to the\ninterplay between topologically inequivalent triads in the network.\nFurthermore, under reasonable assumptions for the moments of the backbone\nnetwork, we establish approximate relationships between motif densities, which\nwe test in a large dataset of real-world networks.

Since it is\nimpractical to compute the expected risk exactly over all possible hypotheses,\ntwo approximations are commonly used in MBR. First, it integrates over a\nsampled set of hypotheses rather than over all possible hypotheses. Second, it\nestimates the probability of each hypothesis using a Monte Carlo estimator.\nWhile the first approximation is necessary to make it computationally feasible,\nthe second is not essential since we typically have access to the model\nprobability at inference time.

Our approach,\nlatent task-specific graph network simulator, uses non-amortized task posterior\napproximations to sample latent descriptions of unknown system properties.\nAdditionally, we leverage movement primitives for efficient full trajectory\nprediction, effectively addressing the issue of accumulating errors encountered\nby previous auto-regressive methods. We validate the effectiveness of our\napproach through various experiments, performing on par with or better than\nestablished baseline methods. Movement primitives further allow us to\naccommodate various types of context data, as demonstrated through the\nutilization of point clouds during inference. By combining GNSs with\nmeta-learning, we bring them closer to real-world applicability, particularly\nin scenarios with smaller datasets.",

Analytic progress can be made in the concentrated limit\n(when the solvent-to-total-viscosity ratio $\\beta \\rightarrow 0$), illustrating\nthe boundary layer structure of PDI, and allowing the prediction of its\neigenvalues for both plane Couette and channel flow. We draw connections\nbetween PDI and the polymer melt `sharkskin' instability, both of which are\nshort wavelength instabilities localised to the extrudate surface. Inertia is\nshown to have a destabilising effect, reducing the smallest Weissenberg number\n($W$) where PDI exists in a concentrated fluid from $W\\sim 8$ in inertialess\nflows, to $W \\sim 2$ when inertia is significant.",

Our theoretical study is based on\na functional that is built using quantum Monte Carlo results of the bulk phase\nand incorporates finite-range effects. A characteristic feature of these drops\nis the existence of a critical atom number, that is the minimum number of\nparticles to have a many-body bound state. We report results on the critical\natom numbers for different magnetic fields and applying confinement strengths\ntowards a quasi-two-dimensional setup. In the regime where the local density\napproximation is expected to be valid, we find that the critical atom number\ndecreases linearly with the harmonic oscillator length of the confining\npotential. With the largest squeezing explored in our work, we predict stable\ndrops at the level of one thousand atoms. Our functional reduces the critical\nnumbers for any confinement and applied magnetic field with respect to the\nestimations based on the Lee-Huang-Yang model. We observe saturated drops when\nthe number of atoms in the drop is much larger than the critical value, their\ncentral density being higher for the quantum Monte Carlo functional than for\nthe Lee-Huang-Yang one.",

Meanwhile, the increasing connectivity of\ncloud-based or networked control results in vast amounts of such data, which\nposes a privacy threat, especially when evaluation on external platforms is\nconsidered. In this context, a cipher based on a random affine transformation\ngained attention, which is supposed to enable privacy-preserving evaluations of\nquadratic programs (QPs) with little computational overhead compared to other\nmethods.\n  This paper deals with the security of such randomly transformed QPs in the\ncontext of model predictive control (MPC). In particular, we show how to\nconstruct attacks against this cipher and thereby underpin concerns regarding\nits security in a practical setting. To this end, we exploit invariants under\nthe transformations and common specifications of MPC-related QPs. Our numerical\nexamples then illustrate that these two ingredients suffice to extract\ninformation from ciphertexts.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "In the reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, the ability to predict receiving\nreward in the near or more distant future means the ability to evaluate the\ncurrent state as more or less close to the target state (labelled by the reward\nsignal). In the present work, we utilize a spiking neural network (SNN) to\npredict time to the next target event (reward - in case of RL). In the context\nof SNNs, events are represented as spikes emitted by network neurons or input\nnodes. It is assumed that target events are indicated by spikes emitted by a\nspecial network input node. Using description of the current state encoded in\nthe form of spikes from the other input nodes, the network should predict\napproximate time of the next target event. This research paper presents a novel\napproach to learning the corresponding predictive model by an SNN consisting of\nleaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. The proposed method leverages specially\ndesigned local synaptic plasticity rules and a novel columnar-layered SNN\narchitecture. Similar to our previous works, this study places a strong\nemphasis on the hardware-friendliness of the proposed models, ensuring their\nefficient implementation on modern and future neuroprocessors. The approach\nproposed was tested on a simple reward prediction task in the context of one of\nthe RL benchmark ATARI games, ping-pong. It was demonstrated that the SNN\ndescribed in this paper gives superior prediction accuracy in comparison with\nprecise machine learning techniques, such as decision tree algorithms and\nconvolutional neural networks.",

                "year": 2023,
                "abstract": "The increasing reliance on Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography for\nPulmonary Embolism (PE) diagnosis presents challenges and a pressing need for\nimproved diagnostic solutions. The primary objective of this study is to\nleverage deep learning techniques to enhance the Computer Assisted Diagnosis of\nPE. With this aim, we propose a classifier-guided detection approach that\neffectively leverages the classifier's probabilistic inference to direct the\ndetection predictions, marking a novel contribution in the domain of automated\nPE diagnosis. Our end-to-end classification framework introduces an\nAttention-Guided Convolutional Neural Network (AG-CNN) that leverages local\ncontext by utilizing an attention mechanism. This approach emulates a human\nexpert's attention by looking at both global appearances and local lesion\nregions before forming a conclusive decision. The classifier demonstrates\nstrong performance on the FUMPE dataset, achieving AUROC, sensitivity,\nspecificity, and F1-score of 0.927, 0.862, 0.879, and 0.805 respectively with\nInception-v3 backbone architecture. Moreover, AG-CNN outperforms the baseline\nDenseNet-121 model, achieving an 8.1% AUROC gain. While prior studies have\nprimarily focused on PE detection in main arteries, our utilization of\ncutting-edge object detection models and ensembling techniques greatly improves\nthe accuracy of finding small embolisms in the peripheral arteries. Finally,\nour proposed classifier-guided detection approach further refines the detection\nmetrics contributing new state-of-the-art to the community: mAP$_{50}$,\nsensitivity and F1-score of 0.846, 0.901 and 0.779 respectively outperforming\nthe former benchmark with a significant 3.7% improvement in mAP$_{50}$. Our\nresearch aims to elevate PE patient care by integrating AI solutions into\nclinical workflows, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in\nmedical diagnostics.",
