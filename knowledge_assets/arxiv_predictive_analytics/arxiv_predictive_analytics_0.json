            "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools for open-ended\nimage understanding tasks, including open vocabulary segmentation. Yet, direct\napplication of such VLMs to segmentation is non-trivial, since VLMs are trained\nwith image-text pairs and naturally lack pixel-level granularity. Recent works\nhave made advancements in bridging this gap, often by leveraging the shared\nimage-text space in which the image and a provided text prompt are represented.\nIn this paper, we challenge the capabilities of VLMs further and tackle\nopen-vocabulary segmentation without the need for any textual input. To this\nend, we propose a novel Self-Guided Semantic Segmentation (Self-Seg) framework.\nSelf-Seg is capable of automatically detecting relevant class names from\nclustered BLIP embeddings and using these for accurate semantic segmentation.\nIn addition, we propose an LLM-based Open-Vocabulary Evaluator (LOVE) to\neffectively assess predicted open-vocabulary class names. We achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC, ADE20K and CityScapes for\nopen-vocabulary segmentation without given class names, as well as competitive\nperformance with methods where class names are given. All code and data will be\nreleased.",

The Heisenberg exchanges, which can\nbe calculated to an arbitrary shell, are transferred into the Monte Carlo\ncalculation. Using Cr-based magnets as the showcases, we show that our method\nis a powerful tool to study the 2D magnets in two aspects. First, considering\nlong-range exchanges enables us to identify the spin frustration in the\nsuspended CrTe2 monolayer, whereas the heterostructure calculations reveal that\nthe ferromagnetism can be recovered if the monolayer CrTe2 is grown onto\nvarious 2D substrates. Second, we realize a high-throughput screening of novel\nmagnets discovered by random structure searches. Six 2D Cr chalcogenides are\nselected to have high TM.

Firstly, a frustum\nfeature encoder module is used to extract per-point features within the frustum\nregion, which preserves scene consistency and is crucial for point-level\npredictions. Next, a frustum-point fusion module is introduced to update\nper-point features hierarchically, which enables each point to extract more\nsurrounding information via the frustum features. Finally, a head fusion module\nis used to fuse features at different levels for final semantic prediction.\nExtensive experiments on four popular LiDAR segmentation benchmarks under\nvarious task setups demonstrate our superiority.

PC priors penalize the Kullback-Leibler\nDivergence (KLD) between the distributions induced by a ``simple'' model and\nthat of a more complex model. However, in many common cases, it is impossible\nto construct a prior in this way because the KLD is infinite. Various\napproximations are used to mitigate this problem, but the resulting priors then\nfail to follow the designed principles.

These priors avoid the infinite\nmodel distance issues and can be derived by following the principles exactly,\nmaking them more interpretable. Furthermore, principles and recipes to\nconstruct joint WCP priors for multiple parameters analytically and numerically\nare proposed and we show that they can be easily obtained, either numerically\nor analytically, for a general class of models.

            "summary": "Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are defined as ''coherent'' if\nthey are capable of responding to external perturbations in a collective\nmanner. This implies that information must be able to propagate across ICME\nstructures, and if this is not the case, single-point in-situ measurements\ncannot be considered as indicative of global ICME properties. Here, we\ninvestigate the role of Alfvenic fluctuations (AFs) as mediators of ICME\ncoherence. We consider multi-point magnetic field and plasma measurements of 10\nICMEs observed by the ACE and Wind spacecraft at 1 au at longitudinal\nseparations of 0.5{\\deg}-0.7{\\deg}. For each event, we analyze the Alfvenicity\nin terms of the residual energy and cross helicity of fluctuations, and the\ncoherence in terms of the magnetic correlation between Wind and ACE. We find\nthat ~65% and 90% of ICME sheaths and magnetic ejecta (MEs), respectively,\npresent extended AFs covering at least 20% of the structure. Cross helicity\nsuggests AFs of solar and interplanetary origin may co-exist in the ICME\npopulation at 1 au. AFs are mainly concentrated downstream of shocks and in the\nback of MEs. The magnetic field is poorly correlated within sheaths, while the\ncorrelation decreases from the front to the back of the MEs for most magnetic\nfield components. AFs are also associated with lower magnetic field\ncorrelations. This suggests either that ICME coherence is not mediated by\nAlfven waves, implying that the coherence scale may be smaller than previously\npredicted, or that the magnetic field correlation is not a measure of\ncoherence.",

We recently introduced the Alchemical Integral\nTransform (AIT) enabling the effective prediction of $E_B$ but requiring us to\nparametrize space $\\pmb{r}$ in terms of $\\lambda$ for which we used an Ansatz\nfound by trial and error. The kernel $\\mathcal{K}$ of AIT also required\npre-computed solutions of certain Diophantine equations which increased\ncomputational complexity and cost. Here, we present the exact one-dimensional\nsolution to $\\pmb{r}(\\lambda)$, together with the full one-dimensional kernel\n$\\mathcal{K}$. Numerical evidence and a proof are presented in form of the\nquantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) and the Morse potential. Furthermore, we\nderive an analytical expression of $\\mathcal{K}$ for the free atom which\namounts to proof that the energy varies quadratically exactly, not\napproximately, in nuclear charge $Z_B$ for the entire iso-electronic series of\nall the possible charged ions, i.e. $E_B(Z, N_e)\\propto-\\frac{1}{2}Z_B^2$.\nComparison to Levy's averaging formula for relative energies of iso-electronic\nsystems also enables us to derive his residual error term. Finally, we rewrite\n$\\mathcal{K}$ in a simple, compact and easy to implement form for arbitrary\nchanges in external potentials $$E_B-E_A\n=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}d\\pmb{y}_A\\,\\rho_A(\\pmb{y}_A)\\,\\mathcal{K}[v_A,v_B](\\pmb{y}_A)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}d\\pmb{y}_A\\,\\rho_A(\\pmb{y}_A)\\frac{v_B(\\pmb{y}_A)-v_A(\\pmb{y}_A)}{(2\\pi)^n}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}d\\pmb{\\phi}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}d\\pmb{r}_A\\int_0^1d\\lambda\\,e^{i\\pmb{\\phi}\\cdot\\left(\\pmb{y}_A-\\pmb{r}(\\lambda)\\right)}$$\nHere, $v_A,v_B$ are initial and final external potential, $\\pmb{r}(\\lambda)$\nthe $n$-dimensional parametrization.",

Here, we generate entanglement in a novel bipartite quantum system\ncontaining two massive objects: a photoelectron, which is a free particle\npropagating rapidly in space, and a light-dressed atomic ion with tunable\ncoupled energy levels. Because of the entanglement, the measured photoelectron\nspectra reveal information about the coherent dynamics in the residual ion\ninteracting with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses delivered by a seeded\nfree-electron laser. The observations are supported by a quantum optics based\nanalytical model, which was further validated by numerical simulations based on\nthe time-dependent Dirac equation. The degree of entanglement between the two\nobjects is interpreted in terms of the entanglement entropy of the reduced\nsystem, as a function of the interaction time between the laser pulse and the\ndressed ion.

We present\nFreqFed, a novel aggregation mechanism that transforms the model updates (i.e.,\nweights) into the frequency domain, where we can identify the core frequency\ncomponents that inherit sufficient information about weights. This allows us to\neffectively filter out malicious updates during local training on the clients,\nregardless of attack types, strategies, and clients' data distributions. We\nextensively evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of FreqFed in different\napplication domains, including image classification, word prediction, IoT\nintrusion detection, and speech recognition. We demonstrate that FreqFed can\nmitigate poisoning attacks effectively with a negligible impact on the utility\nof the aggregated model.",

Our methodology builds on (a) the Bayesian\nprobabilistic version of the world population model and (b) on the\ninterdependencies of the minimum food requirements and the national food system\ncapacities on key drivers, such as: population, income, natural resources, and\nother socioeconomic and climate indicators. Model uncertainty plays an\nimportant role in such endeavours. In this perspective, the concept of the\nrecently developed convex risk measures which mitigate the model uncertainty\neffects, is employed for the development of a framework for assessment, in the\ncontext of food security. The proposed method provides predictions and\nevaluations for food security risk both within and across probabilistic\nscenarios at country level. Our methodology is illustrated through its\nimplementation for the cases of Egypt and Ethiopia, for the time period\n2019-2050, under the combined context of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\n(SSPs) and the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).",

            "summary": "Recent molecular communication (MC) research has integrated more detailed\ncomputational models to capture the dynamics of practical biophysical systems.\nThis research focuses on developing realistic models for MC transceivers\ninspired by spheroids - three-dimensional cell aggregates commonly used in\norgan-on-chip experimental systems. Potential applications that can be used or\nmodeled with spheroids include nutrient transport in an organ-on-chip system,\nthe release of biomarkers or reception of drug molecules by a cancerous tumor\nsite, or transceiver nanomachines participating in information exchange. In\nthis paper, a simple diffusive MC system is considered where a spheroidal\ntransmitter and receiver are in an unbounded fluid environment. These\nspheroidal antennas are modeled as porous media for diffusive signaling\nmolecules, then their boundary conditions and effective diffusion coefficients\nare characterized. Further, for either a point source or spheroidal\ntransmitter, Green's function for concentration (GFC) outside and inside the\nreceiving spheroid is analytically derived and formulated in terms of an\ninfinite series and confirmed by a particle-based simulator (PBS). The provided\nGFCs enable computation of the transmitted and received signals in the\nspheroidal communication system. This study shows that the porous structure of\nthe receiving spheroid amplifies diffusion signals but also disperses them,\nthus there is a trade-off between porosity and information transmission rate.\nAlso, the results reveal that the porous arrangement of the transmitting\nspheroid not only disperses the received signal but also attenuates it. System\nperformance is also evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER). Decreasing the\nporosity of the receiving spheroid is shown to enhance system performance.\nConversely, reducing the porosity of the transmitting spheroid can adversely\naffect system performance.",

The non-trivial topology of materials is within the known\nmechanisms that prevent the bound states to couple with the extended states. In\nthis work we search for topologically protected BICs in a quantum Hall bar with\nan anti-dot formed by a pore far from the borders of the bar. The bound state\nenergies and wavefunctions are calculated by means of the Recursive S-Matrix\nmethod. The resulting bound state energies coexist with extended states and\nexhibit a pattern complimentary to the Hofstadter butterfly. A\nsymmetry-breaking diagonal disorder was introduced, showing that the BICs with\nenergies far from the Landau levels remain robust.

With their famous strong Coulomb correlations among 3d electrons and\nthe proximity to antiferromagnetic instability these systems represent a\nchallenge for their theoretical description, and most previous studies of\nsuperconductivity relied on the solutions of simplified few--orbital model\nHamiltonians.

We present a general\nmodel and formal notation for these social network extensions that permit\nsocial scientists to be more explicit about their balance theoretic statements.\nSpecifically, we formulate statements as a comparison of two conditional\nprobabilities of a tie, where the conditionals are defined by the 2-path\nrelation Ego - X - Alter. Given the importance Heider assigns to the role of\nnegative associations, we further identify negative ties as separate from\nnon-ties (neutral or zero-valued ties) and consider a signed graph to be a\nrestricted multigraph composed of three mutually exclusive and exhaustive\nrelations: positive ties, negative ties, and zero-ties. We stress that\nneutrality is the result of a triadic process. Combining these two features\ninto our theoretical frame results in 27 identifiable configurations. Drawing\non the work on Transitivity Correlation models, we propose a set of simple\ndescriptive statistics to measure the extent to which evidence for any\nstipulated balance configuration is present in a network. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how to apply this approach to assess network-level balance in a\nlarge data set consisting of friendly vs hostile relations between countries\nfrom 1816 to 2007. We find strong evidence particularly for one of the four\nclassic Heiderian balance theory predictions, and virtually no evidence in\nsupport of the imbalance predictions. However, we do find stable and surprising\nevidence that `neutral' ties are important in balancing the relations among\nnations.",

After\nthe end of the superactive state, the hot component became significantly\nredder, $(U-B)_0 \\approx -0.3$ and $(B-V)_0 \\approx 0.6$ in August 2023, and\nits luminosity decreased markedly to $20-25$~$L_\\odot$ in April-May 2023, and\nto $8-9~L_\\odot$ in August 2023.

The events are modelled as Cox\nprocesses (doubly stochastic Poisson processes) where the event intensities may\ndepend on all the modeled events as well as external factors. The model has a\nstrictly concave log-likelihood function which facilitates its fitting to\nobserved data. Besides event times, the model describes the random lengths of\nstoppage times which can have a strong influence on the final score of a match.\nThe model is illustrated on eight years of data from Campeonato Brasileiro de\nFutebol S\\'erie A. We find that dynamic regressors significantly improve the\nin-game predictive power of the model. In particular, a) when a team receives a\nred card, its goal intensity decreases more than 30%; b) the goal rate of a\nteam increases by 10% if it is losing by one goal and by 20% if its losing by\ntwo goals; and c) when the goal difference at the end of the second half is\nless than or equal to one, the stoppage time is on average more than one minute\nlonger than in matches with a difference of two goals.",

We employ\nsemi-analytical General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) computations to\nstudy the emission from the accretion flow around LQBHs. Our findings indicate\nthat the increase of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effects results in an\nenlargement of the rings from LQBHs, thereby causing a more circular\npolarization pattern in the shadow images. We make comparisons with the Event\nHorizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr\\,A$^*$ and M\\,87$^*$, which enable\nus to determine an upper limit for the polymetric function $P$ in LQG. The\nupper limit for Sgr\\,A$^*$ is $0.2$, while for M\\,87$^*$ it is $0.07$. Both\nblack holes exhibit a preference for a relatively high spin ($a\\gtrsim0.5$ for\nSgr\\,A$^*$ and $0.5\\lesssim a \\lesssim 0.7$ for M\\,87$^*$). The constraints for\nSgr\\,A$^*$ are based on black hole spin and ring diameter, whereas for\nM\\,87$^*$, the constraints are further tightened by the polarimetric pattern.\nIn essence, our simulations provide observational constraints on the effect of\nLQG in supermassive black holes (SMBH), providing the most consistent\ncomparison with observation.",

Analytical\nmodeling of the buckling of miniaturized pillars is especially important due to\nthe difficulties in conducting experiments. Here, a well-posed stress-driven\nnonlocal model is developed, which allows the calculation of the critical loads\nand buckling configurations of the miniaturized pillars on an elastic\nfoundation and with arbitrary numbers of edge cracks. The discontinuities in\nbending slopes and deflection at the damaged cross-sections due to the edge\ncracks are captured through the incorporation of both rotational and\ntranslational springs. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to investigate the\ninstability of pillars containing a range of one to four cracks. This analysis\nreveals interesting effects regarding the influence of crack location,\nnonlocality, and elastic foundation on the initial and subsequent critical\nloads and associated buckling configurations. The main findings are: (i) the\nshielding and amplification effects related to a system of cracks become more\nsignificant as the dimensions of pillars reduce, (ii) the influence of the\nshear force at the damaged cross-section related to the translational spring\nmust not be neglected when dealing with higher modes of buckling and long\ncracks, (iii) an elastic foundation decreases the effects of the cracks and\nsize dependency on the buckling loads, and (iv) the effects of the edge cracks\non the critical loads and buckling configurations of the miniaturized pillars\nare highly dependent on the boundary conditions.",

            "summary": "Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the\nbroadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple\nfractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in\nsharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently\nshown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling\nmay display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named\nQD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic,\nnon-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the\ninformation propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is\nentangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the\ndistribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an\nenvironment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the\nfraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two\nsimilar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a\nnoisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We\nderive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we\nanalyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD,\nintermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The\nencoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero\ncorrelation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be\nprobed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction,\nwhich becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The\nQD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must\nbe probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry\nbreaking in the replica space.",

Data heterogeneity is one of the core\nchallenges in federated learning, which could severely degrade the convergence\nrate and prediction performance of deep neural networks. To address this issue,\nwe develop a novel personalized federated learning framework for heterogeneous\ndata, which we refer to as FedSplit. This modeling framework is motivated by\nthe finding that, data in different clients contain both common knowledge and\npersonalized knowledge. Then the hidden elements in each neural layer can be\nsplit into the shared and personalized groups. With this decomposition, a novel\nobjective function is established and optimized. We demonstrate FedSplit\nenjoyers a faster convergence speed than the standard federated learning method\nboth theoretically and empirically. The generalization bound of the FedSplit\nmethod is also studied. To practically implement the proposed method on real\ndatasets, factor analysis is introduced to facilitate the decoupling of hidden\nelements. This leads to a practically implemented model for FedSplit and we\nfurther refer to as FedFac. We demonstrated by simulation studies that, using\nfactor analysis can well recover the underlying shared/personalized\ndecomposition. The superior prediction performance of FedFac is further\nverified empirically by comparison with various state-of-the-art federated\nlearning methods on several real datasets.",

This paper addresses the problem by\nintroducing an effective activity grammar to guide neural predictions for\ntemporal action segmentation. We propose a novel grammar induction algorithm\nthat extracts a powerful context-free grammar from action sequence data.

However, none of these projects have\nthe power to systematically unveil the galaxy cluster population at $z>1$.\nThere therefore remains the need for an ATHENA-like mission to run independent\ncosmological investigations and scrutinise the consistency between the results\nfrom the $0<z<1$ and $1<z<2$ epochs. We study the constraints on the DE EoS and\non primordial non-Gaussanities for typical X-ray cluster surveys executed by\nATHENA. We consider two survey designs: 50 deg$^2$ at 80ks (survey A) and 200\ndeg$^2$ at 20ks (survey B). We analytically derive cluster counts in a space of\nobservable properties, and predict the cosmological potential of the\ncorresponding samples with a Fisher analysis. The achieved depth allows us to\nunveil the halo mass function down to the group scale out to $z=2$. We predict\nthe detection of thousands of clusters down to a few 10$^{13} h^{-1}\nM_{\\odot}$, in particular 940 and 1400 clusters for surveys A and B,\nrespectively, at $z>1$. Such samples will allow a detailed modelling of the\nevolution of cluster physics along with a standalone cosmological analysis. Our\nresults suggest that survey B has the optimal design as it provides greater\nstatistics. Remarkably, high-$z$ clusters, despite representing 15% or less of\nthe full samples, allow a significant reduction of the uncertainty on the\ncosmological parameters: $\\Delta w_a$ is reduced by a factor of 2.3 and $\\Delta\nf_{NL}^{loc}$ by a factor of 3. Inventorying the high-$z$ X-ray cluster\npopulation can play a crucial role in ensuring overall cosmological\nconsistency. This will be the major aim of future new-generation ATHENA-like\nmissions.",

            "summary": "The mergers of two neutron stars are exceptional multi-messenger events that\nenable us to probe fundamental physics in one of the most extreme environments\nin the Universe. Multi-wavelength follow-up observations are essential in order\nto probe the physics of the outflows from and remnants of these neutron star\nmergers, both when detected as short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and as\ngravitational wave events. Rapid follow-up can provide localisations for\ntargeted deep follow-up observations and, ideally, a distance measurement,\nwhich constrains for instance the energetics of the merger. A key outstanding\nquestion is the remnant's nature: with its expected mass and rapid spin, it\ncould either be a black hole or a supramassive, likely highly magnetised\nneutron star (a magnetar). Both can power a GRB, but rapidly spinning magnetars\nare additionally predicted to emit coherent radio bursts following their\nformation and may constitute a small fraction of the progenitors of fast radio\nbursts. Black holes, by contrast, are not expected to emit coherent radio\nbursts in the time following the GRB itself. Here we present rapid follow-up\nobservations of the short GRB 201006A using LOFAR. We have detected a\n5.6$\\sigma$, short, coherent radio flash at 144 MHz at 76.6 mins post-burst.\nThis radio flash is 27 arcsec offset from the GRB location, which has a\nprobability of occurring by chance of $\\sim$0.5% (2.6$\\sigma$) when accounting\nfor measurement uncertainties. Despite the offset, we show that the probability\nof finding an unrelated transient within 40 arcsec of the GRB location is\n$<10^{-6}$ and conclude that this is likely to be the radio counterpart to GRB\n201006A. The radio flash is tentatively (2.5$\\sigma$) shown to be highly\ndispersed, allowing a distance estimate, corresponding to a redshift of\n$0.58\\pm0.06$, that is in the range of typical short GRB distances.

To alleviate\nthis problem, we aim to design efficient quantum circuits that would outperform\nthe existing ones on the current noisy quantum devices. In this study, we\ndesigned a novel quantum circuit that reduces the required circuit depth and\nnumber of two-qubit entangling gates by about 60%, while retaining the accuracy\nof the ground state energies close to the chemical accuracy. Moreover, even in\nthe presence of device noise, these novel shallower circuits yielded\nsubstantially low error rates than the existing approaches for predicting the\nground state energies of molecules. By considering the umbrella inversion\nprocess in ammonia molecule as an example, we demonstrated the advantages of\nthis new approach and estimated the energy barrier for the inversion process.",

Reconstruction-based\napproaches that use generative models to learn to reconstruct healthy brain\nanatomy are commonly used for this task. Diffusion models are an emerging class\nof deep generative models that show great potential regarding reconstruction\nfidelity. However, they face challenges in preserving intensity characteristics\nin the reconstructed images, limiting their performance in anomaly detection.\nTo address this challenge, we propose to condition the denoising mechanism of\ndiffusion models with additional information about the image to reconstruct\ncoming from a latent representation of the noise-free input image. This\nconditioning enables high-fidelity reconstruction of healthy brain structures\nwhile aligning local intensity characteristics of input-reconstruction pairs.\nWe evaluate our method's reconstruction quality, domain adaptation features and\nfinally segmentation performance on publicly available data sets with various\npathologies. Using our proposed conditioning mechanism we can reduce the\nfalse-positive predictions and enable a more precise delineation of anomalies\nwhich significantly enhances the anomaly detection performance compared to\nestablished state-of-the-art approaches to unsupervised anomaly detection in\nbrain MRI.

To probe the limit of such methods, we\ndesigned a universal readout error mitigation protocol based on quantum state\ntomography (QST), which estimates the density matrix of a quantum system, and\nquantum detector tomography (QDT), which characterizes the measurement\nprocedure. By treating readout error mitigation in the context of state\ntomography the method becomes largely device-, architecture-, noise source-,\nand quantum state-independent. We implement this method on a superconducting\nqubit and benchmark the increase in reconstruction fidelity for QST.

            "summary": "In recent years, knowledge distillation methods based on contrastive learning\nhave achieved promising results on image classification and object detection\ntasks. However, in this line of research, we note that less attention is paid\nto semantic segmentation. Existing methods heavily rely on data augmentation\nand memory buffer, which entail high computational resource demands when\napplying them to handle semantic segmentation that requires to preserve\nhigh-resolution feature maps for making dense pixel-wise predictions. In order\nto address this problem, we present Augmentation-free Dense Contrastive\nKnowledge Distillation (Af-DCD), a new contrastive distillation learning\nparadigm to train compact and accurate deep neural networks for semantic\nsegmentation applications. Af-DCD leverages a masked feature mimicking\nstrategy, and formulates a novel contrastive learning loss via taking advantage\nof tactful feature partitions across both channel and spatial dimensions,\nallowing to effectively transfer dense and structured local knowledge learnt by\nthe teacher model to a target student model while maintaining training\nefficiency. Extensive experiments on five mainstream benchmarks with various\nteacher-student network pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\nFor instance, the DeepLabV3-Res18|DeepLabV3-MBV2 model trained by Af-DCD\nreaches 77.03%|76.38% mIOU on Cityscapes dataset when choosing DeepLabV3-Res101\nas the teacher, setting new performance records.

ZSM frameworks leverage advanced technologies such as\nMachine Learning (ML) to enable intelligent decision-making and reduce human\nintervention. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Zero-Touch Networks\n(ZTNs) within the ZSM framework, covering network optimization, traffic\nmonitoring, energy efficiency, and security aspects of next-generational\nnetworks. The paper explores the challenges associated with ZSM, particularly\nthose related to ML, which necessitate the need to explore diverse network\nautomation solutions. In this context, the study investigates the application\nof Automated ML (AutoML) in ZTNs, to reduce network management costs and\nenhance performance. AutoML automates the selection and tuning process of a ML\nmodel for a given task. Specifically, the focus is on AutoML's ability to\npredict application throughput and autonomously adapt to data drift.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AutoML\npipeline over traditional ML in terms of prediction accuracy. Integrating\nAutoML and ZSM concepts significantly reduces network configuration and\nmanagement efforts, allowing operators to allocate more time and resources to\nother important tasks. The paper also provides a high-level 5G system\narchitecture incorporating AutoML and ZSM concepts. This research highlights\nthe potential of ZTNs and AutoML to revolutionize the management of 5G+\nnetworks, enabling automated decision-making and empowering network operators\nto achieve higher efficiency, improved performance, and enhanced user\nexperience.",

A multi-information\nvariable is constructed to transform the system into a new state space, where\nit is found that the jerk dynamics of the turbine-generator cascaded system is\na second-order differential equation. Benefiting from this characteristic, we\npropose a new form for GDTA using jerk dynamics, which is established in the\nfrequency-frequency acceleration phase space.

            "summary": "Multivariate time-series data in numerous real-world applications (e.g.,\nhealthcare and industry) are informative but challenging due to the lack of\nlabels and high dimensionality. Recent studies in self-supervised learning have\nshown their potential in learning rich representations without relying on\nlabels, yet they fall short in learning disentangled embeddings and addressing\nissues of inductive bias (e.g., transformation-invariance). To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose TimeDRL, a generic multivariate time-series\nrepresentation learning framework with disentangled dual-level embeddings.\nTimeDRL is characterized by three novel features: (i) disentangled derivation\nof timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings from patched time-series data\nusing a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) utilization of timestamp-predictive and\ninstance-contrastive tasks for disentangled representation learning, with the\nformer optimizing timestamp-level embeddings with predictive loss, and the\nlatter optimizing instance-level embeddings with contrastive loss; and (iii)\navoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases, such as\ntransformation-invariance from cropping and masking. Comprehensive experiments\non 6 time-series forecasting datasets and 5 time-series classification datasets\nhave shown that TimeDRL consistently surpasses existing representation learning\napproaches, achieving an average improvement of forecasting by 57.98% in MSE\nand classification by 1.25% in accuracy.

Included among the major changes is an overhauled treatment\nof stellar feedback that is derived from energy conservation, operates on local\nscales, affects gas gradually over time rather than instantaneously, and\npredicts a mass-loading factor for every galaxy, which is a first for a SAM.\nBuilding on the model's resolved angular-momentum structure of galaxies, we now\nconsider the heating of stellar discs, delivering predictions for disc\nstructure both radially and vertically, another SAM first. We add a further\ndimension to stellar discs by tracking the distribution of stellar ages in each\nannulus. Each annulus--age bin has its own velocity dispersion and metallicity\nevolved in the model. This allows Dark Sage to make structural predictions for\ngalaxies that previously only hydrodynamic simulations could. We present the\nmodel as run on the merger trees of the highest-resolution gravity-only\nsimulation of the MillenniumTNG suite. Despite its additional complexity\nrelative to other SAMs, Dark Sage only has three free parameters, the least of\nany SAM, which we calibrate exclusively against the cosmic star formation\nhistory and the $z=0$ stellar and HI mass functions using a particle-swarm\noptimisation method.

Recent studies by Hatta and Zhou, however, show\nthat gluon generalized parton distribution (GPD) $E_g$, which is associated\nwith spin-flip processes, exhibits the Regge behavior identical to the BFKL\nPomeron. This was done by deriving the small-$x$ evolution equation for the\nreal part of $F$-type spin-flip gluon GTMDs $F_{1,2}$. In this article, we have\nshown that though the evolution equation for ${\\rm Re}(F_{1,2})$ has IR poles -\nthey all mutually cancel - making the equation IR finite and self-consistent.\nWe also have analytically solved the equations in the dilute regime and find\nsmall-$x$ asymptotics of the GTMDs ${\\rm Re}(F_{1,2})$ as \\begin{eqnarray} {\\rm\nRe}(F_{1,2}) \\sim \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha_s\\left(4\\ln2-8/3\\right)}\n\\left(\\cos 3\\phi_{k\\Delta} +\\cos \\phi_{k\\Delta}\\right). \\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray} Interestingly, the surviving solution corresponds to conformal\nspin $n=2$ and carries an explicit $\\cos 3\\phi_{k\\Delta} + \\cos \\phi_{k\\Delta}$\nazimuthal dependence. As the imaginary part of $F_{1,2}$, is related to the\nspin-dependent odderon or Gluon Siver function and scales as ${\\rm Im}(F_{1,2})\n\\sim x^{0}$, the positive intercept for ${\\rm Re}(F_{1,2})$, implies that it is\nexpected to dominate over the gluon Siver function in the small-$x$ limit - and\nmay directly impact the modeling of unpolarised GTMDs and associated spin-flip\nprocesses.",

            "summary": "Here, we design a novel class of Janus structures PbXY(X,Y = F, Cl, Br, I)\nand propose it for the solar mediated photocatalytic water splitting hydrogen\nproduction as well as for the photovoltaic solarcell applications. Charge\nanalysis shows that covalent bonding for less electronegative atoms and ionic\nbonding for more electronegative atoms. Strong dual bonding like ionic one side\nand covalent other side is observed when heavy and lighter atoms are part of\nthe same Janus structures. The as designed Janus structures show good dynamical\nstability through phonon calculations. Basic electronic structure using\nGeneralised Gradient Approximation(GGA) reveal both direct and indirect nature\nof band gap with large tunability. Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) electronic\nstructure calculations are performed and wider band gaps are predicted for\nthese Janus structures. The calculated effective masses of charge carriers show\nrobust charge carrier dynamics. The orbital resolved electronic density of\nstates (DOS) shows that the conduction band edge is composed of pz orbital of\nPb atom. The partialcharge density calculated at conduction band minimum (CBM)\nalso support the result obtained from PDOS analysis. Breaking of\ncentrosymmetry, polarization in the out of plane direction, the z-oriented\norbitals of CBM all points that these materials are suitable for shift current\ngeneration. The calculated optical absorption spectra show that the Janus\nstructures are suitable for visible light absorption. The calculated potential\ndifference between the top and bottom layer show significant variation and\nmaximum (1.02 eV) is observed for PbClF. Further, we show that combining both\npotential difference and HSE bandgap, valence band maximum(VBM) and CBM\nstraddle the water redox potentials, thus making the Janus structures suitable\nfor water redox reactions.",

However, reconstructing or predicting low-level pixel features\neasily enables the network to achieve overly strong generalization ability,\nallowing anomalies to be reconstructed or predicted as effectively as normal\ndata. Different from their methods, inspired by the Student-Teacher Network, we\npropose a novel framework called the Multilevel Guidance-Exploration\nNetwork(MGENet), which detects anomalies through the difference in high-level\nrepresentation between the Guidance and Exploration network. Specifically, we\nfirst utilize the pre-trained Normalizing Flow that takes skeletal keypoints as\ninput to guide an RGB encoder, which takes unmasked RGB frames as input, to\nexplore motion latent features. Then, the RGB encoder guides the mask encoder,\nwhich takes masked RGB frames as input, to explore the latent appearance\nfeature. Additionally, we design a Behavior-Scene Matching Module(BSMM) to\ndetect scene-related behavioral anomalies.

The COVID-19 case growth\nrate stands as a key epidemiological parameter to estimate and monitor for\neffective detection and containment of the resurgence of outbreaks. A\nfundamental challenge in growth rate estimation and hence outbreak detection is\nbalancing the accuracy-speed tradeoff, where accuracy typically degrades with\nshorter fitting windows. In this paper, we develop a machine learning (ML)\nalgorithm, which we call Transfer Learning Generalized Random Forest (TLGRF),\nthat balances this accuracy-speed tradeoff. Specifically, we estimate the\ninstantaneous COVID-19 exponential growth rate for each U.S. county by using\nTLGRF that chooses an adaptive fitting window size based on relevant day-level\nand county-level features affecting the disease spread. Through transfer\nlearning, TLGRF can accurately estimate case growth rates for counties with\nsmall sample sizes. Out-of-sample prediction analysis shows that TLGRF\noutperforms established growth rate estimation methods. Furthermore, we\nconducted a case study based on outbreak case data from the state of Colorado\nand showed that the timely detection of outbreaks could have been improved by\nup to 224% using TLGRF when compared to the decisions made by Colorado's\nDepartment of Health and Environment (CDPHE).

            "summary": "Predicting the properties of strongly correlated materials is a significant\nchallenge in condensed matter theory. The widely used dynamical mean-field\ntheory faces difficulty in solving quantum impurity models numerically. Hybrid\nquantum--classical algorithms such as variational quantum eigensolver emerge as\na potential solution for quantum impurity models. A common challenge in these\nalgorithms is the rapid growth of the number of variational parameters with the\nnumber of spin-orbitals in the impurity. In our approach to this problem, we\ndevelop compact ansatzes using a combination of two different strategies.\nFirst, we employ compact physics-inspired ansatz, $k$-unitary cluster Jastrow\nansatz, developed in the field of quantum chemistry. Second, we eliminate\nlargely redundant variational parameters of physics-inspired ansatzes\nassociated with bath sites based on physical intuition. This is based on the\nfact that a quantum impurity model with a star-like geometry has no direct\nhopping between bath sites. We benchmark the accuracy of these ansatzes for\nboth ground-state energy and dynamic quantities by solving typical quantum\nimpurity models with/without shot noise. The results suggest that we can\nmaintain the accuracy of ground-state energy while we drop the number of\nvariational parameters associated with bath sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat a moment expansion, when combined with the proposed ansatzes, can\ncalculate the imaginary-time Green's functions under the influence of shot\nnoise. This study demonstrates the potential for addressing complex impurity\nmodels in large-scale quantum simulations with fewer variational parameters\nwithout sacrificing accuracy.",

The performance of the one-node MPC is limited by\nsignificant plant-model mismatch, while the three-node formulation better\napproximates real-world dynamics and results in much more effective cost\nreduction and load shifting.

As the core of open-vocabulary understanding, alignment of\nvisual content with the semantics of unbounded text has become the bottleneck\nof this field. To address this challenge, recent works propose to utilize CLIP\nas an additional classifier and aggregate model predictions with CLIP\nclassification results. Despite their remarkable progress, performance of OVS\nmethods in relevant scenarios is still unsatisfactory compared with supervised\ncounterparts. We attribute this to the in-vocabulary embedding and\ndomain-biased CLIP prediction. To this end, we present a Semantic-assisted\nCAlibration Network (SCAN). In SCAN, we incorporate generalized semantic prior\nof CLIP into proposal embedding to avoid collapsing on known categories.\nBesides, a contextual shift strategy is applied to mitigate the lack of global\ncontext and unnatural background noise. With above designs, SCAN achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on all popular open-vocabulary segmentation\nbenchmarks.

            "summary": "Recent gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BH) mergers\nand the stochastic GW background have triggered renewed interest in primordial\nblack holes (PBHs) in the stellar-mass ($\\sim 10 - 100\\ \\rm M_\\odot$) and\nsupermassive regimes ($\\sim 10^7 - 10^{11}\\ \\rm M_\\odot$). Although only a\nsmall fraction ($\\lesssim 1\\%$) of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs is\nrequired to explain such observations, these PBHs may play important roles in\nearly structure/star/galaxy formation. In this chapter, we combine\nsemi-analytical analysis and cosmological simulations to explore the possible\nimpact of PBHs on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, taking into\naccount two (competing) effects of PBHs: acceleration of structure formation\nand gas heating by BH accretion feedback. We find that the impact of\nstellar-mass PBHs (allowed by existing observational constraints) on primordial\nstar formation is likely minor, although they do alter the properties of the\nfirst star-forming halos/clouds and can potentially trigger the formation of\nmassive BHs, while supermassive PBHs serve as seeds of massive structures that\ncan explain the apparent overabundance of massive galaxies in recent\nobservations. Our tentative models and results call for future studies with\nimproved modeling of the interactions between PBHs, particle DM, and baryons to\nbetter understand the impact of PBHs on early star/galaxy/structure formation\nand their imprints in high-redshift observations.",

We focus on mass ratios in the typical range\nfor mixtures of ultracold atoms and reveal a pronounced dependence of the\nresonance widths on the mass ratio: a distinct maximum near the equal-mass\nscenario and a rapid decrease away from it. Moreover, we show that this\nbehaviour is not covered by the analytical formula of Pen'kov~[Phys. Rev. A 60,\n3756 (1999)]. Notably, near the mass ratio for Caesium-Lithium mixtures, we\nobtain nearly vanishing widths of the resonances which validates to treat them\nin the bound state approximation.

We address the design of the optimal signaling mechanism that best\naligns the workplace occupancy with the planner's preference (i.e., maintaining\nsafe capacity limits and operational efficiency at workplace). For various\nforms of planner preferences, we show numerical and analytical proof that\ninterval-based information mechanisms are optimal. These mechanisms partition\nthe continuous domain of the risk parameter into disjoint intervals and\nprovision information based on interval-specific probability distributions over\na finite set of signals. When the planner seeks to achieve an occupancy that\nlies in one of finitely many pre-specified ranges independent of the underlying\nrisk, we provide an optimal mechanism that uses at most two intervals. On the\nother hand, when the preference on the occupancy is risk-dependent, we show\nthat an approximately optimal interval-based mechanism can be computed\nefficiently. We bound the approximation loss for preferences that are expressed\nthrough a Lipschitz continuous function of both occupancy and risk parameter.\nWe provide examples that demonstrate the improvement of proposed signaling\nmechanisms relative to the common benchmarks in information provision.

            "summary": "Cross-modality registration between 2D images from cameras and 3D point\nclouds from LiDARs is a crucial task in computer vision and robotic. Previous\nmethods estimate 2D-3D correspondences by matching point and pixel patterns\nlearned by neural networks, and use Perspective-n-Points (PnP) to estimate\nrigid transformation during post-processing. However, these methods struggle to\nmap points and pixels to a shared latent space robustly since points and pixels\nhave very different characteristics with patterns learned in different manners\n(MLP and CNN), and they also fail to construct supervision directly on the\ntransformation since the PnP is non-differentiable, which leads to unstable\nregistration results. To address these problems, we propose to learn a\nstructured cross-modality latent space to represent pixel features and 3D\nfeatures via a differentiable probabilistic PnP solver. Specifically, we design\na triplet network to learn VoxelPoint-to-Pixel matching, where we represent 3D\nelements using both voxels and points to learn the cross-modality latent space\nwith pixels. We design both the voxel and pixel branch based on CNNs to operate\nconvolutions on voxels/pixels represented in grids, and integrate an additional\npoint branch to regain the information lost during voxelization. We train our\nframework end-to-end by imposing supervisions directly on the predicted pose\ndistribution with a probabilistic PnP solver. To explore distinctive patterns\nof cross-modality features, we design a novel loss with adaptive-weighted\noptimization for cross-modality feature description.

Therefore, this paper\nproposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL)\nto formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory\nrepresentations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a\nweighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility\ninteractions over both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly\nencoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion) to learn entangled spatial-temporal\ndependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and\ntime information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility\nregularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories.\nTested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL\noutperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal\ndistributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal\ncorrelations. We also explore how spatial-temporal features presented in latent\nspace, validating that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns.

            "summary": "Modeling, identification, drive, and current control loop of a\nlimited-rotation actuator with magnetic restoration is studied. Nonlinear and\nlinearized electromechanical models are developed for the design of the drive\nas well as small and large signal controls of the actuator. To get higher\naccuracy and an efficient design, the eddy-currents in the laminations and the\nmagnet are modeled by analytically solving the diffusion equation from which a\nlumped-element circuit is derived for system-level analyses like control system\ndesign. The impact of the pre-sliding friction is studied as well. Finite\nelement analysis is also employed. The actuator is prototyped and the\nidentification of the model is carried out. A close agreement is observed\nbetween the results obtained from the model, FEM and experiment. Its\nsuperiority over previous approaches are shown. Then, an op-amp-based drive is\nproposed and designed. Afterward, a very accurate model for the drive and the\ncurrent loop is developed to be used as a simulation platform, while its\nsimplified version is obtained for design purposes. Part II of the paper is on\nthe evaluations and trade-offs of the current control as well as linear and\nnonlinear position control.",

            "summary": "The observational data of high redshift galaxies become increasingly\nabundant, especially since the operation of the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST), which allows us to verify and optimize the galaxy formation model at\nhigh redshifts. In this work, we investigate the merging history of massive\ngalaxies at $3 < z < 6$ using a well-developed semi-analytic galaxy formation\ncatalogue. We find that the major merger rate increases with redshift up to 3\nand then flattens. The fraction of wet mergers, during which the sum of the\ncold gas mass is higher than the sum of the stellar mass in two merging\ngalaxies, also increases from $\\sim$ 34\\% at $z = 0$ to 96\\% at $z = 3$.\nInterestingly, almost all major mergers are wet at $z > 3$ . This can be\nattributed to the high fraction ($> 50\\%$) of cold gas at $z > 3$. In addition,\nwe study some special systems of massive merging galaxies at $3 < z < 6$,\nincluding the massive gas-rich major merging systems and extreme dense\nproto-clusters, and investigate the supermassive black hole-dark matter halo\nmass relation and dual AGNs. We find that the galaxy formation model reproduces\nthe incidence of those observed massive galaxies, but fails to reproduce the\nrelation between the supermassive black hole mass and the dark matter halo mass\nat $z \\sim 6$. The latter requires more careful estimates of the supermassive\nblack hole masses observationally. Otherwise, it could suggest modifications of\nthe modeling of the supermassive black hole growth at high redshifts.",

To address these issues, we propose the first\nmethod for text-conditioned human motion generation in the frequency domain of\nmotions. We develop a network encoder that converts the motion space into a\ncompact yet expressive parameterized phase space with high-frequency details\nencoded, capturing the local periodicity of motions in time and space with high\naccuracy. We also introduce a conditional diffusion model for predicting\nperiodic motion parameters based on text descriptions and a start pose,\nefficiently achieving smooth transitions between motion sequences associated\nwith different text descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms current methods in generating a broader variety of high-quality\nmotions, and synthesizing long sequences with natural transitions.",

In this work, we introduce a latent inference budget\nmodel (L-IBM) that models agents' computational constraints explicitly, via a\nlatent variable (inferred jointly with a model of agents' goals) that controls\nthe runtime of an iterative inference algorithm. L-IBMs make it possible to\nlearn agent models using data from diverse populations of suboptimal actors. In\nthree modeling tasks -- inferring navigation goals from routes, inferring\ncommunicative intents from human utterances, and predicting next moves in human\nchess games -- we show that L-IBMs match or outperform Boltzmann models of\ndecision-making under uncertainty. Inferred inference budgets are themselves\nmeaningful, efficient to compute, and correlated with measures of player skill,\npartner skill and task difficulty.",

The ability to precisely predict protein thermostability\nis pivotal for various subfields and applications in biochemistry, including\ndrug development, protein evolution analysis, and enzyme synthesis. Despite the\nproposition of multiple methodologies aimed at addressing this issue, few\napproaches have successfully achieved optimal performance coupled with high\ncomputational efficiency. Two principal hurdles contribute to the existing\nchallenges in this domain. The first is the complexity of extracting and\naggregating sufficiently representative features from proteins. The second\nrefers to the limited availability of experimental data for protein mutation\nanalysis, further complicating the comprehensive evaluation of model\nperformance on unseen data samples. With the advent of Large Language\nModels(LLM), such as the ESM models in protein research, profound\ninterpretation of protein features is now accessibly aided by enormous training\ndata. Therefore, LLMs are indeed to facilitate a wide range of protein\nresearch. In our study, we introduce an ESM-assisted efficient approach that\nintegrates protein sequence and structural features to predict the\nthermostability changes in protein upon single-point mutations.

PartDistill consists of a\nteacher network that uses a VLM to make 2D predictions and a student network\nthat learns from the 2D predictions while extracting geometrical features from\nmultiple 3D shapes to carry out 3D part segmentation. A bi-directional\ndistillation, including forward and backward distillations, is carried out\nwithin the framework, where the former forward distills the 2D predictions to\nthe student network, and the latter improves the quality of the 2D predictions,\nwhich subsequently enhances the final 3D part segmentation. Moreover,\nPartDistill can exploit generative models that facilitate effortless 3D shape\ncreation for generating knowledge sources to be distilled.

            "summary": "Joint embedding (JE) architectures have emerged as a promising avenue for\nacquiring transferable data representations. A key obstacle to using JE\nmethods, however, is the inherent challenge of evaluating learned\nrepresentations without access to a downstream task, and an annotated dataset.\nWithout efficient and reliable evaluation, it is difficult to iterate on\narchitectural and training choices for JE methods. In this paper, we introduce\nLiDAR (Linear Discriminant Analysis Rank), a metric designed to measure the\nquality of representations within JE architectures. Our metric addresses\nseveral shortcomings of recent approaches based on feature covariance rank by\ndiscriminating between informative and uninformative features. In essence,\nLiDAR quantifies the rank of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) matrix\nassociated with the surrogate SSL task -- a measure that intuitively captures\nthe information content as it pertains to solving the SSL task. We empirically\ndemonstrate that LiDAR significantly surpasses naive rank based approaches in\nits predictive power of optimal hyperparameters. Our proposed criterion\npresents a more robust and intuitive means of assessing the quality of\nrepresentations within JE architectures, which we hope facilitates broader\nadoption of these powerful techniques in various domains.",

            "summary": "We argue that time series analysis is fundamentally different in nature to\neither vision or natural language processing with respect to the forms of\nmeaningful self-supervised learning tasks that can be defined. Motivated by\nthis insight, we introduce a novel approach called \\textit{Series2Vec} for\nself-supervised representation learning. Unlike other self-supervised methods\nin time series, which carry the risk of positive sample variants being less\nsimilar to the anchor sample than series in the negative set, Series2Vec is\ntrained to predict the similarity between two series in both temporal and\nspectral domains through a self-supervised task. Series2Vec relies primarily on\nthe consistency of the unsupervised similarity step, rather than the intrinsic\nquality of the similarity measurement, without the need for hand-crafted data\naugmentation. To further enforce the network to learn similar representations\nfor similar time series, we propose a novel approach that applies\norder-invariant attention to each representation within the batch during\ntraining. Our evaluation of Series2Vec on nine large real-world datasets, along\nwith the UCR/UEA archive, shows enhanced performance compared to current\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised techniques for time series. Additionally, our\nextensive experiments show that Series2Vec performs comparably with fully\nsupervised training and offers high efficiency in datasets with limited-labeled\ndata. Finally, we show that the fusion of Series2Vec with other representation\nlearning models leads to enhanced performance for time series classification.\nCode and models are open-source at\n\\url{https://github.com/Navidfoumani/Series2Vec.}",

The analytical solutions of wave frequency and growth rate are\nderived when the wave speed is larger than the ion thermal speed but smaller\nthan the electron thermal speed. The unstable drift mode is found to have a\nlower limit of wavenumber due to the suprathermal electrons, which does not\nexist in Maxwellian plasmas. The population of suprathermal ions affects the\ncritical wavenumber for instability but does not determine its emergence.\nMoreover, the wave frequency, growth rate, and critical wavenumber are\nnumerically solved from the dispersion relation.

Until recently, this goal was thought to be out of reach\nfor realistic continuum-mechanical simulations of musculoskeletal systems, due\nto prohibitive computational cost. Within this work we use a sparse grid\nsurrogate to capture the surface deformation of the m.~biceps brachii in order\nto train a deep learning model, used for real-time visualisation of the same\nmuscle. Both these surrogate models take 5 muscle activation levels as input\nand output Cartesian coordinate vectors for each mesh node on the muscle's\nsurface. Thus, the neural network architecture features a significantly lower\ninput than output dimension. 5 muscle activation levels were sufficient to\nachieve an average error of 0.97 +/- 0.16 mm, or 0.57 +/- 0.10 % for the 2809\nmesh node positions of the biceps. The model achieved evaluation times of 9.88\nms per predicted deformation state on CPU only and 3.48 ms with GPU-support,\nleading to theoretical frame rates of 101 fps and 287 fps respectively. Deep\nlearning surrogates thus provide a way to make continuum-mechanical simulations\naccessible for visual real-time applications.",

Ray tracing (RT)-based methods have been widely used for many\nyears, but they require significant computational effort that may become\nprohibitive with the increased network densification and/or use of higher\nfrequencies in B5G/6G systems. In this paper, we propose a data-driven,\nmodel-free pathloss map prediction (PMP) method, called PMNet. PMNet uses a\nsupervised learning approach: it is trained on a limited amount of RT (or\nchannel measurement) data and map data. Once trained, PMNet can predict\npathloss over location with high accuracy (an RMSE level of $10^{-2}$) in a few\nmilliseconds. We further extend PMNet by employing transfer learning (TL). TL\nallows PMNet to learn a new network scenario quickly (x5.6 faster training) and\nefficiently (using x4.5 less data) by transferring knowledge from a pre-trained\nmodel, while retaining accuracy. Our results demonstrate that PMNet is a\nscalable and generalizable ML-based PMP method, showing its potential to be\nused in several network optimization applications.",

            "summary": "We study stochastic motion under a nonlinear frictional force that levels off\nwith increasing velocity. Specifically, our frictional force is of the\nso-called Coulomb-tanh type. At small speed, it increases approximately\nlinearly with velocity, while at large speed it approaches a constant\nmagnitude, similarly to solid (dry, Coulomb) friction. In one spatial\ndimension, a formal analogy between the associated Fokker-Planck equation and\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation for a quantum-mechanical oscillator in a nonharmonic\nP\\\"oschl-Teller potential is revealed. Then, the stationary velocity statistics\ncan be treated analytically. From such analytical considerations, we determine\nassociated diffusion coefficients, which we confirm by agent-based simulations.\nMoreover, from such simulations and from numerically solving the associated\nFokker-Planck equation, we find that the spatial distribution function,\nstarting from an initial Gaussian shape, develops tails that appear exponential\nat intermediate time scales. At small magnitudes of stochastic driving, the\nvelocity distribution resembles the case of linear friction, while at large\nmagnitudes it rather approaches the case of solid (dry, Coulomb) friction. The\nsame is true for diffusion coefficients. In a certain sense, thus interpolating\nbetween the two extreme cases of linear friction and solid (dry, Coulomb)\nfriction, our approach should be useful to describe several cases of practical\nrelevance. For instance, a reduced increase in friction with increasing\nrelative speed is typical of shear-thinning behavior. Therefore, driven motion\nin shear-thinning environments is one specific example to which our description\nmay be applied.",

            "summary": "Due to the availability of only a few labeled instances for the novel target\nprediction task and the significant domain shift between the well annotated\nsource domain and the target domain, cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL)\ninduces a very challenging adaptation problem. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple Adaptive Weighted Co-Learning (AWCoL) method to address the CDFSL\nchallenge by adapting two independently trained source prototypical\nclassification models to the target task in a weighted co-learning manner. The\nproposed method deploys a weighted moving average prediction strategy to\ngenerate probabilistic predictions from each model, and then conducts adaptive\nco-learning by jointly fine-tuning the two models in an alternating manner\nbased on the pseudo-labels and instance weights produced from the predictions.\nMoreover, a negative pseudo-labeling regularizer is further deployed to improve\nthe fine-tuning process by penalizing false predictions. Comprehensive\nexperiments are conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and the empirical\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method produces state-of-the-art CDFSL\nperformance.",

In this work, we address the\nchallenging problem of generating synchronized object motion and human motion\nguided by language descriptions in 3D scenes. We propose Controllable\nHuman-Object Interaction Synthesis (CHOIS), an approach that generates object\nmotion and human motion simultaneously using a conditional diffusion model\ngiven a language description, initial object and human states, and sparse\nobject waypoints. While language descriptions inform style and intent,\nwaypoints ground the motion in the scene and can be effectively extracted using\nhigh-level planning methods. Naively applying a diffusion model fails to\npredict object motion aligned with the input waypoints and cannot ensure the\nrealism of interactions that require precise hand-object contact and\nappropriate contact grounded by the floor. To overcome these problems, we\nintroduce an object geometry loss as additional supervision to improve the\nmatching between generated object motion and input object waypoints. In\naddition, we design guidance terms to enforce contact constraints during the\nsampling process of the trained diffusion model.",

This often requires maximizing the likelihood of a\nsymbolic constraint w.r.t the neural network's output distribution. Such output\ndistributions are typically assumed to be fully-factorized. This limits the\napplicability of neuro-symbolic learning to the more expressive autoregressive\ndistributions, e.g., transformers. Under such distributions, computing the\nlikelihood of even simple constraints is #P-hard. Instead of attempting to\nenforce the constraint on the entire output distribution, we propose to do so\non a random, local approximation thereof. More precisely, we optimize the\nlikelihood of the constraint under a pseudolikelihood-based approximation\ncentered around a model sample. Our approximation is factorized, allowing the\nreuse of solutions to sub-problems, a main tenet for efficiently computing\nneuro-symbolic losses. Moreover, it is a local, high-fidelity approximation of\nthe likelihood, exhibiting low entropy and KL-divergence around the model\nsample. We evaluate our approach on Sudoku and shortest-path prediction cast as\nautoregressive generation, and observe that we greatly improve upon the base\nmodel's ability to predict logically-consistent outputs. We also evaluate on\nthe task of detoxifying large language models.

Previous work has tested the\naccuracy of this approach with N-body simulations, but generally on idealised\nmock galaxy surveys. However, systematic biases may arise solely due to survey\nselection effects such as flux-limited samples, edge-effects, and complications\ndue to the obscuration of the Galactic plane. In this work, we explore the\nimpact of each of these effects independently and simultaneously, using the\nsemi-analytic models from numerical simulations to generate mock catalogues\nthat mimic the 2M++ density field. We find the reconstruction and analysis\nmethods used for our 2M++ mocks produce a value of fsigma_8 that is biased high\nby a factor 1.04 \\pm 0.01 compared to the true value. Moreover, a cosmic volume\nmatching that of 2M++ has a cosmic variance uncertainty in fsigma_8 of ~5%. The\nsystematic bias is a function of distance: it is unbiased close to the origin\nbut is biased slightly high for distances in the range 100-180 Mpc/h.\nCorrecting for this small bias, we find the linear fsigma_8 = 0.362 \\pm 0.023.\nThe predicted peculiar velocities from 2M++ have an error of 170 km/s that\nslowly increases with distance, exceeding 200 km/s only at distances of 180-200\nMpc/h.

Under the assumption that cost is given by an utterance's\nlength, he supported this claim by showing that words' lengths are inversely\ncorrelated with their frequencies. Communicative cost, however, can be\noperationalized in different ways. Piantadosi et al. (2011) claim that cost\nshould be measured as the distance between an utterance's information rate and\nchannel capacity, which we dub the channel capacity hypothesis (CCH) here.\nFollowing this logic, they then proposed that a word's length should be\nproportional to the expected value of its surprisal (negative log-probability\nin context). In this work, we show that Piantadosi et al.'s derivation does not\nminimize CCH's cost, but rather a lower bound, which we term CCH-lower. We\npropose a novel derivation, suggesting an improved way to minimize CCH's cost.\nUnder this method, we find that a language's word lengths should instead be\nproportional to the surprisal's expectation plus its variance-to-mean ratio.\nExperimentally, we compare these three communicative cost functions: Zipf's,\nCCH-lower , and CCH. Across 13 languages and several experimental settings, we\nfind that length is better predicted by frequency than either of the other\nhypotheses. In fact, when surprisal's expectation, or expectation plus\nvariance-to-mean ratio, is estimated using better language models, it leads to\nworse word length predictions.

A challenge is that the human decision\ncensors the outcome data: we only observe test outcomes for patients doctors\nhistorically tested. Untested patients, for whom outcomes are unobserved, may\ndiffer from tested patients along observed and unobserved dimensions. We\npropose a Bayesian model class which captures this setting. The purpose of the\nmodel is to accurately estimate risk for both tested and untested patients.\nEstimating this model is challenging due to the wide range of possibilities for\nuntested patients. To address this, we propose two domain constraints which are\nplausible in health settings: a prevalence constraint, where the overall\ndisease prevalence is known, and an expertise constraint, where the human\ndecision-maker deviates from purely risk-based decision-making only along a\nconstrained feature set. We show theoretically and on synthetic data that\ndomain constraints improve parameter inference. We apply our model to a case\nstudy of cancer risk prediction, showing that the model's inferred risk\npredicts cancer diagnoses, its inferred testing policy captures known public\nhealth policies, and it can identify suboptimalities in test allocation.

Over time, the dynamics of such flows\nevolve towards a finite-dimensional invariant manifold. Using only data from\ndirect numerical simulations, in the present work we identify the manifold and\ndetermine evolution equations for the dynamics on it. We use an advanced\nautoencoder framework to automatically estimate the intrinsic dimension of the\nmanifold and provide an orthogonal coordinate system. Then, we learn the\ndynamics by determining an equation on the manifold by using both a function\nspace approach (approximating the Koopman operator) and a state space approach\n(approximating the vector field on the manifold). We apply this method to exact\ncoherent states for Kolmogorov flow and minimal flow unit pipe flow. Fully\nresolved simulations for these cases require O(103) and O(105) degrees of\nfreedom respectively, and we build models with two or three degrees of freedom\nthat faithfully capture the dynamics of these flows.

We developed and implemented a\nmultiple-input, single-output (MISO) framework comprising two deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) models, predicting key process performance indicators. These\nmodels were then integrated into an optimization framework, leveraging particle\nswarm optimization (PSO) and statistical analysis to generate a comprehensive\nPareto front representation. This approach delineated feasible operational\nregions (FORs) and highlighted the spectrum of optimal decision-making\nscenarios. A key aspect of our methodology was the evaluation of optimization\neffectiveness. This was accomplished by testing decision variables derived from\nthe Pareto front against a phenomenological model, affirming the surrogate\nmodels reliability. Subsequently, the study delved into analyzing the feasible\noperational domains of these decision variables. A detailed correlation map was\nconstructed to elucidate the interplay between these variables, thereby\nuncovering the most impactful factors influencing process behavior. The study\noffers a practical, insightful operational map that aids operators in\npinpointing the optimal process location and prioritizing specific operational\ngoals.",

Unlike 3D generative methods\nthat explicitly condition the diffusion model on camera pose or multi-view\ninformation, our diffusion model is conditioned only on a single masked 2D\nimage. Nevertheless, we show that this 2D diffusion model can still serve as a\ngenerative prior in a 3D multi-view reconstruction problem where we optimize a\nNeRF using a combination of score distillation sampling and NeRF reconstruction\nlosses. Predicted depth is used as additional supervision to encourage accurate\ngeometry. We compare our approach to 3D inpainting methods that focus on object\nremoval. Because our method can generate content to fill any 3D masked region,\nwe additionally demonstrate 3D object completion, 3D object replacement, and 3D\nscene completion.",

Here, the sample\ncomplexity for estimating the worst-case performance gap across groups (e.g.,\nthe largest difference in error rates) increases exponentially with the number\nof group-denoting sensitive attributes.

By allowing a small probabilistic slack on the groups over which a\nmodel has approximately equal performance, we show that the sample complexity\nrequired for discovering performance violations is reduced exponentially to be\nat most upper bounded by the square root of the number of groups. As a\nbyproduct of our analysis, when the groups are weighted by a specific prior\ndistribution, we show that R\\'enyi entropy of order $2/3$ of the prior\ndistribution captures the sample complexity of the proposed CVaR test\nalgorithm.

This resonance, however, turns out to be a bulk glueball mixing with\nthe flux tube excitations rather than a genuine string worldsheet state. In\ngeneral $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories (dual to clock spin models), we observe a\ncontinuous phase transition for $N \\geq 4$, while for $N > 5$ it is governed by\nthe $O(2)$ universality class.

We\ninvestigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet\n(dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical\nsignatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively,\nthat go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits\ntransport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary\ncircuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and\nscattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue\nthat the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these\nsolvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can\nserve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are\nsensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived\nquasiparticles or dual-unitarity.",

            "summary": "Generalized Wigner Crystal (GWC) is a novel quantum phase of matter driven by\nfurther-range interaction at fractional fillings of a lattice. The role of\nfurther range interaction as the driver for the incompressible state is akin to\nWigner crystal. On the other hand, the significant role of commensurate filling\nis akin to the Mott insulator. Recent progress in simulator platforms presents\nunprecedented opportunities to investigate quantum melting in the strongly\ninteracting regime through synergy between theory and experiments. However, the\nearlier theory literature presents diverging predictions. We study the quantum\nfreezing of GWC through large-scale density matrix renormalization group\nsimulations of a triangular lattice extended Hubbard model. We find a single\nfirst-order phase transition between the Fermi liquid and the\n$\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ GWC state. The GWC state shows long-range\nantiferromagnetic $120^\\circ$ N{\\'e}el order. Our results present the simplest\nanswers to the question of the quantum phase transition into the GWC phase and\nthe properties of the GWC phase.",

Under this setting, the model can perceive tasks from prompts\nand accomplish them without any extra task-specific head predictions or model\nfine-tuning. However, Skeleton sequence modeling via in-context learning\nremains unexplored. Directly applying existing in-context models from other\nareas onto skeleton sequences fails due to the inter-frame and cross-task pose\nsimilarity that makes it outstandingly hard to perceive the task correctly from\na subtle context. To address this challenge, we propose Skeleton-in-Context\n(SiC), an effective framework for in-context skeleton sequence modeling. Our\nSiC is able to handle multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously after a\nsingle training process and accomplish each task from context according to the\ngiven prompt. It can further generalize to new, unseen tasks according to\ncustomized prompts. To facilitate context perception, we additionally propose a\ntask-unified prompt, which adaptively learns tasks of different natures, such\nas partial joint-level generation, sequence-level prediction, or 2D-to-3D\nmotion prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our SiC on multiple tasks, including motion prediction, pose\nestimation, joint completion, and future pose estimation. We also evaluate its\ngeneralization capability on unseen tasks such as motion-in-between. These\nexperiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-task\nperformance and even outperforms single-task methods on certain tasks.",

They are\nassociated with fascinating dynamics emerging by the ubiquitous phenomenon of\nmodulation instability. In this work, we consider the discrete nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with linear gain and nonlinear loss. For the infinite\nlattice supplemented with nonzero boundary conditions which describe solutions\ndecaying on the top of a finite background, we give a rigorous proof that for\nthe corresponding initial-boundary value problem, solutions exist for any\ninitial condition, if and only if, the amplitude of the background has a\nprecise value $A_*$ defined by the gain-loss parameters. We argue that this\nessential property of this infinite lattice can't be captured by finite lattice\napproximations of the problem. Commonly, such approximations are defined by\nlattices with periodic boundary conditions or as it is shown herein, by a\nmodified problem closed with Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the finite\ndimensional dynamical system defined by the periodic lattice, the dynamics for\nall initial conditions are captured by a global attractor. Analytical arguments\ncorroborated by numerical simulations show that the global attractor is\ntrivial, defined by a plane wave of amplitude $A_*$. Thus, any instability\neffects or localized phenomena simulated by the finite system can be only\ntransient prior the convergence to this trivial attractor. Aiming to simulate\nthe dynamics of the infinite lattice as accurately as possible, we study the\ndynamics of localized initial conditions on the constant background and\ninvestigate the potential impact of the global asymptotic stability of the\nbackground with amplitude $A_*$ in the long-time evolution of the system.",

We distinctly characterize the\nautonomous driving process as a sequential combination of perception,\nprediction, and reasoning steps, and the question-answer pairs are\nautomatically collected from a diverse range of open-source outdoor driving\ndatasets, including nuScenes, Waymo and ONCE. Moreover, we introduce a novel\naggregated evaluation metric to assess chain-based reasoning performance in\nautonomous systems, addressing the semantic ambiguities of existing metrics\nsuch as BLEU and CIDEr. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conduct experiments\nto assess various existing VLMs, revealing insights into their reasoning\ncapabilities.

This approach assumes\nthat the results of these simplified are faithful to the original model. Here,\nwe illustrate an important caveat to this assumption: even if the simplified\nrepresentations can accurately approximate the full model on the training set,\nthey may fail to accurately capture the model's behavior out of distribution --\nthe understanding developed from simplified representations may be an illusion.\nWe illustrate this by training Transformer models on controlled datasets with\nsystematic generalization splits. First, we train models on the Dyck\nbalanced-parenthesis languages. We simplify these models using tools like\ndimensionality reduction and clustering, and then explicitly test how these\nsimplified proxies match the behavior of the original model on various\nout-of-distribution test sets. We find that the simplified proxies are\ngenerally less faithful out of distribution. In cases where the original model\ngeneralizes to novel structures or deeper depths, the simplified versions may\nfail, or generalize better. This finding holds even if the simplified\nrepresentations do not directly depend on the training distribution. Next, we\nstudy a more naturalistic task: predicting the next character in a dataset of\ncomputer code. We find similar generalization gaps between the original model\nand simplified proxies, and conduct further analysis to investigate which\naspects of the code completion task are associated with the largest gaps.\nTogether, our results raise questions about the extent to which mechanistic\ninterpretations derived using tools like SVD can reliably predict what a model\nwill do in novel situations.",

            "summary": "This paper introduces a methodology designed to augment the inverse design\noptimization process in scenarios constrained by limited compute, through the\nstrategic synergy of multi-fidelity evaluations, machine learning models, and\noptimization algorithms. The proposed methodology is analyzed on two distinct\nengineering inverse design problems: airfoil inverse design and the scalar\nfield reconstruction problem. It leverages a machine learning model trained\nwith low-fidelity simulation data, in each optimization cycle, thereby\nproficiently predicting a target variable and discerning whether a\nhigh-fidelity simulation is necessitated, which notably conserves computational\nresources. Additionally, the machine learning model is strategically deployed\nprior to optimization to reduce the search space, thereby further accelerating\nconvergence toward the optimal solution. The methodology has been employed to\nenhance two optimization algorithms, namely Differential Evolution and Particle\nSwarm Optimization. Comparative analyses illustrate performance improvements\nacross both algorithms. Notably, this method is adeptly adaptable across any\ninverse design application, facilitating a harmonious synergy between a\nrepresentative low-fidelity machine learning model, and high-fidelity\nsimulation, and can be seamlessly applied across any variety of\npopulation-based optimization algorithms.",

            "summary": "Inflation, a period of exponential expansion in the early Universe, is\nconsidered an important part of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model,\nand plays a crucial role in explaining a wide range of current observations.\nThe standard inflationary model predicts a primordial spectrum of fluctuations\nthat is nearly scale-independent, fitting remarkably well the latest\nobservational data. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing discussion surrounding\nthe transition from an initial homogeneous and isotropic quantum state,\ncharacterizing the matter fields during inflation, to a classical\ninhomogeneous/anisotropic one, which gives rise to large-scale structure in the\nUniverse. To tackle this issue, in the present work we explore an inflationary\nscenario where quantum ``collapse'' (or reduction) occurs naturally during the\nevolution of the system; this model is inspired in the so called Continuous\nSpontaneous Localization (CSL) model. Our present work builds upon previous\nresults by considering the primordial power spectrum up to the second order in\nthe Hubble Flow Functions, where we perform an estimation of the model free\nparameters. By validating the predictions of the model against observational\ndata, we investigate whether this second-order calculation can explain the\nslight departure from the power law observed in the scalar spectral running\nindex. We hope this research contributes to the understanding of the\nquantum-to-classical transition and its implications for cosmology.",

This raises\na red flag in the use of GPT models for certain general tasks such as\nconstructing knowledge graphs, considering their adherence to this symmetric\nprinciple. In our study, we examined a bidirectional LLM, BERT, and found that\nit is immune to the reversal curse. Driven by ongoing efforts to construct\nbiomedical knowledge graphs with LLMs, we also embarked on evaluating more\ncomplex but essential deductive reasoning capabilities. This process included\nfirst training encoder and decoder language models to master the intersection\n($\\cap$) and union ($\\cup$) operations on two sets and then moving on to assess\ntheir capability to infer different combinations of union ($\\cup$) and\nintersection ($\\cap$) operations on three newly created sets. The findings\nshowed that while both encoder and decoder language models, trained for tasks\ninvolving two sets (union/intersection), were proficient in such scenarios,\nthey encountered difficulties when dealing with operations that included three\nsets (various combinations of union and intersection). Our research highlights\nthe distinct characteristics of encoder and decoder models in simple and\ncomplex logical reasoning.

            "summary": "Using integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA, we study the resolved\nmicrostructures in a shocked region in Criss Cross Nebula (CCN), with an\nunprecedentedly high resolution of $\\lesssim$1000 AU. We measure surface\nbrightness maps for 34 emission lines, which can be broadly divided into three\ncategories: (1) the [OIII] $\\lambda$5007-like group including seven\nhigh-ionization lines and two [OII] auroral lines which uniformly present a\nremarkable lane structure, (2) the H$\\alpha$ $\\lambda$6563-like group including\n23 low-ionization or recombination lines which present a clump-like structure,\nand (3) [OII] $\\lambda$3726 and [OII] $\\lambda$3729 showing high densities at\nboth the [OIII] $\\lambda$5007 lane and the H$\\alpha$ clump. We use these\nmeasurements to constrain resolved shock models implemented in MAPPINGS V. We\nfind our data can be reasonably well-fitted by a model which includes a\nplane-parallel shock with a velocity of $133\\pm5$ km/s, plus an isotropic\ntwo-dimensional Gaussian component which is likely another clump of gas ionized\nby photons from the shocked region, and a constant background. We compare the\nelectron density and temperature profiles as predicted by our model with those\ncalculated using observed emission line ratios. We find different line ratios\nto provide inconsistent temperature maps, and the discrepancies can be\nattributed to observational effects caused by limited spatial resolution and\nprojection of the shock geometry, as well as contamination of the additional\nGaussian component. Implications on shock properties and perspectives on future\nIFS-based studies of CCN are discussed.",

FEA is used for predicting the strain\nconfiguration throughout the active region induced by the curving procedure of\nthe device. NEGF is used to calculate the vertical hole mobility for a select\nset of strain configurations, from which the internal quantum efficiency of the\ndevice is approximated to predict performance under strained conditions. Then\nthis data set is used to train a GP model that maps the quantum efficiency QE\npredictions onto the spatial coordinates of the curved device, based on the\nstrain configuration predicted using FEA.

            "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-motion generation using diffusion and\nautoregressive models have shown promising results. However, these models often\nsuffer from a trade-off between real-time performance, high fidelity, and\nmotion editability. To address this gap, we introduce MMM, a novel yet simple\nmotion generation paradigm based on Masked Motion Model. MMM consists of two\nkey components: (1) a motion tokenizer that transforms 3D human motion into a\nsequence of discrete tokens in latent space, and (2) a conditional masked\nmotion transformer that learns to predict randomly masked motion tokens,\nconditioned on the pre-computed text tokens. By attending to motion and text\ntokens in all directions, MMM explicitly captures inherent dependency among\nmotion tokens and semantic mapping between motion and text tokens. During\ninference, this allows parallel and iterative decoding of multiple motion\ntokens that are highly consistent with fine-grained text descriptions,\ntherefore simultaneously achieving high-fidelity and high-speed motion\ngeneration. In addition, MMM has innate motion editability. By simply placing\nmask tokens in the place that needs editing, MMM automatically fills the gaps\nwhile guaranteeing smooth transitions between editing and non-editing parts.\nExtensive experiments on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMM\nsurpasses current leading methods in generating high-quality motion (evidenced\nby superior FID scores of 0.08 and 0.429), while offering advanced editing\nfeatures such as body-part modification, motion in-betweening, and the\nsynthesis of long motion sequences. In addition, MMM is two orders of magnitude\nfaster on a single mid-range GPU than editable motion diffusion models. Our\nproject page is available at \\url{https://exitudio.github.io/MMM-page}.",

To realize this mechanism, we\nconstruct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally\ncoupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such\nnonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations -- so-called non-Hermitian skin\nwaves, which are typically unstable -- into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We\nrationalize our observations by introducing non-reciprocal generalizations of\nthe Frenkel-Kontorova and sine-Gordon models, and use the latter to predict the\nterminal velocity of the (anti)solitons and determine their stability. Finally,\nwe harness non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active\nwaveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information.\nMore broadly, our findings suggest that non-reciprocal driving is a robust\nmechanism to steer nonlinear waves and could be generalized beyond mechanics,\ne.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter.",

This paper introduces a sophisticated encoder-decoder\nframework, developed to address visual grounding in AVs.Our Context-Aware\nVisual Grounding (CAVG) model is an advanced system that integrates five core\nencoders-Text, Image, Context, and Cross-Modal-with a Multimodal decoder. This\nintegration enables the CAVG model to adeptly capture contextual semantics and\nto learn human emotional features, augmented by state-of-the-art Large Language\nModels (LLMs) including GPT-4. The architecture of CAVG is reinforced by the\nimplementation of multi-head cross-modal attention mechanisms and a\nRegion-Specific Dynamic (RSD) layer for attention modulation. This\narchitectural design enables the model to efficiently process and interpret a\nrange of cross-modal inputs, yielding a comprehensive understanding of the\ncorrelation between verbal commands and corresponding visual scenes. Empirical\nevaluations on the Talk2Car dataset, a real-world benchmark, demonstrate that\nCAVG establishes new standards in prediction accuracy and operational\nefficiency. Notably, the model exhibits exceptional performance even with\nlimited training data, ranging from 50% to 75% of the full dataset. This\nfeature highlights its effectiveness and potential for deployment in practical\nAV applications. Moreover, CAVG has shown remarkable robustness and\nadaptability in challenging scenarios, including long-text command\ninterpretation, low-light conditions, ambiguous command contexts, inclement\nweather conditions, and densely populated urban environments.

            "summary": "Sample selection models represent a common methodology for correcting bias\ninduced by data missing not at random. It is well known that these models are\nnot empirically identifiable without exclusion restrictions. In other words,\nsome variables predictive of missingness do not affect the outcome model of\ninterest. The drive to establish this requirement often leads to the inclusion\nof irrelevant variables in the model. A recent proposal uses adaptive LASSO to\ncircumvent this problem, but its performance depends on the so-called\ncovariance assumption, which can be violated in small to moderate samples.\nAdditionally, there are no tools yet for post-selection inference for this\nmodel. To address these challenges, we propose two families of spike-and-slab\npriors to conduct Bayesian variable selection in sample selection models. These\nprior structures allow for constructing a Gibbs sampler with tractable\nconditionals, which is scalable to the dimensions of practical interest. We\nillustrate the performance of the proposed methodology through a simulation\nstudy and present a comparison against adaptive LASSO and stepwise selection.\nWe also provide two applications using publicly available real data.

Top-quark jets reconstructed with the anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm with a radius\nparameter $R=1.0$ are selected in top-quark pair ($t\\bar{t}$) events where one\ntop quark decays semileptonically and the other hadronically, or where both top\nquarks decay hadronically. The top-quark jets are required to have transverse\nmomentum $p_\\mathrm{T} > 350$ GeV, yielding large samples of data events with\njet $p_\\mathrm{T}$ values between 350 and 600 GeV. One- and two-dimensional\ndifferential cross-sections for eight substructure variables, defined using\nonly the charged components of the jets, are measured in a particle-level phase\nspace by correcting for the smearing and acceptance effects induced by the\ndetector. The differential cross-sections are compared with the predictions of\nseveral Monte Carlo simulations in which top-quark pair-production quantum\nchromodynamic matrix-element calculations at next-to-leading-order precision in\nthe strong coupling constant $\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}$ are passed to leading-order\nparton shower and hadronization generators. The Monte Carlo predictions for\nmeasures of the broadness, and also the two-body structure, of the top-quark\njets are found to be in good agreement with the measurements, while variables\nsensitive to the three-body structure of the top-quark jets exhibit some\ntension with the measured distributions.",

However, when\nmultirotors fly in close vertical proximity to each other, the propeller\ndownwash from the vehicles can have a destabilising effect on each other.\nUnfortunately, even in a homogeneous team, an accurate model of downwash forces\nfrom one vehicle is unlikely to be sufficient for predicting aggregate forces\nfrom multiple vehicles in formation.\n  In this work, we model the interaction patterns produced by one or more\nvehicles flying in close proximity to an ego-vehicle. We first present an\nexperimental test rig designed to capture 6-DOF exogenic forces acting on a\nmultirotor frame. We then study and characterize these measured forces as a\nfunction of the relative states of two multirotors flying various patterns in\nits vicinity.\n  Our analysis captures strong non-linearities present in the aggregation of\nthese interactions. Then, by modeling the formation as a graph, we present a\nnovel approach for learning the force aggregation function, and contrast it\nagainst simpler linear models. Finally, we explore how our proposed models\ngeneralize when a fourth vehicle is added to the formation.",

By training the network with environmental characteristics\nsurrounding each galaxy in redshift space, our ANN model can accurately predict\nthe line-of-sight velocity of each individual galaxy. When this velocity is\nused to eliminate the RSD effect, the two-point correlation function (TPCF) in\nreal space can be recovered with an accuracy better than 1% at $s$ > 8\n$h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$, and 4% on all scales compared to ground truth. The\nreal-space power spectrum can be recovered within 3% on $k$< 0.5\n$\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}h$, and less than 5% for all $k$ modes. The quadrupole moment\nof the TPCF or power spectrum is almost zero down to $s$ = 10\n$h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ or all $k$ modes, indicating an effective correction of\nthe spatial anisotropy caused by the RSD effect. We demonstrate that on large\nscales, without additional training with new data, our network is adaptable to\ndifferent cosmological models, and mock galaxy samples at high redshifts and\nhigh biases, achieving less than 10% error for scales greater than 15\n$h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$. As it is sensitive to large-scale densities, it does not\nmanage to remove Fingers of God in large clusters, but works remarkably well at\nrecovering real-space galaxy positions elsewhere.

It consists of two parts:\nPart A applies the modern theory of probability in which an arbitrary convex\nfunction \\phi is employed as an analytic \"device\" to express information as\nstatistical dependency contained in the topological sub-\\sigma-algebra\nstructure. Via thermo-doubling, Fenchel-Young equality (FYE) that consists of\n\\phi(x) and its conjugate \\psi(y) establishes the notion of equilibrium between\nx and y through duality symmetry and the principle of maximum entropy/minimum\nfree energy. Part B deals with a given set of repetitive measurements, where an\ninherent convex function emerges via the mathematics of large deviations.\nLogarithm-based Shannon entropy with \\phi(x)=-\\log x figures prominently for\ni.i.d. sample statistics. Information can be a measure of the agreement between\na statistical observation and its theoretical models. Maximum likelihood\nprinciple arises here and FYE provides a thermodynamic energetic narrative of\nrecurrent data.",

            "summary": "Image-based crop growth modeling can substantially contribute to precision\nagriculture by revealing spatial crop development over time, which allows an\nearly and location-specific estimation of relevant future plant traits, such as\nleaf area or biomass. A prerequisite for realistic and sharp crop image\ngeneration is the integration of multiple growth-influencing conditions in a\nmodel, such as an image of an initial growth stage, the associated growth time,\nand further information about the field treatment. We present a two-stage\nframework consisting first of an image prediction model and second of a growth\nestimation model, which both are independently trained. The image prediction\nmodel is a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (CWGAN). In\nthe generator of this model, conditional batch normalization (CBN) is used to\nintegrate different conditions along with the input image. This allows the\nmodel to generate time-varying artificial images dependent on multiple\ninfluencing factors of different kinds. These images are used by the second\npart of the framework for plant phenotyping by deriving plant-specific traits\nand comparing them with those of non-artificial (real) reference images. For\nvarious crop datasets, the framework allows realistic, sharp image predictions\nwith a slight loss of quality from short-term to long-term predictions.\nSimulations of varying growth-influencing conditions performed with the trained\nframework provide valuable insights into how such factors relate to crop\nappearances, which is particularly useful in complex, less explored crop\nmixture systems. Further results show that adding process-based simulated\nbiomass as a condition increases the accuracy of the derived phenotypic traits\nfrom the predicted images. This demonstrates the potential of our framework to\nserve as an interface between an image- and process-based crop growth model.",

The common wisdom states\nthat absorption in the dielectric violates Brewster angle and leads to a\nnon-vanishing reflection.

Unlike the\ntraditional \"lossless\" Brewster angle, perfect transmission in this case is\naccompanied by phase singularities of the reflection amplitude. In this paper,\nwe examine theoretically phase singularities and the associated topological\ncharges emerging in the wavelength-incidence angle space upon perfect\ntransmission into absorbing uniaxial dielectrics. We derive the analytical\ncriterion of perfect light transmission into an anisotropic medium, demonstrate\nphase singularities in these scenarios, and study their dynamics as a function\nof material parameters. Finally, by lowering the symmetry of the problem, we\ntranslate this phenomenon into a different parameter space of wave vector\ncomponents, and illustrate the feasibility of this phenomenon with available\noptically anisotropic materials.

By combining chemical rate networks\nwith continuum & line radiative transfer, and the calculation of all relevant\ndust and gas heating & cooling rates in an axisymmetric disc structure, these\nmodels make detailed predictions about the molecular composition of the disc,\nthe discs' internal gas and dust temperature structure, and the composition of\nice layers which form on the refractory dust grain surfaces.

While numerous backdoor attacks\noccur within the digital realm, their practical implementation in real-world\nprediction systems remains limited and vulnerable to disturbances in the\nphysical world. Consequently, this limitation has given rise to the development\nof physical backdoor attacks, where trigger objects manifest as physical\nentities within the real world. However, creating the requisite dataset to\ntrain or evaluate a physical backdoor model is a daunting task, limiting the\nbackdoor researchers and practitioners from studying such physical attack\nscenarios. This paper unleashes a recipe that empowers backdoor researchers to\neffortlessly create a malicious, physical backdoor dataset based on advances in\ngenerative modeling. Particularly, this recipe involves 3 automatic modules:\nsuggesting the suitable physical triggers, generating the poisoned candidate\nsamples (either by synthesizing new samples or editing existing clean samples),\nand finally refining for the most plausible ones. As such, it effectively\nmitigates the perceived complexity associated with creating a physical backdoor\ndataset, transforming it from a daunting task into an attainable objective.\nExtensive experiment results show that datasets created by our \"recipe\" enable\nadversaries to achieve an impressive attack success rate on real physical world\ndata and exhibit similar properties compared to previous physical backdoor\nattack studies.

Complex 3D motions of the cylinder with respect to the wall\noccur during bouncing, including multi-contact-points between the cylinder and\nthe bottom as well as cavitation.\n  We investigate numerical modelling of an idealized situation (2D infinite\ncylinder falling parallel to the wall) with 2D simulations where the fluid\nequations of motion were coupled to the particle equation of motion through an\nImmersed Boundary Method. The particle equation of motion is coupled to an\nelastic force to model bouncing, requiring a parameterization of the cut-off\nlength (interpreted as a roughness) and the contact time (associated with the\ncontact elasticity) used here to capture the experimental observations. The\nsimulations confirmed that i) the departure of the coefficient of restitution\nfrom 0 is strictly dependent on the apparent roughness and ii) the coefficient\nof restitution depends on the contact time.\n  Finally, we model the coefficient of restitution as the product of two\ncontributions to the mechanical loss of energy: the collision-to-terminal\nvelocity ratio ($V_c/V_t$) of the approach-phase and the rebound-to-collision\nvelocity ratio ($-V_r/V_c$) of the contact-phase. This leads to a reasonably\ngood prediction of the coefficient of restitution in the intermediate regime in\n$St$. This suggests the relevance of lumping the complex details of physical\nphenomena involved during contact into a simple concept based on the contact\napparent roughness and elasticity.",

In this\npaper we develop neural network models to approximate Knapsack Problem\nsolutions using the Lagrangian Dual Framework while improving constraint\nsatisfaction. We explore the problems of output interpretation and model\nselection within this context. Experimental results show strong constraint\nsatisfaction with a minor reduction of optimality as compared to a baseline\nneural network which does not explicitly model the constraints.",

            "summary": "With the continuous maturation and application of autonomous driving\ntechnology, a systematic examination of open-source autonomous driving datasets\nbecomes instrumental in fostering the robust evolution of the industry\necosystem. Current autonomous driving datasets can broadly be categorized into\ntwo generations. The first-generation autonomous driving datasets are\ncharacterized by relatively simpler sensor modalities, smaller data scale, and\nis limited to perception-level tasks. KITTI, introduced in 2012, serves as a\nprominent representative of this initial wave. In contrast, the\nsecond-generation datasets exhibit heightened complexity in sensor modalities,\ngreater data scale and diversity, and an expansion of tasks from perception to\nencompass prediction and control. Leading examples of the second generation\ninclude nuScenes and Waymo, introduced around 2019. This comprehensive review,\nconducted in collaboration with esteemed colleagues from both academia and\nindustry, systematically assesses over seventy open-source autonomous driving\ndatasets from domestic and international sources. It offers insights into\nvarious aspects, such as the principles underlying the creation of high-quality\ndatasets, the pivotal role of data engine systems, and the utilization of\ngenerative foundation models to facilitate scalable data generation.\nFurthermore, this review undertakes an exhaustive analysis and discourse\nregarding the characteristics and data scales that future third-generation\nautonomous driving datasets should possess. It also delves into the scientific\nand technical challenges that warrant resolution. These endeavors are pivotal\nin advancing autonomous innovation and fostering technological enhancement in\ncritical domains.

These tasks can be effectively\napproached as image forecasting problems using computer vision models. Vector\nquantization (VQ) is a well-known method for discrete representation that\nimproves the latent space, leading to enhanced generalization and transfer\nlearning capabilities. One of the main challenges in using VQ for\nspatiotemporal forecasting is how to balance between keeping enough details and\nremoving noises from the original patterns for better generalization. We\naddress this challenge by developing sparse vector quantization, or {\\bf SVQ}\nfor short, that leverages sparse regression to make better trade-off between\nthe two objectives. The main innovation of this work is to approximate sparse\nregression by a two-layer MLP and a randomly fixed or learnable matrix,\ndramatically improving its computational efficiency. Through experiments\nconducted on diverse datasets in multiple fields including weather forecasting,\ntraffic flow prediction, and video forecasting, we unequivocally demonstrate\nthat our proposed method consistently enhances the performance of base models\nand achieves state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks.",

A single wave\npacket is found if the cavity is resonant to the external laser.

            "summary": "A critical yet unpredictable complication following cataract surgery is\nintraocular lens dislocation. Postoperative stability is imperative, as even a\ntiny decentration of multifocal lenses or inadequate alignment of the torus in\ntoric lenses due to postoperative rotation can lead to a significant drop in\nvisual acuity. Investigating possible intraoperative indicators that can\npredict post-surgical instabilities of intraocular lenses can help prevent this\ncomplication. In this paper, we develop and evaluate the first fully-automatic\nframework for the computation of lens unfolding delay, rotation, and\ninstability during surgery. Adopting a combination of three types of CNNs,\nnamely recurrent, region-based, and pixel-based, the proposed framework is\nemployed to assess the possibility of predicting post-operative lens\ndislocation during cataract surgery. This is achieved via performing a\nlarge-scale study on the statistical differences between the behavior of\ndifferent brands of intraocular lenses and aligning the results with expert\nsurgeons' hypotheses and observations about the lenses. We exploit a\nlarge-scale dataset of cataract surgery videos featuring four intraocular lens\nbrands. Experimental results confirm the reliability of the proposed framework\nin evaluating the lens' statistics during the surgery. The Pearson correlation\nand t-test results reveal significant correlations between lens unfolding delay\nand lens rotation and significant differences between the intra-operative\nrotations stability of four groups of lenses. These results suggest that the\nproposed framework can help surgeons select the lenses based on the patient's\neye conditions and predict post-surgical lens dislocation.",

To\nthis end, we propose a method to utilize a diffusion-based generative sequence\nmodel to plan a series of milestones in a latent space and to have an agent to\nfollow the milestones to accomplish a given task. The proposed method can learn\ncontrol-relevant, low-dimensional latent representations of milestones, which\nmakes it possible to efficiently perform long-term planning and vision-based\ncontrol. Furthermore, our approach exploits generation flexibility of the\ndiffusion model, which makes it possible to plan diverse trajectories for\nmulti-task decision-making. We demonstrate the proposed method across offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks and an visual manipulation environment.\nThe results show that our approach outperforms offline RL methods in solving\nlong-horizon, sparse-reward tasks and multi-task problems, while also achieving\nthe state-of-the-art performance on the most challenging vision-based\nmanipulation benchmark.",

For this purpose, we study\ntransmission of an electron wave packet through the dynamical barrier, and\nidentify two regimes, the semiclassical regime and the quasistatic regime. In\neach regime, we calculate the arrival-time distribution reconstructed by using\nthe barrier and quantify the error in the detection, the difference of the\ntemporal uncertainty between the wave-packet distribution and the reconstructed\ndistribution. Our finding suggests that for precise detection, the time scale,\nin which the barrier height rises over the energy distribution of the wave\npacket and the tunneling energy window of the barrier, has to be much shorter\nthan the temporal uncertainty of the wave packet.

In\nthis paper, we derive a formula for the most general expression of the\nstochastic gravitational wave background correlation that could be tested with\npulsar timing and future square kilometer arrays. Our expressions extends the\nharmonic space analysis, also often referred to as the power spectrum approach,\nto predict the correlation signatures of an anisotropic polarized stochastic\ngravitational wave background with subluminal tensor, vector, and scalar\ngravitational degrees of freedom. We present the first few nontrivial\nanisotropy and polarization signatures in the correlation and discuss their\ndependence on the gravitational wave speed and pulsar distances. Our results\nset up tests that could potentially be used to rigorously examine the isotropy\nof the stochastic gravitational wave background and strengthen the existing\nconstraints on possible non-Einsteinian polarizations in the nanohertz\ngravitational wave regime.",

            "summary": "Controlling energy consumption in buildings through demand response (DR) has\nbecome increasingly important to reduce global carbon emissions and limit\nclimate change. In this paper, we specifically focus on controlling the heating\nsystem of a residential building to optimize its energy consumption while\nrespecting user's thermal comfort. Recent works in this area have mainly\nfocused on either model-based control, e.g., model predictive control (MPC), or\nmodel-free reinforcement learning (RL) to implement practical DR algorithms. A\nspecific RL method that recently has achieved impressive success in domains\nsuch as board games (go, chess) is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Yet, for\nbuilding control it has remained largely unexplored. Thus, we study MCTS\nspecifically for building demand response. Its natural structure allows a\nflexible optimization that implicitly integrate exogenous constraints (as\nopposed, for example, to conventional RL solutions), making MCTS a promising\ncandidate for DR control problems. We demonstrate how to improve MCTS control\nperformance by incorporating a Physics-informed Neural Network (PiNN) model for\nits underlying thermal state prediction, as opposed to traditional purely\ndata-driven Black-Box approaches. Our MCTS implementation aligned with a PiNN\nmodel is able to obtain a 3% increment of the obtained reward compared to a\nrule-based controller; leading to a 10% cost reduction and 35% reduction on\ntemperature difference with the desired one when applied to an artificial price\nprofile. We further implemented a Deep Learning layer into the Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch technique using a neural network that leads the tree search through more\noptimal nodes. We then compared this addition with its Vanilla version, showing\nthe improvement in computational cost required.",

The entropy dilution in an early\nmatter-dominated era provides an attractive mechanism for solving such an\noverabundance problem. In this work, we note that this dark matter dilution\nmechanism will lead to two distinctive kinks in the primordial GW spectrum,\nwhose frequencies strongly correlate with the DM mass.

The timely and accurate prediction of CWHTs' destinations and dwell times\nplay a key role in effective environmental management. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a prediction method based on an interpretable\nactivity-based model, input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM), and validate it\non 300 CWHTs in Chengdu, China. Contextual factors are considered in the model\nto improve its prediction power. Results show that the IOHMM outperforms\nseveral baseline models, including Markov chains, linear regression, and long\nshort-term memory. Factors influencing the predictability of CWHTs'\ntransportation activities are also explored using linear regression models.\nResults suggest the proposed model holds promise in assisting authorities by\npredicting the upcoming transportation activities of CWHTs and administering\nintervention in a timely and effective manner.",

It\nis noteworthy that even in the case of a CP-conserving 2HDM, the resulting\nelectron EDM is capable of reaching the current experimental limit, with CP\nviolation arising exclusively from the dark sectors. Furthermore, we introduce\na heavy dark sector (HDS) approximation for the analytic calculation of the\nEDM, assuming that the dark sector particles are much heavier than the physical\nstates in the 2HDM.

            "summary": "The spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) has recently spread from its\nnative range to several other countries and forecasts predict that it may\nbecome a global invasive pest. In particular, since its confirmed presence in\nthe United States in 2014 it has established itself as a major invasive pest in\nthe Mid-Atlantic region where it is damaging both naturally occurring and\ncommercially important farmed plants. Quarantine zones have been introduced to\ncontain the infestation, but the spread to new areas continues. At present the\npathways and drivers of spread are not well-understood. In particular, several\nhuman activity related factors have been proposed to contribute to the spread;\nhowever, which features of the current spread can be attributed to these\nfactors remains unclear. Here we collect county level data on infestation\nstatus and four human activity related factors and use statistical methods to\ndetermine whether there is evidence for an association between the factors and\ninfestation. Then we construct a mechanistic network model based on the factors\nfound to be associated with infestation and use it to simulate local spread. We\nfind that the model reproduces key features of the spread 2014 to 2021. In\nparticular, the growth of the main infestation region and the opening of spread\ncorridors in the westward and southwestern directions is consistent with data\nand the model accurately forecasts the correct infestation status at the county\nlevel in 2021 with $81\\%$ accuracy. We then use the model to forecast the\nspread up to 2025 in a larger region. Given that this model is based on a few\nhuman activity related factors that can be targeted, it may prove useful in\ninforming management and further modeling efforts related to the current\nspotted lanternfly infestation in the US and potentially for current and future\ninvasions elsewhere globally.",

In this paper we consider a triggering process of\nreconnection that is driven by interaction of two discontinuities: solar wind\nrotational discontinuity and tangential discontinuity at the Earth's\nmagnetospheric boundary, magnetopause. Combining the multispacecraft\nmeasurements and global hybrid simulations, we show that solar wind\ndiscontinuities may drive the magnetopause reconnection and cause the mixing of\nthe solar wind and magnetosphere plasmas around the magnetopause, well\ndownstream of the solar wind flow. Since large-amplitude discontinuities are\nfrequently observed in the solar wind and predicted for various stellar winds,\nour results of reconnection driven by the discontinuity-discontinuity\ninteraction may have a broad application beyond the magnetosphere.",

The stiffness of the\nproblem is attributed to the sharp singular layers, which can result in\nsubstantial computational errors if not appropriately addressed. Traditional\nnumerical methods typically require extensive mesh refinements near the\nboundary to achieve accurate solutions, which can be computationally expensive.\nTo address the challenges posed by singularly perturbed problems, we employ\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs). However, PINNs may struggle with\nrapidly varying singularly perturbed solutions over a small domain region,\nleading to inadequate resolution and potentially inaccurate or unstable\nresults. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a semi-analytic method that\naugments PINNs with singular layers or corrector functions.

To enhance expert diversity for collaboration among all experts, the\nExpert-Specific Projection method is proposed to assign a unique projection\nperspective to each expert. To balance decision-making influence for\ncollaboration within the expert group, the Expert-Specific Loss is presented to\nintegrate individual expert loss into the weighted decision loss of the group\nfor more equitable training.

We employ an\nefficient sampler to obtain representative inputs and the output distribution\nof the trained model, which, after selective annotation, can be used to\nestimate the model's precision and recall at different output values and a\ncomprehensive precision-recall curve. Our experiments demonstrate that\nOmniInput enables a more fine-grained comparison between models, especially\nwhen their performance is almost the same on pre-defined datasets, leading to\nnew findings and insights for how to train more robust, generalizable models.",

However, due to the emergence and development of\nadversarial deep learning technologies, it becomes challenging for the adoption\nof DL models into IDS. In this paper, we propose a novel IDS architecture that\ncan enhance the robustness of IDS against adversarial attacks by combining\nconventional machine learning (ML) models and Deep Learning models. The\nproposed DLL-IDS consists of three components: DL-based IDS, adversarial\nexample (AE) detector, and ML-based IDS. We first develop a novel AE detector\nbased on the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID). Then, we exploit the low\nattack transferability between DL models and ML models to find a robust ML\nmodel that can assist us in determining the maliciousness of AEs. If the input\ntraffic is detected as an AE, the ML-based IDS will predict the maliciousness\nof input traffic, otherwise the DL-based IDS will work for the prediction. The\nfusion mechanism can leverage the high prediction accuracy of DL models and low\nattack transferability between DL models and ML models to improve the\nrobustness of the whole system. In our experiments, we observe a significant\nimprovement in the prediction performance of the IDS when subjected to\nadversarial attack, achieving high accuracy with low resource consumption.",

We develop a mathematical model to\ncharacterize a heterogeneous system in terms of its task and machine\nheterogeneity dimensions and then reduce it to a single value, called\nHomogeneous Equivalent Execution Time (HEET), which represents the execution\ntime behavior of the entire system. We used AWS EC2 instances to implement a\nreal-world machine learning inference system. Performance evaluation of the\nHEET score across different heterogeneous system configurations demonstrates\nthat HEET can accurately characterize the performance behavior of these\nsystems. In particular, the results show that our proposed method is capable of\npredicting the true makespan of heterogeneous systems without online\nevaluations with an average precision of 84%.

            "summary": "Existing salient object detection methods are capable of predicting binary\nmaps that highlight visually salient regions. However, these methods are\nlimited in their ability to differentiate the relative importance of multiple\nobjects and the relationships among them, which can lead to errors and reduced\naccuracy in downstream tasks that depend on the relative importance of multiple\nobjects. To conquer, this paper proposes a new paradigm for saliency ranking,\nwhich aims to completely focus on ranking salient objects by their \"importance\norder\". While previous works have shown promising performance, they still face\nill-posed problems. First, the saliency ranking ground truth (GT) orders\ngeneration methods are unreasonable since determining the correct ranking order\nis not well-defined, resulting in false alarms. Second, training a ranking\nmodel remains challenging because most saliency ranking methods follow the\nmulti-task paradigm, leading to conflicts and trade-offs among different tasks.\nThird, existing regression-based saliency ranking methods are complex for\nsaliency ranking models due to their reliance on instance mask-based saliency\nranking orders. These methods require a significant amount of data to perform\naccurately and can be challenging to implement effectively. To solve these\nproblems, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the causes and proposes a\nwhole-flow processing paradigm of saliency ranking task from the perspective of\n\"GT data generation\", \"network structure design\" and \"training protocol\". The\nproposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the\nwidely-used SALICON set, as demonstrated by extensive experiments with fair and\nreasonable comparisons. The saliency ranking task is still in its infancy, and\nour proposed unified framework can serve as a fundamental strategy to guide\nfuture work.",

The complex interplay between Ising spin\norbit coupling and the Pauli paramagnetic effect can lead to a stabilization of\nthe FFLO state in a relatively large range of the phase diagram, even below the\nPauli limit. In this study, we present experimental evidence of the formation\nof this orbital FFLO state in true bulk 2H-NbSe2 samples. This evidence was\nobtained using high-resolution magnetic torque experiments in magnetic fields\napplied strictly parallel to the NbSe2 basal plane. The magnetic torque reveals\na small step-like reversible anomaly, indicating a magnetic field-induced\nthermodynamic phase transition within the superconducting state. This anomaly\nbears many similarities to the FFLO transitions in other FFLO superconductors,\nsuggesting the potential existence of an orbital FFLO state in bulk 2H-NbSe2\nsamples. Additionally, we observe a pronounced in-plane 6-fold symmetry of the\nupper critical field in the field range above this phase transition, which has\npreviously been interpreted as a hallmark of the orbital FFLO state in thin\n2H-NbSe2.",

            "summary": "Sleep staging has become a critical task in diagnosing and treating sleep\ndisorders to prevent sleep related diseases. With rapidly growing large scale\npublic sleep databases and advances in machine learning, significant progress\nhas been made toward automatic sleep staging. However, previous studies face\nsome critical problems in sleep studies; the heterogeneity of subjects'\nphysiological signals, the inability to extract meaningful information from\nunlabeled sleep signal data to improve predictive performances, the difficulty\nin modeling correlations between sleep stages, and the lack of an effective\nmechanism to quantify predictive uncertainty. In this study, we propose a\nneural network based automatic sleep staging model, named DREAM, to learn\ndomain generalized representations from physiological signals and models sleep\ndynamics. DREAM learns sleep related and subject invariant representations from\ndiverse subjects' sleep signal segments and models sleep dynamics by capturing\ninteractions between sequential signal segments and between sleep stages. In\nthe experiments, we demonstrate that DREAM outperforms the existing sleep\nstaging methods on three datasets. The case study demonstrates that our model\ncan learn the generalized decision function resulting in good prediction\nperformances for the new subjects, especially in case there are differences\nbetween testing and training subjects. The usage of unlabeled data shows the\nbenefit of leveraging unlabeled EEG data. Further, uncertainty quantification\ndemonstrates that DREAM provides prediction uncertainty, making the model\nreliable and helping sleep experts in real world applications.",

            "summary": "The identification of essential proteins in protein-protein interaction\nnetworks (PINs) can help to discover drug targets and prevent disease. In order\nto improve the accuracy of the identification of essential proteins,\nresearchers attempted to obtain a refined PIN by combining multiple biological\ninformation to filter out some unreliable interactions in the PIN.\nUnfortunately, such approaches drastically reduce the number of nodes in the\nPIN after multiple refinements and result in a sparser PIN. It makes a\nconsiderable portion of essential proteins unidentifiable. In this paper, we\npropose a multi-layer refined network (MR-PIN) that addresses this problem.\nFirstly, four refined networks are constructed by respectively integrating\ndifferent biological information into the static PIN to form a multi-layer\nheterogeneous network. Then scores of proteins in each network layer are\ncalculated by the existing node ranking method, and the importance score of a\nprotein in the MR-PIN is evaluated in terms of the geometric mean of its scores\nin all layers. Finally, all nodes are sorted by their importance scores to\ndetermine their essentiality. To evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-layer\nrefined network model, we apply 16 node ranking methods on the MR-PIN, and\ncompare the results with those on the SPIN, DPIN and RDPIN. Then the predictive\nperformances of these ranking methods are validated in terms of the\nidentification number of essential protein at top100 - top600, sensitivity,\nspecificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F-measure,\naccuracy, Jackknife, ROCAUC and PRAUC. The experimental results show that the\nMR-PIN is superior to the existing refined PINs in the identification accuracy\nof essential proteins.",

It is shown\nthat a nut graph $G$ always has at least one more edge orbit than it has vertex\norbits: $o_e(G) \\geq o_v(G) + 1$, with the obvious corollary that edge\ntransitive nut graphs do not exist. We give infinite familes of\nvertex-transitive nut graphs with two orbits of edges, and infinite families of\nnut graphs with two orbits of vertices and three of edges. Several\nconstructions for nut graphs from smaller starting graphs are known: double\nsubdivision of a bridge, four-fold subdivision of an edge, a construction for\nextrusion of a vertex with preservation of the degree sequence. To these we add\nmultiplier constructions that yield nut graphs from regular (not necessarily\nnut graph) parents.

Three well-studied scaling relations are\nfit to the 19,999 star-forming spaxels in the extended sample, namely the\nresolved Schmidt-Kennicutt (rSK) relation, the resolved star forming main\nsequence (rSFMS) and the resolved molecular gas main sequence (rMGMS). We\nadditionally investigate the relationship between the dynamical equilibrium\npressure (PDE) and star formation rate surface density (Sigma_SFR), which we\nrefer to as the resolved PDE (rPDE) relation. Contrary to previous studies that\nhave focussed on normal star-forming galaxies and found an approximately linear\nrPDE relation, the presence of more vigourously star-forming galaxies in the\nextended ALMaQUEST sample reveals a marked turnover in the relation at high\npressures. Although the scatter around the linear fit to the rPDE relation is\nsimilar to the other three relations, a random forest analysis, which can\nextract non-linear dependences, finds that PDE is unambiguously more important\nthan either Sigma_H2 or Sigma_star for predicting Sigma_SFR. We compare the\nobserved rPDE relation to the prediction of the pressure-regulated\nfeedback-modulated (PRFM) model of star formation, finding that galaxies\nresiding on the global SFMS do indeed closely follow the rPDE relation\npredicted by the PRFM theory. However, galaxies above and below the global SFMS\nshow significant deviations from the model. Galaxies with high SFR are instead\nconsistent with models that include other contributions to turbulence in\naddition to the local star formation feedback.",

Universal adversarial\nattack methods such as Fast Sign Gradient Method (FSGM) and Projected Gradient\nDescend (PGD) are popular for LiDAR object detection, but they are often\ndeficient compared to task-specific adversarial attacks. Additionally, these\nuniversal methods typically require unrestricted access to the model's\ninformation, which is difficult to obtain in real-world applications. To\naddress these limitations, we present a black-box Scaling Adversarial\nRobustness (ScAR) method for LiDAR object detection. By analyzing the\nstatistical characteristics of 3D object detection datasets such as KITTI,\nWaymo, and nuScenes, we have found that the model's prediction is sensitive to\nscaling of 3D instances. We propose three black-box scaling adversarial attack\nmethods based on the available information: model-aware attack,\ndistribution-aware attack, and blind attack. We also introduce a strategy for\ngenerating scaling adversarial examples to improve the model's robustness\nagainst these three scaling adversarial attacks.

            "summary": "Physicians write notes about patients. In doing so, they reveal much about\nthemselves. Using data from 129,228 emergency room visits, we train a model to\nidentify notes written by fatigued physicians -- those who worked 5 or more of\nthe prior 7 days. In a hold-out set, the model accurately identifies notes\nwritten by these high-workload physicians, and also flags notes written in\nother high-fatigue settings: on overnight shifts, and after high patient\nvolumes. Model predictions also correlate with worse decision-making on at\nleast one important metric: yield of testing for heart attack is 18% lower with\neach standard deviation increase in model-predicted fatigue. Finally, the model\nindicates that notes written about Black and Hispanic patients have 12% and 21%\nhigher predicted fatigue than Whites -- larger than overnight vs. daytime\ndifferences. These results have an important implication for large language\nmodels (LLMs). Our model indicates that fatigued doctors write more predictable\nnotes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, because word prediction is the core of how LLMs\nwork, we find that LLM-written notes have 17% higher predicted fatigue than\nreal physicians' notes. This indicates that LLMs may introduce distortions in\ngenerated text that are not yet fully understood.",

Our focus here is on its manifestations within a\nspecific class of nonequilibrium stationary states: driven open quantum matter.\nProgress in this field is fueled by a number of uprising platforms ranging from\nlight-driven quantum materials over synthetic quantum systems like cold atomic\ngases to the functional devices of the noisy intermediate scale quantum era.\nThese systems share in common that, on the microscopic scale, they obey the\nlaws of quantum mechanics, while detailed balance underlying thermodynamic\nequilibrium is broken due to the simultaneous presence of Hamiltonian unitary\ndynamics and nonunitary drive and dissipation. The challenge is then to connect\nthis microscopic physics to macroscopic observables, and to identify universal\ncollective phenomena that uniquely witness the breaking of equilibrium\nconditions, thus having no equilibrium counterparts. In the framework of a\nLindblad-Keldysh field theory, we discuss on the one hand the principles\ndelimiting thermodynamic equilibrium from driven open stationary states, and on\nthe other hand show how unifying concepts such as symmetries, the purity of\nstates, and scaling arguments are implemented. We then present instances of\nuniversal behavior structured into three classes: new realizations of\nparadigmatic nonequilibrium phenomena, including a survey of first experimental\nrealizations; novel instances of nonequilibrium universality found in these\nsystems made of quantum ingredients; and genuinely quantum phenomena out of\nequilibrium, including in fermionic systems. We also discuss perspectives for\nfuture research on driven open quantum matter.",

            "summary": "In the canonical tachyonic resonance preheating scenario, only an order one\nfraction of energy density in the inflaton is transferred to radiation, due to\nbackreaction effects. One possible way to improve the energy transfer\nefficiency is to allow for the perturbative decays of the resonantly produced\ndaughter particles, which serve as the \"spillway\" to drain the direct decay\nproducts from inflaton and to reduce the backreaction. In this article, we\nstudy two observational consequences of spillway preheating. The first is on\nthe inflationary observables: the scalar spectrum tilt $n_s$ and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. The spillway scenario modifies the evolution of the\nequation of state between the end of inflation and the thermal big bang. As a\nresult, it affects the time elapsed from inflation to the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB), as well as the fits of inflationary models and their\ncorresponding prediction for $n_s$ and $r$. We map out the equation of state by\nsystematically scanning the parameter space of the spillway scenario, and show\nthat the most efficient spillway scenario predicts a bluer spectrum, compared\nto the tachyonic preheating scenario. Another consequence is the production of\nhigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). Comparing the simulation results with\nthose of tachyonic preheating, we find that the existence of spillways leads to\nsharper-peaked GW spectra with a mildly damped amplitude.",

Here, in particular, we explore the\nnonlinear effects induced by subtracting a term proportional to Bohm's quantum\npotential to the usual (linear) Schr\\\"odinger equation, which generates the\nso-called \"classical\" Schr\\\"odinger equation. Although a simple nonlinear\ntransformation allows us to recover the well-known classical Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation, by combining a series of analytical results (in the limiting cases)\nand simulations (whenever the analytical treatment is unaffordable), we find an\nanalytical explanation to why the dynamics in the nonlinear \"classical\" regime\nis still strongly nonclassical. This is even more evident by establishing a\none-to-one comparison between the Bohmian trajectories associated with the\ncorresponding wave function and the classical trajectories that one should\nobtain. Based on these observations, it is clear that the transition to a fully\nclassical regime requires extra conditions in order to remove any trace of\ncoherence, which is the truly distinctive trait of quantum mechanics. This\nbehavior is investigated in three paradigmatic cases, namely, the dispersion of\na free propagating localized particle, the harmonic oscillator, and a\nsimplified version of Young's two-slit experiment.",

We propose formulating PCR as a denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic process, mapping noisy transformations to the ground truth.\nHowever, using diffusion models for PCR has nontrivial challenges, such as\nadapting a generative model to a discriminative task and leveraging the\nestimated nonlinear transformation from the previous step. Instead of training\na diffusion model to directly map pure noise to ground truth, we map the\npredictions of an off-the-shelf PCR model to ground truth. The predictions of\noff-the-shelf models are often imperfect, especially in challenging cases where\nthe two points clouds have low overlap, and thus could be seen as noisy\nversions of the real rigid transformation. In addition, we transform the\nrotation matrix into a spherical linear space for interpolation between samples\nin the forward process, and convert rigid transformations into auxiliary\ninformation to implicitly exploit last-step estimations in the reverse process.\nAs a result, conditioned on time step, the denoising model adapts to the\nincreasing accuracy across steps and refines registrations. Our extensive\nexperiments showcase the effectiveness of our DiffusionPCR, yielding\nstate-of-the-art registration recall rates (95.3%/81.6%) on 3DMatch and\n3DLoMatch.

The force in MOND is not a direct particle-particle interaction,\nbut derives from a potential for which a nonlinear partial differential\nequation (PDE) needs to be solved. Normally, this makes the problem of\nsimulating dynamical evolution computationally expensive. We intend to develop\na fast particle-mesh (PM) code for MOND (the AQUAL formalism). We transformed\nthe nonlinear equation for MOND into a system of linear PDEs plus one algebraic\nequation. An iterative scheme with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) produces\nsuccessively better numerical approximations. The algorithm was tested for\ndynamical systems in MOND where analytical solutions are known: the two-body\nproblem, a body with a circular ring, and a spherical distribution of particles\nin thermal equilibrium in the self-consistent potential. The PM code can\naccurately calculate the forces at subpixel scale and reproduces the analytical\nsolutions. Four iterations are required for the potential, but when the spatial\nsteps are small compared to the kernel width, one iteration is suffices. The\nuse of a smoothing kernel for the accelerations is inevitable in order to\neliminate the self-gravity of the point particles. Our PDE solver is $15$ to\n$42$ times as slow as a standard Poisson solver. However, the smoothing and\nparticle propagation takes up most of the time above one particle per $10^3$\npixels.

            "summary": "Horizontal gene transfer inference approaches are usually based on gene\nsequences: parametric methods search for patterns that deviate from a\nparticular genomic signature, while phylogenetic methods use sequences to\nreconstruct the gene and species trees. However, it is well-known that\nsequences have difficulty identifying ancient transfers since mutations have\nenough time to erase all evidence of such events. In this work, we ask whether\ncharacter-based methods can predict gene transfers. Their advantage over\nsequences is that homologous genes can have low DNA similarity, but still have\nretained enough important common motifs that allow them to have common\ncharacter traits, for instance the same functional or expression profile. A\nphylogeny that has two separate clades that acquired the same character\nindependently might indicate the presence of a transfer even in the absence of\nsequence similarity. We introduce perfect transfer networks, which are\nphylogenetic networks that can explain the character diversity of a set of taxa\nunder the assumption that characters have unique births, and that once a\ncharacter is gained it is rarely lost. Examples of such traits include\ntransposable elements, biochemical markers and emergence of organelles, just to\nname a few. We study the differences between our model and two similar models:\nperfect phylogenetic networks and ancestral recombination networks. Our goals\nare to initiate a study on the structural and algorithmic properties of perfect\ntransfer networks. We then show that in polynomial time, one can decide whether\na given network is a valid explanation for a set of taxa, and show how, for a\ngiven tree, one can add transfer edges to it so that it explains a set of taxa.\nWe finally provide lower and upper bounds on the number of transfers required\nto explain a set of taxa, in the worst case.",

This paper presents an innovative framework for detecting areas of\nalgorithmic bias in medical-AI decision support systems. Our approach\nefficiently identifies potential biases in medical-AI models, specifically in\nthe context of sepsis prediction, by employing the Classification and\nRegression Trees (CART) algorithm. We verify our methodology by conducting a\nseries of synthetic data experiments, showcasing its ability to estimate areas\nof bias in controlled settings precisely. The effectiveness of the concept is\nfurther validated by experiments using electronic medical records from Grady\nMemorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. These tests demonstrate the practical\nimplementation of our strategy in a clinical environment, where it can function\nas a vital instrument for guaranteeing fairness and equity in AI-based medical\ndecisions.",

To generate region and vessel ground-truths,\nwe used state-of-the-art automatic methods following manual correction of\ninaccurate segmentations, with foveal positions manually annotated. We trained\na U-Net deep-learning model to detect the region, vessels, and fovea to\ncalculate choroid thickness, area, and vascular index in a fovea-centred region\nof interest. We analysed segmentation agreement (AUC, Dice) and choroid metrics\nagreement (Pearson, Spearman, mean absolute error (MAE)) in internal and\nexternal test sets. We compared Choroidalyzer to two manual graders on a small\nsubset of external test images and examined cases of high error.\n  Results: Choroidalyzer took 0.299 seconds per image on a standard laptop and\nachieved excellent region (Dice: internal 0.9789, external 0.9749), very good\nvessel segmentation performance (Dice: internal 0.8817, external 0.8703) and\nexcellent fovea location prediction (MAE: internal 3.9 pixels, external 3.4\npixels). For thickness, area, and vascular index, Pearson correlations were\n0.9754, 0.9815, and 0.8285 (internal) / 0.9831, 0.9779, 0.7948 (external),\nrespectively (all p<0.0001). Choroidalyzer's agreement with graders was\ncomparable to the inter-grader agreement across all metrics.\n  Conclusions: Choroidalyzer is an open-source, end-to-end pipeline that\naccurately segments the choroid and reliably extracts thickness, area, and\nvascular index. Especially choroidal vessel segmentation is a difficult and\nsubjective task, and fully-automatic methods like Choroidalyzer could provide\nobjectivity and standardisation.",

Applying duality theory and addressing free-boundary\nproblems, we analytically solve both cases, and provide explicit expressions\nfor value functions and optimal strategies in both cases. In the first\nscenario, where the bequest amount is fixed, distinct outcomes emerge based on\ndifferent levels of risk aversion parameter $\\gamma$: (i) the optimal time for\nlife insurance purchase occurs when the agent's wealth surpasses a critical\nthreshold if $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$, or (ii) life insurance should be acquired\nimmediately if $\\gamma>1$.

We study its symmetry\nresolution for two disjoint intervals in the ground state of the massless Dirac\nfermion field theory, extending previous results for the case of adjacent\nintervals. By applying the replica trick, this problem boils down to compute\nthe charged moments of the realignment matrix. We show that, for two disjoint\nintervals, they correspond to the partition function of the theory on a torus\nwith a non-contractible charged loop. This confers a great advantage compared\nto the negativity based on the partial transposition, for which the Riemann\nsurfaces generated by the replica trick have higher genus. This result empowers\nus to carry out the replica limit, yielding analytic expressions for the\nsymmetry-resolved CCNR negativity. Furthermore, these expressions provide also\nthe symmetry decomposition of other related quantities such as the operator\nentanglement of the reduced density matrix or the reflected entropy.",

This paper\nintroduces MPerceiver: a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that\nharnesses Stable Diffusion (SD) priors to enhance adaptiveness,\ngeneralizability and fidelity for all-in-one image restoration. Specifically,\nwe develop a dual-branch module to master two types of SD prompts: textual for\nholistic representation and visual for multiscale detail representation. Both\nprompts are dynamically adjusted by degradation predictions from the CLIP image\nencoder, enabling adaptive responses to diverse unknown degradations. Moreover,\na plug-in detail refinement module improves restoration fidelity via direct\nencoder-to-decoder information transformation. To assess our method, MPerceiver\nis trained on 9 tasks for all-in-one IR and outperforms state-of-the-art\ntask-specific methods across most tasks. Post multitask pre-training,\nMPerceiver attains a generalized representation in low-level vision, exhibiting\nremarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities in unseen tasks. Extensive\nexperiments on 16 IR tasks and 26 benchmarks underscore the superiority of\nMPerceiver in terms of adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity.",

            "summary": "Adversarial attacks have highlighted the vulnerability of classifiers based\non machine learning for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target\nRecognition (ATR) tasks. An adversarial attack perturbs SAR images of on-ground\ntargets such that the classifiers are misled into making incorrect predictions.\nHowever, many existing attacking techniques rely on arbitrary manipulation of\nSAR images while overlooking the feasibility of executing the attacks on\nreal-world SAR imagery. Instead, adversarial attacks should be able to be\nimplemented by physical actions, for example, placing additional false objects\nas scatterers around the on-ground target to perturb the SAR image and fool the\nSAR ATR.\n  In this paper, we propose the On-Target Scatterer Attack (OTSA), a\nscatterer-based physical adversarial attack. To ensure the feasibility of its\nphysical execution, we enforce a constraint on the positioning of the\nscatterers. Specifically, we restrict the scatterers to be placed only on the\ntarget instead of in the shadow regions or the background. To achieve this, we\nintroduce a positioning score based on Gaussian kernels and formulate an\noptimization problem for our OTSA attack. Using a gradient ascent method to\nsolve the optimization problem, the OTSA can generate a vector of parameters\ndescribing the positions, shapes, sizes and amplitudes of the scatterers to\nguide the physical execution of the attack that will mislead SAR image\nclassifiers. The experimental results show that our attack obtains\nsignificantly higher success rates under the positioning constraint compared\nwith the existing method.",

Utilizing BenchLMM, we comprehensively evaluate\nstate-of-the-art LMMs and reveal: 1) LMMs generally suffer performance\ndegradation when working with other styles; 2) An LMM performs better than\nanother model in common style does not guarantee its superior performance in\nother styles; 3) LMMs' reasoning capability can be enhanced by prompting LMMs\nto predict the style first, based on which we propose a versatile and\ntraining-free method for improving LMMs; 4) An intelligent LMM is expected to\ninterpret the causes of its errors when facing stylistic variations.

            "summary": "A combination of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier\nfunctions (CBFs) forms an efficient framework for addressing control challenges\nin safe stabilization. In our previous research, we developed an analytical\ncontrol strategy, namely the universal formula, that incorporates CLF and CBF\nconditions for safe stabilization. However, successful implementation of this\nuniversal formula relies on an accurate model, as any mismatch between the\nmodel and the actual system can compromise stability and safety. In this paper,\nwe propose a new universal formula that leverages Gaussian processes (GPs)\nlearning to address safe stabilization in the presence of model uncertainty. By\nutilizing the results related to bounded learning errors, we achieve a high\nprobability of stability and safety guarantees with the proposed universal\nformula. Additionally, we introduce a probabilistic compatibility condition to\nevaluate conflicts between the modified CLF and CBF conditions with GP learning\nresults. In cases where compatibility assumptions fail and control system\nlimits are present, we propose a modified universal formula that relaxes\nstability constraints and a projection-based method accommodating control\nlimits. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation of\nadaptive cruise control (ACC), highlighting its potential for practical\napplications in real-world scenarios.",

This is done by relating\nthe graphs to certain particle systems that we call Infinite Bin Models (IBM).\nA number of limit theorems are shown. The goal of this paper is to present\nresults along with techniques that have been used in this area. In the case of\n$\\overrightarrow G(\\mathbb Z, p)$ the last passage percolation constant $C(p)$\nis studied in great detail. It is shown that $C(p)$ is analytic for $p>0$, has\nan interesting asymptotic expansion at $p=1$ and that $C(p)/p$ converges to $e$\nlike $1/(\\log p)^2$ as $p \\to 0$. The paper includes the study of IBMs as\nmodels on their own as well as their connections to stochastic models of\nbranching processes in continuous or discrete time with selection. Several\nproofs herein are new or simplified versions of published ones. Regenerative\ntechniques are used where possible, exhibiting random sets of vertices over\nwhich the graphs regenerate. When edges have random weights we show how the\nlast passage percolation constants behave and when central limit theorems\nexist. When the underlying vertex set is partially ordered, new phenomena\noccur, e.g., there are relations with last passage Brownian percolation. We\nalso look at weights that may possibly take negative values and study in detail\nsome special cases that require combinatorial/graph theoretic techniques that\nexhibit some interesting non-differentiability properties of the last passage\npercolation constant. We also explain how to approach the problem of estimation\nof last passage percolation constants by means of perfect simulation.",

Tight monitoring is crucial for\nachieving high precision at a lower cost, with applications such as spray\ncoating. Obtaining HI labels in real-world applications is often\ncost-prohibitive, requiring continuous, precise health measurements. Therefore,\nit is more convenient to leverage run-to failure datasets that may provide\npotential indications of machine wear condition, making it necessary to apply\nsemi-supervised tools for HI construction. In this study, we adapt the Deep\nSemi-supervised Anomaly Detection (DeepSAD) method for HI construction. We use\nthe DeepSAD embedding as a condition indicators to address interpretability\nchallenges and sensitivity to system-specific factors. Then, we introduce a\ndiversity loss to enrich condition indicators. We employ an alternating\nprojection algorithm with isotonic constraints to transform the DeepSAD\nembedding into a normalized HI with an increasing trend. Validation on the PHME\n2010 milling dataset, a recognized benchmark with ground truth HIs demonstrates\nmeaningful HIs estimations.

In this paper we studied a peculiar case of the so\ncalled Deser-Woodard theory consisting in the addition of a non-local term to\nthe Hilbert-Einstein lagrangian, and we derived for the first time contraints\non the dimensionaless non-local parameter A by exploiting the predicted\ngravitational wave emission in three binary pulsars, namely PSR J1012+5307, PSR\nJ0348+0432 and PSR $J1738+0333. We discovered that the instantaneous flux\nstrongly depends on A and that the best constraints (0.12 < A < 0.16) come from\nPSR J1012+5307, for which the GR prediction is outside the observational\nranges. However, since for PSR J1012 + 5307 scintillation is suspected, as\nemerged in a recent census by LOFAR, corruptions in pulsar timing could be\nhidden.

However, researchers question the value of using ViTs as models of\nbiological learning because ViTs are thought to be more data hungry than\nbrains, with ViTs requiring more training data to reach similar levels of\nperformance. To test this assumption, we directly compared the learning\nabilities of ViTs and animals, by performing parallel controlled rearing\nexperiments on ViTs and newborn chicks. We first raised chicks in impoverished\nvisual environments containing a single object, then simulated the training\ndata available in those environments by building virtual animal chambers in a\nvideo game engine. We recorded the first-person images acquired by agents\nmoving through the virtual chambers and used those images to train self\nsupervised ViTs that leverage time as a teaching signal, akin to biological\nvisual systems. When ViTs were trained through the eyes of newborn chicks, the\nViTs solved the same view invariant object recognition tasks as the chicks.\nThus, ViTs were not more data hungry than newborn visual systems: both learned\nview invariant object representations in impoverished visual environments. The\nflexible and generic attention based learning mechanism in ViTs combined with\nthe embodied data streams available to newborn animals appears sufficient to\ndrive the development of animal-like object recognition.",

            "summary": "Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) based on deep learning has proven to be an\neffective and flexible solution, attracting extensive research. Deep neural\nnetworks can learn rich representations from vast amounts of representative\nlabeled data for various applications. In IFD, they achieve high classification\nperformance from signals in an end-to-end manner, without requiring extensive\ndomain knowledge. However, deep learning models usually only perform well on\nthe data distribution they have been trained on. When applied to a different\ndistribution, they may experience performance drops. This is also observed in\nIFD, where assets are often operated in working conditions different from those\nin which labeled data have been collected. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\ndeals with the scenario where labeled data are available in a source domain,\nand only unlabeled data are available in a target domain, where domains may\ncorrespond to operating conditions. Recent methods rely on training with\nconfident pseudo-labels for target samples. However, the confidence-based\nselection of pseudo-labels is hindered by poorly calibrated confidence\nestimates in the target domain, primarily due to over-confident predictions,\nwhich limits the quality of pseudo-labels and leads to error accumulation. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel UDA method called Calibrated Adaptive Teacher\n(CAT), where we propose to calibrate the predictions of the teacher network\nthroughout the self-training process, leveraging post-hoc calibration\ntechniques. We evaluate CAT on domain-adaptive IFD and perform extensive\nexperiments on the Paderborn benchmark for bearing fault diagnosis under\nvarying operating conditions. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on most transfer tasks.",

Thanks to significant\nprogress in computing and numerical modelling, more physical models have been\ndeveloped and a wider parameter space explored to understand the early stages\nof star formation more fully. In this review, I describe the expected physical\nproperties of the first and second core stages and how the inclusion of\ndifferent physics affects those predicted characteristics. I provide an\noverview of chemical models and synthetic observations, looking towards the\npositive identification of the first core in nature, which remains elusive.\nHowever, there are a few likely candidate first cores, which are listed, and I\nbriefly discuss the recent progress in characterising the youngest protostellar\nsources. Chemistry will be instrumental in the firm identification of the first\ncore so we require robust theoretical predictions of the chemical evolution of\nprotostellar cores, especially of the first and second core outflows. Looking\nahead, simulations can shed light on how the protostellar collapse phase shapes\nthe evolution of the protostellar disc. Simulations of dust evolution during\nprotostellar core collapse show there is significant enhancement in grain size\nand abundance towards the centre of the core. Chemical models show that the\nwarm, dense conditions of the first core drive chemical evolution. There is a\nwide scope for further study of the role that the first and second core stages\nplay in determining the structure and composition of the protostellar disc and\nenvelope and, of course, the eventual influence on the formation of planets.",

However, deterministic weather forecasting\nmethods do not support probabilistic predictions, and conversely, probabilistic\nmodels tend to be less accurate. To address these challenges, in this paper, we\nintroduce the \\textbf{\\textit{D}}eterministic \\textbf{\\textit{G}}uidance\n\\textbf{\\textit{D}}iffusion \\textbf{\\textit{M}}odel (DGDM) for probabilistic\nweather forecasting, integrating benefits of both deterministic and\nprobabilistic approaches. During the forward process, both the deterministic\nand probabilistic models are trained end-to-end. In the reverse process,\nweather forecasting leverages the predicted result from the deterministic\nmodel, using as an intermediate starting point for the probabilistic model. By\nfusing deterministic models with probabilistic models in this manner, DGDM is\ncapable of providing accurate forecasts while also offering probabilistic\npredictions. To evaluate DGDM, we assess it on the global weather forecasting\ndataset (WeatherBench) and the common video frame prediction benchmark (Moving\nMNIST). We also introduce and evaluate the Pacific Northwest Windstorm\n(PNW)-Typhoon weather satellite dataset to verify the effectiveness of DGDM in\nhigh-resolution regional forecasting. As a result of our experiments, DGDM\nachieves state-of-the-art results not only in global forecasting but also in\nregional forecasting.

By devising an index function for quantifying the\nimplementation cost of the combined incentives, we analytically construct the\noptimally combined incentive protocol by using optimal control theory. By means\nof theoretical analysis, we identify the mathematical conditions, under which\nthe optimally combined incentive scheme requires the minimal amount of cost.

However, common reliance on high-throughput ab initio data necessarily\ninherits limitations of such data: mismatch with experiments.

We propose using machine learning\nto \"bottle\" such operational intuition into quantifiable descriptors using\nexpertly curated measurement-based data. We introduce \"Materials\nExpert-Artificial Intelligence\" (ME-AI) to encapsulate and articulate this\nhuman intuition. As a first step towards such a program, we focus on the\ntopological semimetal (TSM) among square-net materials as the property inspired\nby the expert-identified descriptor based on structural information: the\ntolerance factor. We start by curating a dataset encompassing 12 primary\nfeatures of 879 square-net materials, using experimental data whenever\npossible. We then use Dirichlet-based Gaussian process regression using a\nspecialized kernel to reveal composite descriptors for square-net topological\nsemimetals. The ME-AI learned descriptors independently reproduce expert\nintuition and expand upon it. Specifically, new descriptors point to\nhypervalency as a critical chemical feature predicting TSM within square-net\ncompounds.

The\nratio of $Z\\rightarrow \\textrm{inv}$ to $Z\\rightarrow\\ell\\ell$ events, where\ninv refers to non-detected particles and $\\ell$ is either an electron or a\nmuon, is measured and corrected for detector effects. Events with at least one\nenergetic central jet with $p_{\\textrm{T}} \\geq 110$ GeV are selected for both\nthe $Z\\rightarrow \\textrm{inv}$ and $Z\\rightarrow\\ell\\ell$ final states to\nobtain a similar phase space in the ratio. The invisible width is measured to\nbe $506\\pm2 \\textrm{ (stat.)} \\pm12 \\textrm{ (syst.)}$ MeV and is the single\nmost precise recoil-based measurement. The result is in agreement with the most\nprecise determination from LEP and the Standard Model prediction based on three\nneutrino generations.",

            "summary": "Speech-driven 3D facial animation has improved a lot recently while most\nrelated works only utilize acoustic modality and neglect the influence of\nvisual and textual cues, leading to unsatisfactory results in terms of\nprecision and coherence. We argue that visual and textual cues are not trivial\ninformation. Therefore, we present a novel framework, namely PMMTalk, using\ncomplementary Pseudo Multi-Modal features for improving the accuracy of facial\nanimation. The framework entails three modules: PMMTalk encoder, cross-modal\nalignment module, and PMMTalk decoder. Specifically, the PMMTalk encoder\nemploys the off-the-shelf talking head generation architecture and speech\nrecognition technology to extract visual and textual information from speech,\nrespectively. Subsequently, the cross-modal alignment module aligns the\naudio-image-text features at temporal and semantic levels. Then PMMTalk decoder\nis employed to predict lip-syncing facial blendshape coefficients. Contrary to\nprior methods, PMMTalk only requires an additional random reference face image\nbut yields more accurate results. Additionally, it is artist-friendly as it\nseamlessly integrates into standard animation production workflows by\nintroducing facial blendshape coefficients. Finally, given the scarcity of 3D\ntalking face datasets, we introduce a large-scale 3D Chinese Audio-Visual\nFacial Animation (3D-CAVFA) dataset. Extensive experiments and user studies\nshow that our approach outperforms the state of the art. We recommend watching\nthe supplementary video.",

            "summary": "We explore a class of adversarial attacks targeting the activations of\nlanguage models. By manipulating a relatively small subset of model\nactivations, $a$, we demonstrate the ability to control the exact prediction of\na significant number (in some cases up to 1000) of subsequent tokens $t$. We\nempirically verify a scaling law where the maximum number of target tokens\n$t_\\mathrm{max}$ predicted depends linearly on the number of tokens $a$ whose\nactivations the attacker controls as $t_\\mathrm{max} = \\kappa a$. We find that\nthe number of bits of control in the input space needed to control a single bit\nin the output space (what we call attack resistance $\\chi$) is remarkably\nconstant between $\\approx 16$ and $\\approx 25$ over 2 orders of magnitude of\nmodel sizes for different language models. Compared to attacks on tokens,\nattacks on activations are predictably much stronger, however, we identify a\nsurprising regularity where one bit of input steered either via activations or\nvia tokens is able to exert control over a similar amount of output bits. This\ngives support for the hypothesis that adversarial attacks are a consequence of\ndimensionality mismatch between the input and output spaces. A practical\nimplication of the ease of attacking language model activations instead of\ntokens is for multi-modal and selected retrieval models, where additional data\nsources are added as activations directly, sidestepping the tokenized input.\nThis opens up a new, broad attack surface. By using language models as a\ncontrollable test-bed to study adversarial attacks, we were able to experiment\nwith input-output dimensions that are inaccessible in computer vision,\nespecially where the output dimension dominates.",

To incorporate drivers' anticipative behaviors and to remove\nimpractical speed discontinuity inherent in the classic\nLighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) traffic model, nonlocal partial differential\nequation (PDE) models with ``look-ahead\" dynamics have been proposed, which\nassume that the speed is a function of weighted downstream traffic density.\nHowever, it lacks data validation on two important questions: whether there\nexist nonlocal dynamics, and how the length and weight of the ``look-ahead\"\nwindow affect the spatial temporal propagation of traffic densities. In this\npaper, we adopt traffic trajectory data from a ring-road experiment and design\na physics-informed neural network to learn the fundamental diagram and\nlook-ahead kernel that best fit the data, and reinvent a data-enhanced nonlocal\nLWR model via minimizing the loss function combining the data discrepancy and\nthe nonlocal model discrepancy. Results show that the learned nonlocal LWR\nyields a more accurate prediction of traffic wave propagation in three\ndifferent scenarios: stop-and-go oscillations, congested, and free traffic. We\nfirst demonstrate the existence of ``look-ahead\" effect with real traffic data.\nThe optimal nonlocal kernel is found out to take a length of around 35 to 50\nmeters, and the kernel weight within 5 meters accounts for the majority of the\nnonlocal effect.

Sketch understanding poses fundamental challenges for\ngeneral-purpose vision algorithms because it requires robustness to the\nsparsity of sketches relative to natural visual inputs and because it demands\ntolerance for semantic ambiguity, as sketches can reliably evoke multiple\nmeanings. While current vision algorithms have achieved high performance on a\nvariety of visual tasks, it remains unclear to what extent they understand\nsketches in a human-like way. Here we introduce SEVA, a new benchmark dataset\ncontaining approximately 90K human-generated sketches of 128 object concepts\nproduced under different time constraints, and thus systematically varying in\nsparsity. We evaluated a suite of state-of-the-art vision algorithms on their\nability to correctly identify the target concept depicted in these sketches and\nto generate responses that are strongly aligned with human response patterns on\nthe same sketch recognition task. We found that vision algorithms that better\npredicted human sketch recognition performance also better approximated human\nuncertainty about sketch meaning, but there remains a sizable gap between model\nand human response patterns. To explore the potential of models that emulate\nhuman visual abstraction in generative tasks, we conducted further evaluations\nof a recently developed sketch generation algorithm (Vinker et al., 2022)\ncapable of generating sketches that vary in sparsity.

Both stitched and unstitched specimen\nsets were designed for comparison. For a size effect study, the ENF specimens\nwere geometrically scaled with three scaling levels. Based on the\nload-displacement data (i.e., global analysis), the fracture energy of the\nspecimen material was analyzed using the compliance calibration method and a\nsize effect theory. The fracture energy values were compared between the\nstitched and unstitched cases to characterize the enhanced fracture toughness\nof stitched composites. For local analysis, two types of digital image\ncorrelation (DIC) systems were employed: microscopic and macroscopic (i.e.,\ncoupon-scale) DIC systems. By analyzing in-plane displacement through the\nthickness, separation development was characterized along predicted fracture\nprocess zones. The impact of out-of-plane stitches on separation propagation\nalong fracture process zones was discussed based on the DIC analysis.

This is in a possible coincidence with our QCD\nsum rule study of [arXiv:2006.01018], where we interpreted the $X17$ as a\ntetraquark state composed of four bare quarks ($u \\bar u d \\bar d$), and\nclaimed that ``A unique feature of this tetraquark assignment is that we\npredict two almost degenerate states with significantly different widths''.\nThese two different tetraquark states are described by two different chiral\ntetraquark currents $\\bar u_L \\gamma_\\mu d_L~\\bar d_L \\gamma^\\mu u_L$ and $\\bar\nu_L \\gamma_\\mu d_L~\\bar d_R \\gamma^\\mu u_R$. To verify whether the tetraquark\nassignment is correct or not, we replace the up and down quarks by the strange\nquarks, and apply the QCD sum rule method to study the other four chiral\ntetraquark currents $\\bar u_L \\gamma_\\mu s_L~\\bar s_L \\gamma^\\mu u_L$, $\\bar\nu_L \\gamma_\\mu s_L~\\bar s_R \\gamma^\\mu u_R$, $\\bar d_L \\gamma_\\mu s_L~\\bar s_L\n\\gamma^\\mu d_L$, and $\\bar d_L \\gamma_\\mu s_L~\\bar s_R \\gamma^\\mu d_R$.

In a\ncommonly accepted range of the model parameter $\\alpha$ in the form factor, the\npredicted branching ratios may reach to the order of $10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$.

This study addresses three problems of applying such\nalgorithms under unbounded stochastic uncertainties: 1) tuning-free regularizer\ndesign, 2) initial condition estimation, and 3) reliable constraint\nsatisfaction, by using stochastic prediction error quantification. The\nregularizer is designed by leveraging the expected output cost. An initial\ncondition estimator is proposed by filtering the measurements with the\none-step-ahead stochastic data-driven prediction. A novel constraint-tightening\nmethod, using second-order cone constraints, is presented to ensure\nhigh-probability chance constraint satisfaction.

Given an arbitrary\nview and two sets of scene images captured at different timestamps, we can\npredict the scene changes in that view, which has significant potential\napplications in scene monitoring and measuring. We conducted preliminary\nstudies and found that such an exciting task cannot be easily achieved by\nutilizing existing NeRFs and 2D change detection methods with many false or\nmissing detections. The main reason is that the 2D change detection is based on\nthe pixel appearance difference between spatial-aligned image pairs and\nneglects the stereo information in the NeRF. To address the limitations, we\npropose the C-NERF to represent scene changes as directional consistency\ndifference-based NeRF, which mainly contains three modules. We first perform\nthe spatial alignment of two NeRFs captured before and after changes. Then, we\nidentify the change points based on the direction-consistent constraint; that\nis, real change points have similar change representations across view\ndirections, but fake change points do not. Finally, we design the change map\nrendering process based on the built NeRFs and can generate the change map of\nan arbitrarily specified view direction. To validate the effectiveness, we\nbuild a new dataset containing ten scenes covering diverse scenarios with\ndifferent changing objects. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art 2D change\ndetection and NeRF-based methods by a significant margin.",

The\napproach avoids alterations caused by well-known finite-size effects of the\ntranslational diffusion. Moreover, a procedure is derived to control and\ncorrect for effects caused by fixed distance-sampling cutoffs and periodic\nboundary conditions. By construction, this approach is capable of accurately\npredicting the correct low-frequency scaling behavior of the intermolecular NMR\ndipole-dipole relaxation rate and thus allows the reliable calculation of the\nfrequency-dependent relaxation rate over many orders of magnitude. Our approach\nis based on the utilisation of the theory of Hwang and Freed for the\nintermolecular dipole-dipole correlation function and its corresponding\nspectral density [J. Chem. Phys. 63, 4017 (1975)] and its combination with data\nfrom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The deviations from the Hwang and\nFreed theory caused by periodic boundary conditions and sampling distance\ncutoffs are quantified by means of random walker Monte Carlo simulations. An\nexpression based on the Hwang and Freed theoryis also suggested for correcting\nthose effects. As a proof of principle, our approach is demonstrated by\ncomputing the frequency-dependent inter- and intramolecular dipolar NMR\nrelaxation rate of the $^1$H nuclei in liquid water at $273\\,\\mbox{K}$ and\n$298\\,\\mbox{K}$ based on simulations of the TIP4P/2005 model.

            "summary": "A machine learning model is traditionally considered robust if its prediction\nremains (almost) constant under input perturbations with small norm. However,\nreal-world tasks like molecular property prediction or point cloud segmentation\nhave inherent equivariances, such as rotation or permutation equivariance. In\nsuch tasks, even perturbations with large norm do not necessarily change an\ninput's semantic content. Furthermore, there are perturbations for which a\nmodel's prediction explicitly needs to change. For the first time, we propose a\nsound notion of adversarial robustness that accounts for task equivariance. We\nthen demonstrate that provable robustness can be achieved by (1) choosing a\nmodel that matches the task's equivariances (2) certifying traditional\nadversarial robustness. Certification methods are, however, unavailable for\nmany models, such as those with continuous equivariances. We close this gap by\ndeveloping the framework of equivariance-preserving randomized smoothing, which\nenables architecture-agnostic certification. We additionally derive the first\narchitecture-specific graph edit distance certificates, i.e. sound robustness\nguarantees for isomorphism equivariant tasks like node classification. Overall,\na sound notion of robustness is an important prerequisite for future work at\nthe intersection of robust and geometric machine learning.",

The daunting challenges in this field stem from the\ndifficulty of optimizing in high-dimensional action spaces and the instability\nintroduced by the bipedal morphology of humanoids. However, the extensive\ncollection of human motion-captured data and the derived datasets of humanoid\ntrajectories, such as MoCapAct, paves the way to tackle these challenges. In\nthis context, we present Humanoid Generalist Autoencoding Planner (H-GAP), a\nstate-action trajectory generative model trained on humanoid trajectories\nderived from human motion-captured data, capable of adeptly handling downstream\ncontrol tasks with Model Predictive Control (MPC). For 56 degrees of freedom\nhumanoid, we empirically demonstrate that H-GAP learns to represent and\ngenerate a wide range of motor behaviours. Further, without any learning from\nonline interactions, it can also flexibly transfer these behaviors to solve\nnovel downstream control tasks via planning. Notably, H-GAP excels established\nMPC baselines that have access to the ground truth dynamics model, and is\nsuperior or comparable to offline RL methods trained for individual tasks.\nFinally, we do a series of empirical studies on the scaling properties of\nH-GAP, showing the potential for performance gains via additional data but not\ncomputing.

Along this line,\nmany of the latest works follow an open-loop evaluation setting on nuScenes to\nstudy the planning behavior. In this paper, we delve deeper into the problem by\nconducting thorough analyses and demystifying more devils in the details. We\ninitially observed that the nuScenes dataset, characterized by relatively\nsimple driving scenarios, leads to an under-utilization of perception\ninformation in end-to-end models incorporating ego status, such as the ego\nvehicle's velocity. These models tend to rely predominantly on the ego\nvehicle's status for future path planning. Beyond the limitations of the\ndataset, we also note that current metrics do not comprehensively assess the\nplanning quality, leading to potentially biased conclusions drawn from existing\nbenchmarks. To address this issue, we introduce a new metric to evaluate\nwhether the predicted trajectories adhere to the road. We further propose a\nsimple baseline able to achieve competitive results without relying on\nperception annotations. Given the current limitations on the benchmark and\nmetrics, we suggest the community reassess relevant prevailing research and be\ncautious whether the continued pursuit of state-of-the-art would yield\nconvincing and universal conclusions.

Unfortunately, because posterior\ndistributions provided by SBI are (potentially crude) approximations of the\ntrue posterior, the resulting decisions can be suboptimal. Here, we address the\nquestion of how to perform Bayesian decision making on stochastic simulators,\nand how one can circumvent the need to compute an explicit approximation to the\nposterior. Our method trains a neural network on simulated data and can predict\nthe expected cost given any data and action, and can, thus, be directly used to\ninfer the action with lowest cost. We apply our method to several benchmark\nproblems and demonstrate that it induces similar cost as the true posterior\ndistribution. We then apply the method to infer optimal actions in a real-world\nsimulator in the medical neurosciences, the Bayesian Virtual Epileptic Patient,\nand demonstrate that it allows to infer actions associated with low cost after\nfew simulations.",

We consider two surrogates:\n(1) a convex interpolating function and (2) an input-convex neural network. We\nhighlight that irrespective of the choice of surrogate the behaviour of the\nsurrogate near the origin and ability of the surrogate to describe the feasible\nregion are key concerns for the closed loop performance of the new MPC problem.\nWe address these concerns by tailoring the design of the surrogate to ensure\ngood performance in both aspects. The paper concludes with a numerical example,\nshowing the clear and significant reduction in computational complexity through\nthe use of these convex surrogates.",

            "summary": "Spatio-temporal forecasting in various domains, like traffic prediction and\nweather forecasting, is a challenging endeavor, primarily due to the\ndifficulties in modeling propagation dynamics and capturing high-dimensional\ninteractions among nodes. Despite the significant strides made by graph-based\nnetworks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors\nclosely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration:\ntime delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional\ninteractions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph\nLearning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In\norder to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a\nseries-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of\nnon-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for\nthe improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal\ninteractions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph\nlearning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph\nstructure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale\ngraph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both\ndelayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node\nvariations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks\nsynergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction\naccuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on\nmeteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its\neffectiveness and superiority.",

Methods. The usual dynamic tools\nfor meteoroid streams were used to describe the behavior of the particles\nejected by the comet. The resulting modeled meteoroid stream was thoroughly\ninspected for collisions between the stream and the Earth. Results. The results\nshow a possible encounter forecast for December 12, 2023, between 8:00 and\n12:30 UT. The slow entry velocity is typically known to cause dim meteors. The\nactivity level of the shower is highly uncertain due to the absence of reported\npast showers. Conclusions. Overall, the most optimal observations on the\nforecasted day would be achieved from Eastern Australia, New Zealand, and\nOceania.

In this approach, the network is\niteratively populated by agents following dynamically evolving fastest paths,\nthat are progressively attracted towards uncongested parts of the network, as\nthe global traffic volume increases. Following the transition of the network\nstate from empty to saturated, we study the emergence of congestion and the\nprogressive disruption of global connectivity due to a relatively small\nfraction of crowded edges.\n  We assess the predictive power of our model by comparing the speed\ndistribution against a large experimental dataset for the London area with\nremarkable results, which also translate into a qualitative similarity of the\ncongestion maps. Also, percolation analysis confirms a quantitative agreement\nof the model with the real data for London. For seven other topologically\ndifferent cities we performed simulations to obtain the Fisher critical\nexponent $\\tau$ that showed no common functional dependence on the traffic\nlevel. The critical exponent $\\gamma$, studied to assess the power-law decay of\nspatial correlation, was found inversely proportional to the number of vehicles\nboth for real and simulated traffic.\n  This simulation approach seems particularly fit to describe qualitative and\nquantitative properties of the network loading process, culminating in\npeak-hour congestion, by using only topological and geographical network\nfeatures.",

The core learning process\nrequires the initialization of model weight matrices within each GNN layer,\nwhich is typically accomplished via classic initialization methods such as\nXavier initialization. However, these methods were originally motivated to\nstabilize the variance of hidden embeddings and gradients across layers of\nFeedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to\navoid vanishing gradients and maintain steady information flow. In contrast,\nwithin the GNN context classical initializations disregard the impact of the\ninput graph structure and message passing on variance. In this paper, we\nanalyze the variance of forward and backward propagation across GNN layers and\nshow that the variance instability of GNN initializations comes from the\ncombined effect of the activation function, hidden dimension, graph structure\nand message passing. To better account for these influence factors, we propose\na new initialization method for Variance Instability Reduction within GNN\nOptimization (Virgo), which naturally tends to equate forward and backward\nvariances across successive layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 15\ndatasets to show that Virgo can lead to superior model performance and more\nstable variance at initialization on node classification, link prediction and\ngraph classification tasks.

In this paper we consolidate these\ntwo types of spirals into a unified description, treating density waves beyond\nthe tight-winding limit, in the regime of shearing and non-steady open spirals.\nThis 'shearing wave' scenario novelly captures swing amplification that enables\nstructure formation above conventional Q thresholds. However, it also\nhighlights the fundamental role of spiral forcing on the amplification process\nin general, whether the wave is shearing or not. Thus it captures resonant and\nnon-resonant mode growth through the donkey effect described by Lynden-Bell &\nKalnajs and, critically, the cessation of growth when donkey behavior is no\nlonger permitted. Our calculations predict growth exclusive to trailing spirals\nabove the Jeans length, the prominence of spirals across a range of\norientations that increases with decreasing arm multiplicity, and a critical\norientation where growth is fastest that is the same for both modes and\nmaterial patterns. Predicted structures are consistent with highly regular,\nhigh-multiplicity gaseous spur features and long filaments spaced close to the\nJeans scale in spirals and bars. Applied to stellar disks, conditions favor low\nmultiplicity (m<5) open trailing spirals with pitch angles in the observed\nrange $10 deg$<$i_p$<$50 deg$. The results of this work serve as a basis for\ndescribing spirals as a unified class of transient waves, abundantly stimulated\nbut narrowly selected for growth depending on local conditions.",

The design of these markets is challenged\nby varying privacy preferences as well as data similarity among data owners.\nRelated works have often overlooked how data similarity impacts pricing and\ndata value through statistical information leakage. We demonstrate that data\nsimilarity and privacy preferences are integral to market design and propose a\nquery-response protocol using local differential privacy for a two-party data\nacquisition mechanism. In our regression data market model, we analyze\nstrategic interactions between privacy-aware owners and the learner as a\nStackelberg game over the asked price and privacy factor.

            "summary": "In the realm of machine learning, the data may contain additional attributes,\nknown as privileged information (PI). The main purpose of PI is to assist in\nthe training of the model and then utilize the acquired knowledge to make\npredictions for unseen samples. Support vector regression (SVR) is an effective\nregression model, however, it has a low learning speed due to solving a convex\nquadratic problem (QP) subject to a pair of constraints. In contrast, twin\nsupport vector regression (TSVR) is more efficient than SVR as it solves two\nQPs each subject to one set of constraints. However, TSVR and its variants are\ntrained only on regular features and do not use privileged features for\ntraining. To fill this gap, we introduce a fusion of TSVR with learning using\nprivileged information (LUPI) and propose a novel approach called twin support\nvector regression with privileged information (TSVR+). The regularization terms\nin the proposed TSVR+ capture the essence of statistical learning theory and\nimplement the structural risk minimization principle. We use the successive\noverrelaxation (SOR) technique to solve the optimization problem of the\nproposed TSVR+, which enhances the training efficiency. As far as our knowledge\nextends, the integration of the LUPI concept into twin variants of regression\nmodels is a novel advancement. The numerical experiments conducted on UCI,\nstock and time series data collectively demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed model.",

Using observations of the\noutput at low- and high-fidelity levels, we propose a method that combines\nGaussian process (GP) regression and Bayesian neural network (BNN), in a method\ncalled GPBNN. The low-fidelity output is treated as a single-fidelity code\nusing classical GP regression. The high-fidelity output is approximated by a\nBNN that incorporates, in addition to the high-fidelity observations,\nwell-chosen realisations of the low-fidelity output emulator. The predictive\nuncertainty of the final surrogate model is then quantified by a complete\ncharacterisation of the uncertainties of the different models and their\ninteraction.

We compute exactly the joint distribution of the positions of\nthe particles in the stationary state, which allows us to compute several\nphysical observables analytically. In particular, we show that the extreme\nvalue statistics (EVS), i.e., the distribution of the position of the rightmost\nparticle has a nontrivial shape in the large $N$ limit. The scaling function\ncharacterizing this EVS has a finite support with a tunable shape (by varying\nthe parameters). Remarkably, this scaling function turns out to be universal.\nFirst, it also describes the distribution of the position of the $k$-th\nrightmost particle in a $1d$ trap.

In this paper, we make the first attempt to\nassess the informativeness of local data derived from diverse domains and\npropose a novel methodology termed Federated Evidential Active Learning (FEAL)\nto calibrate the data evaluation under domain shift. Specifically, we introduce\na Dirichlet prior distribution in both local and global models to treat the\nprediction as a distribution over the probability simplex and capture both\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties by using the Dirichlet-based evidential\nmodel. Then we employ the epistemic uncertainty to calibrate the aleatoric\nuncertainty. Afterward, we design a diversity relaxation strategy to reduce\ndata redundancy and maintain data diversity.

            "summary": "Although vision models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)\nshow impressive generalization performance, their zero-shot robustness is still\nlimited under Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios without fine-tuning. Instead\nof undesirably providing human supervision as commonly done, it is possible to\ntake advantage of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that hold powerful\nvisual understanding abilities. However, MLLMs are shown to struggle with\nvision problems due to the incompatibility of tasks, thus hindering their\nutilization. In this paper, we propose to effectively leverage MLLMs to conduct\nMachine Vision Therapy which aims to rectify the noisy predictions from vision\nmodels. By fine-tuning with the denoised labels, the learning model performance\ncan be boosted in an unsupervised manner. To solve the incompatibility issue,\nwe propose a novel Denoising In-Context Learning (DICL) strategy to align\nvision tasks with MLLMs. Concretely, by estimating a transition matrix that\ncaptures the probability of one class being confused with another, an\ninstruction containing a correct exemplar and an erroneous one from the most\nprobable noisy class can be constructed. Such an instruction can help any MLLMs\nwith ICL ability to detect and rectify incorrect predictions of vision models.\nThrough extensive experiments on ImageNet, WILDS, DomainBed, and other OOD\ndatasets, we carefully validate the quantitative and qualitative effectiveness\nof our method.

            "summary": "Dense retrieval methods have been mostly focused on unstructured text and\nless attention has been drawn to structured data with various aspects, e.g.,\nproducts with aspects such as category and brand. Recent work has proposed two\napproaches to incorporate the aspect information into item representations for\neffective retrieval by predicting the values associated with the item aspects.\nDespite their efficacy, they treat the values as isolated classes (e.g., \"Smart\nHomes\", \"Home, Garden & Tools\", and \"Beauty & Health\") and ignore their\nfine-grained semantic relation. Furthermore, they either enforce the learning\nof aspects into the CLS token, which could confuse it from its designated use\nfor representing the entire content semantics, or learn extra aspect embeddings\nonly with the value prediction objective, which could be insufficient\nespecially when there are no annotated values for an item aspect. Aware of\nthese limitations, we propose a MUlti-granulaRity-aware Aspect Learning model\n(MURAL) for multi-aspect dense retrieval. It leverages aspect information\nacross various granularities to capture both coarse and fine-grained semantic\nrelations between values. Moreover, MURAL incorporates separate aspect\nembeddings as input to transformer encoders so that the masked language model\nobjective can assist implicit aspect learning even without aspect-value\nannotations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets of products and\nmini-programs show that MURAL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nsignificantly.",

            "summary": "Bridge detection in remote sensing images (RSIs) plays a crucial role in\nvarious applications, but it poses unique challenges compared to the detection\nof other objects. In RSIs, bridges exhibit considerable variations in terms of\ntheir spatial scales and aspect ratios. Therefore, to ensure the visibility and\nintegrity of bridges, it is essential to perform holistic bridge detection in\nlarge-size very-high-resolution (VHR) RSIs. However, the lack of datasets with\nlarge-size VHR RSIs limits the deep learning algorithms' performance on bridge\ndetection. Due to the limitation of GPU memory in tackling large-size images,\ndeep learning-based object detection methods commonly adopt the cropping\nstrategy, which inevitably results in label fragmentation and discontinuous\nprediction. To ameliorate the scarcity of datasets, this paper proposes a\nlarge-scale dataset named GLH-Bridge comprising 6,000 VHR RSIs sampled from\ndiverse geographic locations across the globe. These images encompass a wide\nrange of sizes, varying from 2,048*2,048 to 16,38*16,384 pixels, and\ncollectively feature 59,737 bridges. Furthermore, we present an efficient\nnetwork for holistic bridge detection (HBD-Net) in large-size RSIs. The HBD-Net\npresents a separate detector-based feature fusion (SDFF) architecture and is\noptimized via a shape-sensitive sample re-weighting (SSRW) strategy. Based on\nthe proposed GLH-Bridge dataset, we establish a bridge detection benchmark\nincluding the OBB and HBB tasks, and validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nHBD-Net. Additionally, cross-dataset generalization experiments on two publicly\navailable datasets illustrate the strong generalization capability of the\nGLH-Bridge dataset.",

            "summary": "Increased demand for high-performance permanent magnets in the electric\nvehicle and wind turbine industries has prompted the search for cost-effective\nalternatives. Nevertheless, the discovery of new magnetic materials with the\ndesired intrinsic and extrinsic permanent magnet properties presents a\nsignificant challenge. Traditional density functional theory (DFT) accurately\npredicts intrinsic permanent magnet properties such as magnetic moments,\nmagneto-crystalline anisotropy constants, and exchange interactions. However,\nit cannot compute extrinsic macroscopic properties, such as coercivity ($H_c$),\nwhich are influenced by factors like microscopic defects and internal grain\nstructures. Although micromagnetic simulation helps compute $H_c$, it\noverestimates the values almost by an order of magnitude due to Brown's\nparadox. To circumvent these limitations, we employ machine learning (ML)\nmethods in an extensive database obtained from experiments, DFT calculations,\nand micromagnetic modeling. Our novel ML approach is computationally much\nfaster than the micromagnetic simulation program, the mumax$^3$. We\nsuccessfully utilize it to predict $H_c$ values for materials like cerium-doped\n$\\mathrm{Nd}_2\\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\\mathrm{B}$, and subsequently compare the\npredicted values with experimental results. Remarkably, our ML model accurately\nidentifies uniaxial magnetic anisotropy as the primary contributor to $H_c$.\nWith DFT calculations, we predict the Nd-site dependent magnetic anisotropy\nbehavior in $\\mathrm{Nd}_2\\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\\mathrm{B}$, confirming $4f$-site\nplanar and $4g$-site uniaxial to crystalline $c$-direction in good agreement\nwith experiment. The Green's function atomic sphere approximation calculated a\nCurie temperature ($T_{\\rm C}$) for $\\mathrm{Nd}_2\\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\\mathrm{B}$\nthat also agrees well with experiment.",

            "summary": "Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery plays a pivotal role in\nextracting precise information for diverse down-stream applications. Recent\ndevelopment of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), an advanced general-purpose\nsegmentation model, has revolutionized this field, presenting new avenues for\naccurate and efficient segmentation. However, SAM is limited to generating\nsegmentation results without class information. Consequently, the utilization\nof such a powerful general vision model for semantic segmentation in remote\nsensing images has become a focal point of research. In this paper, we present\na streamlined framework aimed at leveraging the raw output of SAM by exploiting\ntwo novel concepts called SAM-Generated Object (SGO) and SAM-Generated Boundary\n(SGB). More specifically, we propose a novel object loss and further introduce\na boundary loss as augmentative components to aid in model optimization in a\ngeneral semantic segmentation framework. Taking into account the content\ncharacteristics of SGO, we introduce the concept of object consistency to\nleverage segmented regions lacking semantic information. By imposing\nconstraints on the consistency of predicted values within objects, the object\nloss aims to enhance semantic segmentation performance. Furthermore, the\nboundary loss capitalizes on the distinctive features of SGB by directing the\nmodel's attention to the boundary information of the object. Experimental\nresults on two well-known datasets, namely ISPRS Vaihingen and LoveDA Urban,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

An external magnetic field can destroy a pair of\nWeyl nodes (which are separated by a momentum space distance $2k_0$) of\nopposite chirality, when the magnetic length $l_B$ becomes close to or smaller\nthan the inverse separation $1/2k_0$. In this work, we investigate pairwise\nannihilation of Weyl nodes by external magnetic field which ranges all the way\nfrom small to a very large value in the Hofstadter regime $l_B \\sim a$. We show\nthat this pairwise annihilation in a WSM featuring two Weyl nodes leads to the\nemergence of either a normal insulator or a layered Chern insulator. In the\ncase of a Weyl semimetal with multiple Weyl nodes, the potential for generating\na variety of states through external magnetic fields emerges.

            "summary": "Sequential recommendation aims to predict the subsequent items matching user\npreference based on her/his historical interactions. With the development of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in exploring the\npotential of LLMs for sequential recommendation by framing it as a language\nmodeling task. Prior works represent items in the textual prompts using either\nID indexing or text indexing and feed the prompts into LLMs, but falling short\nof either encapsulating comprehensive world knowledge or exhibiting sufficient\nsequential understanding. To harness the complementary strengths of traditional\nrecommenders (which encode user behavioral knowledge) and LLMs (which possess\nworld knowledge about items), we propose LLaRA -- a Large Language and\nRecommendation Assistant framework. Specifically, LLaRA represents items in\nLLM's input prompts using a novel hybrid approach that integrates ID-based item\nembeddings from traditional recommenders with textual item features. Viewing\nthe ``sequential behavior of the user'' as a new modality in recommendation, we\nemploy an adapter to bridge the modality gap between ID embeddings of the\ntraditional recommenders and the input space of LLMs. Furthermore, instead of\ndirectly exposing the hybrid prompt to LLMs, we apply a curriculum learning\napproach to gradually ramp up training complexity. We first warm up the LLM\nwith text-only prompting, which aligns more naturally with the LLM's language\nmodeling capabilities. Thereafter, we progressively transition to hybrid\nprompting, training the adapter to incorporate behavioral knowledge from the\ntraditional sequential recommender into the LLM. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the efficacy of LLaRA framework. Our code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/ljy0ustc/LLaRA .",

GDN uses stacking of different\nnetworks to enhance the model performance. Specifically, GDN consists of two\nsequential levels in its structure.

To avoid low accuracy and long training\ntime, the second level takes the output of the GoogLeNet and DenseNet as the\ninput for a logistic regression model. We compare our method with four baseline\nnetworks including ResNet, VGGNet, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet on the dataset, in\nwhich GoogLeNet and DenseNet significantly outperform ResNet and VGGNet. In the\nsecond level, different stacking methods such as perceptron, logistic\nregression, SVM, decision trees and K-neighbor are studied in which Logistic\nRegression shows the best prediction result among all.

Traditional supervised methods often grapple with limited\n3D data availability and struggle to generalize to unseen object categories.\nPartSLIP, a recent advancement, has made significant strides in zero- and\nfew-shot 3D part segmentation. This is achieved by harnessing the capabilities\nof the 2D open-vocabulary detection module, GLIP, and introducing a heuristic\nmethod for converting and lifting multi-view 2D bounding box predictions into\n3D segmentation masks. In this paper, we introduce PartSLIP++, an enhanced\nversion designed to overcome the limitations of its predecessor. Our approach\nincorporates two major improvements. First, we utilize a pre-trained 2D\nsegmentation model, SAM, to produce pixel-wise 2D segmentations, yielding more\nprecise and accurate annotations than the 2D bounding boxes used in PartSLIP.\nSecond, PartSLIP++ replaces the heuristic 3D conversion process with an\ninnovative modified Expectation-Maximization algorithm. This algorithm\nconceptualizes 3D instance segmentation as unobserved latent variables, and\nthen iteratively refines them through an alternating process of 2D-3D matching\nand optimization with gradient descent.

            "summary": "Multifunctional metamaterials (MMM) bear promise as next-generation material\nplatforms supporting miniaturization and customization. Despite many\nproof-of-concept demonstrations and the proliferation of deep learning assisted\ndesign, grand challenges of inverse design for MMM, especially those involving\nheterogeneous fields possibly subject to either mutual meta-atom coupling or\nlong-range interactions, remain largely under-explored. To this end, we present\na data-driven design framework, which streamlines the inverse design of MMMs\ninvolving heterogeneous fields. A core enabler is implicit Fourier neural\noperator (IFNO), which predicts heterogeneous fields distributed across a\nmetamaterial array, thus in general at odds with homogenization assumptions, in\na parameter-/sample-efficient fashion. Additionally, we propose a standard\nformulation of inverse problem covering a broad class of MMMs, and\ngradient-based multitask concurrent optimization identifying a set of\nPareto-optimal architecture-stimulus (A-S) pairs. Fourier multiclass blending\nis proposed to synthesize inter-class meta-atoms anchored on a set of geometric\nmotifs, while enjoying training-free dimension reduction and built-it\nreconstruction. Interlocking the three pillars, the framework is validated for\nlight-bylight programmable plasmonic nanoantenna, whose design involves vast\nspace jointly spanned by quasi-freeform supercells, maneuverable incident phase\ndistributions, and conflicting figure-of-merits involving on-demand\nlocalization patterns. Accommodating all the challenges without a-priori\nsimplifications, our framework could propel future advancements of MMM.",

We leverage social media data, a potent\nsource of public sentiment, in tandem with macroeconomic indicators as\ngovernment-compiled statistics, to refine stock market predictions.

Second, solely focusing on the historical data of a particular\nstock without considering its sector can lead to oversight. Stocks within the\nsame industry often exhibit correlated price behaviors. Lastly, simply\nforecasting the direction of price movement without assessing its magnitude is\nof limited value, as the extent of the rise or fall truly determines\nprofitability.

Utilizing Faiman's heat dissipation model and data\nfiltering method, the study demonstrates favourable comparisons of FT\nexperimental results with literature, while yielding novel heat dissipation\nfactors for SAT modules. Enhanced heat dissipation is observed in no/low wind\nconditions for SAT modules compared to FT modules. Analyses reveal the\ninfluence of plane-of-array (POA) irradiance, wind speed and direction on\nmodule temperature, with SAT modules exhibiting greater heat dissipation\nstability. An investigation into data filtering methods suggests minor\nsensitivity for both configurations, with a slightly more pronounced impact on\nSAT modules. Assessments comparing module temperature predictions using diverse\nheat dissipation factors for FT modules reveal negligible sensitivity. This\nsuggests that exact heat dissipation factor values may not be crucial for\naccurate predictions of module temperature in FT open-rack systems. Annual\npower output simulations using PVsyst software demonstrate a 2.9% and 3.3%\nenhancement for FT and SAT configurations, respectively, when employing\nexperimentally determined heat dissipation factors.

            "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic response highlighted the potential of deep learning\nmethods in facilitating the diagnosis and prognosis of lung diseases through\nautomated segmentation of normal and abnormal tissue in computed tomography\n(CT). Such methods not only have the potential to aid in clinical\ndecision-making but also contribute to the comprehension of novel diseases. In\nlight of the labor-intensive nature of manual segmentation for large chest CT\ncohorts, there is a pressing need for reliable automated approaches that enable\nefficient analysis of chest CT anatomy in vast research databases, especially\nin more scarcely annotated targets such as pneumonia consolidations. A limiting\nfactor for the development of such methods is that most current models optimize\na fixed annotation format per network output. To tackle this problem,\npolymorphic training is used to optimize a network with a fixed number of\noutput channels to represent multiple hierarchical anatomic structures,\nindirectly optimizing more complex labels with simpler annotations. We combined\nover 6000 volumetric CT scans containing varying formats of manual and\nautomated labels from different sources, and used polymorphic training along\nwith multitask learning to develop MEDPSeg, an end-to-end method for the\nsegmentation of lungs, airways, pulmonary artery, and lung lesions with\nseparation of ground glass opacities, and parenchymal consolidations, all in a\nsingle forward prediction. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple\ntargets, particularly in the segmentation of ground glass opacities and\nconsolidations, a challenging problem with limited manual annotation\navailability.

            "summary": "Interpretability methods are critical components for examining and exploring\ndeep neural networks (DNN), as well as increasing our understanding of and\ntrust in them. Vision transformers (ViT), which can be trained to\nstate-of-the-art performance with a self-supervised learning (SSL) training\nmethod, provide built-in attention maps (AM). While AMs can provide\nhigh-quality semantic segmentation of input images, they do not account for any\nsignal coming from a downstream classifier. We introduce class-discriminative\nattention maps (CDAM), a novel post-hoc explanation method that is highly\nsensitive to the target class. Our method essentially scales attention scores\nby how relevant the corresponding tokens are for the predictions of a\nclassifier head. Alternative to classifier outputs, CDAM can also explain a\nuser-defined concept by targeting similarity measures in the latent space of\nthe ViT. This allows for explanations of arbitrary concepts, defined by the\nuser through a few sample images. We investigate the operating characteristics\nof CDAM in comparison with relevance propagation (RP) and token ablation maps\n(TAM), an alternative to pixel occlusion methods. CDAM is highly\nclass-discriminative and semantically relevant, while providing implicit\nregularization of relevance scores.\n  PyTorch implementation: \\url{https://github.com/lenbrocki/CDAM}\n  Web live demo: \\url{https://cdam.informatism.com/}",

            "summary": "Neural Radiance Fields have achieved remarkable results for novel view\nsynthesis but still lack a crucial component: precise measurement of\nuncertainty in their predictions. Probabilistic NeRF methods have tried to\naddress this, but their output probabilities are not typically accurately\ncalibrated, and therefore do not capture the true confidence levels of the\nmodel. Calibration is a particularly challenging problem in the sparse-view\nsetting, where additional held-out data is unavailable for fitting a calibrator\nthat generalizes to the test distribution. In this paper, we introduce the\nfirst method for obtaining calibrated uncertainties from NeRF models. Our\nmethod is based on a robust and efficient metric to calculate per-pixel\nuncertainties from the predictive posterior distribution. We propose two\ntechniques that eliminate the need for held-out data. The first, based on patch\nsampling, involves training two NeRF models for each scene. The second is a\nnovel meta-calibrator that only requires the training of one NeRF model. Our\nproposed approach for obtaining calibrated uncertainties achieves\nstate-of-the-art uncertainty in the sparse-view setting while maintaining image\nquality. We further demonstrate our method's effectiveness in applications such\nas view enhancement and next-best view selection.",

            "summary": "Networks in machine learning offer examples of complex high-dimensional\ndynamical systems reminiscent of biological systems. Here, we study the\nlearning dynamics of Generalized Hopfield networks, which permit a\nvisualization of internal memories. These networks have been shown to proceed\nthrough a 'feature-to-prototype' transition, as the strength of network\nnonlinearity is increased, wherein the learned, or terminal, states of internal\nmemories transition from mixed to pure states. Focusing on the prototype\nlearning dynamics of the internal memories we observe a strong resemblance to\nthe canalized, or low-dimensional, dynamics of cells as they differentiate\nwithin a Waddingtonian landscape. Dynamically, we demonstrate that learning in\na Generalized Hopfield Network proceeds through sequential 'splits' in memory\nspace. Furthermore, order of splitting is interpretable and reproducible. The\ndynamics between the splits are canalized in the Waddington sense -- robust to\nvariations in detailed aspects of the system. In attempting to make the analogy\na rigorous equivalence, we study smaller subsystems that exhibit similar\nproperties to the full system. We combine analytical calculations with\nnumerical simulations to study the dynamical emergence of the\nfeature-to-prototype transition, and the behaviour of splits in the landscape,\nsaddles points, visited during learning. We exhibit regimes where saddles\nappear and disappear through saddle-node bifurcations, qualitatively changing\nthe distribution of learned memories as the strength of the nonlinearity is\nvaried -- allowing us to systematically investigate the mechanisms that\nunderlie the emergence of Waddingtonian dynamics. Memories can thus\ndifferentiate in a predictive and controlled way, revealing new bridges between\nexperimental biology, dynamical systems theory, and machine learning.",

We find that the particle wrapping\nprocess is dictated by the balance between the elastic energy penalty and\nadhesion energy gain, leading to two distinct engulfment pathways, tip-first\nand side-first, emphasizing the significance of the particle orientation in\ndetermining the pathway. Moreover, our experimental results are consistent with\ntheoretical predictions in a state diagram, showcasing how to control the\nwrapping pathway from surfing to partial to complete wrapping by the interplay\nbetween membrane tension and adhesive strength. At moderate particle\nconcentrations, we observed the formation of rod clusters, which exhibited\ncooperative and sequential wrapping. Our study not only contributes to a\ncomprehensive understanding of the mechanistic intricacies of endocytosis by\nhighlighting how the interplay between the anisotropic particle shape,\ncurvature, orientation, membrane tension, and adhesive strength can influence\nthe engulfment pathway but also provides a foundational base for future\nresearch in the field.",

            "summary": "Given the safety-critical functions of autonomous cyber-physical systems\n(CPS) across diverse domains, testing these systems is essential. While\nconventional software and hardware testing methodologies offer partial\ninsights, they frequently do not provide adequate coverage in a CPS. In this\nstudy, we introduce a testing framework designed to systematically formulate\ntest cases, effectively exploring the state space of CPS. This framework\nintroduces a coverage-centric sampling technique, coupled with a cluster-based\nmethodology for training a surrogate model. The framework then uses model\npredictive control within the surrogate model to generates test cases tailored\nto CPS specifications. To evaluate the efficacy of the framework, we applied it\non several benchmarks, spanning from a kinematic car to systems like an\nunmanned aircraft collision avoidance system (ACAS XU) and automatic\ntransmission system. Comparative analyses were conducted against alternative\ntest generation strategies, including randomized testing, as well as\nfalsification using S-TaLiRo.",

Climate-smart agricultural technologies are\nbeing developed to boost yields while decreasing operating expenses. Crop yield\nprediction, on the other hand, is difficult because of the complex and\nnonlinear impacts of cultivar, soil type, management, pest and disease,\nclimate, and weather patterns on crops. To solve this issue, we employ machine\nlearning (ML) to forecast production while considering climate change, soil\ndiversity, cultivar, and inorganic nitrogen levels. From the 1980s to the\n1990s, field data were gathered across the southern cotton belt of the United\nStates. To capture the most current effects of climate change over the previous\nsix years, a second data source was produced using the process-based crop\nmodel, GOSSYM. We concentrated our efforts on three distinct areas inside each\nof the three southern states: Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia. To simplify the\namount of computations, accumulated heat units (AHU) for each set of\nexperimental data were employed as an analogy to use time-series weather data.\nThe Random Forest Regressor yielded a 97.75% accuracy rate, with a root mean\nsquare error of 55.05 kg/ha and an R2 of around 0.98. These findings\ndemonstrate how an ML technique may be developed and applied as a reliable and\neasy-to-use model to support the cotton climate-smart initiative.",

In recent years, they have garnered particular interest,\nboth due to their connection to asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems and\nbecause their observation would serve as a unique test of the nonlinear nature\nof general relativity. Apart from the more commonly known displacement and spin\nmemories, however, there are other memory effects predicted by Einstein's\nequations that are associated with more subleading terms in the asymptotic\nexpansion of the Bondi-Sachs metric. In this paper, we write explicit\nexpressions for these higher memory effects in terms of their charge and flux\ncontributions. Further, by using a numerical relativity simulation of a binary\nblack hole merger, we compute the magnitude and morphology of these terms and\ncompare them to those of the displacement and spin memory. We find that,\nalthough these terms are interesting from a theoretical perspective, due to\ntheir small magnitude they will be particularly challenging to observe with\ncurrent and future detectors.",

We present PatchFusion, a novel tile-based framework\nwith three key components to improve the current state of the art: (1) A\npatch-wise fusion network that fuses a globally-consistent coarse prediction\nwith finer, inconsistent tiled predictions via high-level feature guidance, (2)\nA Global-to-Local (G2L) module that adds vital context to the fusion network,\ndiscarding the need for patch selection heuristics, and (3) A Consistency-Aware\nTraining (CAT) and Inference (CAI) approach, emphasizing patch overlap\nconsistency and thereby eradicating the necessity for post-processing.\nExperiments on UnrealStereo4K, MVS-Synth, and Middleburry 2014 demonstrate that\nour framework can generate high-resolution depth maps with intricate details.\nPatchFusion is independent of the base model for depth estimation.

While prior\ninvestigations primarily relied on non-self-consistent analytic methods to\nestimate the influence of DM spikes on eccentric IMRIs, our work introduces the\nfirst self-consistent treatment of this phenomenon through $N$-body\nsimulations. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that dynamical\nfriction (DF), a cumulative effect of two-body encounters, is the primary\nmechanism responsible for energy dissipation, we reveal that the slingshot\nmechanism, a three-body effect, plays a more significant role in driving the\nbinary system's energy loss and consequent orbital shrinkage, similar to\nstellar loss cone scattering in Massive Black Hole (MBH) binaries. Furthermore,\nour work extends its analysis to include rotation in DM spikes, a factor often\noverlooked in previous studies. We find that binaries that counter-rotate with\nrespect to the spike particles merge faster, while binaries that co-rotate\nmerge slower, in opposition to the expectation from DF theory. While our models\nare idealistic, they offer findings that pave the way for a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the complex interactions between DM spikes, IMRIs, GW\nemission, and the ability to constrain DM microphysics. Our work systematically\nincludes Post-Newtonian (PN) effects until 2.5 order and our results are\naccurate and robust.",

We show here that KN spectral features go through rapid recombination\ntransitions, with features due to elements in the new ionisation state emerging\nquickly. Due to time-delay effects of the rapidly-expanding KN, a 'wave' of\nthese new features passing though the ejecta should be a detectable phenomenon.\nIn particular, isolated line features will emerge as blueshifted absorption\nfeatures first, gradually evolving into more pronounced absorption/emission P\nCygni features and then pure emission features. In this analysis we present the\nevolution of the individual exposures of the KN AT2017gfo observed with\nVLT/X-shooter that together comprise X-shooter's first epoch spectrum (1.43\ndays post-merger). We show that the spectra of these 'sub-epochs' show a\nsignificant evolution across the roughly one hour of observations, including a\ndecrease of the blackbody temperature and photospheric velocity. The early\ncooling is even more rapid than that inferred from later photospheric epochs,\nand suggest a fixed power-law relation between temperature and time cannot\ncapture the data. The cooling constrains the recombination-wave, where a Sr II\ninterpretation of the AT2017gfo $\\sim1 \\mu$m feature predicts both a specific\ntiming for the feature emergence and its early spectral shape, including the\nvery weak emission component observed at 1.43 days. This reverberation analysis\nsuggests that temporal modelling is important for interpreting individual\nspectra and that higher cadence spectral series, especially when concentrated\nat specific times, can provide strong constraints on KN line identifications.\nGiven the use of such short-timescale information, we lay out improved\nobserving strategies for future KN monitoring.",

Instead,\nKepler discovered that systems of small planets frequently have period ratios\nlarger than those associated with mean-motion resonances and rarely have period\nratios smaller than those associated with mean-motion resonances. Both\nshort-timescale processes related to the formation or early evolution of\nplanetary systems and long-timescale secular processes have been proposed as\nexplanations for these observations. Using a thin disk stellar population's\nGalactic velocity dispersion as a relative age proxy, we find that\nKepler-discovered multiple-planet systems with at least one planet pair near a\nperiod ratio suggestive of a second-order mean-motion resonance have a colder\nGalactic velocity dispersion and are therefore younger than both\nsingle-transiting and multiple-planet systems that lack planet pairs consistent\nwith mean-motion resonances. We argue that a non-tidal secular process with a\ncharacteristic timescale no less than a few hundred Myr is responsible for\nmoving systems of low-mass planets away from second-order mean-motion\nresonances. Among systems with at least one planet pair near a period ratio\nsuggestive of a first-order mean-motion resonance, only the population of\nsystems likely affected by tidal dissipation inside their innermost planets has\na small Galactic velocity dispersion and is therefore young. We predict that\nperiod ratios suggestive of mean-motion resonances are more common in young\nsystems with 10 Myr $\\lesssim \\tau \\lesssim 100$ Myr and become less common as\nplanetary systems age.",

Our PSC proposal\nutilizes a hybrid mask-based technique on the non-empty voxels from sparse\nmulti-scale completions. Whereas the SSC literature overlooks uncertainty which\nis critical for robotics applications, we instead propose an efficient\nensembling to estimate both voxel-wise and instance-wise uncertainties along\nPSC. This is achieved by building on a multi-input multi-output (MIMO)\nstrategy, while improving performance and yielding better uncertainty for\nlittle additional compute. Additionally, we introduce a technique to aggregate\npermutation-invariant mask predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod surpasses all baselines in both Panoptic Scene Completion and\nuncertainty estimation on three large-scale autonomous driving datasets.

Two simple yet essential changes are made. First, we\nshift the prediction target from raw pixels to semantic tokens, enabling a\nhigher-level understanding of visual content. Second, we supplement the\nautoregressive modeling by instructing the model to predict not only the next\ntokens but also the visible tokens. This pipeline is particularly effective\nwhen semantic tokens are encoded by discriminatively trained models, such as\nCLIP. We introduce this novel approach as D-iGPT. Extensive experiments\nshowcase that D-iGPT excels as a strong learner of visual representations: A\nnotable achievement of D-iGPT is its compelling performance on the ImageNet-1K\ndataset -- by training on publicly available datasets, D-iGPT achieves 89.5\\%\ntop-1 accuracy with a vanilla ViT-Large model. This model also shows strong\ngeneralization on the downstream task and robustness on out-of-distribution\nsamples.

To ground this prediction\nprocess in auto-regression, we customize a non-causal attention mask for the\ndecoder, incorporating two key features: modeling tokens from different labels\nto be independent, and treating image tokens as a prefix. This masking\nmechanism inspires an efficient method - one-shot sampling - to simultaneously\nsample tokens of multiple labels in parallel and rank generated labels by their\nprobabilities during inference. To further enhance the efficiency, we propose a\nsimple strategy to construct a compact decoder by simply discarding the\nintermediate blocks of a pretrained language model.

Furthermore,\nthe knowledge of models is often encapsulated in the response distribution\nitself and may be transferred from teachers to student in a more fluid way.

Inspired by the image-generation paradigm of VQ-GAN and MaskGIT,\nwhere transformers are used to model the discrete latent sequences of a VQ-VAE,\nwe use GIVT to model the unquantized real-valued latent sequences of a VAE.\nWhen applying GIVT to class-conditional image generation with iterative masked\nmodeling, we show competitive results with MaskGIT, while our approach\noutperforms both VQ-GAN and MaskGIT when using it for causal modeling.

            "summary": "Cultivation experiments often produce sparse and irregular time series.\nClassical approaches based on mechanistic models, like Maximum Likelihood\nfitting or Monte-Carlo Markov chain sampling, can easily account for sparsity\nand time-grid irregularities, but most statistical and Machine Learning tools\nare not designed for handling sparse data out-of-the-box. Among popular\napproaches there are various schemes for filling missing values (imputation)\nand interpolation into a regular grid (alignment). However, such methods\ntransfer the biases of the interpolation or imputation models to the target\nmodel. We show that Deep Set Neural Networks equipped with triplet encoding of\nthe input data can successfully handle bio-process data without any need for\nimputation or alignment procedures. The method is agnostic to the particular\nnature of the time series and can be adapted for any task, for example, online\nmonitoring, predictive control, design of experiments, etc. In this work, we\nfocus on forecasting. We argue that such an approach is especially suitable for\ntypical cultivation processes, demonstrate the performance of the method on\nseveral forecasting tasks using data generated from macrokinetic growth models\nunder realistic conditions, and compare the method to a conventional fitting\nprocedure and methods based on imputation and alignment.",

            "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in\nstoring and recalling factual knowledge, but also in adapting to novel\nin-context information. Yet, the mechanisms underlying their in-context\ngrounding remain unknown, especially in situations where in-context information\ncontradicts factual knowledge embedded in the parameters. This is critical for\nretrieval-augmented generation methods, which enrich the context with\nup-to-date information, hoping that grounding can rectify the outdated\nparametric knowledge. In this study, we introduce Fakepedia, a counterfactual\ndataset designed to evaluate grounding abilities when the parametric knowledge\nclashes with the in-context information. We benchmark various LLMs with\nFakepedia and discover that GPT-4-turbo has a strong preference for its\nparametric knowledge. Mistral-7B, on the contrary, is the model that most\nrobustly chooses the grounded answer. Then, we conduct causal mediation\nanalysis on LLM components when answering Fakepedia queries. We demonstrate\nthat inspection of the computational graph alone can predict LLM grounding with\n92.8% accuracy, especially because few MLPs in the Transformer can predict\nnon-grounded behavior. Our results, together with existing findings about\nfactual recall mechanisms, provide a coherent narrative of how grounding and\nfactual recall mechanisms interact within LLMs.",

We present several schemes achieving entanglement\nenhancement with photon addition and subtraction, and then consider filtration\nas a general probabilistic procedure consisting in acting with local\n(non-unitary) operators on each mode. From this, we identify a sufficient set\nof two conditions on filtration operators for successfully enhancing the\nentanglement of a TMSV state, namely the operators must be Fock-orthogonal\n(i.e., preserving the orthogonality of Fock states) and Fock-amplifying (i.e.,\ngiving larger amplitudes to larger Fock states). Our results notably prove that\nideal photon addition, subtraction, and any concatenation thereof always\nenhance the entanglement of a TMSV state in the sense of majorization theory.\nWe further investigate the case of realistic photon addition (subtraction) and\nare able to upper bound the distance between a realistic photon-added\n(-subtracted) TMSV state and a nearby state that is provably more entangled\nthan the TMSV, thus extending entanglement enhancement to practical schemes via\nthe use of a notion of approximate majorization. Finally, we consider the state\nresulting from $k$-photon addition (on each of the two modes) on a TMSV state.\nWe prove analytically that the state corresponding to $k=1$ majorizes any state\ncorresponding to $2\\leq k \\leq 8$ and we conjecture the validity of the\nstatement for all $k\\geq 9$.",

The available\nbandwidth increases roughly linearly as we increase the carrier frequency, but\nthe range shrinks drastically. This paper explores if we can instead reach\nmassive capacities using spatial multiplexing over multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) channels. In line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, therank of\nthe MIMO channel matrix depends on the polarization and antenna arrangement. We\noptimize the rank and condition number by identifying the optimal antenna\nspacing in dual-polarized planar antenna arrays with imperfect isolation. The\nresult is sparely spaced antenna arrays that exploit radiative near-field\nproperties. We further optimize the array geometry for minimum aperture length\nand aperture area, which leads to different configurations. Moreover, we prove\nanalytically that for fixed-sized arrays, the MIMO rank grows quadratically\nwith the carrier frequency in LOS scenarios, if the antennas are appropriately\ndesigned. Hence, MIMO technology contributes more to the capacity growth than\nthe bandwidth. The numerical results show that massive data rates, far beyond 1\nTbps, can be reached both over fixed point-to-point links.

Consequently, the\nprevalent approach for training machine learning models on data stored in\nrelational databases involves performing feature engineering to merge the data\nfrom multiple tables into a single table and subsequently applying single table\nmodels. This approach not only requires significant effort in feature\nengineering but also destroys the inherent relational structure present in the\ndata. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called\nGraph-based Feature Synthesis (GFS). GFS formulates the relational database as\na heterogeneous graph, thereby preserving the relational structure within the\ndata. By leveraging the inductive bias from single table models, GFS\neffectively captures the intricate relationships inherent in each table.\nAdditionally, the whole framework eliminates the need for manual feature\nengineering.

            "summary": "Acquiring a substantial number of data points for training accurate machine\nlearning (ML) models is a big challenge in scientific fields where data\ncollection is resource-intensive. Here, we propose a novel approach for\nconstructing a minimal yet highly informative database for training ML models\nin complex multi-dimensional parameter spaces. To achieve this, we mimic the\nunderlying relation between the output and input parameters using Gaussian\nprocess regression (GPR). Using a set of known data, GPR provides predictive\nmeans and standard deviation for the unknown data. Given the predicted standard\ndeviation by GPR, we select data points using Bayesian optimization to obtain\nan efficient database for training ML models. We compare the performance of ML\nmodels trained on databases obtained through this method, with databases\nobtained using traditional approaches. Our results demonstrate that the ML\nmodels trained on the database obtained using Bayesian optimization approach\nconsistently outperform the other two databases, achieving high accuracy with a\nsignificantly smaller number of data points. Our work contributes to the\nresource-efficient collection of data in high-dimensional complex parameter\nspaces, to achieve high precision machine learning predictions.",

In this theory quantum particles are localized waves, i.e,\nsolitons, that are solutions of relativistic nonlinear field equations. The\ntheory that we present here is the natural extension of this old work and\nrelies on a strong time-symmetry requiring the presence of advanced and\nretarded waves converging on particles. Using this method, we are able to\njustify wave-particle duality and to explain the violations of Bell's\ninequalities. Moreover, the theory recovers the predictions of the pilot-wave\ntheory of de Borglie and Bohm, often known as Bohmian mechanics. As a direct\nconsequence, we reinterpret the nonlocal action at a distance presents in the\npilot-wave theory. In the double solution developed here there is fundamentally\nno action at a distance but the theory requires a form of superdeterminism\ndriven by time-symmetry.",

While performing model checking at runtime would\noffer a precise solution to the PM problem, it is generally computationally\nexpensive. To address this scalability issue, several lightweight approaches\nbased on machine learning have recently been proposed. These approaches work by\nlearning an approximate yet efficient surrogate (deep learning) model of the\nexpensive model checker. A key challenge remains to ensure reliable\npredictions, especially in safety-critical applications. We review our recent\nwork on predictive monitoring, one of the first to propose learning-based\napproximations for CPS verification of temporal logic specifications and the\nfirst in this context to apply conformal prediction (CP) for rigorous\nuncertainty quantification. These CP-based uncertainty estimators offer\nstatistical guarantees regarding the generalization error of the learning\nmodel, and they can be used to determine unreliable predictions that should be\nrejected. In this tutorial, we present a general and comprehensive framework\nsummarizing our approach to the predictive monitoring of CPSs, examining in\ndetail several variants determined by three main dimensions: system dynamics\n(deterministic, non-deterministic, stochastic), state observability, and\nsemantics of requirements' satisfaction (Boolean or quantitative).",

In this study we investigate the influence\nof arrangement on the overall structural behaviour of the resulting\ninterlocking assemblies. This is performed using the Versatile Block, as it can\nbe arranged in three different doubly periodic ways given by wallpaper\nsymmetries. Our focus lies on the load transfer mechanisms from the assembly\nonto the frame. For fast a priori evaluation of the assemblies we introduce a\ncombinatorial model called Interlocking Flows. To investigate our assemblies\nfrom a mechanical point of view we conduct several finite element studies.\nThese reveal a strong influence of arrangement on the structural behaviour, for\ninstance, an impact on both the point and amount of maximum deflection. The\nresults of the finite element analysis are in very good agreement with the\npredictions of the Interlocking Flow model.

The primary way in which solar activity affects the Earth's\nenvironment is via the solar wind and its transients. However, the relationship\nbetween solar activity and solar wind is not the same at the Space Weather and\nSpace Climate time scales. In this work, we investigate this relationship\nexploiting five solar cycles data of Ca II K index and solar wind parameters,\nby taking advantage of the Hilbert-Huang Transform, which allows to separate\nthe contribution at the different time scales. By filtering out the high\nfrequency components and looking at decennial time scales, we confirm the\npresence of a delayed response of solar wind to Ca II K index variations, with\na time lag of ~ 3.1-year for the speed and ~ 3.4-year for the dynamic pressure.\nTo assess the results in a stronger framework, we make use of a Transfer\nEntropy approach to investigate the information flow between the quantities and\nto test the causality of the relation. The time lag results from the latter are\nconsistent with the cross-correlation ones, pointing out the presence of a\nstatistical significant information flow from Ca II K index to solar wind\ndynamic pressure that peaks at time lag of 3.6-year.

One of the possible hypotheses is that when the\nprotoplanetary disk of the solar system had already formed, a very close\n$(<1\\,\\mathrm{pc})$ supernova (SN) injected radioactive material directly into\nthe disk. Such a $^{26}$Al injection hypothesis has been tested so far with\nvery limited setups for disk structure and supernova distance, and then by\ncomparing disruption and injection conditions separately. We extend this\nproblem to analytically investigate whether there are conditions under which\nthe surviving disk radius can confine enough $^{26}$Al for planet formation\nwhile allowing some disk disruption. We also consider a variety of i) disk mass\nand structure, ii) $^{26}$Al yields from SNs, and iii) large dust mass fraction\n$\\eta_\\mathrm{d}$. We find that $^{26}$Al yields of SN are required as $\\gtrsim\n2.1\\times10^{-3}M_\\odot(\\eta_\\mathrm{d}/0.2)^{-1}$, which is difficult to\nreproduce given the diversity of ejected $^{26}$Al mass and large dust mass\nfractions from the supernovae. Furthermore, we find that even if the above\nconditions are met, the SN shock changes the disk temperature. Our results\nplace a strong constraint on the 'disk injection scenario'; a scenario in which\nfresh $^{26}$Al of the early Solar System is injected from a supernova into an\nalready formed protosolar nebula is quite challenging. Rather, we suggest that\nthe fresh $^{26}$Al of the early solar system must have been\nsynthesized/injected in other ways.",

The main background\nprocesses are from Standard Model $Z$ boson production in association with\nphotons or jets.

To achieve this, current works try to\nconstruct a Tri-Perspective View (TPV) or Occupancy (OCC) representation\nextending from the Bird-Eye-View perception. However, compressed views like TPV\nrepresentation lose 3D geometry information while raw and sparse OCC\nrepresentation requires heavy but reducant computational costs. To address the\nabove limitations, we propose Compact Occupancy TRansformer (COTR), with a\ngeometry-aware occupancy encoder and a semantic-aware group decoder to\nreconstruct a compact 3D OCC representation. The occupancy encoder first\ngenerates a compact geometrical OCC feature through efficient explicit-implicit\nview transformation. Then, the occupancy decoder further enhances the semantic\ndiscriminability of the compact OCC representation by a coarse-to-fine semantic\ngrouping strategy. Empirical experiments show that there are evident\nperformance gains across multiple baselines, e.g., COTR outperforms baselines\nwith a relative improvement of 8%-15%, demonstrating the superiority of our\nmethod.",

Our research demonstrates that existing\nstate-of-the-art UAD approaches do not generalise well to diverse types of\nanomalies in realistic multi-modal MR data. To overcome this, we introduce a\nnew UAD method named Aggregated Normative Diffusion (ANDi). ANDi operates by\naggregating differences between predicted denoising steps and ground truth\nbackwards transitions in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) that\nhave been trained on pyramidal Gaussian noise. We validate ANDi against three\nrecent UAD baselines, and across three diverse brain MRI datasets. We show that\nANDi, in some cases, substantially surpasses these baselines and shows\nincreased robustness to varying types of anomalies. Particularly in detecting\nmultiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, ANDi achieves improvements of up to 178% in\nterms of AUPRC.",

            "summary": "We report on radio timing observations of PSR J0210+5845 which reveal large\ndeviations from typical pulsar spin-down behaviour. We interpret these\ndeviations as being due to binary motion around the $V=13.5$ star 2MASS\nJ02105640$+$5845176, which is coincident in celestial position and distance\nwith the pulsar. Archival observations and new optical spectroscopy identify\nthis star as a B6V star with a temperature of $T_\\mathrm{eff}\\approx 14\\,000$K\nand a mass of $M_\\mathrm{c}= 3.5$ to $3.8$M$_\\odot$, making it the lowest mass\nmain-sequence star known orbiting a non-recycled pulsar. We found that the\ntiming observations constrain the binary orbit to be wide and moderately\neccentric, with an orbital period of $P_\\mathrm{b}=47^{+40}_{-14}$yr and\neccentricity $e=0.46^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$. We predict that the next periastron\npassage will occur between 2030 and 2034. Due to the low companion mass, we\nfind that the probability for a system with the properties of PSR J0210+5845\nand its binary companion to survive the supernova is low. We show that a low\nvelocity and fortuitously directed natal kick is required for the binary to\nremain bound during the supernova explosion, and argue that an electron-capture\nsupernova is a plausible formation scenario for the pulsar.",

We develop a spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model for\nbias-corrected estimation of arrival dates of the first migratory bird\nindividuals at a breeding site. Higher sampling effort could be correlated with\nearlier observed dates. We implement data fusion of two citizen-science\ndatasets with sensibly different protocols (BBS, eBird) and map posterior\ndistributions of the latent process, which contains four spatial components\nwith Gaussian process priors: species niche; sampling effort; position and\nscale parameters of annual first date of arrival. The data layer includes four\nresponse variables: counts of observed eBird locations (Poisson);\npresence-absence at observed eBird locations (Binomial); BBS occurrence counts\n(Poisson); first arrival dates (Generalized Extreme-Value). We devise a Markov\nChain Monte Carlo scheme and check by simulation that the latent process\ncomponents are identifiable. We apply our model to several migratory bird\nspecies in the northeastern US for 2001--2021. The sampling effort is shown to\nsignificantly modulate the observed first arrival date. We exploit this\nrelationship to effectively debias predictions of the true first arrival dates.",

            "summary": "Investigating the response of icy dust aggregates to water ice sublimation is\nessential for understanding the formation and properties of planetesimals in\nprotoplanetary discs. However, their fate remains unclear, as previous studies\nsuggest aggregates could either survive or completely fall apart to\n(sub){\\mu}m-sized grains. Protoplanetary discs around stars undergoing\naccretion outbursts represent a unique laboratory to study the ice sublimation\nprocess, as the water snowline is pushed outward to regions accessible to\ncurrent observatories. In this work, we aim to understand the aggregates'\nresponse to ice sublimation by focusing on V883 Ori, a system currently\nundergoing a powerful accretion outburst. We present new analysis of archival\nhigh resolution ALMA observations of the protoplanetary disc of V883 Ori at\n0.88, 1.3, 2.0, and 3.1 mm, and derive new radial spectral index profiles,\nwhich we compare with predictions from one-dimensional dust evolution\nsimulations. In the region of V883 Ori where water ice has sublimated, we find\nlower spectral indices than previously obtained, indicating the presence of\ncm-sized particles. Coupled with our dust evolution models, we find that the\nonly way to explain their presence is to assume they formed before the\noutburst, and survived the sublimation process. The resilience of dust\naggregates to such intense events leads us to speculate that it may extend to\nother environments with more gentle heating, such as pebbles drifting through\nthe water snowline in quiescent protoplanetary discs. In that case, it may\nalter the formation pathway of dry planetesimals interior to the snowline.",

We\napply this approach to marine navigation, combining RL with PSF on a simulated\nCybership II model.

With the success of Pre-trained Language\nModels (PLMs) such as BERT, they have been applied for text encoding for KGC.\nHowever, the current methods mostly prefer to fine-tune PLMs, leading to huge\ntraining costs and limited scalability to larger PLMs. In contrast, we propose\nto utilize prompts and perform KGC on a frozen PLM with only the prompts\ntrained. Accordingly, we propose a new KGC method named PDKGC with two prompts\n-- a hard task prompt which is to adapt the KGC task to the PLM pre-training\ntask of token prediction, and a disentangled structure prompt which learns\ndisentangled graph representation so as to enable the PLM to combine more\nrelevant structure knowledge with the text information. With the two prompts,\nPDKGC builds a textual predictor and a structural predictor, respectively, and\ntheir combination leads to more comprehensive entity prediction. Solid\nevaluation on two widely used KGC datasets has shown that PDKGC often\noutperforms the baselines including the state-of-the-art, and its components\nare all effective.

            "summary": "This work uses game theory as a mathematical framework to address interaction\nmodeling in multi-agent motion forecasting and control. Despite its\ninterpretability, applying game theory to real-world robotics, like automated\ndriving, faces challenges such as unknown game parameters. To tackle these, we\nestablish a connection between differential games, optimal control, and\nenergy-based models, demonstrating how existing approaches can be unified under\nour proposed Energy-based Potential Game formulation. Building upon this, we\nintroduce a new end-to-end learning application that combines neural networks\nfor game-parameter inference with a differentiable game-theoretic optimization\nlayer, acting as an inductive bias. The analysis provides empirical evidence\nthat the game-theoretic layer adds interpretability and improves the predictive\nperformance of various neural network backbones using two simulations and two\nreal-world driving datasets.",

However, the influence of pre-stress states on the\npropagation of Lamb waves in thin-walled structures is not fully covered, yet.\nSo far experimental work presented in the literature only focuses on a few\nindividual frequencies, which does not allow a comprehensive verification of\nthe numerous numerical investigations. Furthermore, most work is based on the\nstrain-energy density function by Murnaghan. To validate the common modeling\napproach and to investigate the suitability of other non-linear strain-energy\ndensity functions an extensive experimental and numerical investigation\ncovering a large frequency range is presented here. The numerical simulation\ncomprises the use of the Neo-Hooke as well as the Murnaghan material model. It\nis found that these two material models show qualitatively similar results.\nFurthermore, the comparison with the experimental results reveals, that the\nNeo-Hooke material model reproduces the effect of pre-stress on the difference\nin the Lamb wave phase velocity very well in most cases. For the $A_0$ wave\nmode at higher frequencies, however, the sign of this difference is only\ncorrectly predicted by the Murnaghan model. In contrast to this the Murnaghan\nmaterial model fails to predict the sign change for the $S_0$ wave mode.",

These\nanalytical results characterize how the generalization error depends on the\nnetwork structure, the task similarity and the number of tasks, and show how\nthese dependencies are intertwined. In particular, our results show that the\ngeneralization error can be significantly reduced by adjusting the network\nsize, where the most favorable network size depends on task similarity and the\nnumber of tasks.

While significant\nprogress has been observed in computer vision and natural language processing,\nits exploration in tabular data, ubiquitous in many industrial applications,\nremains nascent. To bridge this gap, we present Wild-Tab, a large-scale\nbenchmark tailored for OOD generalization in tabular regression tasks. The\nbenchmark incorporates 3 industrial datasets sourced from fields like weather\nprediction and power consumption estimation, providing a challenging testbed\nfor evaluating OOD performance under real-world conditions. Our extensive\nexperiments, evaluating 10 distinct OOD generalization methods on Wild-Tab,\nreveal nuanced insights. We observe that many of these methods often struggle\nto maintain high-performance levels on unseen data, with OOD performance\nshowing a marked drop compared to in-distribution performance. At the same\ntime, Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), despite its simplicity, delivers\nrobust performance across all evaluations, rivaling the results of\nstate-of-the-art methods. Looking forward, we hope that the release of Wild-Tab\nwill facilitate further research on OOD generalization and aid in the\ndeployment of machine learning models in various real-world contexts where\nhandling distribution shifts is a crucial requirement.",

            "summary": "Zero-shot age estimation aims to learn feature information about age from\ninput images and make inferences about a given person's image or video frame\nwithout specific sample data. The development of zero-shot age estimation can\nimprove the efficiency and accuracy of various applications (e.g., age\nverification and secure access control, etc.), while also promoting research on\nmulti-modal and zero-shot learning in the social media field. For example,\nzero-sample age estimation can be used to create social networks focused on\nspecific age groups. However, existing methods mainly focus on supervised,\nlabeled age estimation learning, and the prediction effect of zero-shot\nlearning is very poor. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel\nCLIP-driven Zero-shot Learning for Correcting Inverse Age Estimation\n(CZL-CIAE). Specifically, we first introduce the CLIP model to extract image\nfeatures and text semantic information respectively, and map them into a highly\nsemantically aligned high-dimensional feature space. Next, we designed a new\nTransformer architecture (i.e., FourierFormer) to achieve channel evolution and\nspatial interaction of images, and to fuse image and text semantic information.\nFinally, we introduce reversible age estimation, which uses end-to-end error\nfeedback to reduce the error rate of age predictions. Through extensive\nexperiments on multiple data sets, CZL-CIAE has achieved better age prediction\nresults.",

            "summary": "Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of a\nperson based on a given textual description. The key challenge is to learn the\nrelations between detailed information from visual and textual modalities.\nExisting works focus on learning a latent space to narrow the modality gap and\nfurther build local correspondences between two modalities. However, these\nmethods assume that image-to-text and text-to-image associations are\nmodality-agnostic, resulting in suboptimal associations. In this work, we show\nthe discrepancy between image-to-text association and text-to-image association\nand propose CADA: Cross-Modal Adaptive Dual Association that finely builds\nbidirectional image-text detailed associations. Our approach features a\ndecoder-based adaptive dual association module that enables full interaction\nbetween visual and textual modalities, allowing for bidirectional and adaptive\ncross-modal correspondence associations. Specifically, the paper proposes a\nbidirectional association mechanism: Association of text Tokens to image\nPatches (ATP) and Association of image Regions to text Attributes (ARA). We\nadaptively model the ATP based on the fact that aggregating cross-modal\nfeatures based on mistaken associations will lead to feature distortion. For\nmodeling the ARA, since the attributes are typically the first distinguishing\ncues of a person, we propose to explore the attribute-level association by\npredicting the masked text phrase using the related image region. Finally, we\nlearn the dual associations between texts and images, and the experimental\nresults demonstrate the superiority of our dual formulation. Codes will be made\npublicly available.",

            "summary": "Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), renowned for their interpretability, have\nbecome increasingly vital in representing complex stochastic processes in\nvarious domains such as gene expression analysis, healthcare, and traffic\nprediction. Structure learning of DBNs from data is challenging, particularly\nfor datasets with thousands of variables. Most current algorithms for DBN\nstructure learning are adaptations from those used in static Bayesian Networks\n(BNs), and are typically focused on small-scale problems. In order to solve\nlarge-scale problems while taking full advantage of existing algorithms, this\npaper introduces a novel divide-and-conquer strategy, originally developed for\nstatic BNs, and adapts it for large-scale DBN structure learning. In this work,\nwe specifically concentrate on 2 Time-sliced Bayesian Networks (2-TBNs), a\nspecial class of DBNs. Furthermore, we leverage the prior knowledge of 2-TBNs\nto enhance the performance of the strategy we introduce. Our approach\nsignificantly improves the scalability and accuracy of 2-TBN structure\nlearning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,\nshowing substantial improvements over existing algorithms in both computational\nefficiency and structure learning accuracy. On problem instances with more than\n1,000 variables, our approach improves two accuracy metrics by 74.45% and\n110.94% on average , respectively, while reducing runtime by 93.65% on average.",

While there has been a body of research attempting to infer the\npolitical leaning of social media users, this has been typically simplified as\na binary classification problem (e.g. left vs right) and has been limited to a\nsingle location, leading to a dearth of investigation into more complex,\nmulticlass classification and its generalizability to different locations,\nparticularly those with multi-party systems. Our work performs the first such\neffort by studying political leaning inference in three of the UK's nations\n(Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each of which has a different political\nlandscape composed of multiple parties. To do so, we collect and release a\ndataset comprising users labelled by their political leaning as well as\ninteractions with one another. We investigate the ability to predict the\npolitical leaning of users by leveraging these interactions in challenging\nscenarios such as few-shot learning, where training data is scarce, as well as\nassessing the applicability to users with different levels of political\nengagement. We show that interactions in the form of retweets between users can\nbe a very powerful feature to enable political leaning inference, leading to\nconsistent and robust results across different regions with multi-party\nsystems. However, we also see that there is room for improvement in predicting\nthe political leaning of users who are less engaged in politics.",

            "summary": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning that forecasts future events based\non historical snapshots distributed over timestamps is denoted as extrapolation\nand has gained significant attention. Owing to its extreme versatility and\nvariation in spatial and temporal correlations, TKG reasoning presents a\nchallenging task, demanding efficient capture of concurrent structures and\nevolutional interactions among facts. While existing methods have made strides\nin this direction, they still fall short of harnessing the diverse forms of\nintrinsic expressive semantics of TKGs, which encompass entity correlations\nacross multiple timestamps and periodicity of temporal information. This\nlimitation constrains their ability to thoroughly reflect historical\ndependencies and future trends. In response to these drawbacks, this paper\nproposes an innovative reasoning approach that focuses on Learning Multi-graph\nStructure (LMS). Concretely, it comprises three distinct modules concentrating\non multiple aspects of graph structure knowledge within TKGs, including\nconcurrent and evolutional patterns along timestamps, query-specific\ncorrelations across timestamps, and semantic dependencies of timestamps, which\ncapture TKG features from various perspectives. Besides, LMS incorporates an\nadaptive gate for merging entity representations both along and across\ntimestamps effectively. Moreover, it integrates timestamp semantics into graph\nattention calculations and time-aware decoders, in order to impose temporal\nconstraints on events and narrow down prediction scopes with historical\nstatistics. Extensive experimental results on five event-based benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that LMS outperforms state-of-the-art extrapolation\nmodels, indicating the superiority of modeling a multi-graph perspective for\nTKG reasoning.",

            "summary": "Many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) add self-loops to a graph to include\nfeature information about a node itself at each layer. However, if the GNN\nconsists of more than one layer, this information can return to its origin via\ncycles in the graph topology. Intuition suggests that this \"backflow\" of\ninformation should be larger in graphs with self-loops compared to graphs\nwithout. In this work, we counter this intuition and show that for certain GNN\narchitectures, the information a node gains from itself can be smaller in\ngraphs with self-loops compared to the same graphs without. We adopt an\nanalytical approach for the study of statistical graph ensembles with a given\ndegree sequence and show that this phenomenon, which we call the self-loop\nparadox, can depend both on the number of GNN layers $k$ and whether $k$ is\neven or odd. We experimentally validate our theoretical findings in a synthetic\nnode classification task and investigate its practical relevance in 23\nreal-world graphs.",

Previous studies assumed inflation to occur in a valley of the\npotential, employing the single-field approximation. In this work, we explore\nan alternative scenario for the type-II seesaw leptogenesis, where the\ninflation takes place along a ridge of the potential. Firstly, we conduct a\ncomprehensive numerical calculation in the canonical scenario, where inflation\noccurs in a valley, confirming the effectiveness of the single-field\napproximation. Then, we introduce a novel scenario wherein inflation initiates\nalong the potential's ridge and transitions to the valley in the late stages.\nIn this case, the single-field inflation approximation is no longer valid, yet\nleptogenesis is still successfully achieved. We find that this scenario can\ngenerate a significant non-Gaussianity signature, offering testable predictions\nfor future experiments.",

Recent one-stage methods adopt a transformer decoder to\ncollect image-wide cues that are useful for interaction prediction; however,\nthe interaction representations obtained using this method are entangled and\nlack interpretability. In contrast, traditional two-stage methods benefit\nsignificantly from their ability to compose interaction features in a\ndisentangled and explainable manner. In this paper, we improve the performance\nof one-stage methods by enabling them to extract disentangled interaction\nrepresentations. First, we propose Shunted Cross-Attention (SCA) to extract\nhuman appearance, object appearance, and global context features using\ndifferent cross-attention heads. This is achieved by imposing different masks\non the cross-attention maps produced by the different heads. Second, we\nintroduce the Interaction-aware Pose Estimation (IPE) task to learn\ninteraction-relevant human pose features using a disentangled decoder. This is\nachieved with a novel attention module that accurately captures the human\nkeypoints relevant to the current interaction category. Finally, our approach\nfuses the appearance feature and pose feature via element-wise addition to form\nthe interaction representation. Experimental results show that our approach can\nbe readily applied to existing one-stage HOI detectors. Moreover, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO.",

In our research, we introduce a fresh\nperspective on urban mobility prediction. Instead of oversimplifying urban\nmobility data as traditional video data, we regard it as a complex multivariate\ntime series. This perspective involves treating the time-varying values of each\ngrid in each channel as individual time series, necessitating a thorough\nexamination of temporal dynamics, cross-variable correlations, and\nfrequency-domain insights for precise and reliable predictions. To address this\nchallenge, we present the Super-Multivariate Urban Mobility Transformer\n(SUMformer), which utilizes a specially designed attention mechanism to\ncalculate temporal and cross-variable correlations and reduce computational\ncosts stemming from a large number of time series. SUMformer also employs\nlow-frequency filters to extract essential information for long-term\npredictions.

Our goal in this paper is to find a configuration that adheres to\nuser-specified limits on certain risks while being useful with respect to other\nconflicting metrics. We solve this by combining Bayesian Optimization (BO) with\nrigorous risk-controlling procedures, where our core idea is to steer BO\ntowards an efficient testing strategy. Our BO method identifies a set of Pareto\noptimal configurations residing in a designated region of interest. The\nresulting candidates are statistically verified and the best-performing\nconfiguration is selected with guaranteed risk levels. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach on a range of tasks with multiple desiderata,\nincluding low error rates, equitable predictions, handling spurious\ncorrelations, managing rate and distortion in generative models, and reducing\ncomputational costs.",

Existing default prediction\nstudies on the basis of gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), deep learning\ntechniques, and feature selection strategies can have varying degrees of\nsuccess depending on the specific task. Motivated by this, we propose\nTab-Attention, a novel self-attention-based stacked generalization method for\ncredit default prediction.

We organize multi-view feature spaces\naccording to the latent linear or nonlinear strengths between features and\nlabels. Meanwhile, the f1 score assists the model in imbalance training to find\nthe optimal state for identifying minority default samples. Our Tab-Attention\nachieves superior Recall_1 and f1_1 of default intention recognition than\nexisting GBDT-based models and advanced deep learning by about 32.92% and\n16.05% on average, respectively, while maintaining outstanding overall\nperformance and prediction performance for non-default samples.

The new index emerges from recent\ndevelopments in forecast verification of extreme events: it is derived as a\nconsistent forecast with the diagonal score, a weighted version of the\ncontinuous ranked probability score targetting high-impact events. In this\nstudy, we emphasise the importance of forecast discretisation for communication\npurposes and decision-making. A forecast is actionable in the situation where a\nuser can decide to take action when a threshold is exceeded by the forecast.\nForecast verification is performed to assess both the potential skill of the\ndifferent indices as well as their specific skill as actionable forecasts.\nAmong the investigated actionable forecasts, the new proposed index\ndemonstrates the strongest discrimination power, in particular at longer lead\ntimes, paving the way for seamless predictions of high-impact weather across\ntime ranges.",

            "summary": "Elastic wave speeds are fundamental in geomechanics and have historically\nbeen described by an analytic formula that assumes linearly elastic solid\nmedium. Empirical relations stemming from this assumption were used to\ndetermine nonlinearly elastic stiffness relations that depend on pressure,\ndensity, and other state variables. Evidently, this approach introduces a\nmathematical and physical disconnect between the derivation of the analytical\nwave speed (and thus stiffness) and the empirically generated stiffness\nconstants. In our study, we derive wave speeds for energy-conserving\n(hyperelastic) and non-energy-conserving (hypoelastic) constitutive models that\nhave a general dependence on pressure and density. Under isotropic compression\nstates, the analytical solutions for both models converge to previously\ndocumented empirical relations. Conversely, in the presence of shear,\nhyperelasticity predicts changes in the longitudinal and transverse wave speed\nratio. This prediction arises from terms that ensure energy conservation in the\nhyperelastic model, without needing fabric to predict such an evolution, as was\nsometimes assumed in previous investigations. Such insights from\nhyperelasticity could explain the previously unaccounted-for evolution of\nlongitudinal wave speeds in oedometric compression. Finally, the procedure used\nherein is general and could be extended to account for other relevant state\nvariables of soils, such as grain-size, grain-shape, or saturation.",

            "summary": "Liquid ammonia combustion can be enhanced by co-firing with small molecular\nfuels such as methane, and liquid ammonia will undergo flash evaporation due to\nits relatively low saturation pressure. These characteristics, involving the\npresence of multiple fuel streams, a rapid phase change process, and strong\nheat loss, pose challenges for flamelet modeling of liquid ammonia combustion.\nTo address these issues, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of\nflamelet-based models for liquid ammonia combustion in a turbulent mixing\nlayer. Specifically, the extended flamelet/progress variable (E-FPV), extended\nflamelet-generated manifolds (E-FGM), and extended hybrid (E-Hybrid) models are\ndeveloped and assessed. Firstly, a three-dimensional Point-Particle Direct\nNumerical Simulation (PP-DNS) with detailed chemistry is performed, where the\nturbulent flow is fully resolved, and the ammonia droplets are described by the\nLagrangian method, to investigate the combustion characteristics of a liquid\nammonia/methane co-fired flame and to provide state-of-the-art validation data\nfor flamelet modeling. The PP-DNS results reveal distinct stages in the liquid\nammonia/methane co-fired flame. The phase change process introduces significant\nheat loss due to the high latent heat of liquid ammonia. Subsequently,\nflamelet-based models are developed to account for the complex fuel streams,\nrapid phase change process, and strong local heat loss. The performance of\nthese models is evaluated through a priori analysis by comparing the\npredictions with the PP-DNS results. The a priori results show that the E-FGM\nmodel outperforms the E-FPV and E-Hybrid models. This superior performance can\nbe attributed to the rapid flash evaporation and sufficient mixing of the\nsuperheated ammonia, resulting in the dominance of the premixed combustion mode\nin liquid ammonia combustion.",

A key component of these optimizers is the so-called preconditioning\nmatrix, providing enhanced gradient information and regulating the step size of\neach gradient direction. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to\ndesigning the preconditioning matrix by utilizing the gradient difference\nbetween two successive steps as the diagonal elements. These diagonal elements\nare closely related to the Hessian and can be perceived as an approximation of\nthe inner product between the Hessian row vectors and difference of the\nadjacent parameter vectors. Additionally, we introduce an auto-switching\nfunction that enables the preconditioning matrix to switch dynamically between\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and the adaptive optimizer. Based on these\ntwo techniques, we develop a new optimizer named AGD that enhances the\ngeneralization performance. We evaluate AGD on public datasets of Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Recommendation Systems\n(RecSys). Our experimental results demonstrate that AGD outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) optimizers, achieving highly competitive or\nsignificantly better predictive performance.

This matching problem has two major\nchallenges. First, it is a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem that\nis hard to solve in a reasonable computational time. Second, the evaluation of\nthe objective function for socially optimal matching contains the utility of\ndrivers for performing the tasks, which is generally unobservable private\ninformation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hierarchical\ndistribution mechanism of CSD tasks that decomposes the matching problem into\nthe task partition (master problem) and individual task-driver matching within\nsmaller groups of drivers (sub-problems). We incorporate an auction mechanism\nwith truth-telling and efficiency into the sub-problems so that the drivers'\nperceived utilities are revealed through their bids. Furthermore, we formulate\nthe master problem as a fluid model based on continuously approximated decision\nvariables. By exploiting the random utility framework, we analytically\nrepresent the objective function of the problem using continuous variables,\nwithout explicitly knowing the drivers' utilities. The numerical experiment\nshows that the proposed approach solved large-scale matching problems at least\n100 times faster than a naive LP solver and approximated the original objective\nvalue with errors of less than 1%.",

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel sequence generation paradigm for pedestrian attribute\nrecognition, termed SequencePAR. It extracts the pedestrian features using a\npre-trained CLIP model and embeds the attribute set into query tokens under the\nguidance of text prompts. Then, a Transformer decoder is proposed to generate\nthe human attributes by incorporating the visual features and attribute query\ntokens. The masked multi-head attention layer is introduced into the decoder\nmodule to prevent the model from remembering the next attribute while making\nattribute predictions during training. Extensive experiments on multiple widely\nused pedestrian attribute recognition datasets fully validated the\neffectiveness of our proposed SequencePAR. The source code and pre-trained\nmodels will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.",

The ground-state phase diagram is determined using the\nnumerical exact diagonalization and DMRG method in addition to the analytical\napproximations in various limiting cases. The phase diagram consists of a\nnonmagnetic phase and several kinds of ferrimagnetic phases. We find two\ndifferent ferrimagnetic phases without spontaneous translational symmetry\nbreakdown.

We first describe this dataset,\nand highlight challenges with seasonality, nonstationarity, partial\nobservability, and heterogeneity across sensors and operation modes of the\nplant. We then describe General Value Function (GVF) predictions -- discounted\ncumulative sums of observations -- and highlight why they might be preferable\nto classical n-step predictions common in time series prediction. We discuss\nhow to use offline data to appropriately pre-train our temporal difference\nlearning (TD) agents that learn these GVF predictions, including how to select\nhyperparameters for online fine-tuning in deployment. We find that the\nTD-prediction agent obtains an overall lower normalized mean-squared error than\nthe n-step prediction agent.

It involves\ndetermining whether a given query graph is present within a larger target\ngraph. Traditional graph-matching algorithms provide precise results but face\nchallenges in large graph instances due to the NP-complete problem, limiting\ntheir practical applicability. In contrast, recent neural network-based\napproximations offer more scalable solutions, but often lack interpretable node\ncorrespondences. To address these limitations, this article presents xNeuSM:\nExplainable Neural Subgraph Matching which introduces Graph Learnable Multi-hop\nAttention Networks (GLeMA) that adaptively learns the parameters governing the\nattention factor decay for each node across hops rather than relying on fixed\nhyperparameters. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing error bounds\nfor GLeMA's approximation of multi-hop attention as a function of the number of\nhops. Additionally, we prove that learning distinct attention decay factors for\neach node leads to a correct approximation of multi-hop attention. Empirical\nevaluation on real-world datasets shows that xNeuSM achieves substantial\nimprovements in prediction accuracy of up to 34% compared to approximate\nbaselines and, notably, at least a seven-fold faster query time than exact\nalgorithms.

Subsequently, the alteration of these\ncharacteristics due to the extra AlSb layer in the M superlattice is\ninvestigated. Extending our models for determining TE- and TM-polarized optical\nabsorption, our calculations reveal that the TE-polarized absorption shows a\nsubstantial influence near the conduction-heavy hole band transition energy,\nwhich eventually diminishes, owing to the dominant TM-contribution due to the\nconduction-light hole band transition. Extending our analysis to the dark\ncurrents, we notice that Schokley-Read-Hall recombination dominates at lower\ndoping levels, while radiative recombination becomes dominant at higher doping\nlevels. Auger transitions are also predicted using the conduction\nmini-bandwidth and the transition probabilities. We show that long-wavelength M\nsuperlattice structures exhibit longer diffusion lengths due to higher\nrecombination lifetimes, indicating that it can be heavily doped to improve the\nquantum efficiency. Mid-wavelength M superlattices show comparable\ncharacteristics, resulting in a 7% increase in quantum efficiency. Further, we\nanalyze the density of states blocked by the barrier; crucial for XBp\nphotodetector after absorber examination.

In this work, we aim\nto enhance CLIP's potential for semantic segmentation with minimal\nmodifications to its pretrained models.

This paper is directed\ntowards learning decision trees from data using a Bayesian approach, which is\nchallenging due to the potentially enormous parameter space required to span\nall tree models. Several approaches have been proposed to combat this\nchallenge, with one of the more successful being Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) methods. The efficacy and efficiency of MCMC methods fundamentally rely\non the quality of the so-called proposals, which is the focus of this paper. In\nparticular, this paper investigates using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)\napproach to explore the posterior of Bayesian decision trees more efficiently\nby exploiting the geometry of the likelihood within a global update scheme. Two\nimplementations of the novel algorithm are developed and compared to existing\nmethods by testing against standard datasets in the machine learning and\nBayesian decision tree literature. HMC-based methods are shown to perform\nfavourably with respect to predictive test accuracy, acceptance rate, and tree\ncomplexity.",

Aside\nfrom explicit human-robot collaboration, robotics can play an increasingly\nimportant role in helping train workers as well as the tools they may use,\nespecially in complex tasks that may be difficult to automate or effectively\nroboticize. This paper introduces a form of smart tool for use by human workers\nand shows how training the tool for task recognition, one of the key\nrequirements, can be accomplished. Machine learning (ML) with purely\nhuman-based data can be extremely laborious and time-consuming. First, we show\nhow data synthetically-generated by a robot can be leveraged in the ML training\nprocess. Later, we demonstrate how fine-tuning ML models for individual\nphysical tasks and workers can significantly scale up the benefits of using ML\nto provide this feedback. Experimental results show the effectiveness and\nscalability of our approach, as we test data size versus accuracy. Smart hand\ntools of the type introduced here can provide insights and real-time analytics\non efficient and safe tool usage and operation, thereby enhancing human\nparticipation and skill in a wide range of work environments.

            "summary": "This paper investigates how representation learning can enable optimal\ncontrol in unknown and complex dynamics, such as chaotic and non-linear\nsystems, without relying on prior domain knowledge of the dynamics. The core\nidea is to establish an equivariant geometry that is diffeomorphic to the\nmanifold defined by a dynamical system and to perform optimal control within\nthis corresponding geometry, which is a non-trivial task. To address this\nchallenge, Koopman Embed to Equivariant Control (KEEC) is introduced for model\nlearning and control. Inspired by Lie theory, KEEC begins by learning a\nnon-linear dynamical system defined on a manifold and embedding trajectories\ninto a Lie group. Subsequently, KEEC formulates an equivariant value function\nequation in reinforcement learning on the equivariant geometry, ensuring an\ninvariant effect as the value function on the original manifold. By deriving\nanalytical-form optimal actions on the equivariant value function, KEEC\ntheoretically achieves quadratic convergence for the optimal equivariant value\nfunction by leveraging the differential information on the equivariant\ngeometry. The effectiveness of KEEC is demonstrated in challenging dynamical\nsystems, including chaotic ones like Lorenz-63. Notably, our findings indicate\nthat isometric and isomorphic loss functions, ensuring the compactness and\nsmoothness of geometry, outperform loss functions without these properties.",

Closing the speed gap\nfor augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices such as\neye-tracking keyboards is important for improving the quality of life for such\nindividuals. Recent advances in neural networks of natural language pose new\nopportunities for re-thinking strategies and user interfaces for enhanced\ntext-entry for AAC users. In this paper, we present SpeakFaster, consisting of\nlarge language models (LLMs) and a co-designed user interface for text entry in\na highly-abbreviated form, allowing saving 57% more motor actions than\ntraditional predictive keyboards in offline simulation. A pilot study with 19\nnon-AAC participants typing on a mobile device by hand demonstrated gains in\nmotor savings in line with the offline simulation, while introducing relatively\nsmall effects on overall typing speed. Lab and field testing on two eye-gaze\ntyping users with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) demonstrated text-entry\nrates 29-60% faster than traditional baselines, due to significant saving of\nexpensive keystrokes achieved through phrase and word predictions from\ncontext-aware LLMs. These findings provide a strong foundation for further\nexploration of substantially-accelerated text communication for motor-impaired\nusers and demonstrate a direction for applying LLMs to text-based user\ninterfaces.",

However, in domains like healthcare, where acquiring features could be\nexpensive or harmful, it is necessary to balance a feature's acquisition cost\nagainst its predictive value. The task of training an AI agent to decide which\nfeatures to acquire is called active feature acquisition (AFA). By deploying an\nAFA agent, we effectively alter the acquisition strategy and trigger a\ndistribution shift. To safely deploy AFA agents under this distribution shift,\nwe present the problem of active feature acquisition performance evaluation\n(AFAPE). We examine AFAPE under i) a no direct effect (NDE) assumption, stating\nthat acquisitions don't affect the underlying feature values; and ii) a no\nunobserved confounding (NUC) assumption, stating that retrospective feature\nacquisition decisions were only based on observed features. We show that one\ncan apply offline reinforcement learning under the NUC assumption and missing\ndata methods under the NDE assumption. When NUC and NDE hold, we propose a\nnovel semi-offline reinforcement learning framework, which requires a weaker\npositivity assumption and yields more data-efficient estimators.

            "summary": "Recently, medical vision-language pre-training (VLP) has reached substantial\nprogress to learn global visual representation from medical images and their\npaired radiology reports. However, medical imaging tasks in real world usually\nrequire finer granularity in visual features. These tasks include visual\nlocalization tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, object detection) and visual\ngrounding task. Yet, current medical VLP methods face challenges in learning\nthese fine-grained features, as they primarily focus on brute-force alignment\nbetween image patches and individual text tokens for local visual feature\nlearning, which is suboptimal for downstream dense prediction tasks. In this\nwork, we propose a new VLP framework, named \\textbf{G}lobal to \\textbf{D}ense\nlevel representation learning (G2D) that achieves significantly improved\ngranularity and more accurate grounding for the learned features, compared to\nexisting medical VLP approaches. In particular, G2D learns dense and\nsemantically-grounded image representations via a pseudo segmentation task\nparallel with the global vision-language alignment. Notably, generating pseudo\nsegmentation targets does not incur extra trainable parameters: they are\nobtained on the fly during VLP with a parameter-free processor. G2D achieves\nsuperior performance across 6 medical imaging tasks and 25 diseases,\nparticularly in semantic segmentation, which necessitates fine-grained,\nsemantically-grounded image features. In this task, G2D surpasses peer models\neven when fine-tuned with just 1\\% of the training data, compared to the 100\\%\nused by these models. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

We investigate how much context is necessary to achieve high-quality\npre-trained acoustic models using self-supervised learning. We principally\ninvestigate contrastive predictive coding (CPC), which we adapt to be able to\nprecisely control the amount of context visible to the model during training\nand inference. We find that phone discriminability in the resulting model\nrepresentations peaks at around 40~ms of preceding context, and that having too\nmuch context (beyond around 320 ms) substantially degrades the quality of the\nrepresentations. Surprisingly, we find that this pattern also transfers to\nsupervised ASR when the pre-trained representations are used as frozen input\nfeatures.

            "summary": "Model Parsing defines the research task of predicting hyperparameters of the\ngenerative model (GM), given a generated image as input. Since a diverse set of\nhyperparameters is jointly employed by the generative model, and dependencies\noften exist among them, it is crucial to learn these hyperparameter\ndependencies for the improved model parsing performance. To explore such\nimportant dependencies, we propose a novel model parsing method called\nLearnable Graph Pooling Network (LGPN). Specifically, we transform model\nparsing into a graph node classification task, using graph nodes and edges to\nrepresent hyperparameters and their dependencies, respectively. Furthermore,\nLGPN incorporates a learnable pooling-unpooling mechanism tailored to model\nparsing, which adaptively learns hyperparameter dependencies of GMs used to\ngenerate the input image. We also extend our proposed method to CNN-generated\nimage detection and coordinate attacks detection. Empirically, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art results in model parsing and its extended applications,\nshowing the effectiveness of our method. Our source code are available.",

Our focus lies on\npreserving the gap distribution and pair correlation function of these point\nsets. Leveraging advancements in deep learning applied to point processes, this\npaper explores the use of an auto-regressive \\textit{Sequence Extension Mixture\nModel} (SEMM) for extending finite sequences, by estimating directly the\nconditional density, instead of the intensity function. We perform comparative\nexperiments on multiple types of point processes, including Poisson, locally\nattractive, and locally repelling sequences, and we perform a case study on the\nprediction of Riemann $\\zeta$ function zeroes. The results indicate that the\nproposed mixture model outperforms traditional neural network architectures in\nsequence extension with the retention of statistical properties. Given this\nmotivation, we showcase the capabilities of a mixture model to extend\nsequences, maintaining specific statistical properties, i.e. the gap\ndistribution, and pair correlation indicators.",

            "summary": "Transformer models exhibit in-context learning: the ability to accurately\npredict the response to a novel query based on illustrative examples in the\ninput sequence. In-context learning contrasts with traditional in-weights\nlearning of query-output relationships. What aspects of the training data\ndistribution and architecture favor in-context vs in-weights learning? Recent\nwork has shown that specific distributional properties inherent in language,\nsuch as burstiness, large dictionaries and skewed rank-frequency distributions,\ncontrol the trade-off or simultaneous appearance of these two forms of\nlearning. We first show that these results are recapitulated in a minimal\nattention-only network trained on a simplified dataset. In-context learning\n(ICL) is driven by the abrupt emergence of an induction head, which\nsubsequently competes with in-weights learning. By identifying progress\nmeasures that precede in-context learning and targeted experiments, we\nconstruct a two-parameter model of an induction head which emulates the full\ndata distributional dependencies displayed by the attention-based network. A\nphenomenological model of induction head formation traces its abrupt emergence\nto the sequential learning of three nested logits enabled by an intrinsic\ncurriculum. We propose that the sharp transitions in attention-based networks\narise due to a specific chain of multi-layer operations necessary to achieve\nICL, which is implemented by nested nonlinearities sequentially learned during\ntraining.",

In this paper, inspired by this theoretical\ninsight, we highlight normed spaces as a more flexible and computationally\nefficient alternative to several popular Riemannian manifolds for learning\ngraph embeddings. Normed space embeddings significantly outperform several\npopular manifolds on a large range of synthetic and real-world graph\nreconstruction benchmark datasets while requiring significantly fewer\ncomputational resources. We also empirically verify the superiority of normed\nspace embeddings on growing families of graphs associated with negative, zero,\nand positive curvature, further reinforcing the flexibility of normed spaces in\ncapturing diverse graph structures as graph sizes increase. Lastly, we\ndemonstrate the utility of normed space embeddings on two applied graph\nembedding tasks, namely, link prediction and recommender systems. Our work\nhighlights the potential of normed spaces for geometric graph representation\nlearning, raises new research questions, and offers a valuable tool for\nexperimental mathematics in the field of finite metric space embeddings.

Specifically, slicing is more\nocclusion-revealing since it can peel through any occluders without\nobstruction. In the limit, i.e., with infinitely many slices, it is guaranteed\nto unveil all hidden object parts. We realize our idea by developing Slice3D, a\nnovel method for single-view 3D reconstruction which first predicts multi-slice\nimages from a single RGB image and then integrates the slices into a 3D model\nusing a coordinate-based transformer network for signed distance prediction.\nThe slice images can be regressed or generated, both through a U-Net based\nnetwork. For the former, we inject a learnable slice indicator code to\ndesignate each decoded image into a spatial slice location, while the slice\ngenerator is a denoising diffusion model operating on the entirety of slice\nimages stacked on the input channels. We conduct extensive evaluation against\nstate-of-the-art alternatives to demonstrate superiority of our method,\nespecially in recovering complex and severely occluded shape structures, amid\nambiguities.

We document\nseven new features of how research-active professors are compensated, how they\nspend their time, and how they perceive their research pursuits: (1) there is\nmore inequality in earnings within fields than there is across fields; (2)\ninstitutions, ranks, tasks, and sources of earnings can account for roughly\nhalf of the total variation in earnings; (3) there is significant variation\nacross fields in the correlations between earnings and different kinds of\nresearch output, but these account for a small amount of earnings variation;\n(4) measuring professors' productivity in terms of output-per-year versus\noutput-per-research-hour can yield substantial differences; (5) professors'\nbeliefs about the riskiness of their research are best predicted by their\nfundraising intensity, their risk-aversion in their personal lives, and the\ndegree to which their research involves generating new hypotheses; (6) older\nand younger professors have very different research outputs and time\nallocations, but their intended audiences are quite similar; (7) personal\nrisk-taking is highly predictive of professors' orientation towards applied,\ncommercially-relevant research.",

Our study extends this analysis by employing\nrange-based proxies to confirm their findings across a broader dataset and\nnon-standard assets. Notably, we address the concern that rough volatility\nmight be an artifact of microstructure noise in high-frequency return data. Our\nresults reveal that log-volatility, estimated via range-based methods, behaves\nakin to fractional Brownian motion with an even lower $H$, below $0.1$. We also\naffirm the efficacy of the rough fractional stochastic volatility model (RFSV),\nfinding that its predictive capability surpasses that of AR, HAR, and GARCH\nmodels in most scenarios. This work substantiates the intrinsic nature of rough\nvolatility, independent of the microstructure noise often present in\nhigh-frequency financial data.",

We show that the\nconjugate momentum associated with the comoving curvature perturbation during\nboth the ultra-slow-roll phase and the contracting phase of bouncing scenarios\nis conserved in the super-Hubble limit. We illustrate that, within the\nframework of inflation, this conservation of momentum allows for the evolution\nof perturbations across the ultra-slow-roll phase, enabling the calculation of\nthe power spectrum for modes that exit the Hubble radius before the\nultra-slow-roll phase begins. Similarly, in the context of a bounce, we can\ndetermine the power spectrum after the bounce using this method. We support our\napproach with both numerical and analytical arguments.",

These\npredictions can be constrained by many means and, specifically, by measuring\nthe Casimir force arising between two closely spaced bodies due to the\nzero-point and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. After a brief\nsurvey in the theory of the Casimir effect, the strongest constraints on the\npower-type and Yukawa-type corrections to Newtonian gravity, following from\nmeasuring the Casimir force at short distances, are considered. Next,the\nproblems of dark matter, dark energy and their probable constituents are\ndiscussed. This is followed by an analysis of constraints on the dark matter\nparticles, and, specifically, on axions and axionlike particles, obtained from\nthe Casimir effect. The question of whether the Casimir effect can be used for\nconstraining the spin-dependent interactions is also considered. Then the\nconstraints on the dark energy particles, like chameleons and symmetrons, are\nexamined. In all cases the subject of our treatment is not only measurements of\nthe Casimir force but some other relevant table-top experiments as well. In\nconclusion, the prospects of the Casimir effect for constraining theoretical\npredictions beyond the Standard Model at short distances are summarized.",

In this work, we demonstrate\nthat MD simulations, when biased by the MLIP's energy uncertainty, effectively\ncapture extrapolative regions and rare events without the need to know\n\\textit{a priori} the system's transition temperatures and pressures.\nExploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD\nsimulations by introducing the concept of bias stress. We also employ\ncalibrated ensemble-free uncertainties derived from sketched gradient features\nto yield MLIPs with similar or better accuracy than ensemble-based uncertainty\nmethods at a lower computational cost. We use the proposed uncertainty-driven\nAL approach to develop MLIPs for two benchmark systems: alanine dipeptide and\nMIL-53(Al).

The Cox catalytic prior is formulated as a weighted likelihood of the\nregression coefficients based on synthetic data and a surrogate baseline hazard\nconstant. This surrogate hazard can be either provided by the user or estimated\nfrom the data, and the synthetic data are generated from the predictive\ndistribution of a fitted simpler model. For point estimation, we derive an\napproximation of the marginal posterior mode, which can be computed\nconveniently as a regularized log partial likelihood estimator. We prove that\nour prior distribution is proper and the resulting estimator is consistent\nunder mild conditions.

It has been\nshown that by applying the Principal of Maximum Conformality (PMC), which\napplies the renormalization group equation recursively to set the effective\nmagnitude of $\\alpha_s$ of the process, the remaining conformal coefficients\nwill be well matched with the corresponding $\\alpha_s$ at each orders, leading\nto a scheme-and-scale invariant and convergent perturbative series. Thus\ndifferent from conventional scheme-and-scale dependent fixed-order series, the\nPMC series will provide a more reliable platform for estimating UHO\ncontributions. In this paper, by using the total decay width\n$\\Gamma(H\\to\\gamma\\gamma)$ which has been calculated up to N$^4$LO QCD\ncorrections, we derive its PMC series by using the PMC single-scale setting\napproach and estimate its unknown N$^5$LO contributions by using the Bayesian\nanalysis. The Bayesian-based approach estimates the magnitude of the UHO\ncontributions based on an optimized analysis of probability density\ndistribution, and the predicted UHO contribution becomes more accurate when\nmore loop terms have been known to tame the probability density function. Using\nthe top-quark pole mass $M_t$=172.69 GeV and the Higgs mass $M_H$=125.25 GeV as\ninputs, we obtain $\\Gamma(H\\to\\gamma\\gamma) =9.56504~{\\rm keV}$ and the\nestimated N$^5$LO contribution to the total decay width is\n$\\Delta\\Gamma_H=\\pm1.65\\times10^{-4}~{\\rm keV}$ for the smallest credible\ninterval of $95.5\\%$ degree-of-belief.",

For\ndemonstration purposes, we assess the assumptions of the Grid and Grid-to-Grid\nmodels, commonly used for flood real-time forecasting in the UK. While the\ndistributed character of these models is conceptually closer to the physical\nmodel, we demonstrate that its exact implementation leads to many qualitative\nand quantitative differences in the model behaviour. For example, we show that\nthe main assumption, namely that the speed of surface and subsurface flow is\nconstant, causes the Grid-to-Grid model to significantly misrepresent scenarios\nwith no rainfall, leading to too fast river flow decay, and scenarios with\nupstream rainfall, failing to capture characteristic flash flood formation. We\nargue that this analytical approach of finding fundamental differences between\nmodels may help us to develop more theoretically-justified rainfall-runoff\nmodels, e.g. models that can better handle the two aforementioned scenarios and\nother scenarios in which the spatial dependence is crucial to properly\nrepresent the catchment dynamics.",

The setting for this experiment is a geometrically simplified\nbenchmark catchment consisting of a two-dimensional hillslope. For\ndemonstration purposes, we analyse the lumped Probability Distributed Model\n(PDM) formulated by Lamb (1999). Our analysis reveals fundamental differences\nbetween the PDM and physical models, both in qualitative and quantitative\nbehaviours, particularly when studying overland-flow-dominated catchments. For\nexample, our study highlights the fact that the PDM model overestimates the\nrate of river flow growth during highly intensive rainfalls. Additionally, we\nobserve that the PDM model cannot accurately predict peak flows in different\nseasons, characterised by a wide range of mean precipitation/evapotranspiration\nrates.

Therefore, networks need to be end-to-end optimized using information\nfreshness metrics such as age of information under transmit power and\nreliability constraints to ensure support for such applications. For\nshort-packet coding, modelling and understanding the effect of block codeword\nlength on transmit power and other performance metrics is important. To\nunderstand the above optimization for short-packet coding, we consider the\noptimal tradeoff problem between age of information and transmit power under\nreliability constraints for short packet point-to-point communication model\nwith an exogenous packet generation process. In contrast to prior work, we\nconsider scheduling policies that can possibly adapt the block-length or\ntransmission time of short packet codes in order to achieve the optimal\ntradeoff. We characterize the tradeoff using a semi-Markov decision process\nformulation. We also obtain analytical upper bounds as well as numerical,\nanalytical, and asymptotic lower bounds on the optimal tradeoff. We show that\nin certain regimes, such as high reliability and high packet generation rate,\nnon-adaptive scheduling policies (fixed transmission time policies) are\nclose-to-optimal. Furthermore, in a high-power or in a low-power regime,\nnon-adaptive as well as state-independent randomized scheduling policies are\norder-optimal. These results are corroborated by numerical and simulation\nexperiments. The tradeoff is then characterized for a wireless point-to-point\nchannel with block fading as well as for other packet generation models\n(including an age-dependent packet generation model).",

In this paper we test a\nBayesian model averaging method, the so-called Bayesian two-dimensional Monte\nCarlo (2DMC) method, that has been fairly recently proposed against a very\nnewly proposed modification of the regression calibration method, which is\nparticularly suited to studies in which there is a substantial amount of shared\nerror, and in which there may also be curvature in the true dose response. We\nalso compared both methods against standard regression calibration and Monte\nCarlo maximum likelihood. The Bayesian 2DMC method performs poorly, with\ncoverage probabilities both for the linear and quadratic dose coefficients that\nare under 5%, particularly when the magnitudes of classical and Berkson error\nare both moderate to large (20%-50%). The method also produces substantially\nbiased (by a factor of 10) estimates of both the linear and quadratic\ncoefficients, with the linear coefficient overestimated and the quadratic\ncoefficient underestimated. By comparison the extended regression calibration\nmethod yields coverage probabilities that are too low when shared and unshared\nBerkson errors are both large (50%), although otherwise it performs well, and\ncoverage is generally better than the Bayesian 2DMC and all other methods.

            "summary": "In todays competitive landscape, businesses grapple with customer retention.\nChurn prediction models, although beneficial, often lack accuracy due to the\nreliance on a single data source. The intricate nature of human behavior and\nhigh dimensional customer data further complicate these efforts. To address\nthese concerns, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion learning model for\nidentifying customer churn risk levels in financial service providers. Our\nmultimodal approach integrates customer sentiments financial literacy (FL)\nlevel, and financial behavioral data, enabling more accurate and bias-free\nchurn prediction models. The proposed FL model utilizes a SMOGN COREG\nsupervised model to gauge customer FL levels from their financial data. The\nbaseline churn model applies an ensemble artificial neural network and\noversampling techniques to predict churn propensity in high-dimensional\nfinancial data. We also incorporate a speech emotion recognition model\nemploying a pre-trained CNN-VGG16 to recognize customer emotions based on\npitch, energy, and tone. To integrate these diverse features while retaining\nunique insights, we introduced late and hybrid fusion techniques that\ncomplementary boost coordinated multimodal co learning. Robust metrics were\nutilized to evaluate the proposed multimodal fusion model and hence the\napproach validity, including mean average precision and macro-averaged F1\nscore. Our novel approach demonstrates a marked improvement in churn\nprediction, achieving a test accuracy of 91.2%, a Mean Average Precision (MAP)\nscore of 66, and a Macro-Averaged F1 score of 54 through the proposed hybrid\nfusion learning technique compared with late fusion and baseline models.\nFurthermore, the analysis demonstrates a positive correlation between negative\nemotions, low FL scores, and high-risk customers.",

            "summary": "Multivariate time series are everywhere. Nevertheless, real-world time series\ndata often exhibit numerous missing values, which is the time series imputation\ntask. Although previous deep learning methods have been shown to be effective\nfor time series imputation, they are shown to produce overconfident\nimputations, which might be a potentially overlooked threat to the reliability\nof the intelligence system. Score-based diffusion method(i.e., CSDI) is\neffective for the time series imputation task but computationally expensive due\nto the nature of the generative diffusion model framework. In this paper, we\npropose a non-generative time series imputation method that produces accurate\nimputations with inherent uncertainty and meanwhile is computationally\nefficient. Specifically, we incorporate deep ensembles into quantile regression\nwith a shared model backbone and a series of quantile discrimination\nfunctions.This framework combines the merits of accurate uncertainty estimation\nof deep ensembles and quantile regression and above all, the shared model\nbackbone tremendously reduces most of the computation overhead of the multiple\nensembles. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world\ndatasets: air quality and health-care datasets and conduct extensive\nexperiments to show that our method excels at making deterministic and\nprobabilistic predictions. Compared with the score-based diffusion method:\nCSDI, we can obtain comparable forecasting results and is better when more data\nis missing. Furthermore, as a non-generative model compared with CSDI, the\nproposed method consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much\nfaster training speed and fewer model parameters.",

However,\nself-supervised learning of indoor depth from monocular sequences is quite\nchallenging for researchers because of the following two main reasons. One is\nthe large areas of low-texture regions and the other is the complex ego-motion\non indoor training datasets. In this work, our proposed method, named\nIndoorDepth, consists of two innovations. In particular, we first propose a\nnovel photometric loss with improved structural similarity (SSIM) function to\ntackle the challenge from low-texture regions. Moreover, in order to further\nmitigate the issue of inaccurate ego-motion prediction, multiple photometric\nlosses at different stages are used to train a deeper pose network with two\nresidual pose blocks. Subsequent ablation study can validate the effectiveness\nof each new idea. Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate that our\nIndoorDepth outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large\nmargin.

First, there is a\ndisconnect in the sharing pattern between the search and training steps, where\nweights are warped for layers of different sizes during the search to measure\nsimilarity, but not during training, resulting in reduced performance. To\naddress this, we generate layer weights by learning to compose sets of\nSuperWeights, which represent a group of trainable parameters. These\nSuperWeights are created to be large enough so they can be used to represent\nany layer in the network, but small enough that they are computationally\nefficient. The second drawback we address is the method of measuring similarity\nbetween shared parameters. Whereas prior work compared the weights themselves,\nwe argue this does not take into account the amount of conflict between the\nshared weights. Instead, we use gradient information to identify layers with\nshared weights that wish to diverge from each other. We demonstrate that our\nSuperWeight Networks consistently boost performance over the state-of-the-art\non the ImageNet and CIFAR datasets in the NPAS setting. We further show that\nour approach can generate parameters for many network architectures using the\nsame set of weights.

            "summary": "The escalating drug addiction crisis in the United States underscores the\nurgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. This study embarked on an\ninnovative and rigorous strategy to unearth potential drug repurposing\ncandidates for opioid and cocaine addiction treatment, bridging the gap between\ntranscriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. We initiated our approach by\nconducting differential gene expression analysis on addiction-related\ntranscriptomic data to identify key genes. We propose a novel topological\ndifferentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI)\nnetwork derived from DEGs. This method utilizes persistent Laplacians to\naccurately single out pivotal nodes within the network, conducting this\nanalysis in a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Through rigorous\nliterature validation, pathway analysis, and data-availability scrutiny, we\nidentified three pivotal molecular targets, mTOR, mGluR5, and NMDAR, for drug\nrepurposing from DrugBank. We crafted machine learning models employing two\nnatural language processing (NLP)-based embeddings and a traditional 2D\nfingerprint, which demonstrated robust predictive ability in gauging binding\naffinities of DrugBank compounds to selected targets. Furthermore, we\nelucidated the interactions of promising drugs with the targets and evaluated\ntheir drug-likeness. This study delineates a multi-faceted and comprehensive\nanalytical framework, amalgamating bioinformatics, topological data analysis\nand machine learning, for drug repurposing in addiction treatment, setting the\nstage for subsequent experimental validation. The versatility of the methods we\ndeveloped allows for applications across a range of diseases and transcriptomic\ndatasets.",

KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and\ncondensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing\nfirst-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in\nsystems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as\nsecond-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence\nof fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase\ntransition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second\norder) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects\nin such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be\npredicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.",

            "summary": "Optimal resource allocation in wireless systems still stands as a rather\nchallenging task due to the inherent statistical characteristics of channel\nfading. On the one hand, minimax/outage-optimal policies are often\noverconservative and analytically intractable, despite advertising maximally\nreliable system performance. On the other hand, ergodic-optimal resource\nallocation policies are often susceptible to the statistical dispersion of\nheavy-tailed fading channels, leading to relatively frequent drastic\nperformance drops. We investigate a new risk-aware formulation of the classical\nstochastic resource allocation problem for point-to-point power-constrained\ncommunication networks over fading channels with no cross-interference, by\nleveraging the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CV@R) as a coherent measure of risk.\nWe rigorously derive closed-form expressions for the CV@R-optimal risk-aware\nresource allocation policy, as well as the optimal associated quantiles of the\ncorresponding user rate functions by capitalizing on the underlying fading\ndistribution, parameterized by dual variables. We then develop a purely dual\ntail waterfilling scheme, achieving significantly more rapid and assured\nconvergence of dual variables, as compared with the primal-dual tail\nwaterfilling algorithm, recently proposed in the literature. The effectiveness\nof the proposed scheme is also readily confirmed via detailed numerical\nsimulations.",

An automated process that narrows a large set of\npathologies down to the most likely pathologies will be of great importance.\nThe primary prior works have relied on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm\nunder the intuition that it aligns better with how physicians perform DDx. In\nthis paper, we show that a generative approach trained with simpler supervised\nand self-supervised learning signals can achieve superior results on the\ncurrent benchmark. The proposed Transformer-based generative network, named\nDDxT, autoregressively produces a set of possible pathologies, i.e., DDx, and\npredicts the actual pathology using a neural network. Experiments are performed\nusing the DDXPlus dataset. In the case of DDx, the proposed network has\nachieved a mean accuracy of 99.82% and a mean F1 score of 0.9472. Additionally,\nmean accuracy reaches 99.98% with a mean F1 score of 0.9949 while predicting\nground truth pathology. The proposed DDxT outperformed the previous RL-based\napproaches by a big margin. Overall, the automated Transformer-based DDx\ngenerative model has the potential to become a useful tool for a physician in\ntimes of urgency.",

            "summary": "Measurements of the poloidal electron density and temperature distribution in\nthe W7-X island divertor reveal the existence of two distinct scrape-off layer\ntransport regimes. At low and intermediate densities, $T_e$ profiles across the\nmagnetic island are hollow, with a minimum at the island O-point. Above a\nthreshold density $\\overline{n}_e \\approx 5 \\times 10^{19}$ m$^{-3}$, the local\nminimum vanishes and the $T_e$ profiles become monotonic. At the lowest studied\ndensities, the hollow $T_e$ profiles imply an electrostatic field of up to\n$\\textbf{E}_r \\sim 6$ kV/m, which can induce $\\textbf{E} \\times \\textbf{B}$\ndrifts around the island, with drift velocities of up to $\\sim3$ km/s. These\n$\\textbf{E} \\times \\textbf{B}$ drifts result in strong convective heat\ntransport poloidally around the island, binormal to the magnetic field, which\nsupports the hollow radial temperature profile and hence provides a positive\nfeedback to the electric field. Above the threshold density, these drifts\nstrongly diminish, presumably due to increased anomalous diffusion, which\ncauses the profile hollowness and therefore also the radial electric field to\nstrongly diminish. This argument is supported by comparison to EMC3-EIRENE\nmodeling and an analytical transport analyses showing that an additional,\nnon-diffusive transport channel is required to maintain the profile hollowness\nup to the densities seen in experiment, and that a poloidal drift transport\nchannel supports such hollowness only up to certain densities.",

Using\nConvolutional Neural Networks, it presents a method for categorizing melanoma\nimages into benign and malignant images in this research (CNNs). Researchers\nused 'Deep Learning' techniques to train an expansive number of photos &\nessentially to get the expected result deep neural networks to need to be\ntrained with a huge number of parameters as dermoscopic images are sensitive &\nvery hard to classify. This paper, has been emphasized building models with\nless complexity and comparatively better accuracy with limited datasets &\npartially fewer deep networks so that the system can predict Melanoma at ease\nfrom input dermoscopic images as correctly as possible within devices with less\ncomputational power. The dataset has been obtained from ISIC Archive. Multiple\npre-trained models ResNet101, DenseNet, EfficientNet, InceptionV3 have been\nimplemented using transfer learning techniques to complete the comparative\nanalysis & every model achieved good accuracy. Before training the models, the\ndata has been augmented by multiple parameters to improve the accuracy.\nMoreover, the results are better than the previous state-of-the-art approaches\n& adequate to predict melanoma.

We confirm previous results that bar formation is\nmore vigorous in models with a live halo than a rigid one and is further\nenhanced when halo orbits preferentially rotate with the disc. We discuss two\ntypes of buckling events with different symmetries about the mid plane, one\nthat occurs just as the bar is forming and the other well after the bar has\nbeen established. We also show that warps are most easily excited and\nmaintained when the halo is counter-rotating with the disc, in agreement with\ntheoretical predictions. Our most novel result is the discovery of a rotating\nhalo instability, which causes the disc and halo cusp to spiral outward from\nthe centre of mass of the system whether the halo rotates with the disc or\ncounter to it and also occurs in a disc bulge halo system that does not form a\nbar.

The recent feature transformation, masking and\nfactorization-based methods are efficient, but they grow the model only over\nthe global or shared parameter. Therefore, these approaches do not fully\nutilize the previously learned information because the same task-specific\nparameter forgets the earlier knowledge. Thus, these approaches show limited\ntransfer learning ability. Moreover, most of these models have constant\nparameter growth for all tasks, irrespective of the task complexity. Our work\nproposes a simple filter and channel expansion based method that grows the\nmodel over the previous task parameters and not just over the global parameter.\nTherefore, it fully utilizes all the previously learned information without\nforgetting, which results in better knowledge transfer. The growth rate in our\nproposed model is a function of task complexity; therefore for a simple task,\nthe model has a smaller parameter growth while for complex tasks, the model\nrequires more parameters to adapt to the current task. Recent expansion based\nmodels show promising results for task incremental learning (TIL). However, for\nclass incremental learning (CIL), prediction of task id is a crucial challenge;\nhence, their results degrade rapidly as the number of tasks increase. In this\nwork, we propose a robust task prediction method that leverages entropy\nweighted data augmentations and the models gradient using pseudo labels. We\nevaluate our model on various datasets and architectures in the TIL, CIL and\ngenerative continual learning settings. The proposed approach shows\nstate-of-the-art results in all these settings.

Regarding the peak of the streamwise turbulence intensity\n$<uu>^+_P$, we conclude here that accurate measurements in flows with $Re_\\tau$\n$>$ O($10^6$) are required, especially when looking only at the peak $<uu>^+_P$\nto discriminate between recently proposed trends. We also find remarkable\nagreement between the three analyses of Monkewitz \\cite{M22}, Chen and\nSreenivasan \\cite{CS22} and Monkewitz and Nagib \\cite{MN15}, with some\ncoefficients slightly modified, by underpinning them with the same accurate\nmeasurements of $<uu>^+_P$ from reliable channel and boundary layer data. All\nthe three analyses conclude that the inner peak of $<uu>^+$ remains finite in\nthe limit of infinite Reynolds number, which is at variance with the unlimited\ngrowth of $<uu>^+_P$ as $\\ln{Re}$ $_\\tau$ predicted by the attached eddy model\n\\cite{MM19}.

However, handling confusing samples is nontrivial: discarding\nvaluable confusing samples would compromise the model generalisation while\nusing them for training would exacerbate the issue of confirmation bias caused\nby the resulting inevitable mislabelling. To solve this problem, this paper\nproposes to use confusing samples proactively without label correction.\nSpecifically, a Virtual Category (VC) is assigned to each confusing sample in\nsuch a way that it can safely contribute to the model optimisation even without\na concrete label. This provides an upper bound for inter-class information\nsharing capacity, which eventually leads to a better embedding space. Extensive\nexperiments on two mainstream dense prediction tasks -- semantic segmentation\nand object detection, demonstrate that the proposed VC learning significantly\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art, especially when only very few labels are\navailable. Our intriguing findings highlight the usage of VC learning in dense\nvision tasks.",

It is unclear how to test for\nthe significance of treatment effects when the treatments vary across\nindividuals/groups and the error terms may exhibit complicated dependence\nstructures. This paper examines the estimation and inference of multiple\ntreatment effects when the errors are not independent and identically\ndistributed, and the treatment effects vary across individuals/groups. We\nderive a simple analytical expression for approximating the variance-covariance\nstructure of the treatment effect estimators under general dependence\nconditions and propose two test statistics, one is to test for the overall\nsignificance of the treatment effect and the other for the homogeneity of the\ntreatment effects. We find that in the Gaussian approximations to the test\nstatistics, the dependence structures in the data can be safely ignored due to\nthe localized nature of the statistics. This has the important implication that\nthe simulated critical values can be easily obtained. Simulations demonstrate\nour tests have superb size control and reasonable power performance in finite\nsamples regardless of the presence of strong cross-section dependence or/and\nweak serial dependence in the data. We apply our tests to two datasets and find\nsignificant overall treatment effects in each case.",

Such a signature is absent for low disorder strength when\nthe fracture is nucleation-dominated, and high disorder strength when the\nfracture is percolation type. We examine the correlation between the record\nwith the maximum waiting time and the crossover record at which the avalanche\nstatistics change from off-critical to critical. Compared to the avalanche\nbased predictor for failure, we show that the record statistics have the\nadvantage of both being real-time as well as able to predict final fracture at\nmuch smaller strains.

Here, we further\ngeneralize that quantum model by analytically showing that N cascaded\nsingle-photon pulses driving each atom still fulfills a quantum dissipative\nadaptation.

The dynamics were analysed using the\ndifference between transient buoyancy and viscous forces, and it was found that\nthe overall heat transfer coefficient influences the coupling behaviour and the\ndynamics of the component loops in a CNCL. At lower values of the overall heat\ntransfer coefficient, the component loops in the CNCL nearly retain their\nindependent behaviour, i.e., the component loops hardly influence each other.\nIt was also found that the temperature dependent fluid properties influence the\nstability of the CNCL system in some cases.",

The\ndataset contains well-established eye movement variables; prelexical\ncharacteristics such as vowel harmony and bigram-trigram frequencies and word\nfeatures, such as word length, predictability, frequency, eye voice span\nmeasures, Cloze test scores of the root word and suffix predictabilities, as\nwell as the scores obtained from two working memory tests. Our findings on\nfixation parameters and word characteristics are in line with the patterns\nreported in the relevant literature.",

            "summary": "Fake news on social media has large, negative implications for society.\nHowever, little is known about what linguistic cues make people fall for fake\nnews and, hence, how to design effective countermeasures for social media. In\nthis study, we seek to understand which linguistic cues make people fall for\nfake news. Linguistic cues (e.g., adverbs, personal pronouns, positive emotion\nwords, negative emotion words) are important characteristics of any text and\nalso affect how people process real vs. fake news. Specifically, we compare the\nrole of linguistic cues across both cognitive processing (related to careful\nthinking) and affective processing (related to unconscious automatic\nevaluations). To this end, we performed a within-subject experiment where we\ncollected neurophysiological measurements of 42 subjects while these read a\nsample of 40 real and fake news articles. During our experiment, we measured\ncognitive processing through eye fixations, and affective processing in situ\nthrough heart rate variability. We find that users engage more in cognitive\nprocessing for longer fake news articles, while affective processing is more\npronounced for fake news written in analytic words. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work studying the role of linguistic cues in fake\nnews processing. Altogether, our findings have important implications for\ndesigning online platforms that encourage users to engage in careful thinking\nand thus prevent them from falling for fake news.",

We use a Tacotron2 like setup with a spectrogram prediction\nnetwork and a waveglow vocoder. The Tacotron2 acoustic model is trained on\nEnglish data, followed by synthetic Hindi data from the existing TTS system.\nFinally, the decoder of this model is fine-tuned on only 3 hours of target\nHindi speaker data to enable rapid speaker adaptation.

Both networks leverage the physical properties of polarized light\nto learn robust geometric representations by encoding shape priors and\npolarization characteristics derived from our physical model. Geometric\npseudo-labels from the teacher support the student network without the need for\nannotated real data. Dense appearance and geometric information of objects are\nobtained through a differentiable renderer with the predicted pose for\nself-supervised direct coupling. The student network additionally features our\nproposed invertible formulation of the physical shape priors that enables\nend-to-end self-supervised training through physical constraints of derived\npolarization characteristics compared against polarimetric input images.

The thermodynamic parameters of formation of\nsolid solutions are calculated for CdZnTeSe compounds with an arbitrary\nconcentration of the doping elements. There is revealed a new thermodynamic\neffect of a decrease in the excess Gibbs energy in the solid solutions which\ncontain mixed binary components formed during simultaneous doping of the\ncationic and anionic subsystems. Such an effect is connected with emergence of\nstrong covalent bonds in the mixed binary component ZnSe which is a part of the\nquaternary solid solution. This may explain a considerable decrease in the\nnumber of extended defects observed at the growth of CdZnTeSe crystals. The\nproposed theory allows different generalizations, and makes it possible to\nquantitively predict changes of the expected defect quality of the crystals at\nvariations in the composition of the solid solutions.",

Moreover,\nit is a frequent cause of distress and dissatisfaction during the early\npostoperative period. The tools used for predicting PONV at present have not\nyielded satisfactory results. Therefore, prognostic tools for the prediction of\nearly and delayed PONV were developed in this study with the aim of achieving\nsatisfactory predictive performance.\n  Methods: The retrospective data of adult patients admitted to the\npost-anesthesia care unit after undergoing surgical procedures under general\nanesthesia at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel, between September 1, 2018, and\nSeptember 1, 2023, were used in this study. An ensemble model of machine\nlearning algorithms trained on the data of 54848 patients was developed. The\nk-fold cross-validation method was used followed by splitting the data to train\nand test sets that optimally preserve the sociodemographic features of the\npatients, such as age, sex, and smoking habits, using the Bee Colony algorithm.\n  Findings: Among the 54848 patients, early and delayed PONV were observed in\n2706 (4.93%) and 8218 (14.98%) patients, respectively. The proposed PONV\nprediction tools could correctly predict early and delayed PONV in 84.0% and\n77.3% of cases, respectively, outperforming the second-best PONV prediction\ntool (Koivuranta score) by 13.4% and 12.9%, respectively.

We propose a\nnovel approach that fully leverages the spectral characteristics by extracting\ntwo distinct frequency components from the spectrum: low-frequency Spectral\nSaliency and high-frequency Spectral Edge. The Spectral Saliency approximates\nthe region of salient objects, while the Spectral Edge captures edge\ninformation of salient objects. These two complementary components, crucial for\nHSOD, are derived by computing from the inter-layer spectral angular distance\nof the Gaussian pyramid and the intra-neighborhood spectral angular gradients,\nrespectively. To effectively utilize this dual-frequency information, we\nintroduce a novel lightweight Spectrum-driven Mixed-frequency Network (SMN).\nSMN incorporates two parameter-free plug-and-play operators, namely Spectral\nSaliency Generator and Spectral Edge Operator, to extract the Spectral Saliency\nand Spectral Edge components from the input HSI independently. Subsequently,\nthe Mixed-frequency Attention module, comprised of two frequency-dependent\nheads, intelligently combines the embedded features of edge and saliency\ninformation, resulting in a mixed-frequency feature representation.\nFurthermore, a saliency-edge-aware decoder progressively scales up the\nmixed-frequency feature while preserving rich detail and saliency information\nfor accurate salient object prediction.

            "summary": "Retrained large language models (LLMs) have become extensively used across\nvarious sub-disciplines of natural language processing (NLP). In NLP, text\nclassification problems have garnered considerable focus, but still faced with\nsome limitations related to expensive computational cost, time consumption, and\nrobust performance to unseen classes. With the proposal of chain of thought\nprompting (CoT), LLMs can be implemented using zero-shot learning (ZSL) with\nthe step by step reasoning prompts, instead of conventional question and answer\nformats. The zero-shot LLMs in the text classification problems can alleviate\nthese limitations by directly utilizing pretrained models to predict both seen\nand unseen classes. Our research primarily validates the capability of GPT\nmodels in text classification. We focus on effectively utilizing prompt\nstrategies to various text classification scenarios. Besides, we compare the\nperformance of zero shot LLMs with other state of the art text classification\nmethods, including traditional machine learning methods, deep learning methods,\nand ZSL methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of LLMs\nunderscores their effectiveness as zero-shot text classifiers in three of the\nfour datasets analyzed. The proficiency is especially advantageous for small\nbusinesses or teams that may not have extensive knowledge in text\nclassification.",

Under the RSMA principles, the\nmessages for the covert user (Bob) and public user (Grace) are converted to the\ncommon and private streams at the legitimate transmitter (Alice) to realize\ndownlink transmissions, while the STAR-RIS is deployed not only to aid the\npublic transmissions from Alice to Grace, but also to shield the covert\ntransmissions from Alice to Bob against the warden (Willie). To characterize\nthe covert performance of the considered STAR-RIS-aided RSMA (STAR-RIS-RSMA)\nsystem, we derive analytical expression for the minimum average detection error\nprobability of Willie, based on which a covert rate maximization problem is\nformulated. To maximize Bob's covert rate while confusing Willie's monitoring,\nthe transmit power allocation, common rate allocation, and STAR-RIS\nreflection/transmission beamforming are jointly optimized subject to Grace's\nquality of service (QoS) requirements. The non-convex covert rate maximization\nproblem, consisting of highly coupled system parameters are decoupled into\nthree sub-problems of transmit power allocation, common rate allocation, and\nSTAR-RIS reflection/transmission beamforming, respectively. To obtain the\nrank-one constrained optimal solution for the sub-problem of optimizing the\nSTAR-RIS reflection/transmission beamforming, a penalty-based successive convex\napproximation scheme is developed. Moreover, an alternative optimization (AO)\nalgorithm is designed to determine the optimal solution for the sub-problem of\noptimizing the transmit power allocation, while the original problem is overall\nsolved by a new AO algorithm.",

However, query-driven learned cardinality\nestimators are dependent on sample workloads, requiring vast amounts of labeled\nqueries.

Although many\nresearch projects adopt machine learning and deep learning algorithms to\naddress the problem, few of them pay attention to the varying degrees of\ndependencies between stock prices. In this paper we introduce a hybrid model\nthat improves stock price prediction by emphasizing the dependencies between\nadjacent stock prices. The proposed model, ResNLS, is mainly composed of two\nneural architectures, ResNet and LSTM. ResNet serves as a feature extractor to\nidentify dependencies between stock prices across time windows, while LSTM\nanalyses the initial time-series data with the combination of dependencies\nwhich considered as residuals. In predicting the SSE Composite Index, our\nexperiment reveals that when the closing price data for the previous 5\nconsecutive trading days is used as the input, the performance of the model\n(ResNLS-5) is optimal compared to those with other inputs. Furthermore,\nResNLS-5 outperforms vanilla CNN, RNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM models in terms of\nprediction accuracy. It also demonstrates at least a 20% improvement over the\ncurrent state-of-the-art baselines. To verify whether ResNLS-5 can help clients\neffectively avoid risks and earn profits in the stock market, we construct a\nquantitative trading framework for back testing. The experimental results show\nthat the trading strategy based on predictions from ResNLS-5 can successfully\nmitigate losses during declining stock prices and generate profits in the\nperiods of rising stock prices.",

Controlling a nano quadrotor for accurate trajectory tracking\nat high speed in dynamic environments is challenging due to complex aerodynamic\nforces that introduce significant disturbances and large positional tracking\nerrors. These aerodynamic effects are difficult to be identified and require\nfeedback control that compensates for them in real time. NMPC allows the\nnano-quadrotor to control its motion in real time based on onboard sensor\nmeasurements, making it well-suited for tasks such as aggressive maneuvers and\nnavigation in complex and dynamic environments. The software package acados\nenables the implementation of the NMPC algorithm on embedded systems, which is\nparticularly important for nano-quadrotor due to its limited computational\nresources. Our autonomous navigation system is developed based on an AI-deck\nthat is a GAP8-based parallel ultra-low power computing platform with onboard\nsensors of a multi-ranger deck and a flow deck. The proposed method of\nNMPC-based trajectory tracking control is tested in simulation and the results\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in trajectory tracking while considering the\ndynamic environments. It is also tested on a real nano quadrotor hardware, 27-g\nCrazyflie 2.1, with a customized MCU running embedded NMPC, in which accurate\ntrajectory tracking results are achieved in dynamic real-world environments.",

            "summary": "This paper presents model-based and model-free learning methods for economic\nand ecological adaptive cruise control (Eco-ACC) of connected and autonomous\nelectric vehicles. For model-based optimal control of Eco-ACC, we considered\nlongitudinal vehicle dynamics and a quasi-steady-state powertrain model\nincluding the physical limits of a commercial electric vehicle. We used\nadaptive dynamic programming (ADP), in which the value function was trained\nusing data obtained from IPG CarMaker simulations. For real-time\nimplementation, forward multi-step look-ahead prediction and optimization were\nexecuted in a receding horizon scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the\nelectric machine while avoiding rear-end collisions and satisfying the\npowertrain, speed, and distance-gap constraints. For model-free optimal control\nof Eco-ACC, we applied two reinforcement learning methods, Deep Q-Network (DQN)\nand Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), in which deep neural networks\nwere trained in IPG CarMaker simulations. For performance demonstrations, the\nHWFET, US06, and WLTP Class 3b driving cycles were used to simulate the front\nvehicle, and the energy consumptions of the host vehicle and front vehicle were\ncompared. In high-fidelity IPG CarMaker simulations, the proposed\nlearning-based Eco-ACC methods demonstrated approximately 3-5% and 10-14%\nefficiency improvements in highway and city-highway driving scenarios,\nrespectively, compared with the front vehicle.

            "summary": "Remote sensing technology has become a promising tool in yield prediction.\nMost prior work employs satellite imagery for county-level corn yield\nprediction by spatially aggregating all pixels within a county into a single\nvalue, potentially overlooking the detailed information and valuable insights\noffered by more granular data. To this end, this research examines each county\nat the pixel level and applies multiple instance learning to leverage detailed\ninformation within a county. In addition, our method addresses the \"mixed\npixel\" issue caused by the inconsistent resolution between feature datasets and\ncrop mask, which may introduce noise into the model and therefore hinder\naccurate yield prediction. Specifically, the attention mechanism is employed to\nautomatically assign weights to different pixels, which can mitigate the\ninfluence of mixed pixels. The experimental results show that the developed\nmodel outperforms four other machine learning models over the past five years\nin the U.S. corn belt and demonstrates its best performance in 2022, achieving\na coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.84 and a root mean square error\n(RMSE) of 0.83. This paper demonstrates the advantages of our approach from\nboth spatial and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, through an in-depth study\nof the relationship between mixed pixels and attention, it is verified that our\napproach can capture critical feature information while filtering out noise\nfrom mixed pixels.",

A completely conclusive solution\nhas not yet been found, however, as shown by recent criticisms of commonly used\nuncertainty measures associated with second-order distributions, identifying\nundesirable theoretical properties of these measures. In light of these\ncriticisms, we propose a set of formal criteria that meaningful uncertainty\nmeasures for predictive uncertainty based on second-order distributions should\nobey.

Population-level analysis of the\nlatest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog of binary black hole mergers has identified\nevidence for such correlations assuming linear evolution of the mean and width\nof the effective spin distribution as a function of the binary mass ratio and\nmerger redshift. However, the complex astrophysical processes at play in\ncompact binary formation do not necessarily predict linear relationships\nbetween the distributions of these parameters. In this work, we relax the\nassumption of linearity and instead search for correlations using a more\nflexible cubic spline model. Our results suggest a nonlinear correlation\nbetween the width of the effective spin distribution and redshift. We also show\nthat the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaborations may find convincing Bayesian evidence\nfor nonlinear correlations by the end of the fourth observing run, O4.

This result exhibits a $\\sim 3\\sigma$ deviation from the\nStandard Model (SM) prediction. The observed enhancement with respect to the\nStandard Model could indicate the presence of invisible light new physics. In\nthis paper, we investigate whether this result can be accommodated in a minimal\nHiggs portal model, where the SM is extended by a singlet Higgs scalar that\ndecays invisibly to dark sector states. We find that current and future bounds\non invisible decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson completely exclude a new scalar\nwith a mass $\\gtrsim 10$ GeV. On the other hand, the Belle II results can be\nsuccessfully accommodated if the new scalar is lighter than $B$ mesons but\nheavier than kaons. We also investigate the cosmological implications of the\nnew states and explore the possibility that they are part of an abelian Higgs\nextension of the SM. Future Higgs factories are expected to place stringent\nbounds on the invisible branching ratio of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, and will be\nable to definitively test the region of parameter space favored by the Belle II\nresults.",

This paper proposes a unified paradigm, which combines\nthe kernelized autoncoding evolutionary search and the centriod-based\nprediction (denoted by KAEP), for solving dynamic multi-objective optimization\nproblems (DMOPs). Specifically, whenever a change is detected, KAEP reacts\neffectively to it by generating two subpopulations. The first subpoulation is\ngenerated by a simple centriod-based prediction strategy. For the second\ninitial subpopulation, the kernel autoencoder is derived to predict the moving\nof the Pareto-optimal solutions based on the historical elite solutions. In\nthis way, an initial population is predicted by the proposed combination\nstrategies with good convergence and diversity, which can be effective for\nsolving DMOPs.

Our aim is to design a physics-aware and generalizable AI-based PBSPT\ndose prediction method that has the underlying physics considered to achieve\nhigh generalizability to properly handle the outlier clinical cases. Methods\nand Materials: This study analyzed PBSPT plans of 103 prostate and 78 lung\ncancer patients from our institution,with each case comprising CT images,\nstructure sets, and plan doses from our Monte-Carlo dose engine (serving as the\nground truth). Three methods were evaluated in the ablation study: the\nROI-based method, the beam mask and sliding window method, and the noisy\nprobing dose method. Twelve cases with uncommon beam angles or prescription\ndoses tested the methods' generalizability to rare treatment planning\nscenarios. Performance evaluation used DVH indices, 3D Gamma passing rates\n(3%/2mm/10%), and dice coefficients for dose agreement. Results: The noisy\nprobing dose method showed improved agreement of DVH indices, 3D Gamma passing\nrates, and dice coefficients compared to the conventional methods for the\ntesting cases. The noisy probing dose method showed better generalizability in\nthe 6 outlier cases than the ROI-based and beam mask-based methods with 3D\nGamma passing rates (for prostate cancer, targets: 89.32%$\\pm$1.45% vs.\n93.48%$\\pm$1.51% vs. 96.79%$\\pm$0.83%, OARs: 85.87%$\\pm$1.73% vs.\n91.15%$\\pm$1.13% vs. 94.29%$\\pm$1.01%). The dose predictions were completed\nwithin 0.3 seconds. Conclusions: We've devised a novel noisy probing dose\nmethod for PBSPT dose prediction in prostate and lung cancer patients.

We highlight the\nequally important, but severely understudied, realm of temporal collective\ndecision-making, i.e., decisions about when to perform an action. We argue that\ntemporal collective decision making is likely to differ from spatial decision\nmaking in several crucial ways and probably involves different mechanisms,\nmodel predictions, and experimental outcomes.

            "summary": "Effective management of environmental resources and agricultural\nsustainability heavily depends on accurate soil moisture data. However,\ndatasets like the SMAP/Sentinel-1 soil moisture product often contain missing\nvalues across their spatiotemporal grid, which poses a significant challenge.\nThis paper introduces a novel Spatiotemporal Transformer model (ST-Transformer)\nspecifically designed to address the issue of missing values in sparse\nspatiotemporal datasets, particularly focusing on soil moisture data. The\nST-Transformer employs multiple spatiotemporal attention layers to capture the\ncomplex spatiotemporal correlations in the data and can integrate additional\nspatiotemporal covariates during the imputation process, thereby enhancing its\naccuracy. The model is trained using a self-supervised approach, enabling it to\nautonomously predict missing values from observed data points. Our model's\nefficacy is demonstrated through its application to the SMAP 1km soil moisture\ndata over a 36 x 36 km grid in Texas. It showcases superior accuracy compared\nto well-known imputation methods. Additionally, our simulation studies on other\ndatasets highlight the model's broader applicability in various spatiotemporal\nimputation tasks.",

            "summary": "Many material properties can be traced back to properties of their grain\nboundaries. Grain boundary energy (GBE), as a result, is a key quantity of\ninterest in the analysis and modeling of microstructure. A standard method for\ncalculating grain boundary energy is molecular dynamics (MD); however,\non-the-fly MD calculations are not tenable due to the extensive computational\ntime required. Lattice matching (LM) is a reduced-order method for estimating\nGBE quickly; however, it has only been tested against a relatively limited set\nof data, and does not have a suitable means for assessing error. In this work,\nwe use the recently published dataset of Homer et al. [1] to assess the\nperformance of LM over the full range of GB space, and to equip LM with a\nmetric for error estimation. LM is used to generate energy estimates, along\nwith predictions of facet morphology, for each of the 7,304 boundaries in the\nHomer dataset. In keeping with prior work, it is observed that LM predictions\nof low energy boundaries matches well with MD results. Moreover, there is a\ngood general agreement between LM and MD, and it is apparent that the error\nscales approximately linearly with the predicted energy value; this makes it\npossible to establish an empirical estimate on error for future LM\ncalculations. An essential part of the LM method is the faceting relaxation,\nwhich corrects the expected energy by convexification across the compact space\n(S2) of boundary plane orientations. The original Homer dataset did not allow\nfor faceting, but upon extended annealing, it was shown that facet patterns\nsimilar to those predicted by LM were emerging.",

Detailed transport\neffects are accounted for by including a mixture-averaged transport model when\nbuilding the flamelet database. This approach adds new terms to the transport\nequations of the controlling variables in the form of diffusive fluxes where\nthe coefficients can be computed from the information contained in the manifold\nand saved in the flamelet database. The manifold is constructed from the\nsolution of a set of premixed unstretched adiabatic one-dimensional flames with\nmixture-averaged transport for a range of mixture fraction within the\nflammability range. Special attention is given to the numerical aspects related\nto the construction of the chemical manifold to reduce the numerical error in\nevaluating the new terms derived from the preferential diffusion of certain\nspecies. Finally, a systematic application of the method to simulate laminar\nhydrogen flames in various canonical configurations is presented from premixed\nto stratified flames, including the case of a triple flames with different\nmixing lengths. The results demonstrate that the method describes accurately\nthe flame structure and propagation velocities at a low cost, showing a\nremarkable agreement with the detailed chemistry solutions for flame structure\nand propagation velocity.",

            "summary": "Global climate models (GCMs) are the main tools for understanding and\npredicting climate change. However, due to limited numerical resolutions, these\nmodels suffer from major structural uncertainties; e.g., they cannot resolve\ncritical processes such as small-scale eddies in atmospheric and oceanic\nturbulence. Thus, such small-scale processes have to be represented as a\nfunction of the resolved scales via closures (parametrization). The accuracy of\nthese closures is particularly important for capturing climate extremes.\nTraditionally, such closures are based on heuristics and simplifying\nassumptions about the unresolved physics. Recently, supervised-learned\nclosures, trained offline on high-fidelity data, have been shown to outperform\nthe classical physics-based closures. However, this approach requires a\nsignificant amount of high-fidelity training data and can also lead to\ninstabilities. Reinforcement learning is emerging as a potent alternative for\ndeveloping such closures as it requires only low-order statistics and leads to\nstable closures. In Scientific Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SMARL)\ncomputational elements serve a dual role of discretization points and learning\nagents. We leverage SMARL and fundamentals of turbulence physics to learn\nclosures for prototypes of atmospheric and oceanic turbulence. The policy is\ntrained using only the enstrophy spectrum, which is nearly invariant and can be\nestimated from a few high-fidelity samples (these few samples are far from\nenough for supervised/offline learning). We show that these closures lead to\nstable low-resolution simulations that, at a fraction of the cost, can\nreproduce the high-fidelity simulations' statistics, including the tails of the\nprobability density functions. The results demonstrate the high potential of\nSMARL for closure modeling for GCMs, especially in the regime of scarce data\nand indirect observations.",

The\ninvestigation, covering a wide temperature range (30 K-600 K), reports the\nemergence of an unusual optical phonon-dominated thermal transport in\ncrystalline Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$. Further, a significant contribution of\nfour-phonon scattering is recorded which markedly alters the lattice thermal\nconductivity. Therefore, the combined effect of cubic and quartic phonon\nanharmonicity is seen to navigate the underlying physical mechanism and open up\nintriguing phononic interactions in Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ at high temperature.\nIrrespective of three and four-phonon processes, Umklapp is seen to prevail\nover normal scattering events. Consequently, four-phonon scattering is found to\nnotably reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ to 28\n$\\%$ at room temperature and 42 $\\%$ at higher temperature. This quartic\nanharmonicity further manifests in the breakdown of T$^{-1}$ scaling of thermal\nconductivity and challenges the idea of a universal lower bound to phononic\nthermal diffusivity at high temperature. The faster decay of thermal\ndiffusivity compared to T$^{-1}$ is rationalized encompassing the quartic\nanharmonicity via a modified time scale. These results invoke better\nunderstanding and precision to the theoretical prediction of thermal transport\nproperties of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$.

The solutions obtained from VQE exhibit a high\napproximation ratio behavior, and consistently outperform several common\nportfolio models in backtesting over a long period of time. A unique aspect of\nour VQE scheme is that after the quantum circuit is optimized, only a minimal\nnumber of samplings is required to give a high approximation ratio result since\nthe probability distribution should be concentrated on high-quality solutions.\nWe further emphasize the importance of employing only a small number of final\nsamplings in our scheme by comparing the cost with those obtained from an\nexhaustive search and random sampling.

It is especially\nimportant in content creation to be able to modify generated motion or to\nspecify keyframes. To enable stochasticity as well as motion editing, we\npropose a lightweight audio-conditioned diffusion model for 3D facial motion.\nThis diffusion model can be trained on a small 3D motion dataset, maintaining\nexpressive lip motion output. In addition, it can be finetuned for specific\nsubjects, requiring only a short video of the person.

Unlike typical robot learning approaches which directly\nlearn how a robot should act from interaction data, we adopt a factorized\napproach that can leverage large-scale human videos to learn how a human would\naccomplish a desired task (a human plan), followed by translating this plan to\nthe robots embodiment. Specifically, we learn a human plan predictor that,\ngiven a current image of a scene and a goal image, predicts the future hand and\nobject configurations. We combine this with a translation module that learns a\nplan-conditioned robot manipulation policy, and allows following humans plans\nfor generic manipulation tasks in a zero-shot manner with no deployment-time\ntraining. Importantly, while the plan predictor can leverage large-scale human\nvideos for learning, the translation module only requires a small amount of\nin-domain data, and can generalize to tasks not seen during training. We show\nthat our learned system can perform over 16 manipulation skills that generalize\nto 40 objects, encompassing 100 real-world tasks for table-top manipulation and\ndiverse in-the-wild manipulation. https://homangab.github.io/hopman/",

The recently demonstrated semiconductor grafting\ntechnique provides an alternative and viable approach towards\nlattice-mismatched $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based p-n heterojunctions with high\nquality interfaces. Understanding and quantitatively characterizing the band\nalignment of the grafted heterojunctions is crucial for future bipolar device\ndevelopment employing the grafting method. In this work, we present a\nsystematic study of the band alignment in the grafted monocrystalline\nSi/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterostructure by employing X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy (XPS). The core level peaks and valence band spectra of the Si,\n$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and the grafted heterojunction were carefully obtained and\nanalyzed. The band diagrams of the Si/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterostructure were\nconstructed using two individual methods, the core level peak method and the\nvalence band spectrum method, by utilizing the different portions of the\nmeasured data. The reconstructed band alignments of the Si/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$\nheterostructure using the two different methods are identical within the error\nrange. The band alignment is also consistent with the prediction from the\nelectron affinity values of Si and $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The study suggests that\nthe interface defect density in grafted Si/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterostructure\nis at a sufficiently low level such that Fermi level pinning at the interface\nhas been completely avoided and the universal electron affinity rule can be\nsafely employed to construct the band diagrams of grafted monocrystalline\nSi/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterostructures.",

The marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) that\nfoliate these tubes can have complicated geometries as well as non-spherical\ntopologies. In particular, toroidal MOTSs form inside both of the original\nblack holes during the early stages of a head-on merger that starts from\ntime-symmetric initial data [1]. We show that toroidal MOTSs also form in the\nmaximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime as Kruskal time\nadvances from the $T=0$ moment of time symmetry. As for the merger simulations,\nthey cross the Einstein-Rosen bridge and are tightly sandwiched between the\napparent horizons in the two asymptotic regions at early times. This strongly\nsuggests that their formation is a consequence of the initial conditions rather\nthan merger physics. Finally, we consider MOTSs of spherical topology in the\nKruskal-Szekeres slicing and study their properties.

Using a two-band description of the\nground state and excited state and a mean-field approximation of the intra-band\natomic pairing, we investigate the phase transitions and crossover between\nsuperfluid/normal phases. Defining an effective scattering length by combining\nboth inter-band and intra-band interactions, we derive closed form gap and\nnumber density equations for both ground state and excited state atomic bands.\nWe find that our zero-temperature analytical results and finite-temperature\nnumerical results indicate that the system can show smooth crossover between\nBardeen, Cooper, and Schreifer (BCS) and Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)\nsuperfluidity for atoms in each band. In addition, we find that inter-band and\nintra-band interactions can induce quantum phase transitions between BCS/BEC\nsuperfluid states of atoms in one band to that of the other. We anticipate that\nour closed form analytical results can be used as a bench mark for future\nexperimental and theoretical investigations and will have an impact on the\ncurrent understanding of two-band superconductors such as MgB$_2$.",

For $\\al > 4$\nthe behaviour is similar to that of the nearest-neighbor model, with the\nformation of ordered domains of a typical size growing as $L(t) \\propto\n\\sqrt{t}$, until consensus is reached in a time or order $N\\ln N$, $N$ being\nthe number of agents. Dynamical scaling is violated due to an excess of\ninterfacial sites whose density decays as slow as $\\rho(t) \\propto 1/\\ln t$.\nSizable finite-time corrections are also present, which are absent in the case\nof nearest-neighbors interactions. For $0<\\al \\leq 4$ standard scaling is\nreinstated, and the correlation length increases algebraically as $L(t)\\propto\nt^{1/z}$, with $1/z=2/\\al$ for $3<\\al<4$ and $1/z=2/3$ for $0<\\al<3$. In\naddition, for $\\al \\le 3$, $L(t)$ depends on $N$ at any time $t>0$. Such\ncoarsening, however, only leads the system to a partially ordered metastable\nstate where correlations decay algebraically with distance, and whose lifetime\ndiverges in the $N\\to \\infty$ limit.

However, it is solely concentrated on the\nappearance and geometry modeling, while lacking in fine-grained object-level\nscene understanding. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Grouping, which\nextends Gaussian Splatting to jointly reconstruct and segment anything in\nopen-world 3D scenes. We augment each Gaussian with a compact Identity\nEncoding, allowing the Gaussians to be grouped according to their object\ninstance or stuff membership in the 3D scene. Instead of resorting to expensive\n3D labels, we supervise the Identity Encodings during the differentiable\nrendering by leveraging the 2D mask predictions by SAM, along with introduced\n3D spatial consistency regularization. Comparing to the implicit NeRF\nrepresentation, we show that the discrete and grouped 3D Gaussians can\nreconstruct, segment and edit anything in 3D with high visual quality, fine\ngranularity and efficiency. Based on Gaussian Grouping, we further propose a\nlocal Gaussian Editing scheme, which shows efficacy in versatile scene editing\napplications, including 3D object removal, inpainting, colorization and scene\nrecomposition.

To deal with this problem, we\npropose Virtual Fusion - a new method that takes advantage of unlabeled data\nfrom multiple time-synchronized sensors during training, but only needs one\nsensor for inference. Contrastive learning is adopted to exploit the\ncorrelation among sensors. Virtual Fusion gives significantly better accuracy\nthan training with the same single sensor, and in some cases, it even surpasses\nactual fusion using multiple sensors at test time. We also extend this method\nto a more general version called Actual Fusion within Virtual Fusion (AFVF),\nwhich uses a subset of training sensors during inference.

In traditional partially observable Markov decision processes\n(POMDP), ensuring safety typically involves estimating the belief in latent\nstates. However, accurately estimating an optimal Bayesian filter in POMDP to\ninfer latent states from observations in a continuous state space poses a\nsignificant challenge, largely due to the intractable likelihood. To tackle\nthis issue, we propose a stochastic model-based approach that guarantees RL\nsafety almost surely in the face of unknown system dynamics and partial\nobservation environments. We leveraged the Predictive State Representation\n(PSR) and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to represent future\nmulti-step observations analytically, and the results in this context are\nprovable. Furthermore, we derived essential operators from the kernel Bayes'\nrule, enabling the recursive estimation of future observations using various\noperators. Under the assumption of \\textit{undercompleness}, a polynomial\nsample complexity is established for the RL algorithm for the infinite size of\nobservation and action spaces, ensuring an $\\epsilon-$suboptimal safe policy\nguarantee.",

Our analysis is based on the Puiseux series expansion\nof the eigenvalue decomposition of analytic para-Hermitian matrices on the\ncomplex unit circumference. We study the case in which the rectangular matrix\ndoes not admit a full analytic singular value factorization, either due to\npartly multiplexed systems or to sign ambiguity. We show how to find an SVD\nfactorization in the ring of Puiseux series where each singular value and the\nassociated singular vectors present the same period and multiplexing structure,\nand we prove that it is always possible to find an analytic pseudo-circulant\nfactorization, meaning that any arbitrary arrangements of multiplexed systems\ncan be converted into a parallel form. In particular, one can show that the\nsign ambiguity can be overcome by allowing non-real holomorphic singular\nvalues.",

However, conventional models use grids\nwith fixed resolution and range and face computational inefficiencies due to\nthe uniform allocation of resources across all cells. To address this, we\npropose PointBeV, a novel sparse BeV segmentation model operating on sparse BeV\ncells instead of dense grids. This approach offers precise control over memory\nusage, enabling the use of long temporal contexts and accommodating\nmemory-constrained platforms. PointBeV employs an efficient two-pass strategy\nfor training, enabling focused computation on regions of interest. At inference\ntime, it can be used with various memory/performance trade-offs and flexibly\nadjusts to new specific use cases. PointBeV achieves state-of-the-art results\non the nuScenes dataset for vehicle, pedestrian, and lane segmentation,\nshowcasing superior performance in static and temporal settings despite being\ntrained solely with sparse signals. We will release our code along with two new\nefficient modules used in the architecture: Sparse Feature Pulling, designed\nfor the effective extraction of features from images to BeV, and Submanifold\nAttention, which enables efficient temporal modeling.

            "summary": "Simulation-based digital twins must provide accurate, robust and reliable\ndigital representations of their physical counterparts. Quantifying the\nuncertainty in their predictions plays, therefore, a key role in making\nbetter-informed decisions that impact the actual system. The update of the\nsimulation model based on data must be then carefully implemented. When applied\nto complex standing structures such as bridges, discrepancies between the\ncomputational model and the real system appear as model bias, which hinders the\ntrustworthiness of the digital twin and increases its uncertainty. Classical\nBayesian updating approaches aiming to infer the model parameters often fail at\ncompensating for such model bias, leading to overconfident and unreliable\npredictions. In this paper, two alternative model bias identification\napproaches are evaluated in the context of their applicability to digital twins\nof bridges. A modularized version of Kennedy and O'Hagan's approach and another\none based on Orthogonal Gaussian Processes are compared with the classical\nBayesian inference framework in a set of representative benchmarks.\nAdditionally, two novel extensions are proposed for such models: the inclusion\nof noise-aware kernels and the introduction of additional variables not present\nin the computational model through the bias term. The integration of such\napproaches in the digital twin corrects the predictions, quantifies their\nuncertainty, estimates noise from unknown physical sources of error and\nprovides further insight into the system by including additional pre-existing\ninformation without modifying the computational model.",

In the\nmeantime, current state-of-the-art 3D scene understanding approaches primarily\nrequire high-quality labels to train neural networks, which merely perform well\nin a fully supervised manner. This work presents a generalized and simple\nframework for dealing with 3D scene understanding when the labeled scenes are\nquite limited. To extract knowledge for novel categories from the pre-trained\nvision-language models, we propose a hierarchical feature-aligned pre-training\nand knowledge distillation strategy to extract and distill meaningful\ninformation from large-scale vision-language models, which helps benefit the\nopen-vocabulary scene understanding tasks. To leverage the boundary\ninformation, we propose a novel energy-based loss with boundary awareness\nbenefiting from the region-level boundary predictions. To encourage latent\ninstance discrimination and to guarantee efficiency, we propose the\nunsupervised region-level semantic contrastive learning scheme for point\nclouds, using confident predictions of the neural network to discriminate the\nintermediate feature embeddings at multiple stages. Extensive experiments with\nboth indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach\nin both data-efficient learning and open-world few-shot learning.

The driving term in these equations\nis the so-called one-particle exchange, which leads to a kinematic divergence\nfor particles on-mass-shell. A vital component in defining three-particle\namplitudes with definite parity and total angular momentum, which are used in\nspectroscopic studies, is to project the one-particle exchange into definite\npartial waves. We present a general procedure to construct exact analytic\npartial wave projections of the one-particle exchange contribution for any\nsystem composed of three spinless hadrons. Our result allows one full control\nover the analytic structure of the projection, which we explore for some\nlow-lying partial waves with applications to three pions.",

Our framework allows us to do a first deep dive into the topic and\nincludes a collection of streams and tasks composed from two existing video\ndatasets, plus methodology for performance evaluation that considers both\nadaptation and generalization. We employ pixel-to-pixel modelling as a\npractical and flexible way to switch between pre-training and single-stream\nevaluation as well as between arbitrary tasks, without ever requiring changes\nto models and always using the same pixel loss. Equipped with this framework we\nobtained large single-stream learning gains from pre-training with a novel\nfamily of future prediction tasks, found that momentum hurts, and that the pace\nof weight updates matters. The combination of these insights leads to matching\nthe performance of IID learning with batch size 1, when using the same\narchitecture and without costly replay buffers.",

            "summary": "There is a growing demand for explainable, transparent, and data-driven\nmodels within the domain of fraud detection. Decisions made by fraud detection\nmodels need to be explainable in the event of a customer dispute. Additionally,\nthe decision-making process in the model must be transparent to win the trust\nof regulators and business stakeholders. At the same time, fraud detection\nsolutions can benefit from data due to the noisy, dynamic nature of fraud and\nthe availability of large historical data sets. Finally, fraud detection is\nnotorious for its class imbalance: there are typically several orders of\nmagnitude more legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones. In this paper, we\npresent Deep Symbolic Classification (DSC), an extension of the Deep Symbolic\nRegression framework to classification problems. DSC casts classification as a\nsearch problem in the space of all analytic functions composed of a vocabulary\nof variables, constants, and operations and optimizes for an arbitrary\nevaluation metric directly. The search is guided by a deep neural network\ntrained with reinforcement learning. Because the functions are mathematical\nexpressions that are in closed-form and concise, the model is inherently\nexplainable both at the level of a single classification decision and the\nmodel's decision process. Furthermore, the class imbalance problem is\nsuccessfully addressed by optimizing for metrics that are robust to class\nimbalance such as the F1 score. This eliminates the need for oversampling and\nundersampling techniques that plague traditional approaches. Finally, the model\nallows to explicitly balance between the prediction accuracy and the\nexplainability. An evaluation on the PaySim data set demonstrates competitive\npredictive performance with state-of-the-art models, while surpassing them in\nterms of explainability. This establishes DSC as a promising model for fraud\ndetection systems.",

We develop the perturbation theory\nenabling one to calculate nonlinear corrections to correlation functions of the\nflow fluctuations found in the linear approximation. We calculate the\ncorrection to the pair correlation function and the triple correlation\nfunction. It enables us to establish the criterion of validity of the\nperturbation theory for different ratios of viscosity and bottom friction. We\nfind that the corrections to the second moment are anomalously weak in the\ncases of small bottom friction and of small viscosity and rely the weakness to\nthe energy balance and to the enstrophy balance. We demonstrate that at small\nbottom friction the triple correlation function is characterized by a universal\nscaling behavior in some region of lengths. The developed perturbation method\nwas verified and confirmed by direct numerical simulations.",

            "summary": "The tidal acceleration experienced by an object at the event horizon of a\nblack hole decreases as one over the square of the black hole's mass. As such\nthere is a maximum mass at which a black hole can tidally disrupt an object\noutside of its event horizon and potentially produce observable emission. This\nmaximum mass is known as the ``Hills mass'', and in full general relativity is\na function of both the black hole's spin $a_\\bullet$ and the inclination angle\nof the incoming object's orbit with respect to the black hole's spin axis\n$\\psi$. In this paper we demonstrate that the Hills mass can be represented by\na simple analytical function of $a_\\bullet$ and $\\psi$, the first general\nsolution of this problem. This general solution is found by utilising the\nsymmetries of a class of critical Kerr metric orbits known as the innermost\nbound spherical orbits. Interestingly, at fixed black hole spin the maximum\nHills mass can lie at incoming orbital inclinations outside of the black hole's\nequatorial plane $\\psi \\neq \\pi/2$. When compared to previous results in the\nliterature this effect can lead to an increase in the maximum Hills mass (at\nfixed spin) by as much as a factor of $\\sqrt{11/5} \\simeq 1.48$ for a maximally\nrotating black hole. We then demonstrate how Bayesian inference, coupled with\nan estimate of the mass of a black hole in a tidal disruption event, can be\nused to place conservative constraints on that black hole's spin. We provide a\npublicly available code tidalspin which computes these spin distributions.",

            "summary": "Accurate hand gesture prediction is crucial for effective upper-limb\nprosthetic limbs control. As the high flexibility and multiple degrees of\nfreedom exhibited by human hands, there has been a growing interest in\nintegrating deep networks with high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)\ngrids to enhance gesture recognition capabilities. However, many existing\nmethods fall short in fully exploit the specific spatial topology and temporal\ndependencies present in HD-sEMG data. Additionally, these studies are often\nlimited number of gestures and lack generality. Hence, this study introduces a\nnovel gesture recognition method, named STGCN-GR, which leverages\nspatio-temporal graph convolution networks for HD-sEMG-based human-machine\ninterfaces. Firstly, we construct muscle networks based on functional\nconnectivity between channels, creating a graph representation of HD-sEMG\nrecordings. Subsequently, a temporal convolution module is applied to capture\nthe temporal dependences in the HD-sEMG series and a spatial graph convolution\nmodule is employed to effectively learn the intrinsic spatial topology\ninformation among distinct HD-sEMG channels. We evaluate our proposed model on\na public HD-sEMG dataset comprising a substantial number of gestures (i.e.,\n65). Our results demonstrate the remarkable capability of the STGCN-GR method,\nachieving an impressive accuracy of 91.07% in predicting gestures, which\nsurpasses state-of-the-art deep learning methods applied to the same dataset.",

To overcome it, we propose TASFAR, a novel target-agnostic source-free\ndomain adaptation approach for regression tasks. Using prediction confidence,\nTASFAR estimates a label density map as the target label distribution, which is\nthen used to calibrate the source model on the target domain. We have conducted\nextensive experiments on four regression tasks with various domain gaps,\nnamely, pedestrian dead reckoning for different users, image-based people\ncounting in different scenes, housing-price prediction at different districts,\nand taxi-trip duration prediction from different departure points. TASFAR is\nshown to substantially outperform the state-of-the-art source-free UDA\napproaches by averagely reducing 22% errors for the four tasks and achieve\nnotably comparable accuracy as source-based UDA without using source data.",

For example, the Generalised Network\nAutoregressive (GNAR) models exploit such structure parsimoniously. We use the\nGNAR framework to introduce two association measures: the network and partial\nnetwork autocorrelation functions, and introduce Corbit (correlation-orbit)\nplots for visualisation. As with regular autocorrelation plots, Corbit plots\npermit interpretation of underlying correlation structures and, crucially, aid\nmodel selection more rapidly than using other tools such as AIC or BIC. We\nadditionally interpret GNAR processes as generalised graphical models, which\nconstrain the processes' autoregressive structure and exhibit interesting\ntheoretical connections to graphical models via utilization of higher-order\ninteractions. We demonstrate how incorporation of prior information is related\nto performing variable selection and shrinkage in the GNAR context. We\nillustrate the usefulness of the GNAR formulation, network autocorrelations and\nCorbit plots by modelling a COVID-19 network time series of the number of\nadmissions to mechanical ventilation beds at 140 NHS Trusts in England & Wales.\nWe introduce the Wagner plot that can analyse correlations over different time\nperiods or with respect to external covariates. In addition, we introduce plots\nthat quantify the relevance and influence of individual nodes. Our modelling\nprovides insight on the underlying dynamics of the COVID-19 series, highlights\ntwo groups of geographically co-located `influential' NHS Trusts and\ndemonstrates superior prediction abilities when compared to existing\ntechniques.",

            "summary": "The tourism sector is a sector with many opportunities for business\ndevelopment. Entrepreneurship in this sector promotes economic growth and job\ncreation. Knowing how entrepreneurial intention develops facilitates its\ntransformation into entrepreneurial behaviour. Entrepreneurial behaviour can\nadopt a causal logic, an effectual logic or a combination of both. Considering\nthe causal logic, decision-making is done through prediction. In this way,\nentrepreneurs try to increase their market share by planning strategies and\nanalysing possible deviations from their plans. Previous literature studies\ncausal entrepreneurial behaviour, as well as variables such as creative\ninnovation, proactive decisions and entrepreneurship training when the\nentrepreneur has already created his or her firm. However, there is an obvious\ngap at a stage prior to the start of entrepreneurial activity when the\nentrepreneurial intention is formed. This paper analyses how creativity,\nproactivity, entrepreneurship education and the propensity for causal behaviour\ninfluence entrepreneurial intentions. To achieve the research objective, we\nanalysed a sample of 464 undergraduate tourism students from two universities\nin southern Spain. We used SmartPLS 3 software to apply a structural equation\nmethodology to the measurement model composed of nine hypotheses. The results\nshow, among other relationships, that causal propensity, entrepreneurship\nlearning programmes and proactivity are antecedents of entrepreneurial\nintentions. These findings have implications for theory, as they fill a gap in\nthe field of entrepreneurial intentions. Considering propensity towards causal\nbehaviour before setting up the firm is unprecedented.

The space spanned by the IoUT nodes is\nthree-dimensional, i.e., users are located in half-sphere centered at the AP\nplaced at the bottom of a floating object at the water surface level. The\nanalytical expressions for the system throughput and reliability expressed in\nterms of the outage probability are derived. Based on the simulated\nsignal-to-noise-and-interference-ratio statistics and derived analytical\nexpressions, we present numerical results that investigate the trade-off\nbetween the system performance and the IoUT system parameters, such as the\nnumber of users, activation probability and type of water medium.

The current state of the analysis of\niterative algebraic solvers for nonsymmetric systems lacks the contraction\nproperty in the norms that are prescribed by the functional analytic setting.\nThis seemingly prevents their application in the optimality analysis of\ngoal-oriented adaptivity. As a remedy, this paper proposes a goal-oriented\nadaptive iteratively symmetrized finite element method (GOAISFEM). It employs a\nnested loop with a contractive symmetrization procedure, e.g., the Zarantonello\niteration, and a contractive algebraic solver, e.g., an optimal multigrid\nsolver. The various iterative procedures require well-designed stopping\ncriteria such that the adaptive algorithm can effectively steer the local mesh\nrefinement and the computation of the inexact discrete approximations. The main\nresults consist of full linear convergence of the proposed adaptive algorithm\nand the proof of optimal convergence rates with respect to both degrees of\nfreedom and total computational cost (i.e., optimal complexity).

These atypical cells can\noverwhelm healthy cells, leading to severe health consequences. Early and\naccurate detection of ALL is vital for effective treatment and improving\nsurvival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming, costly, and\nprone to errors. The paper proposes an automated detection approach using\ncomputer-aided diagnostic (CAD) models, leveraging deep learning techniques to\nenhance the accuracy and efficiency of leukemia diagnosis. The study utilizes\nvarious transfer learning models like ResNet101V2, VGG19, InceptionV3, and\nInceptionResNetV2 for classifying ALL. The methodology includes using the Local\nInterpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for ensuring the validity and\nreliability of the AI system's predictions. This approach is critical for\novercoming the \"black box\" nature of AI, where decisions made by models are\noften opaque and unaccountable. The paper highlights that the proposed method\nusing the InceptionV3 model achieved an impressive 98.38% accuracy,\noutperforming other tested models. The results, verified by the LIME algorithm,\nshowcase the potential of this method in accurately identifying ALL, providing\na valuable tool for medical practitioners.

This research presents a novel\napproach that combines Fuzzy Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) optimised Phase\nCohesive Sequence (PCS) representations and fuzzy CSP-optimized signal\namplitude representations. The research aims to examine alterations in\nElectroencephalogram (EEG) synchronisation between a state of alertness and\ndrowsiness, forecast drivers' reaction times by analysing EEG data, and\nsubsequently identify the presence of drowsiness. The study's findings indicate\nthat this approach successfully distinguishes between alert and drowsy mental\nstates. By employing a Deep Autoencoder-based data fusion technique and a\nregression model such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) or Least Absolute\nShrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), the proposed method outperforms using\nindividual feature sets in combination with a regressor model. This superiority\nis measured by evaluating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute\nPercentage Error (MAPE), and Correlation Coefficient (CC). In other words, the\nfusion of autoencoder-based amplitude EEG power features and PCS features, when\nused in regression, outperforms using either of these features alone in a\nregressor model. Specifically, the proposed data fusion method achieves a\n14.36% reduction in RMSE, a 25.12% reduction in MAPE, and a 10.12% increase in\nCC compared to the baseline model using only individual amplitude EEG power\nfeatures and regression.",

Experience\nsuggests pathologists have personal preferences for brightness when using a\nmicroscope which we hypothesised could be used as a predictor for display\nsetup. We conducted an online survey across 6 NHS hospitals to capture\nbrightness adjustment habits on both microscopes and screens. A subsample of\nrespondents took part in a practical task to determine microscope brightness\nand display luminance preferences.\n  The survey indicates 81% of respondents adjust the brightness on their\nmicroscope, compared with 11% adjusting their digital display. Display\nadjustments are more likely for visual comfort and ambient light compensation\nrather than for tissue factors, common for microscope adjustments. Twenty\nconsultants took part in the practical brightness assessment. Light preferences\non the microscope showed no correlation with screen preferences, except where a\npathologist has a markedly brighter microscope preference. All of the\npreferences in this cohort were for a display luminance of less than\n500cd/m$^2$, with 90% preferring 350cd/m$^2$ or less. There was no correlation\nbetween these preferences and the ambient lighting in the room.\n  We conclude that microscope preferences can only be used to predict screen\nluminance requirements where the microscope is being used at very high\nbrightness levels. A display capable of a brightness of 500cd/m$^2$ should be\nsuitable for almost all pathologists with 300cd/m$^2$ suitable for the\nmajority. The ability to adjust display luminance was felt to be important by\nthe majority of respondents. Further work needs to be undertaken to establish\nthe relationship between diagnostic performance, preferences and ambient\nlighting levels.",

            "summary": "The background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) predicted by the\ninflationary scenario induce incoherence of the electromagnetic field\npropagating over cosmological distances. We propose a new schema to constrain\nthe underlying inflationary parameters, in particular the tensor-to-scalar\nratio r, based on angular size-redshift \\theta-z measurement accomplished by\nvery long baseline interferometry (VLBI) surveys. VLBI observations rely on the\nvan-Citter Zernike theorem, which expresses the coherence length in terms of\nits wavelength and angular size, i.e., d_coh < \\lambda/\\theta. In this study,\nwe show that the interaction of the radio signal (involved in VLBI) with PGWs,\nalong the propagation from a source located at redshift z_* to the Earth, leads\nto the blurring of the visibility. The blurring effect is evaluated for the\nhighly-squeezed PGW, where it turns out that in order not to ruin the\nvisibility, the projected baseline of the interferometer must be smaller than\n\\xi_sq(z), which is inversely proportional to the the tensor-to-scalar ratio\nthrough \\xi_sq \\propto r^{-1/2}. Hence, VLBI observations based on interference\npattern lead to a constraint on r imposed by the fact that \\xi_sq(z) is greater\nthan d_coh of the emitted radiation. In order to evaluate the constraint, we\nuse a sample of compact radio quasars observed in VLBI and located at redshift\nrange 0.46<z<2.73. We obtain a stringent upper-bound on the tensor-to-scalar\nratio, r<2.10^{-6}, far beyond present constraints on this parameter. Further\nissues and caveats that potentially affect the results are reviewed. In\nparticular, the possible effect of quantum-to-classical transition of PGWs is\ndiscussed. Ultimately, the background of primordial tensor perturbations may be\nmore constrained with the help of the high-precision VLBI measurement of\nangular size-redshift of more distant sources.",

One of the most successful ultrasound pulse sequences to\ndisentangle these nonlinear effects relies on the transmission of\ncross-propagating plane waves. However, theory describing the noncollinear\nnonlinear interaction of two finite plane waves has not been fully developed\nand a better understanding of these effects would improve contrast-enhanced\nultrasound imaging further. Here, local nonlinear interactions at the\nintersection of two plane-waves are investigated by extending the Westervelt\nequation with a term including the Lagrangian density. The Iterative Nonlinear\nContrast Source (INCS) method is employed to numerically solve this full\nnonlinear wave equation for two 3D finite cross-propagating pulsed plane waves.\nIn addition, analytical expressions for the cross-propagation of two infinite\ncontinuous plane waves are derived. Numerical results obtained with INCS show\ngood agreement with the analytical expressions. Overall, the generated results\nshow that the pressure associated with local nonlinear effects is two orders of\nmagnitude lower than the pressure associated with global nonlinear effects.\nLocal nonlinear effects are therefore expected to be negligible in the context\nof single-shot ultrasound imaging, but they may influence approaches that\nsubtract pressure fields such as amplitude modulation or pulse inversion.",

Only recently have empirical predictions of various possible theories\nof quantum gravity been put to test. The dawn of multi-messenger high-energy\nastrophysics has been tremendously beneficial, as it allows us to study\nparticles with much higher energies and travelling much longer distances than\npossible in terrestrial experiments, but more progress is needed on several\nfronts.\n  A thorough appraisal of current strategies and experimental frameworks,\nregarding quantum gravity phenomenology, is provided here. Our aim is twofold:\na description of tentative multimessenger explorations, plus a focus on future\ndetection experiments.\n  As the outlook of the network of researchers that formed through the COST\nAction CA18108 \"Quantum gravity phenomenology in the multi-messenger approach\n(QG-MM)\", in this work we give an overview of the desiderata that future\ntheoretical frameworks, observational facilities, and data-sharing policies\nshould satisfy in order to advance the cause of quantum gravity phenomenology.",

            "published": "2023-12-01T07:04:47Z",
            "summary": "Existing neural implicit surface reconstruction methods have achieved\nimpressive performance in multi-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit\ngeometry priors such as depth maps or point clouds as regularization. However,\nthe reconstruction results still lack fine details because of the over-smoothed\ndepth map or sparse point cloud. In this work, we propose a neural implicit\nsurface reconstruction pipeline with guidance from 3D Gaussian Splatting to\nrecover highly detailed surfaces. The advantage of 3D Gaussian Splatting is\nthat it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a\nnaive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are\nthe centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus\nintroduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by\nenforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine\nthe point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the\nsurface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of\npoints as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction\nimproves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By\njointly optimizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting and the neural implicit model, our\napproach benefits from both representations and generates complete surfaces\nwith intricate details. Experiments on Tanks and Temples verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.",

Our main result is an (almost) optimal\nbound on the sample complexity of learning $\\ell_p$-distances for integer $p$.\nFor any $p \\ge 1$ we show that $\\tilde \\Theta(\\min(nd,n^2))$ labeled tuples are\nnecessary and sufficient for learning $d$-dimensional representations of\n$n$-point datasets.

            "summary": "It is widely believed that the dense supervision is better than the sparse\nsupervision in the field of depth completion, but the underlying reasons for\nthis are rarely discussed. In this paper, we find that the challenge of using\nsparse supervision for training Radar-Camera depth prediction models is the\nProjection Transformation Collapse (PTC). The PTC implies that sparse\nsupervision leads the model to learn unexpected collapsed projection\ntransformations between Image/Radar/LiDAR spaces. Building on this insight, we\npropose a novel ``Disruption-Compensation\" framework to handle the PTC, thereby\nrelighting the use of sparse supervision in depth completion tasks. The\ndisruption part deliberately discards position correspondences among\nImage/Radar/LiDAR, while the compensation part leverages 3D spatial and 2D\nsemantic information to compensate for the discarded beneficial position\ncorrespondence. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework\n(sparse supervision) outperforms the state-of-the-art (dense supervision) with\n11.6$\\%$ improvement in mean absolute error and $1.6 \\times$ speedup.

Quantum Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using\nquantum mechanisms. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient training\nprocess in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from $N$ to $log_2N$. This paper\nimplements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction\naccuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST\nhand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and cat/dog face images. Additionally, data\naugmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance\nof classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is\nalso implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data\naugmentation didn't improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind\nthis result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of Quantum\nmachine learning theory.",

            "summary": "The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the number of requisite\ntraining samples can be reduced with the use of various transfer learning\nmodels for predicting, for example, the chemical source terms of the\ndata-driven reduced-order model that represents the homogeneous ignition\nprocess of a hydrogen/air mixture. Principal component analysis is applied to\nreduce the dimensionality of the hydrogen/air mixture in composition space.\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to tabulate the reaction rates of\nprincipal components, and subsequently, a system of ordinary differential\nequations is solved. As the number of training samples decreases at the target\ntask (i.e.,for T0 > 1000 K and various phi), the reduced-order model fails to\npredict the ignition evolution of a hydrogen/air mixture. Three transfer\nlearning strategies are then applied to the training of the ANN model with a\nsparse dataset. The performance of the reduced-order model with a sparse\ndataset is found to be remarkably enhanced if the training of the ANN model is\nrestricted by a regularization term that controls the degree of knowledge\ntransfer from source to target tasks. To this end, a novel transfer learning\nmethod is introduced, parameter control via partial initialization and\nregularization (PaPIR), whereby the amount of knowledge transferred is\nsystemically adjusted for the initialization and regularization of the ANN\nmodel in the target task. It is found that an additional performance gain can\nbe achieved by changing the initialization scheme of the ANN model in the\ntarget task when the task similarity between source and target tasks is\nrelatively low.",

Accurate identification of nucleic acid-binding residues\nis a critical step in understanding the interaction mechanisms. Although many\ncomputationally based methods have been developed to predict nucleic\nacid-binding residues, challenges remain. In this study, a fast and accurate\nsequence-based method, called ESM-NBR, is proposed. In ESM-NBR, we first use\nthe large protein language model ESM2 to extract discriminative biological\nproperties feature representation from protein primary sequences; then, a\nmulti-task deep learning model composed of stacked bidirectional long\nshort-term memory (BiLSTM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks is\nemployed to explore common and private information of DNA- and RNA-binding\nresidues with ESM2 feature as input. Experimental results on benchmark data\nsets demonstrate that the prediction performance of ESM2 feature representation\ncomprehensively outperforms evolutionary information-based hidden Markov model\n(HMM) features. Meanwhile, the ESM-NBR obtains the MCC values for DNA-binding\nresidues prediction of 0.427 and 0.391 on two independent test sets, which are\n18.61 and 10.45% higher than those of the second-best methods, respectively.\nMoreover, by completely discarding the time-cost multiple sequence alignment\nprocess, the prediction speed of ESM-NBR far exceeds that of existing methods\n(5.52s for a protein sequence of length 500, which is about 16 times faster\nthan the second-fastest method).

            "summary": "Data-driven weather prediction (DDWP) models are increasingly becoming\npopular for weather forecasting. However, while operational weather forecasts\npredict a wide variety of weather variables, DDWPs currently forecast a\nspecific set of key prognostic variables. Non-prognostic (\"diagnostic\")\nvariables are sometimes modeled separately as dependent variables of the\nprognostic variables (c.f. FourCastNet), or by including the diagnostic\nvariable as a target in the DDWP. However, the cost of training and deploying\nbespoke models for each diagnostic variable can increase dramatically with more\ndiagnostic variables, and limit the operational use of such models. Likewise,\nretraining an entire DDWP each time a new diagnostic variable is added is also\ncost-prohibitive. We present an two-stage approach that allows new diagnostic\nvariables to be added to an end-to-end DDWP model without the expensive\nretraining. In the first stage, we train an autoencoder that learns to embed\nprognostic variables into a latent space. In the second stage, the autoencoder\nis frozen and \"downstream\" models are trained to predict diagnostic variables\nusing only the latent representations of prognostic variables as input. Our\nexperiments indicate that models trained using the two-stage approach offer\naccuracy comparable to training bespoke models, while leading to significant\nreduction in resource utilization during training and inference. This approach\nallows for new \"downstream\" models to be developed as needed, without affecting\nexisting models and thus reducing the friction in operationalizing new models.",

            "summary": "Asynchronous pipeline model parallelism with a \"1F1B\" (one forward, one\nbackward) schedule generates little bubble overhead and always provides quite a\nhigh throughput. However, the \"1F1B\" schedule inevitably leads to weight\ninconsistency and weight staleness issues due to the cross-training of\ndifferent mini-batches across GPUs. To simultaneously address these two\nproblems, in this paper, we propose an optimizer-dependent weight prediction\nstrategy (a.k.a PipeOptim) for asynchronous pipeline training. The key insight\nof our proposal is that we employ a weight prediction strategy in the forward\npass to ensure that each mini-batch uses consistent and staleness-free weights\nto compute the forward pass. To be concrete, we first construct the weight\nprediction scheme based on the update rule of the used optimizer when training\nthe deep neural network models. Then throughout the \"1F1B\" pipelined training,\neach mini-batch is mandated to execute weight prediction ahead of the forward\npass, subsequently employing the predicted weights to perform the forward pass.\nAs a result, PipeOptim 1) inherits the advantage of the \"1F1B\" schedule and\ngenerates pretty high throughput, and 2) can ensure effective parameter\nlearning regardless of the type of the used optimizer. To verify the\neffectiveness of our proposal, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations\nusing eight different deep-learning models spanning three machine-learning\ntasks including image classification, sentiment analysis, and machine\ntranslation. The experiment results demonstrate that PipeOptim outperforms the\npopular pipelined approaches including GPipe, PipeDream, PipeDream-2BW, and\nSpecTrain.

We\nstrategically introduce stimuli-responsive bilayer bridge films within\nconventional honeycombs to achieve the desired actuation. The films are\nincorporated such that, in response to an external field (thermal, electric,\nchemical, etc.), the bridge film bends out-of-plane, activating the honeycomb\nin the plane. The conventional out-of-plane deformation of the bridge film can\nlead to interesting and unconventional actuation in the plane. An analytical\nmodel of this coupled unit cell behaviour is developed using curved beam\ntheory, and the model is validated against finite element simulations. Several\napplications of such designs are presented. Unit cell architectures exhibiting\nboth positive and negative macroscopic actuation are proposed, and the\ncriterion for achieving such actuation is derived analytically. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that by altering the topology, unidirectional and bidirectional\nnegative actuation can be achieved. We also propose designs that result in the\nnegative actuation of the structure with both monotonically increasing and\nmonotonically decreasing stimuli. Finally, by combining two macroscopic\nstructures with positive and negative actuation, we design efficient\nactuators/sensors that bend in the plane in response to a stimulus.",

A CV model leveraged in this environment can become\nuncertain in its predictions, as the environment and the objects existing in\nthe environment begin to change.

However, discrepancies between theoretical predictions and\nempirical observations have opened up important questions yet to be answered.\nStudying statistically significant and unbiased samples of BSGs can help to\nimprove the situation. We aim to perform a homogeneous and comprehensive\nquantitative spectroscopic analysis of a large sample of Galactic BSGs from the\nIACOB spectroscopic database. We derive the projected rotational velocity\n($v\\sin i$) and macroturbulent broadening ($v_{\\rm mac}$) using IACOB-BROAD. We\nused FASTWIND computations to derive effective temperatures ($T_{\\rm eff}$),\nsurface gravities, microturbulences ($\\xi$), Si and He surface abundances, and\nthe wind-strength parameter. We provide estimates of the above-mentioned\nquantities for the largest sample of Galactic BSGs spectroscopically analyzed\nto date, comprising 538 O9-B5 type stars. We find a drop in the relative number\nof BSGs at ~21 kK, coinciding with a scarcity of fast rotating stars below that\ntemperature. We speculate that this feature might be roughly delineating the\nlocation of the empirical Terminal-Age-Main-Sequence in the 15-85Msol range. By\ninvestigating the main characteristics of the $v\\sin i$ distribution of O stars\nand BSGs as a function of $T_{\\rm eff}$, we propose that an efficient mechanism\ntransporting angular momentum from the stellar core to the surface might be\noperating along the main sequence. We find correlations between $\\xi$, $v_{\\rm\nmac}$ and the spectroscopic luminosity. We also find that no more than 20% of\nthe BSGs have atmospheres enriched in He, and suggest that the origin of this\nspecific sub-sample of BSGs might be in binary evolution. We do not find clear\nempirical evidence of an increase in the wind-strength over the wind\nbi-stability region towards lower $T_{\\rm eff}$.",

They have shown particularly striking\nsuccesses when training an operator, which takes as input a PDE in some family,\nand outputs its solution. However, the architectural design space, especially\ngiven structural knowledge of the PDE family of interest, is still poorly\nunderstood. We seek to remedy this gap by studying the benefits of weight-tied\nneural network architectures for steady-state PDEs. To achieve this, we first\ndemonstrate that the solution of most steady-state PDEs can be expressed as a\nfixed point of a non-linear operator. Motivated by this observation, we propose\nFNO-DEQ, a deep equilibrium variant of the FNO architecture that directly\nsolves for the solution of a steady-state PDE as the infinite-depth fixed point\nof an implicit operator layer using a black-box root solver and differentiates\nanalytically through this fixed point resulting in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ training\nmemory. Our experiments indicate that FNO-DEQ-based architectures outperform\nFNO-based baselines with $4\\times$ the number of parameters in predicting the\nsolution to steady-state PDEs such as Darcy Flow and steady-state\nincompressible Navier-Stokes. Finally, we show FNO-DEQ is more robust when\ntrained with datasets with more noisy observations than the FNO-based\nbaselines, demonstrating the benefits of using appropriate inductive biases in\narchitectural design for different neural network based PDE solvers. Further,\nwe show a universal approximation result that demonstrates that FNO-DEQ can\napproximate the solution to any steady-state PDE that can be written as a fixed\npoint equation.",

A main result of this article is that under certain\nassumptions (satisfied for example when $G$ is a uniform pro-$p$ group) the\ndistribution algebra $D^\\dagger(G,K)$, i.e. the strong dual of\n$\\mathcal{C}^\\dagger(G,K)$, is a Fr\\'{e}chet-Stein algebra in the sense of\nSchneider and Teitelbaum.\n  In the last section we introduce overconvergent representations and show that\nthere is an anti-equivalence of categories between overconvergent\n$G$-representations of compact type and continuous $D^\\dagger(G, K)$-modules on\nnuclear Fr\\'{e}chet spaces. This is analogous to the anti-equivalence between\nlocally analytic representations and modules over the locally analytic\ndistribution algebra as proved by Schneider and Teitelbaum.",

Here, we propose a method to\nconsistently derive hypothetical studies that retain as many of the\ndependencies in the original study as mathematically possible, while removing\nany association of observed confounders to the independent variables. Using\nhistoric studies, we illustrate how the confounding-free scenario re-estimates\nthe effect size of the intervention.

The measurements showed excellent agreement with\ndistributions predicted by $\\textit{ab initio}$ quantum scattering\ncalculations.

The distributed nature of these\nrepresentations, however, entangles together multiple attributes or concepts of\ndata instances (e.g., the topic or sentiment of a text, characteristics of the\nauthor (age, gender, etc), etc). Recent work has proposed the task of concept\nerasure, in which rather than making a concept predictable, the goal is to\nremove an attribute from distributed representations while retaining other\ninformation from the original representation space as much as possible. In this\npaper, we propose a new distance metric learning-based objective, the\nKernelized Rate-Distortion Maximizer (KRaM), for performing concept erasure.\nKRaM fits a transformation of representations to match a specified distance\nmeasure (defined by a labeled concept to erase) using a modified\nrate-distortion function. Specifically, KRaM's objective function aims to make\ninstances with similar concept labels dissimilar in the learned representation\nspace while retaining other information. We find that optimizing KRaM\neffectively erases various types of concepts: categorical, continuous, and\nvector-valued variables from data representations across diverse domains. We\nalso provide a theoretical analysis of several properties of KRaM's objective.\nTo assess the quality of the learned representations, we propose an alignment\nscore to evaluate their similarity with the original representation space.\nAdditionally, we conduct experiments to showcase KRaM's efficacy in various\nsettings, from erasing binary gender variables in word embeddings to\nvector-valued variables in GPT-3 representations.",

Within human metabolic systems, drugs interact with protein\ntargets in cells, influencing target activities and subsequently impacting\nbiological pathways to promote healthy functions and treat diseases. Moving\nbeyond binary relationships and exploring tighter triple relationships is\nessential to understanding drugs' mechanism of action (MoAs). Moreover,\nidentifying the heterogeneity of drugs, targets, and diseases, along with their\ndistinct characteristics, is critical to model these complex interactions\nappropriately. To address these challenges, we effectively model the\ninterconnectedness of all entities in a heterogeneous graph and develop a novel\nHeterogeneous Graph Triplet Attention Network (\\texttt{HeTriNet}).\n\\texttt{HeTriNet} introduces a novel triplet attention mechanism within this\nheterogeneous graph structure. Beyond pairwise attention as the importance of\nan entity for the other one, we define triplet attention to model the\nimportance of pairs for entities in the drug-target-disease triplet prediction\nproblem. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that\n\\texttt{HeTriNet} outperforms several baselines, demonstrating its remarkable\nproficiency in uncovering novel drug-target-disease relationships.",

Of\nparticular interest are single interface or Josephson Junction architectures\ninvolving Weyl semimetals, which are predicted to host odd parity, potentially\ntopological, superconducting states. These expectations rely crucially on the\ntunneling of electronic states at the interface between the two systems. In\nthis study, we revisit the question of induced superconductivity in an\ninversion broken WSM via quantum tunneling, treating the interface as an\neffective potential barrier. We determine the conditions under which the gap\nfunction couples to the Weyl physics and its properties within the WSM.

When different pairs\nstart to overlap temporally, accidental coincidences are thought to give rise\nto a 'classical' quadratic scaling which dominates the signal at large photon\nfluxes and thus recovers a supposedly classical regime, where any quantum\nadvantage is thought to be lost. Here we scrutinize this assumption and\ndemonstrate that quantum-enhanced absorption cross sections can persist even to\nvery large photon numbers. To this end, we use a minimal model for quantum\nlight, which can interpolate continuously between the entangled pair and a\nhigh-photon-flux limit, to derive analytically ETPA cross sections and the\nintensity crossover regime. We investigate the interplay between spectral and\nspatial degrees of freedom, how linewidth broadening of the sample impacts the\nexperimentally achievable enhancement.",

We show that\na comprehensive understanding of the dynamic behavior of systems with quenched\ndefects requires a generalized definition of the dynamic order parameter. By\ndoing so, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quenched defects lowers the\ndynamic critical temperature as well, with a linear trend across the range of\ndefect fractions considered. We also explore if and how it is possible to\npredict the dynamic behavior of specific magnetic systems with quenched\nrandomness.

            "summary": "Quantum Markov models are employed ubiquitously in quantum physics and in\nquantum information theory due to their relative simplicity and analytical\ntractability. In particular, these models are known to give accurate\napproximations for a wide range of quantum optical and mesoscopic systems.\nHowever, in general, the validity of the Markov approximation entails\nassumptions regarding properties of the system of interest and its environment,\nwhich may not be satisfied or accurate in arbitrary physical systems.\nTherefore, developing useful modelling tools for general non-Markovian quantum\nsystems for which the Markov approximation is inappropriate or deficient is an\nundertaking of significant importance. This work considers non-Markovian\nprincipal quantum systems that can be embedded in a larger Markovian quantum\nsystem with one or more compound baths consisting of an auxiliary quantum\nsystem and a quantum white noise field, and derives a set of coupled stochastic\nand quantum master equations for embedded non-Markovian quantum systems. The\ncase of a purely Hamiltonian coupling between the principal and auxiliary\nsystems as a closed system without coupling to white noises is included as a\nspecial case. The results are expected to be of interest for (open-loop and\nfeedback) control of continuous-time non-Markovian systems and studying reduced\nmodels for numerical simulation of such systems. They may also shed more light\non the general structure of continuous-time non-Markovian quantum systems.",

BoNs admit a 4-dimensional\ndescription in terms of a singular Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton involving\nthe size modulus field, stabilized by some potential $V(\\phi)$. Using the\nso-called tunneling potential ($V_t$) approach, we study which types of BoNs\nare possible and for which potentials $V(\\phi)$ can they be present. We\nidentify four different types of BoN, characterized by different asymptotic\nbehaviours at the BoN core and corresponding to different classes of higher\ndimensional theories, which we also classify. Combining numerous analytical and\nnumerical examples, we study the interplay of BoN decays with other standard\ndecay channels, identify the possible types of quenching of BoN decays and show\nhow BoNs for flux compactifications can also be described in 4 dimensions by a\nmultifield $V_t$.

We show that, in the optically-thin\nlimit, a purely analytical argument naturally predicts large, EW$_{\\rm\nFeK\\alpha}\\sim$1 keV, values for such lines, regardless of the details of\nequivalent hydrogen column density, $N_H$, or reprocessor geometry.

We compare to $Chandra$ observations from the literature and discuss\nthat our results are consistent with the large EW$_{\\rm FeK\\alpha}$ values\nreported for local AGN, for which the line is detected in extended, up to\n$\\sim$kpc-scale, regions. We argue that large EW$_{\\rm FeK\\alpha}$ from\nkpc-scale regions in AGN should be ubiquitous, because they do not depend on\nthe absolute luminosity of the central X-ray source, and are measured only\nagainst the scattered continuum.

In our calculations we employ\nupdated physics important for massive star evolution (moderate rotation, high\novershooting, magnetic angular momentum transport). The key feature of our\nmodels is a new prescription for stellar winds for massive stars that updates\nsignificantly previous calculations. We find a maximum BH mass of 28 M$_\\odot$\nat Z = 0.014.

PoseGPT\naddresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as a distinct signal token\nwithin a multi-modal LLM, enabling direct generation of 3D body poses from both\ntextual and visual inputs. This approach not only simplifies pose prediction\nbut also empowers LLMs to apply their world knowledge in reasoning about human\nposes, fostering two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning\nabout pose estimation. These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate\n3D poses from subtle text queries, possibly accompanied by images. We establish\nbenchmarks for these tasks, moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and\nestimation methods. Our results show that PoseGPT outperforms existing\nmultimodal LLMs and task-sepcific methods on these newly proposed tasks.\nFurthermore, PoseGPT's ability to understand and generate 3D human poses based\non complex reasoning opens new directions in human pose analysis.",

The framework offers\nthree distinct advantages. First, it only learns simple continual motions\nbetween adjacent frames, therefore avoiding modeling complex long-range motions\nthat require huge training data. Second, it preserves the high-fidelity\ngeneration ability of the pre-trained image diffusion models by making only\nminimal network modifications. Third, it can generate arbitrarily long videos\nconditioned on a variety of prompts such as text, image or their combinations,\nmaking it highly versatile and flexible. To combat the common drifting issue in\nAR models, we propose masked diffusion model which implicitly learns which\ninformation can be drawn from reference images rather than network predictions,\nin order to reduce the risk of generating inconsistent appearances that cause\ndrifting. Moreover, we further enhance generation coherence by conditioning it\non the initial frame, which typically contains minimal noise. This is\nparticularly useful for long video generation.

            "summary": "We present ContinuityCam, a novel approach to generate a continuous video\nfrom a single static RGB image, using an event camera. Conventional cameras\nstruggle with high-speed motion capture due to bandwidth and dynamic range\nlimitations. Event cameras are ideal sensors to solve this problem because they\nencode compressed change information at high temporal resolution. In this work,\nwe propose a novel task called event-based continuous color video\ndecompression, pairing single static color frames and events to reconstruct\ntemporally continuous videos. Our approach combines continuous long-range\nmotion modeling with a feature-plane-based synthesis neural integration model,\nenabling frame prediction at arbitrary times within the events. Our method does\nnot rely on additional frames except for the initial image, increasing, thus,\nthe robustness to sudden light changes, minimizing the prediction latency, and\ndecreasing the bandwidth requirement. We introduce a novel single objective\nbeamsplitter setup that acquires aligned images and events and a novel and\nchallenging Event Extreme Decompression Dataset (E2D2) that tests the method in\nvarious lighting and motion profiles. We thoroughly evaluate our method through\nbenchmarking reconstruction as well as various downstream tasks. Our approach\nsignificantly outperforms the event- and image- based baselines in the proposed\ntask.",

While this paper focuses on network traffic\nprediction using our adaptive forecasting framework, this framework can also be\napplied to other machine learning applications in uncertain environments.\n  The framework begins with unsupervised clustering of time-series data to\nidentify unique trends and seasonal patterns. Subsequently, we apply supervised\nlearning for traffic volume prediction within each cluster. This specialization\ntowards specific traffic behaviors occurs without penalties from spatial and\ntemporal variations. Finally, the framework adaptively assigns trained models\nto new, previously unseen cells.

We propose a logistic\nBradley-Terry probe which predicts word pair preferences of LLMs from the\nwords' hidden vectors. We first validate our probe on three pair preference\ntasks and thirteen LLMs, where we outperform the word embedding association\ntest (WEAT), a standard approach in testing for implicit association, by a\nrelative 27% in error rate. We also find that word pair preferences are best\nrepresented in the middle layers. Next, we transfer probes trained on harmless\ntasks (e.g., pick the larger number) to controversial ones (compare\nethnicities) to examine biases in nationality, politics, religion, and gender.\nWe observe substantial bias for all target classes: for instance, the Mistral\nmodel implicitly prefers Europe to Africa, Christianity to Judaism, and\nleft-wing to right-wing politics, despite declining to answer. This suggests\nthat instruction fine-tuning does not necessarily debias contextualized\nembeddings. Our codebase is at https://github.com/castorini/biasprobe.",

We initiate the phenomenological study of the\ncorresponding ``electrobaryonic axion\", a particle that couples with both the\nbaryon chemical potential and the electromagnetic field. Neutron stars,\nparticularly magnetars, possessing high baryon density and strong magnetic\nfields, can naturally develop a thin axion hair around their surface. In this\nstudy, we calculate this phenomenon, considering the effects of neutron star\nrotation and general relativity. For axion particles lighter than the neutron\nstar rotation frequency, the anomalous interaction can also induce the emission\nof axion particles from the neutron star.

The\nbreakdown of the formalism is signaled by the fact that a real scattering\namplitude is predicted in a regime where it should be complex. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by deriving an extended formalism that includes the\nnearest branch cut, arising from single particle exchange. We focus on\ntwo-nucleon ($NN \\to NN$) scattering, for which the cut arises from pion\nexchange, but give expressions for any system with a single channel of\nidentical particles. The new result takes the form of a modified quantization\ncondition that can be used to constrain an intermediate K-matrix in which the\ncut is removed. In a second step, integral equations, also derived in this\nwork, must be used to convert the K-matrix to the physical scattering\namplitude. We also show how the new formalism reduces to the standard approach\nwhen the $N \\to N \\pi$ coupling is set to zero.",

In recent years, publicly available material data\nrepositories containing data for various material properties have grown\nrapidly. In this work, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Crystalline\nMaterials (MLCM), a new method for training a foundation model for crystalline\nmaterials via multimodal alignment, where high-dimensional material properties\n(i.e. modalities) are connected in a shared latent space to produce highly\nuseful material representations. We show the utility of MLCM on multiple axes:\n(i) MLCM achieves state-of-the-art performance for material property prediction\non the challenging Materials Project database; (ii) MLCM enables a novel,\nhighly accurate method for inverse design, allowing one to screen for stable\nmaterial with desired properties; and (iii) MLCM allows the extraction of\ninterpretable emergent features that may provide insight to material\nscientists. Further, we explore several novel methods for aligning an arbitrary\nnumber of modalities, improving upon prior art in multimodal learning that\nfocuses on bimodal alignment. Our work brings innovations from the ongoing AI\nrevolution into the domain of materials science and identifies materials as a\ntestbed for the next generation of AI.",

Adopting two physically\nwell-motivated anisotropy profiles, we numerically solve the stellar structure\nequations in order to explore the consequences of anisotropic pressure on\nvarious macroscopic properties such as radius, gravitational mass, surface\nredshift, moment of inertia, tidal Love number and oscillation spectrum.\nRemarkably, for both anisotropy models, negative anisotropies increase the\nradial stability of interacting quark stars, while the opposite occurs for\npositive anisotropies. However, for the Bowers-Liang profile, the central\ndensity corresponding to the maximum-mass point does not coincide with the\ncentral density where the squared oscillation frequency vanishes, indicating\nthat the existence of stable anisotropic interacting quark stars is possible\nbeyond the maximum mass for negative anisotropies. Additionally, we compare our\ntheoretical predictions with several observational mass-radius measurements and\ntidal deformability constraints, which suggest that both strong interaction\neffects and anisotropy effects play a crucial role in describing compact stars\nobserved in the Universe.",

While some work has found that the surprisal estimates from these\nmodels can be used to predict a wide range of human neural and behavioral\nresponses, other work studying more complex syntactic phenomena has found that\nthese surprisal estimates generate incorrect behavioral predictions. This paper\nexplores the extent to which the misalignment between empirical and\nmodel-predicted behavior can be minimized by training models on more\ndevelopmentally plausible data, such as in the BabyLM Challenge. We trained\nteacher language models on the BabyLM \"strict-small\" dataset and used sentence\nlevel surprisal estimates from these teacher models to create a curriculum. We\nfound tentative evidence that our curriculum made it easier for models to\nacquire linguistic knowledge from the training data: on the subset of tasks in\nthe BabyLM challenge suite evaluating models' grammatical knowledge of English,\nmodels first trained on the BabyLM data curriculum and then on a few randomly\nordered training epochs performed slightly better than models trained on\nrandomly ordered epochs alone. This improved linguistic knowledge acquisition\ndid not result in better alignment with human reading behavior, however: models\ntrained on the BabyLM dataset (with or without a curriculum) generated\npredictions that were as misaligned with human behavior as models trained on\nlarger less curated datasets. This suggests that training on developmentally\nplausible datasets alone is likely insufficient to generate language models\ncapable of accurately predicting human language processing.",

However, there lacks a\nsystematic and standardized benchmark to foster the development of LLMs in task\nautomation. To this end, we introduce TaskBench to evaluate the capability of\nLLMs in task automation. Specifically, task automation can be formulated into\nthree critical stages: task decomposition, tool invocation, and parameter\nprediction to fulfill user intent. This complexity makes data collection and\nevaluation more challenging compared to common NLP tasks. To generate\nhigh-quality evaluation datasets, we introduce the concept of Tool Graph to\nrepresent the decomposed tasks in user intent, and adopt a back-instruct method\nto simulate user instruction and annotations. Furthermore, we propose TaskEval\nto evaluate the capability of LLMs from different aspects, including task\ndecomposition, tool invocation, and parameter prediction. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that TaskBench can effectively reflects the capability of LLMs in\ntask automation. Benefiting from the mixture of automated data construction and\nhuman verification, TaskBench achieves a high consistency compared to the human\nevaluation, which can be utilized as a comprehensive and faithful benchmark for\nLLM-based autonomous agents.",

The recent 3D\nGaussian Splatting method has achieved the state-of-the-art rendering quality\nand speed combining the benefits of both primitive-based representations and\nvolumetric representations. However, it often leads to heavily redundant\nGaussians that try to fit every training view, neglecting the underlying scene\ngeometry. Consequently, the resulting model becomes less robust to significant\nview changes, texture-less area and lighting effects. We introduce Scaffold-GS,\nwhich uses anchor points to distribute local 3D Gaussians, and predicts their\nattributes on-the-fly based on viewing direction and distance within the view\nfrustum. Anchor growing and pruning strategies are developed based on the\nimportance of neural Gaussians to reliably improve the scene coverage.

A conjecture of Lov\\'{a}sz and\nSimonovits from the 1970s states that, for every $r\\ge 3$, if $n$ is\nsufficiently large then, for every $e\\le \\binom{n}{2}$, at least one extremal\ngraph can be obtained from a complete partite graph by adding a triangle-free\ngraph into one part.\n  In this note, we explicitly write the minimum number of $r$-cliques predicted\nby the above conjecture. Also, we describe what we believe to be the set of\nextremal graphs for any $r\\ge 4$ and all large $n$, amending the previous\nconjecture of Pikhurko and Razborov.",

The model aims to provide accurate credit assessment\nprediction for new supply chain borrowers with limited historical data. Here,\nthe two-stream domain adaptation architecture with correlation alignment\n(CORAL) loss is used as a core model and is equipped with transformer, which\nprovides insights about the learned features and allow efficient\nparallelization during training. Thanks to the domain adaptation capability of\nthe proposed model, the domain shift between the source and target domain is\nminimized. Therefore, the model exhibits good generalization where the source\nand target do not follow the same distribution, and a limited amount of target\nlabeled instances exist. Furthermore, we employ Local Interpretable\nModel-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to provide more insight into the model\nprediction and identify the key features contributing to supply chain credit\nassessment decisions. The proposed model addresses four significant supply\nchain credit assessment challenges: domain shift, cold start, imbalanced-class\nand interpretability. Experimental results on a real-world data set demonstrate\nthe superiority of TransCORALNet over a number of state-of-the-art baselines in\nterms of accuracy.

Given the multi-variate nature of the\nassessment, which may include criteria (e.g. fairness) not related to\npredictive accuracy, this step is often not straightforward and suffers from\nthe lack of existing tools. For instance, it is common to make use of a tabular\npresentation of the solutions, which provide little information about the\ntrade-offs and the relations between criteria over the set of solutions.\n  This paper proposes an original methodology to support data scientists in the\ninterpretation and comparison of the MOFS outcome by combining post-processing\nand visualisation of the set of solutions. The methodology supports the data\nscientist in the selection of an optimal feature subset by providing her with\nhigh-level information at three different levels: objectives, solutions, and\nindividual features.\n  The methodology is experimentally assessed on two feature selection tasks\nadopting a GA-based MOFS with six objectives (number of selected features,\nbalanced accuracy, F1-Score, variance inflation factor, statistical parity, and\nequalised odds).

In\nthis domain, federated learning is one of the most effective and promising\ntechniques for training global machine learning models, while preserving data\nprivacy at the vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this\nwork, we propose VREM-FL, a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular\nfederated learning that leverages mobility of vehicles in conjunction with\nestimated 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes the global model\nlearned at the server while wisely allocating communication resources. This is\nachieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction\nwith the transmission of their local model updates in an adaptive and\npredictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm\ncan be tuned to trade model training time for radio resource usage.\nExperimental results demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing radio maps. VREM-FL\noutperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning\ntime reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for a semantic image\nsegmentation task (doubling the number of model updates within the same time\nwindow).",

We propose a novel method\nto induce predictable behavior in RL agents, referred to as\nPredictability-Aware RL (PA-RL), which employs the state sequence entropy rate\nas a predictability measure. We show how the entropy rate can be formulated as\nan average reward objective, and since its entropy reward function is\npolicy-dependent, we introduce an action-dependent surrogate entropy enabling\nthe use of PG methods. We prove that deterministic policies minimizing the\naverage surrogate reward exist and also minimize the actual entropy rate, and\nshow how, given a learned dynamical model, we are able to approximate the value\nfunction associated to the true entropy rate.

Giving a weight $k$\nto each nested path, with $k$ a real number, the one-point function of the NP\noperator was found to scale as $ L^{-X_{\\rm NP}(k)}$, with a continuously\nvarying exponent $X_{\\rm NP}(k)$, for which an analytical formula was\nconjectured on the basis of numerical result. Here we revisit the NP problem.\nWe note that while the original NPs are monochromatic, i.e. all on the same\ncluster, one can also consider polychromatic nested paths, which can be on\ndifferent clusters, and lead to an operator with a different exponent. The\noriginal nested paths are therefore labeled with MNP. We first derive an exact\nresult for $X_{\\rm MNP}(k)$, valid for $k \\ge -1$, which replaces the previous\nconjecture. Then we study the probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{\\ell}$ that\n$\\ell \\geq 0$ NPs exist on the percolating cluster. We show that\n$\\mathbb{P}_{\\ell}(L)$ scales as $ L^{-1/4} (\\ln L)^\\ell [(1/\\ell!)\n\\Lambda^\\ell]$ when $L \\gg 1$, with $\\Lambda = 1/\\sqrt{3} \\pi$, and that the\nmean number of NPs, conditioned on the existence of a percolating cluster,\ndiverges logarithmically as $\\kappa \\ln L$, with $\\kappa =3/8\\pi$. These\ntheoretical predictions are confirmed by extensive simulations for a number of\ncritical percolation models, hence supporting the universality of the NP\nobservables.",

The GAMM effectively predicts\nage-specific death rates (ASDRs) in both single and multi-population contexts.\nEmpirical evaluations using data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD)\ndemonstrate the model's exceptional performance in accurately capturing\nobserved mortality rates. In the DK-LME model, the relationship between log\nASDRs, and $k_t$ did not provide a perfect fit. Our study shows that the GAMM\naddresses this limitation. Additionally, as discussed in the DK-LME model,\nASDRs represent longitudinal data. The GAMM offers a suitable alternative to\nthe DK-LME model for modelling and forecasting mortality rates. We will compare\nthe forecast accuracy of the GAMM with both the DK-LME and Li-Lee models in\nmulti-population scenarios, as well as with LC models in single population\nscenarios. Comparative analyses highlight the GAMM's superior sample fitting\nand out-of-sample forecasting performance, positioning it as a promising tool\nfor mortality modelling and forecasting.",

On the\nother hand, traditional low-level 2D layout segmentation is simpler to learn\nand can represent occluded regions, but it requires complex post-processing for\nthe targeting layout polygon and sacrifices accuracy. We present Seg2Reg to\nrender 1D layout depth regression from the 2D segmentation map in a\ndifferentiable and occlusion-aware way, marrying the merits of both sides.\nSpecifically, our model predicts floor-plan density for the input\nequirectangular 360-degree image. Formulating the 2D layout representation as a\ndensity field enables us to employ `flattened' volume rendering to form 1D\nlayout depth regression. In addition, we propose a novel 3D warping\naugmentation on layout to improve generalization. Finally, we re-implement\nrecent room layout reconstruction methods into our codebase for benchmarking\nand explore modern backbones and training techniques to serve as the strong\nbaseline. Our model significantly outperforms previous arts. The code will be\nmade available upon publication.",

In the\nsingle-population case, we will see how the random effects of intercept and\nslope change over different age groups. We will show that the LME model is\nidentifiable. Using simulating parameter uncertainty in the LME model, we will\ncalculate 95% uncertainty intervals for death rate forecasts. We will use data\nfrom the Human Mortality Database (HMD) to illustrate the procedure. We assess\nthe predictive performance of the LME model in comparison to the Lee-Carter\n(LC) models fitted to individual populations. Additionally, we evaluate the\npredictive accuracy of the LME model relative to the Li-Lee (LL) model. Our\nresults indicate that the LME model provides a more precise representation of\nobserved mortality rates within the HMD, demonstrates robustness in calibration\nrate selection, and exhibits superior performance when contrasted with the LC\nand LL models.",

However, due to the\ncomplex topology of these organs and variable physical conditions, for example,\nlighting, large homogeneous texture, and image modality estimating distance\nfrom the camera aka depth) is highly challenging. Moreover, most colonoscopic\nvideo acquisition is monocular, making the depth estimation a non-trivial\nproblem. While methods in computer vision for depth estimation have been\nproposed and advanced on natural scene datasets, the efficacy of these\ntechniques has not been widely quantified on colonoscopy datasets. As the\ncolonic mucosa has several low-texture regions that are not well pronounced,\nlearning representations from an auxiliary task can improve salient feature\nextraction, allowing estimation of accurate camera depths. In this work, we\npropose to develop a novel multi-task learning (MTL) approach with a shared\nencoder and two decoders, namely a surface normal decoder and a depth estimator\ndecoder. Our depth estimator incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance\nglobal context awareness. We leverage the surface normal prediction to improve\ngeometric feature extraction. Also, we apply a cross-task consistency loss\namong the two geometrically related tasks, surface normal and camera depth. We\ndemonstrate an improvement of 14.17% on relative error and 10.4% improvement on\n$\\delta_{1}$ accuracy over the most accurate baseline state-of-the-art BTS\napproach.

However,\nbehavior is typically measured as a sequence of actions, which makes it\ndifficult to infer its hierarchical structure. In this paper, we explore how\npeople form hierarchically-structured plans, using an experimental paradigm\nthat makes hierarchical representations observable: participants create\nprograms that produce sequences of actions in a language with explicit\nhierarchical structure. This task lets us test two well-established principles\nof human behavior: utility maximization (i.e. using fewer actions) and minimum\ndescription length (MDL; i.e. having a shorter program). We find that humans\nare sensitive to both metrics, but that both accounts fail to predict a\nqualitative feature of human-created programs, namely that people prefer\nprograms with reuse over and above the predictions of MDL. We formalize this\npreference for reuse by extending the MDL account into a generative model over\nprograms, modeling hierarchy choice as the induction of a grammar over actions.\nOur account can explain the preference for reuse and provides the best\nprediction of human behavior, going beyond simple accounts of compressibility\nto highlight a principle that guides hierarchical planning.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we present CrimeGAT, a novel application of Graph Attention\nNetworks (GATs) for predictive policing in criminal networks. Criminal networks\npose unique challenges for predictive analytics due to their complex structure,\nmulti-relational links, and dynamic behavior. Traditional methods often fail to\ncapture these complexities, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the use of GATs, which can effectively leverage both\nnode features and graph structure to make predictions. Our proposed CrimeGAT\nmodel integrates attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of a node's\nneighbors, thereby capturing the local and global structures of criminal\nnetworks. We formulate the problem as learning a function that maps node\nfeatures and graph structure to a prediction of future criminal activity. The\nexperimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that CrimeGAT\nout-performs conventional methods in predicting criminal activities, thereby\nproviding a powerful tool for law enforcement agencies to proactively deploy\nresources. Furthermore, the interpretable nature of the attentionmechanism\ninGATs offers insights into the key players and relationships in criminal\nnetworks. This research opens new avenues for applying deep learning techniques\nin the Aeld of predictive policing and criminal network analysis.",

Analytical studies on its\nproperties (metric functions) and stability issues are investigated. Further,\nto establish this model (with the Einasto profile) as one for a dark matter\nhalo, we use the SPARC galactic rotation curve data and estimate the best-fit\nvalues for the model parameters. General relativistic features (beyond the\nKeplerian velocities) such as the tangential pressure profile, are\nquantitatively explored.

We treat both process\nparameters and monitoring sensor signals as BRANN input parameters. We\nconducted an extensive experimental study featuring four different experimental\ndata sets, including the NASA Ames milling dataset, the 2010 PHM Data Challenge\ndataset, the NUAA Ideahouse tool wear dataset, and an in-house performed\nend-milling of the Ti6Al4V dataset.

We consider one-dimensional systems that undergoes\ndelocalization-localization transition in the presence of quasiperiodic and\nlinear potential. By performing sudden quenches across the phase boundary, we\nfind that the exact dynamics get captured very well by QSLs. We show that the\nMT bound is always tighter in the short time limit for any arbitrary state,\nwhile the optimal bound for the time of orthogonalization (time required to\nreach the orthogonal state) depends on the choice of the initial state.\nFurther, for extreme quenches, we prove that the MT bound remains tighter for\nthe time of orthogonalization, and it can qualitatively describe the\nnon-analyticity in free energy for dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT).\nFinally, we also demonstrate that the localization-delocalization transition\npoint can be exactly identified from QSLs, whose computation cost is much less\ncompared to many other diagnostic tools.",

Despite recent advancements in geometric deep\nlearning-based approaches leading to improvements in blind docking efficiency,\nthese methods have encountered notable challenges, such as limited\ngeneralization performance on unseen proteins, the inability to concurrently\naddress the settings of blind docking and site-specific docking, and the\nfrequent occurrence of physical implausibilities such as inter-molecular steric\nclash. In this study, we introduce DeltaDock, a robust and versatile framework\ndesigned for efficient molecular docking to overcome these challenges.\nDeltaDock operates in a two-step process: rapid initial complex structures\nsampling followed by multi-scale iterative refinement of the initial\nstructures. In the initial stage, to sample accurate structures with high\nefficiency, we develop a ligand-dependent binding site prediction model founded\non large protein models and graph neural networks. This model is then paired\nwith GPU-accelerated sampling algorithms. The sampled structures are updated\nusing a multi-scale iterative refinement module that captures both\nprotein-ligand atom-atom interactions and residue-atom interactions in the\nfollowing stage. Distinct from previous geometric deep learning methods that\nare conditioned on the blind docking setting, DeltaDock demonstrates superior\nperformance in both blind docking and site-specific docking settings.\nComprehensive experimental results reveal that DeltaDock consistently surpasses\nbaseline methods in terms of docking accuracy. Furthermore, it displays\nremarkable generalization capabilities and proficiency for predicting\nphysically valid structures, thereby attesting to its robustness and\nreliability in various scenarios.",

In pFL,\nclients may have heterogeneous (also known as non-IID) data, which poses a key\nchallenge in how to decouple the data knowledge into generic knowledge for\nglobal sharing and personalized knowledge for preserving local personalization.\nA typical way of pFL focuses on label distribution skew, and they adopt a\ndecoupling scheme where the model is split into a common feature extractor and\ntwo prediction heads (generic and personalized). However, such a decoupling\nscheme cannot solve the essential problem of feature skew heterogeneity,\nbecause a common feature extractor cannot decouple the generic and personalized\nfeatures. Therefore, in this paper, we rethink the architecture decoupling\ndesign for feature-skew pFL and propose an effective pFL method called FediOS.\nIn FediOS, we reformulate the decoupling into two feature extractors (generic\nand personalized) and one shared prediction head. Orthogonal projections are\nused for clients to map the generic features into one common subspace and\nscatter the personalized features into different subspaces to achieve\ndecoupling for them. In addition, a shared prediction head is trained to\nbalance the importance of generic and personalized features during inference.\nExtensive experiments on four vision datasets demonstrate our method reaches\nstate-of-the-art pFL performances under feature skew heterogeneity.",

Furthermore, they represent\nlanes only by sequences of vectors representing center lines and ignore context\ninformation like lane dividers and other road elements. We present a novel\napproach for vector-based trajectory prediction that addresses these\nshortcomings by leveraging three crucial sources of information: First, we\nmodel interactions between traffic agents by a semantic scene graph, that\naccounts for the nature and important features of their relation. Second, we\nextract agent-centric image-based map features to model the local map context.\nFinally, we generate anchor paths to enforce the policy in multi-modal\nprediction to permitted trajectories only.

The key contributions of SparseDC are two-fold. First,\nwe design a simple strategy, called SFFM, to improve the robustness under\nsparse input by explicitly filling the unstable depth features with stable\nimage features. Second, we propose a two-branch feature embedder to predict\nboth the precise local geometry of regions with available depth values and\naccurate structures in regions with no depth. The key of the embedder is an\nuncertainty-based fusion module called UFFM to balance the local and long-term\ninformation extracted by CNNs and ViTs.

            "summary": "Video panoptic segmentation requires consistently segmenting (for both\n`thing' and `stuff' classes) and tracking objects in a video over time. In this\nwork, we present MaXTron, a general framework that exploits Mask XFormer with\nTrajectory Attention to tackle the task. MaXTron enriches an off-the-shelf mask\ntransformer by leveraging trajectory attention. The deployed mask transformer\ntakes as input a short clip consisting of only a few frames and predicts the\nclip-level segmentation. To enhance the temporal consistency, MaXTron employs\nwithin-clip and cross-clip tracking modules, efficiently utilizing trajectory\nattention. Originally designed for video classification, trajectory attention\nlearns to model the temporal correspondences between neighboring frames and\naggregates information along the estimated motion paths. However, it is\nnontrivial to directly extend trajectory attention to the per-pixel dense\nprediction tasks due to its quadratic dependency on input size. To alleviate\nthe issue, we propose to adapt the trajectory attention for both the dense\npixel features and object queries, aiming to improve the short-term and\nlong-term tracking results, respectively. Particularly, in our within-clip\ntracking module, we propose axial-trajectory attention that effectively\ncomputes the trajectory attention for tracking dense pixels sequentially along\nthe height- and width-axes. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity for dense pixel features. In our cross-clip tracking\nmodule, since the object queries in mask transformer are learned to encode the\nobject information, we are able to capture the long-term temporal connections\nby applying trajectory attention to object queries, which learns to track each\nobject across different clips. Without bells and whistles, MaXTron demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performances on video segmentation benchmarks.",

A fundamental workload in this setting is\ndynamic link prediction: using a history of graph updates to predict whether a\ngiven pair of vertices will become connected. Recent schemes for link\nprediction in such dynamic settings employ Transformers, modeling individual\ngraph updates as single tokens. In this work, we propose HOT: a model that\nenhances this line of works by harnessing higher-order (HO) graph structures;\nspecifically, k-hop neighbors and more general subgraphs containing a given\npair of vertices. Harnessing such HO structures by encoding them into the\nattention matrix of the underlying Transformer results in higher accuracy of\nlink prediction outcomes, but at the expense of increased memory pressure. To\nalleviate this, we resort to a recent class of schemes that impose hierarchy on\nthe attention matrix, significantly reducing memory footprint. The final design\noffers a sweetspot between high accuracy and low memory utilization. HOT\noutperforms other dynamic GRL schemes, for example achieving 9%, 7%, and 15%\nhigher accuracy than - respectively - DyGFormer, TGN, and GraphMixer, for the\nMOOC dataset.

            "summary": "Art objects can evoke certain emotions. Color is a fundamental element of\nvisual art and plays a significant role in how art is perceived. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach to classifying emotions in art using Fuzzy Sets. We\nemploy a fuzzy approach because it aligns well with human judgments' imprecise\nand subjective nature. Extensive fuzzy colors (n=120) and a broad emotional\nspectrum (n=10) allow for a more human-consistent and context-aware exploration\nof emotions inherent in paintings. First, we introduce the fuzzy color\nrepresentation model. Then, at the fuzzification stage, we process the Wiki Art\nDataset of paintings tagged with emotions, extracting fuzzy dominant colors\nlinked to specific emotions. This results in fuzzy color distributions for ten\nemotions. Finally, we convert them back to a crisp domain, obtaining a\nknowledge base of color-emotion associations in primary colors. Our findings\nreveal strong associations between specific emotions and colors; for instance,\ngratitude strongly correlates with green, brown, and orange. Other noteworthy\nassociations include brown and anger, orange with shame, yellow with happiness,\nand gray with fear. Using these associations and Jaccard similarity, we can\nfind the emotions in the arbitrary untagged image. We conducted a 2AFC\nexperiment involving human subjects to evaluate the proposed method. The\naverage hit rate of 0.77 indicates a significant correlation between the\nmethod's predictions and human perception. The proposed method is simple to\nadapt to art painting retrieval systems. The study contributes to the\ntheoretical understanding of color-emotion associations in art, offering\nvaluable insights for various practical applications besides art, like\nmarketing, design, and psychology.",

The common solution\nfor the final predictions is to directly maximize the overlap between each\nproposal and the ground truth box, followed by a winner-takes-all ranking or\nnon-maximum suppression. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective\nalternative. For proposal regression, we solve a simpler problem where we\nregress to the area of intersection between proposal and ground truth. In this\nway, each proposal only specifies which part contains the object, avoiding a\nblind inpainting problem where proposals need to be regressed beyond their\nvisual scope. In turn, we replace the winner-takes-all strategy and obtain the\nfinal prediction by taking the union over the regressed intersections of a\nproposal group surrounding an object. Our revisited approach comes with minimal\nchanges to the detection pipeline and can be plugged into any existing method.\nWe show that our approach directly improves canonical object detection and\ninstance segmentation architectures, highlighting the utility of\nintersection-based regression and grouping.",

            "summary": "The presence of massive neutrinos has still not been revealed by the\ncosmological data. We consider a novel method based on the two-point\nline-of-sight correlation function of high-resolution Lyman-$\\alpha$ data to\nachieve this end in the paper. We adopt semi-analytic models of Lyman-$\\alpha$\nclouds for the study. We employ Fisher matrix technique to show that it is\npossible to achieve a scenario in which the covariance of the two-point\nfunction nearly vanishes for both the spectroscopic noise and the signal. We\nanalyze this near 'zero noise' outcome in detail to argue it might be possible\nto detect neutrinos of mass range $m_\\nu \\simeq 0.05 \\hbox{--}0.1 \\, \\rm eV$\nwith signal-to-noise of unity with a single QSO line of sight. We show that\nthis estimate can be improved to SNR $\\simeq 3\\hbox{--}6$ with data along\nmultiple line of sights within the redshift range $z \\simeq 2 \\hbox{--} 2.5$.\nSuch data sets already exist in the literature. We further carry out principal\ncomponent analysis of the Fisher matrix to study the degeneracies of the\nneutrino mass with other parameters. We show that Planck priors lift the\ndegeneracies between the neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters.\nHowever, the prospects of the detection of neutrino mass are driven by the\npoorly-determined parameters characterizing the ionization and thermal state of\nLyman-$\\alpha$ clouds.",

This loss measures the divergence in the predictions between\nthe source model and another, independently trained model, referred to as the\nwitness model. To understand the effect of model alignment, we conduct a\ngeometric anlaysis of the resulting changes in the loss landscape.

            "summary": "Studies have shown marked sex disparities in Coronary Artery Diseases (CAD)\nepidemiology, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We explored sex\ndisparities in the coronary anatomy and the resulting haemodynamics in patients\nwith suspected, but no significant CAD. Left Main (LM) bifurcations were\nreconstructed from CTCA images of 127 cases (42 males and 85 females, aged 38\nto 81). Detailed shape parameters were measured for comparison, including\nbifurcation angles, curvature, and diameters, before solving the haemodynamic\nmetrics using CFD. The severity and location of the normalised vascular area\nexposed to physiologically adverse haemodynamics were statistically compared\nbetween sexes for all branches. We found significant differences between sexes\nin potentially adverse haemodynamics. Females were more likely than males to\nexhibit adversely low Time Averaged Endothelial Shear Stress along the inner\nwall of a bifurcation (16.8% vs. 10.7%). Males had a higher percentage of areas\nexposed to both adversely high Relative Residence Time (6.1% vs 4.2%, p=0.001)\nand high Oscillatory Shear Index (4.6% vs 2.3%, p<0.001). However, the OSI\nvalues were generally small and should be interpreted cautiously. Males had\nlarger arteries (M vs F, LM: 4.0mm vs 3.3mm, LAD: 3.6mm 3.0mm, LCX:3.5mm vs\n2.9mm), and females exhibited higher curvatures in all three branches (M vs F,\nLM: 0.40 vs 0.46, LAD: 0.45 vs 0.51, LCx: 0.47 vs 0.55, p<0.001) and larger\ninflow angle of the LM trunk (M: 12.9{\\deg} vs F: 18.5{\\deg}, p=0.025).\nHaemodynamic differences were found between male and female patients, which may\ncontribute, at least in part, to differences in CAD risk. This work may\nfacilitate a better understanding of sex differences in the clinical\npresentation of CAD, contributing to improved sex-specific screening,\nespecially relevant for women with CAD who currently have worse predictive\noutcomes.",

In this work, we catalog the possibilities for\nnegative sampling and introduce novel visualization methods that can yield\ninsight into prediction performance and the dynamics of temporal networks. We\nleverage these visualization tools to investigate the effect of negative\nsampling on the predictive performance, at the node and edge level.

In\nthis work, we analyze the sensitivity of causal fairness to unobserved\nconfounding. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we derive bounds for\ncausal fairness metrics under different sources of unobserved confounding. This\nenables practitioners to examine the sensitivity of their machine learning\nmodels to unobserved confounding in fairness-critical applications. Second, we\npropose a novel neural framework for learning fair predictions, which allows us\nto offer worst-case guarantees of the extent to which causal fairness can be\nviolated due to unobserved confounding. Third, we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our framework in a series of experiments, including a real-world case study\nabout predicting prison sentences. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the\nfirst work to study causal fairness under unobserved confounding. To this end,\nour work is of direct practical value as a refutation strategy to ensure the\nfairness of predictions in high-stakes applications.",

Current methods rely on a discriminative classifier trained\nwith point-based learning techniques that provide specific values for\nprototypes. Such prototypes have relatively low representation power due to\ntheir sparsity and potential redundancy, with each prototype containing no\nvariability measure. In this paper, we present a new generative learning of\nprototype distributions, named Mixture of Gaussian-distributed Prototypes\n(MGProto), which are represented by Gaussian mixture models (GMM). Such an\napproach enables the learning of more powerful prototype representations since\neach learned prototype will own a measure of variability, which naturally\nreduces the sparsity given the spread of the distribution around each\nprototype, and we also integrate a prototype diversity objective function into\nthe GMM optimisation to reduce redundancy. Incidentally, the generative nature\nof MGProto offers a new and effective way for detecting out-of-distribution\nsamples. To improve the compactness of MGProto, we further propose to prune\nGaussian-distributed prototypes with a low prior.

The models evolve from the zero-age main\nsequence, until the onset of pair instability. We discuss the main properties\nof the models during their evolution and then focus on the final fate and the\npossible progenitors of jet-driven events. All tracks that undergo\npulsational-pair instability produce successful gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in the\ncollapsar framework, while those that collapse directly to black holes (BH)\nproduce jet-driven supernova events. In these latter cases, the expected black\nhole mass changes due to the jet propagation inside the progenitor, resulting\nin different models that should produce BH within the pair-instability\nblack-hole mass gap.

Naturally, for optimization, it is of interest to understand the\nconvergence properties of gradient descent using fractional derivatives.\nConvergence analysis of fractional gradient descent is currently limited both\nin the methods analyzed and the settings analyzed. This paper aims to fill in\nthese gaps by analyzing variations of fractional gradient descent in smooth and\nconvex, smooth and strongly convex, and smooth and non-convex settings. First,\nnovel bounds will be established bridging fractional and integer derivatives.\nThen, these bounds will be applied to the aforementioned settings to prove\n$O(1/T)$ convergence for smooth and convex functions and linear convergence for\nsmooth and strongly convex functions. Additionally, we prove $O(1/T)$\nconvergence for smooth and non-convex functions using an extended notion of\nsmoothness that is more natural for fractional derivatives. Finally, empirical\nresults will be presented on the potential speed up of fractional gradient\ndescent over standard gradient descent as well as the challenges of predicting\nwhich will be faster in general.",

            "summary": "Large-scale pre-trained models have demonstrated impressive performance in\nvision and language tasks within open-world scenarios. Due to the lack of\ncomparable pre-trained models for 3D shapes, recent methods utilize\nlanguage-image pre-training to realize zero-shot 3D shape recognition. However,\ndue to the modality gap, pretrained language-image models are not confident\nenough in the generalization to 3D shape recognition. Consequently, this paper\naims to improve the confidence with view selection and hierarchical prompts.\nLeveraging the CLIP model as an example, we employ view selection on the vision\nside by identifying views with high prediction confidence from multiple\nrendered views of a 3D shape. On the textual side, the strategy of hierarchical\nprompts is proposed for the first time. The first layer prompts several\nclassification candidates with traditional class-level descriptions, while the\nsecond layer refines the prediction based on function-level descriptions or\nfurther distinctions between the candidates. Remarkably, without the need for\nadditional training, our proposed method achieves impressive zero-shot 3D\nclassification accuracies of 84.44\\%, 91.51\\%, and 66.17\\% on ModelNet40,\nModelNet10, and ShapeNet Core55, respectively.

However, common knowledge bases are\ninherently constrained by limited coverage and noisy information, making\nretrieval-based approaches inadequate to answer implicit reasoning questions.\nIn this paper, we propose an Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG) framework\nthat utilizes inductive knowledge along with the retrieved documents for\nimplicit reasoning. We leverage large language models (LLMs) for deriving such\nknowledge via a novel prompting method based on inductive reasoning patterns.\nOn top of this, we implement two versions of IAG named IAG-GPT and IAG-Student,\nrespectively. IAG-GPT directly utilizes the knowledge generated by GPT-3 for\nanswer prediction, while IAG-Student gets rid of dependencies on GPT service at\ninference time by incorporating a student inductor model. The inductor is\nfirstly trained via knowledge distillation and further optimized by\nback-propagating the generator feedback via differentiable beam scores.\nExperimental results show that IAG outperforms RAG baselines as well as ChatGPT\non two Open-Domain QA tasks.

Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to achieve\ncontrol performance superior to classical approaches while keeping\ncomputational demands low during deployment. However, standard RL approaches\nlike soft-actor critic (SAC) require extensive amounts of training data to be\ncollected and are thus impractical for real-world application. To address this\nissue, we apply recently developed data-efficient deep RL methods to vehicle\ntrajectory control. Our investigation focuses on three methods, so far\nunexplored for vehicle control: randomized ensemble double Q-learning (REDQ),\nprobabilistic ensembles with trajectory sampling and model predictive path\nintegral optimizer (PETS-MPPI), and model-based policy optimization (MBPO). We\nfind that in the case of trajectory control, the standard model-based RL\nformulation used in approaches like PETS-MPPI and MBPO is not suitable. We,\ntherefore, propose a new formulation that splits dynamics prediction and\nvehicle localization. Our benchmark study on the CARLA simulator reveals that\nthe three identified data-efficient deep RL approaches learn control strategies\non a par with or better than SAC, yet reduce the required number of environment\ninteractions by more than one order of magnitude.",

We show that the laser output spectrum and temporal pulse\nprofiles can be accurately predicted with the normalized root mean square error\n(NRMSE) of less than 0.032 within only a 5 ms time frame for scenarios inside\nand outside the training data. We investigate the influence of FNN\nconfiguration on prediction performance.

            "summary": "Machine learning prediction of organic materials properties is an efficient\nvirtual screening method ahead of more expensive screening methods. However,\nthis approach has suffered from insufficient labeled data on organic materials\nto train state-of-the-art machine learning models. In this study, we\ndemonstrate that drug-like small molecule and chemical reaction databases can\nbe used to pretrain the BERT model for the virtual screening of organic\nmaterials. Among the BERT models fine-tuned by five virtual screening tasks on\norganic materials, the USPTO-SMILES pretrained BERT model had R2 > 0.90 for two\ntasks and R2 > 0.82 for one, which was generally superior to the same models\npretrained by the small molecule or organic materials databases, as well as to\nthe other three traditional machine learning models trained directly on the\nvirtual screening task data. The superior performance of the USPTO-SMILES\npretrained BERT model is due to the greater variety of organic building blocks\nin the USPTO database and the broader coverage of the chemical space. The even\nbetter performance of the BERT model pretrained externally from a chemical\nreaction database with additional sources of chemical reactions strengthens our\nproof of concept that transfer learning across different chemical domains is\npractical for the virtual screening of organic materials.",

            "summary": "Recent advances in deep learning have significantly elevated weather\nprediction models. However, these models often falter in real-world scenarios\ndue to their sensitivity to spatial-temporal shifts. This issue is particularly\nacute in weather forecasting, where models are prone to overfit to local and\ntemporal variations, especially when tasked with fine-grained predictions. In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by developing a robust precipitation\nforecasting model that demonstrates resilience against such spatial-temporal\ndiscrepancies. We introduce Temporal Frame Interpolation (TFI), a novel\ntechnique that enhances the training dataset by generating synthetic samples\nthrough interpolating adjacent frames from satellite imagery and ground radar\ndata, thus improving the model's robustness against frame noise. Moreover, we\nincorporate a unique Multi-Level Dice (ML-Dice) loss function, leveraging the\nordinal nature of rainfall intensities to improve the model's performance. Our\napproach has led to significant improvements in forecasting precision,\nculminating in our model securing \\textit{1st place} in the transfer learning\nleaderboard of the \\textit{Weather4cast'23} competition. This achievement not\nonly underscores the effectiveness of our methodologies but also establishes a\nnew standard for deep learning applications in weather forecasting.

Here in this work, by preparing the series alloys of\nMn2CoGa1-xAlx (x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1), we identified the vanishing of\nanomalous Hall effect in the ferromagnetic Mn2CoGa (or x=0.25) alloy in a wide\ntemperature interval, accompanying with growing contribution from the ordinary\nHall effect. As a result, comparatively low carrier density (1020 cm-3) and\nhigh carrier mobility (150 cm2/Vs) are obtained in Mn2CoGa (or x=0.25) alloy in\nthe temperature range of 10-200K. These also lead to a large dip in the related\nmagnetoresistance at low fields. While in high Al content, despite the\nmagnetization behavior is not altered significantly, the Hall resistivity is\ninstead dominated by the anomalous one, just analogous to that widely reported\nin Mn2CoAl. The distinct electrical transport behavior of x=0 and x=0.75 (or 1)\nis presently understood by their possible different scattering mechanism of the\nanomalous Hall effect due to the differences in atomic order and conductivity.\nOur work can expand the existing understanding of the SGS properties and offer\na better SGS candidate with higher carrier mobility that can facilitate the\napplication in the spin-injected related devices.",

            "summary": "One of the most relevant challenges in future 6G wireless networks is how to\nsupport a massive spatial multiplexing of a large number of user terminals.\nRecently, extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs), also referred to as\nextra-large MIMO (XL-MIMO), have emerged as an potential enabler of this type\nof spatially multiplexed transmission. These massive configurations\nsubstantially increase the number of available spatial degrees of freedom\n(transmission modes) while also enabling to spatially focus the transmitted\nenergy into a very small region, thanks to the properties of near-field\npropagation and the large number of transmitters. This work explores whether\nmultiplexing of multiple orthogonal polarizations can enhance the system\nperformance in the near-field. We concentrate on a simple scenario consisting\nof a Uniform Linear Array (ULA) and a single antenna element user equipment\n(UE). We demonstrate that the number of spatial degrees of freedom can be as\nlarge as 3 in the near-field of a Line of Sight (LoS) channel when both\ntransmitter and receiver employ three orthogonal linear polarizations. In the\nfar-field, however, the maximum number of spatial degrees of freedom tends to\nbe only 2, due to the fact that the equivalent MIMO channel becomes rank\ndeficient. We provide an analytical approximation to the achievable rate, which\nallows us to derive approximations to the optimal antenna spacing and array\nsize that maximize the achievable rate",

            "summary": "Temporal sentence grounding aims to localize moments relevant to a language\ndescription. Recently, DETR-like approaches have shown notable progress by\ndecoding the center and length of a target moment from learnable queries.\nHowever, they suffer from the issue of center misalignment raised by the\ninherent ambiguity of moment centers, leading to inaccurate predictions. To\nremedy this problem, we introduce a novel boundary-oriented moment formulation.\nIn our paradigm, the model no longer needs to find the precise center but\ninstead suffices to predict any anchor point within the interval, from which\nthe onset and offset are directly estimated. Based on this idea, we design a\nBoundary-Aligned Moment Detection Transformer (BAM-DETR), equipped with a\ndual-pathway decoding process. Specifically, it refines the anchor and\nboundaries within parallel pathways using global and boundary-focused\nattention, respectively. This separate design allows the model to focus on\ndesirable regions, enabling precise refinement of moment predictions. Further,\nwe propose a quality-based ranking method, ensuring that proposals with high\nlocalization qualities are prioritized over incomplete ones. Extensive\nexperiments verify the advantages of our methods, where our model records new\nstate-of-the-art results on three benchmarks. Code is at\nhttps://github.com/Pilhyeon/BAM-DETR.",

In the case of noncritical quench, i.e., neither the initial\nstate nor the postquench Hamiltonian is at a critical point of equilibrium\nphase transition, a quench to the commensurate phase or incommensurate phase\ngives a scaling of $t^{-3/2}$ or $t^{-1/2}$, respectively, which is the same as\nthe counterpart of the short-range XY model. However, for a quench to the\nboundary line between the commensurate and incommensurate phases, the scaling\nlaw $t^{-\\mu}$ may be different from the $t^{-3/4}$ law of the counterpart of\nthe short-range model. More interestingly, the decaying exponent $\\mu$ may\ndepend on the choice of the parameters of the postquench Hamiltonian because of\nthe different asymptotic behaviors of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, in\ncertain cases, the scaling behavior may be outside the range of predictions\nmade by the stationary phase approximation, because an inflection point emerges\nin the energy spectrum. For the critical quench, i.e., the initial state or the\npostquench Hamiltonian is at a critical point of equilibrium phase transition,\nthe aforementioned scaling law $t^{-\\mu}$ may be changed because of the\ngap-closing property of the energy spectrum of the critical point.",

            "summary": "Unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) aims at detecting the primary\nobjects in a given video sequence without any human interposing. Most existing\nmethods rely on two-stream architectures that separately encode the appearance\nand motion information before fusing them to identify the target and generate\nobject masks. However, this pipeline is computationally expensive and can lead\nto suboptimal performance due to the difficulty of fusing the two modalities\nproperly. In this paper, we propose a novel UVOS model called SimulFlow that\nsimultaneously performs feature extraction and target identification, enabling\nefficient and effective unsupervised video object segmentation. Concretely, we\ndesign a novel SimulFlow Attention mechanism to bridege the image and motion by\nutilizing the flexibility of attention operation, where coarse masks predicted\nfrom fused feature at each stage are used to constrain the attention operation\nwithin the mask area and exclude the impact of noise. Because of the\nbidirectional information flow between visual and optical flow features in\nSimulFlow Attention, no extra hand-designed fusing module is required and we\nonly adopt a light decoder to obtain the final prediction. We evaluate our\nmethod on several benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results. Our\nproposed approach not only outperforms existing methods but also addresses the\ncomputational complexity and fusion difficulties caused by two-stream\narchitectures. Our models achieve 87.4% J & F on DAVIS-16 with the highest\nspeed (63.7 FPS on a 3090) and the lowest parameters (13.7 M).

Here, we\nperform a stringent test for the existence of such learning in the Alphafold2\n(AF) algorithm: We use AF to predict the subtle structural deformation induced\nby single mutations, quantified by strain, and compare with experimental\ndatasets of corresponding perturbations in folding free energy $\\Delta\\Delta\nG$. Unexpectedly, we find that physical strain alone -- without any additional\ndata or computation -- correlates almost as well with $\\Delta \\Delta G$ as\nstate-of-the-art energy-based and machine-learning predictors.This indicates\nthat the AF-predicted structures alone encode fine details about the energy\nlandscape. In particular, the structures encode significant information on\nstability, enough to estimate (de-)stabilizing effects of mutations, thus\npaving the way for the development of novel, structure-based stability\npredictors for protein design and evolution.",

We aim to assess how the induced magnetic fields behave\nunder different solar zenith angles and solar wind conditions, and\nadditionally, understand how planet-specific properties (such as Mars crustal\nmagnetism) alter the formation and structure of the magnetic fields. We then\nuse data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter to compare induced magnetic fields at\nVenus with those at Mars. At Venus, the vertical structure of the magnetic\nfield tends to exist in one of two states (magnetized or unmagnetized) but we\nfind the induced fields at Mars are more complicated, and we are unable to use\nthis simple classification scheme. We also find the low-altitude induced field\nstrength in the ionospheres of both Venus and Mars vary with as cosine of the\nangle between solar wind velocity and the magnetic pileup boundary. The\nlow-altitude field strength at Venus tends to be higher than Mars. However,\nVenus field strengths are lower than theoretical predictions assuming pressure\nbalance and negligible thermal pressure. For Mars, low-altitude field strengths\nare higher than expected given these assumptions. Induced field strengths\nexhibit a trend with solar wind dynamic pressure that is consistent with\npressure balance expectations at both planets, however there is significant\nuncertainty in the Venus fit due to lack of upstream solar wind data. Our\nresults highlight major differences between the induced magnetic fields at\nVenus and Mars, suggesting planet-specific properties such as size and the\npresence of crustal magnetism affect the induced ionospheric magnetic fields at\nnon magnetized planets.",

While a smooth mass distribution creates a symmetric\ngeometry of critical curves with radii of curvature about the Einstein radius,\nsubstructures introduce small-scale distortions on critical curves, which can\nbreak the symmetry of gravitational lensing events near critical curves, such\nas highly magnified individual stars. We derive a general formula that connects\nthe fluctuation of critical curves with the fluctuation of the surface density\ncaused by substructures, which is useful when constraining models of\nsubstructures from observed astrometric perturbations of critical curves. We\nnumerically check that the formula is valid and accurate as long as\nsubstructures are not dominated by a small number of massive structures. As a\ndemonstration of the formula, we also explore the possibility that an anomalous\nposition of an extremely magnified star, recently reported as `Mothra', can be\nexplained by fluctuations in the critical curve due to substructures. We find\nthat cold dark matter subhalos with masses ranging from $5 \\times 10^7\nM_{\\odot}/h$ to $10^9 M_{\\odot}/h$ can well explain the anomalous position of\nMothra, while in the fuzzy dark matter model, the very small mass of $\\sim\n10^{-24}~\\mathrm{eV}$ is needed to explain it.",

We curate datasets\nfrom high-quality CATH protein data, high-throughput $\\textit{de novo}$\ndesigned proteins, and mega-scale experimental mutagenesis experiments, and in\ndoing so, present the $\\textbf{PDB-Struct}$ benchmark that evaluates both\nrecent and previously uncompared protein design methods. Experimental results\nindicate that ByProt, ProteinMPNN, and ESM-IF perform exceptionally well on our\nbenchmark, while ESM-Design and AF-Design fall short on the refoldability\nmetric.

            "summary": "Cross-domain CTR (CDCTR) prediction is an important research topic that\nstudies how to leverage meaningful data from a related domain to help CTR\nprediction in target domain. Most existing CDCTR works design implicit ways to\ntransfer knowledge across domains such as parameter-sharing that regularizes\nthe model training in target domain. More effectively, recent researchers\npropose explicit techniques to extract user interest knowledge and transfer\nthis knowledge to target domain. However, the proposed method mainly faces two\nissues: 1) it usually requires a super domain, i.e. an extremely large source\ndomain, to cover most users or items of target domain, and 2) the extracted\nuser interest knowledge is static no matter what the context is in target\ndomain. These limitations motivate us to develop a more flexible and efficient\ntechnique to explicitly transfer knowledge. In this work, we propose a\ncross-domain augmentation network (CDAnet) being able to perform explicit\nknowledge transfer between two domains. Specifically, CDAnet contains a\ndesigned translation network and an augmentation network which are trained\nsequentially. The translation network computes latent features from two domains\nand learns meaningful cross-domain knowledge of each input in target domain by\nusing a designed cross-supervised feature translator. Later the augmentation\nnetwork employs the explicit cross-domain knowledge as augmented information to\nboost the target domain CTR prediction. Through extensive experiments on two\npublic benchmarks and one industrial production dataset, we show CDAnet can\nlearn meaningful translated features and largely improve the performance of CTR\nprediction. CDAnet has been conducted online A/B test in image2product\nretrieval at Taobao app, bringing an absolute 0.11 point CTR improvement, a\nrelative 0.64% deal growth and a relative 1.26% GMV increase.",

            "summary": "This paper proposes an assistive system for architects that converts a\nlarge-scale point cloud into a standardized digital representation of a\nbuilding for Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications. The process is\nknown as Scan-to-BIM, which requires many hours of manual work even for a\nsingle building floor by a professional architect. Given its challenging\nnature, the paper focuses on helping architects on the Scan-to-BIM process,\ninstead of replacing them. Concretely, we propose an assistive Scan-to-BIM\nsystem that takes the raw sensor data and edit history (including the current\nBIM model), then auto-regressively predicts a sequence of model editing\noperations as APIs of a professional BIM software (i.e., Autodesk Revit). The\npaper also presents the first building-scale Scan2BIM dataset that contains a\nsequence of model editing operations as the APIs of Autodesk Revit. The dataset\ncontains 89 hours of Scan2BIM modeling processes by professional architects\nover 16 scenes, spanning over 35,000 m^2. We report our system's reconstruction\nquality with standard metrics, and we introduce a novel metric that measures\nhow natural the order of reconstructed operations is. A simple modification to\nthe reconstruction module helps improve performance, and our method is far\nsuperior to two other baselines in the order metric. We will release data,\ncode, and models at a-scan2bim.github.io.",

It has wide applications in query rewriting\nand debugging, query explanation, IoT analytics, multi-layer network routing,\netc. In this paper, we study the smallest witness problem (SWP) for the class\nof conjunctive queries (CQs) without self-joins.\n  We first establish the dichotomy that SWP for a CQ can be computed in\npolynomial time if and only if it has {\\em head-cluster property}, unless\n$\\texttt{P} = \\texttt{NP}$. We next turn to the approximated version by\nrelaxing the size of a witness from being minimum. We surprisingly find that\nthe {\\em head-domination} property - that has been identified for the deletion\npropagation problem \\cite{kimelfeld2012maximizing} - can also precisely capture\nthe hardness of the approximated smallest witness problem. In polynomial time,\nSWP for any CQ with head-domination property can be approximated within a\nconstant factor, while SWP for any CQ without such a property cannot be\napproximated within a logarithmic factor, unless $\\texttt{P} = \\texttt{NP}$.\n  We further explore efficient approximation algorithms for CQs without\nhead-domination property: (1) we show a trivial algorithm which achieves a\npolynomially large approximation ratio for general CQs; (2) for any CQ with\nonly one non-output attribute, such as star CQs, we show a greedy algorithm\nwith a logarithmic approximation ratio; (3) for line CQs, which contain at\nleast two non-output attributes, we relate SWP problem to the directed steiner\nforest problem, whose algorithms can be applied to line CQs directly.\nMeanwhile, we establish a much higher lower bound, exponentially larger than\nthe logarithmic lower bound obtained above. It remains open to close the gap\nbetween the lower and upper bound of the approximated SWP for CQs without\nhead-domination property.",

The landscape of MHQA approaches can be classified into two\nprimary categories. The first group focuses on extracting supporting evidence,\nthereby constraining the QA model's context to predicted facts. Conversely, the\nsecond group relies on the attention mechanism of the long input encoding model\nto facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, attention-based token\nrepresentations lack explicit global contextual information to connect\nreasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose GEMFormer, a two-stage\nmethod that first collects relevant information over the entire document to the\nmemory and then combines it with local context to solve the task. Our\nexperimental results show that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with\nmemory-augmented input, including the most certain global elements, improves\nthe model's performance on three MHQA datasets compared to the baseline. We\nalso found that the global explicit memory contains information from supporting\nfacts required for the correct answer.",

            "summary": "Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future\ntrajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their\nhistorical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of\ncomplex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for\naccurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture,\nthe more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous\nworks based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information\nseparately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they\nfailed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of\nsignificance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle\ninteractions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that\nincorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the\nintegrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In\nspecific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer\nperceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal\ninformation historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our\nexperiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF\noutperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon\ntrajectory prediction.",

In this work, we show that the late-time\ntraining dynamics of quantum neural networks can be described by the\ngeneralized Lotka-Volterra equations, which lead to a dynamical phase\ntransition. When the targeted value of cost function crosses the minimum\nachievable value from above to below, the dynamics evolve from a frozen-kernel\nphase to a frozen-error phase, showing a duality between the quantum neural\ntangent kernel and the total error. In both phases, the convergence towards the\nfixed point is exponential, while at the critical point becomes polynomial. Via\nmapping the Hessian of the training dynamics to a Hamiltonian in the imaginary\ntime, we reveal the nature of the phase transition to be second-order with the\nexponent $\\nu=1$, where scale invariance and closing gap are observed at\ncritical point. We also provide a non-perturbative analytical theory to explain\nthe phase transition via a restricted Haar ensemble at late time, when the\noutput state approaches the steady state.

It is known that the energy gap values calculated by\ncommon DFT approaches are underestimated. The bandgap was also found to be\nrelated to the derivative discontinuity (DD) of the exchange-correlation\npotential in the Kohn-Sham formulation of DFT. Several reports have shown that\nDD appears as a step on the potential curve. The step structure is a mandatory\nstructure for aligning the KS energy levels in the ionization potentials in a\ndissociated molecule in both fragments and is a function of electron\nlocalisation. Reproducing the step in the DFT framework gives the charge\ntransfer process and the correct energy gap and describes the source of\ndissociation. This step phenomenon has not yet been studied in the non-additive\nkinetic potential $v^{\\text{NAD}}[\\rho_A,\\rho_B](\\textbf{r})$, a key quantity\nused in embedding theories. While $v^{\\text{NAD}}[\\rho_A,\\rho_B](\\textbf{r})$\nis known to be difficult to approximate, in this work, we explain how an\naccurate energy gap can be produced from the analytically inverted\n$v^{\\text{NAD}}[\\rho_A,\\rho_B](\\textbf{r})$, even if we use the input densities\ncalculated by the local and semi-local functionals.

We here study famous Hopfield models and\nshow that their statistical behavior can be characterized via the fl RDT. Due\nto a nestedly lifted nature, the resulting characterizations and, therefore,\nthe whole analytical machinery that produces them, become fully operational\nonly if one can successfully conduct underlying numerical evaluations. After\nconducting such evaluations for both positive and negative Hopfield models, we\nobserve a remarkably fast convergence of the fl RDT mechanism. Namely, for the\nso-called square case, the fourth decimal precision is achieved already on the\nthird (second non-trivial) level of lifting (3-sfl RDT) for the positive and on\nthe fourth (third non-trivial) level of lifting (4-sfl RDT) for the\ncorresponding negative model. In particular, we obtain the scaled ground state\nfree energy $\\approx 1.7788$ for the positive and $\\approx 0.3279$ for the\nnegative model.",

            "summary": "We study a generic class of \\emph{random optimization problems} (rops) and\ntheir typical behavior. The foundational aspects of the random duality theory\n(RDT), associated with rops, were discussed in \\cite{StojnicRegRndDlt10}, where\nit was shown that one can often infer rops' behavior even without actually\nsolving them. Moreover, \\cite{StojnicRegRndDlt10} uncovered that various\nquantities relevant to rops (including, for example, their typical objective\nvalues) can be determined (in a large dimensional context) even completely\nanalytically. The key observation was that the \\emph{strong deterministic\nduality} implies the, so-called, \\emph{strong random duality} and therefore the\nfull exactness of the analytical RDT characterizations. Here, we attack\nprecisely those scenarios where the strong deterministic duality is not\nnecessarily present and connect them to the recent progress made in studying\nbilinearly indexed (bli) random processes in\n\\cite{Stojnicnflgscompyx23,Stojnicsflgscompyx23}. In particular, utilizing a\nfully lifted (fl) interpolating comparison mechanism introduced in\n\\cite{Stojnicnflgscompyx23}, we establish corresponding \\emph{fully lifted} RDT\n(fl RDT). We then rely on a stationarized fl interpolation realization\nintroduced in \\cite{Stojnicsflgscompyx23} to obtain complete\n\\emph{statitionarized} fl RDT (sfl RDT). A few well known problems are then\ndiscussed as illustrations of a wide range of practical applications implied by\nthe generality of the considered rops.",

            "summary": "Urban economic resilience is intricately linked to how disruptions caused by\npandemics, disasters, and technological shifts ripple through businesses and\nurban amenities. Disruptions, such as closures of non-essential businesses\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, not only affect those places directly but also\ninfluence how people live and move, spreading the impact on other businesses\nand increasing the overall economic shock. However, it is unclear how much\nbusinesses depend on each other in these situations. Leveraging large-scale\nhuman mobility data and millions of same-day visits in New York, Boston, Los\nAngeles, Seattle, and Dallas, we quantify dependencies between\npoints-of-interest (POIs) encompassing businesses, stores, and amenities.\nCompared to places' physical proximity, dependency networks computed from human\nmobility exhibit significantly higher rates of long-distance connections and\nbiases towards specific pairs of POI categories. We show that using\nbehavior-based dependency relationships improves the predictability of business\nresilience during shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, by around 40% compared\nto distance-based models. Simulating hypothetical urban shocks reveals that\nneglecting behavior-based dependencies can lead to a substantial\nunderestimation of the spatial cascades of disruptions on businesses and urban\namenities. Our findings underscore the importance of measuring the complex\nrelationships woven through behavioral patterns in human mobility to foster\nurban economic resilience to shocks.",

            "summary": "In the framework of learned image compression, the context model plays a\npivotal role in capturing the dependencies among latent representations. To\nreduce the decoding time resulting from the serial autoregressive context\nmodel, the parallel context model has been proposed as an alternative that\nnecessitates only two passes during the decoding phase, thus facilitating\nefficient image compression in real-world scenarios. However, performance\ndegradation occurs due to its incomplete casual context. To tackle this issue,\nwe conduct an in-depth analysis of the performance degradation observed in\nexisting parallel context models, focusing on two aspects: the Quantity and\nQuality of information utilized for context prediction and decoding. Based on\nsuch analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Corner-to-Center transformer-based\nContext Model (C$^3$M)} designed to enhance context and latent predictions and\nimprove rate-distortion performance. Specifically, we leverage the\nlogarithmic-based prediction order to predict more context features from corner\nto center progressively. In addition, to enlarge the receptive field in the\nanalysis and synthesis transformation, we use the Long-range Crossing Attention\nModule (LCAM) in the encoder/decoder to capture the long-range semantic\ninformation by assigning the different window shapes in different channels.\nExtensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed method is effective\nand outperforms the state-of-the-art parallel methods.

            "summary": "Due to an alarming trend related to obesity affecting 93.3 million adults in\nthe United States alone, body mass index (BMI) and body weight have drawn\nsignificant interest in various health monitoring applications. Consequently,\nseveral studies have proposed self-diagnostic facial image-based BMI prediction\nmethods for healthy weight monitoring. These methods have mostly used\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) based regression baselines, such as VGG19,\nResNet50, and Efficient-NetB0, for BMI prediction from facial images. However,\nthe high computational requirement of these heavy-weight CNN models limits\ntheir deployment to resource-constrained mobile devices, thus deterring weight\nmonitoring using smartphones. This paper aims to develop a lightweight facial\npatch-based ensemble (PatchBMI-Net) for BMI prediction to facilitate the\ndeployment and weight monitoring using smartphones. Extensive experiments on\nBMI-annotated facial image datasets suggest that our proposed PatchBMI-Net\nmodel can obtain Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the range [3.58, 6.51] with a\nsize of about 3.3 million parameters. On cross-comparison with heavyweight\nmodels, such as ResNet-50 and Xception, trained for BMI prediction from facial\nimages, our proposed PatchBMI-Net obtains equivalent MAE along with the model\nsize reduction of about 5.4x and the average inference time reduction of about\n3x when deployed on Apple-14 smartphone. Thus, demonstrating performance\nefficiency as well as low latency for on-device deployment and weight\nmonitoring using smartphone applications.",

The theory, supplemented by agent based simulations, establish\nthat the SAT emerges as a consequence of biomechanical feedback on cell\ndivision. The emergence of asynchronous phase is due to linearly increasing\nfluctuations in the cell cycle times with each round of cell division.

Their main\nidea is to divide a DNN into two parts, where the first is shallow enough to be\nreliably executed at edge devices of limited computational power, while the\nsecond part is executed at an edge server with higher computational\ncapabilities. The main advantage of such systems is that the input of the DNN\ngets compressed as the subsequent layers of the shallow part extract only the\ninformation necessary for the task. As a result, significant communication\nsavings can be achieved compared to transmitting raw input samples. In this\nwork, we study early exiting in the context of collaborative inference, which\nallows obtaining inference results at the edge device for certain samples,\nwithout the need to transmit the partially processed data to the edge server at\nall, leading to further communication savings. The central part of our system\nis the transmission-decision (TD) mechanism, which, given the information from\nthe early exit, and the wireless channel conditions, decides whether to keep\nthe early exit prediction or transmit the data to the edge server for further\nprocessing. In this paper, we evaluate various TD mechanisms and show\nexperimentally, that for an image classification task over the wireless edge,\nproper utilization of early exits can provide both performance gains and\nsignificant communication savings.",

            "summary": "In many practical computer vision scenarios unlabeled data is plentiful, but\nlabels are scarce and difficult to obtain. As a result, semi-supervised\nlearning which leverages unlabeled data to boost the performance of supervised\nclassifiers have received significant attention in recent literature. One major\nclass of semi-supervised algorithms is co-training. In co-training two\ndifferent models leverage different independent and sufficient \"views\" of the\ndata to jointly make better predictions. During co-training each model creates\npseudo labels on unlabeled points which are used to improve the other model. We\nshow that in the common case when independent views are not available we can\nconstruct such views inexpensively using pre-trained models. Co-training on the\nconstructed views yields a performance improvement over any of the individual\nviews we construct and performance comparable with recent approaches in\nsemi-supervised learning, but has some undesirable properties. To alleviate the\nissues present with co-training we present Meta Co-Training which is an\nextension of the successful Meta Pseudo Labels approach to multiple views. Our\nmethod achieves new state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-10% with very few\ntraining resources, as well as outperforming prior semi-supervised work on\nseveral other fine-grained image classification datasets.",

Unlike offline\nmethods, ours is directly applicable to scenarios with real-time constraints,\nsuch as robotics or mixed reality. To overcome the inherent challenges of\nonline methods, we make two main contributions. First, to effectively extract\ninformation from the input RGB-D video stream, we jointly estimate geometry and\nsemantic labels per frame in 3D. A key focus of our approach is to reason about\nsemantic entities both in the 2D input and the local 3D domain to leverage\ndifferences in spatial context and network architectures. Our method predicts\n2D features using an off-the-shelf segmentation network. The extracted 2D\nfeatures are refined by a lightweight 3D network to enable reasoning about the\nlocal 3D structure. Second, to efficiently deal with an infinite stream of\ninput RGB-D frames, a subsequent network serves as a temporal expert predicting\nthe incremental scene updates by leveraging 2D, 3D, and past information in a\nlearned manner. These updates are then integrated into a global scene\nrepresentation. Using these main contributions, our method can enable scenarios\nwith real-time constraints and can scale to arbitrary scene sizes by processing\nand updating the scene only in a local region defined by the new measurement.\nOur experiments demonstrate improved results compared to existing online\nmethods that purely operate in local regions and show that complementary\nsources of information can boost the performance. We provide a thorough\nablation study on the benefits of different architectural as well as\nalgorithmic design decisions. Our method yields competitive results on the\npopular ScanNet benchmark and SceneNN dataset.",

We propose to predict the risk of developing breast\ncancer within one year based on the current MRI, with the objective of reducing\nscreening burden and facilitating early detection. An AI algorithm was\ndeveloped on 53,858 breasts from 12,694 patients who underwent screening or\ndiagnostic MRI and accrued over 12 years, with 2,331 confirmed cancers. A first\nU-Net was trained to segment lesions and identify regions of concern. A second\nconvolutional network was trained to detect malignant cancer using features\nextracted by the U-Net. This network was then fine-tuned to estimate the risk\nof developing cancer within a year in cases that radiologists considered normal\nor likely benign. Risk predictions from this AI were evaluated with a\nretrospective analysis of 9,183 breasts from a high-risk screening cohort,\nwhich were not used for training. Statistical analysis focused on the tradeoff\nbetween number of omitted exams versus negative predictive value, and number of\npotential early detections versus positive predictive value. The AI algorithm\nidentified regions of concern that coincided with future tumors in 52% of\nscreen-detected cancers. Upon directed review, a radiologist found that 71.3%\nof cancers had a visible correlate on the MRI prior to diagnosis, 65% of these\ncorrelates were identified by the AI model. Reevaluating these regions in 10%\nof all cases with higher AI-predicted risk could have resulted in up to 33%\nearly detections by a radiologist. Additionally, screening burden could have\nbeen reduced in 16% of lower-risk cases by recommending a later follow-up\nwithout compromising current interval cancer rate. With increasing datasets and\nimproving image quality we expect this new AI-aided, adaptive screening to\nmeaningfully reduce screening burden and improve early detection.",

Evaluating trust in AI-DSSs poses challenges to researchers and\npractitioners. These challenges include identifying the components,\ncapabilities, and potential of these systems, many of which are based on the\ncomplex deep learning algorithms that drive DSS performance and preclude\ncomplete manual inspection. We developed two interactive, AI-DSS test\nenvironments using the MAST criteria. One emulated an identity verification\ntask in security screening, and another emulated a text summarization system to\naid in an investigative reporting task. Each test environment had one version\ndesigned to match low-MAST ratings, and another designed to match high-MAST\nratings, with the hypothesis that MAST ratings would be positively related to\nthe trust ratings of these systems. A total of 177 subject matter experts were\nrecruited to interact with and evaluate these systems. Results generally show\nhigher MAST ratings for the high-MAST conditions compared to the low-MAST\ngroups, and that measures of trust perception are highly correlated with the\nMAST ratings. We conclude that MAST can be a useful tool for designing and\nevaluating systems that will engender high trust perceptions, including AI-DSS\nthat may be used to support visual screening and text summarization tasks.\nHowever, higher MAST ratings may not translate to higher joint performance.",

This kind of data requires\nextensive preprocessing, limiting the applicability of existing Time Series\nClassification and Time Series Extrinsic Regression techniques.

We evaluate\nBORF on Time Series Classification and Time Series Extrinsic Regression tasks\nusing the full UEA and UCR repositories, demonstrating its competitive\nperformance against state-of-the-art methods.

However,\nSemi-CRF suffers from two major drawbacks: (1) quadratic complexity over\nsequence length, as it operates on every span of the input sequence, and (2)\ninferior performance compared to CRF for sequence labeling tasks like NER. In\nthis paper, we introduce Filtered Semi-Markov CRF, a variant of Semi-CRF that\naddresses these issues by incorporating a filtering step to eliminate\nirrelevant segments, reducing complexity and search space. Our approach is\nevaluated on several NER benchmarks, where it outperforms both CRF and Semi-CRF\nwhile being significantly faster.

We obtain our results using direct numerical\nsimulations based on a Finite Element Method (FEM) solver; a two-fold interface\nbetween the GNN model and the solver allows the GNN's predictions to be\nincorporated into post-processing steps of the FEM analysis.

In MoMask, a hierarchical quantization scheme is\nemployed to represent human motion as multi-layer discrete motion tokens with\nhigh-fidelity details. Starting at the base layer, with a sequence of motion\ntokens obtained by vector quantization, the residual tokens of increasing\norders are derived and stored at the subsequent layers of the hierarchy. This\nis consequently followed by two distinct bidirectional transformers. For the\nbase-layer motion tokens, a Masked Transformer is designated to predict\nrandomly masked motion tokens conditioned on text input at training stage.\nDuring generation (i.e. inference) stage, starting from an empty sequence, our\nMasked Transformer iteratively fills up the missing tokens; Subsequently, a\nResidual Transformer learns to progressively predict the next-layer tokens\nbased on the results from current layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMoMask outperforms the state-of-art methods on the text-to-motion generation\ntask, with an FID of 0.045 (vs e.g. 0.141 of T2M-GPT) on the HumanML3D dataset,\nand 0.228 (vs 0.514) on KIT-ML, respectively.

In this work, we demonstrate\nthat by taking advantage of manifold learning approaches, we can estimate\nspectroscopic features of large samples of galaxies from their broadband\nphotometry when spectroscopy is available only for a fraction of the sample.\nThis will be done by applying the Self Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm on\nbroadband colors of galaxies and mapping partially available spectroscopic\ninformation into the trained maps. In this pilot study, we focus on estimating\n4000A break in a magnitude-limited sample of galaxies in the COSMOS field. We\nuse observed galaxy colors (ugrizYJH) as well as spectroscopic measurements for\na fraction of the sample from LEGA-C and zCOSMOS spectroscopic surveys to\nestimate this feature for our parent photometric sample. We recover the D4000\nfeature for galaxies which only have broadband colors with uncertainties about\ntwice of the uncertainty of the employed spectroscopic surveys. Using these\nmeasurements we observe a positive correlation between D4000 and stellar mass\nof the galaxies in our sample with weaker D4000 features for higher redshift\ngalaxies at fixed stellar masses.

In contrast, with the\nsame window function, a nonconstant threshold based on ellipsoidal collapse\npredicts uniformly too few haloes. This work indicates a new way to simply and\naccurately evaluate halo mass functions, clustering bias, and assembly\nhistories for a range of cosmologies. We provide a simple fitting function that\naccurately represents the predictions of the theory for a wide range of\nparameters.",

            "summary": "The $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) standard cosmological model is\nin severe tension with several cosmological observations. Foremost is the\nHubble tension, which exceeds $5\\sigma$ confidence. Galaxy number counts show\nthe Keenan-Barger-Cowie (KBC) supervoid, a significant underdensity out to\n300~Mpc that cannot be reconciled with $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Haslbauer et al.\npreviously showed that a high local Hubble constant arises naturally due to\ngravitationally driven outflows from the observed KBC supervoid. The main\nprediction of this model is that peculiar velocities are typically much larger\nthan expected in the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. This agrees with the recent\ndiscovery by Watkins et al. that galaxies in the CosmicFlows-4 catalogue have\nsignificantly faster bulk flows than expected in the $\\Lambda$CDM model on\nscales of $100-250 \\, h^{-1}$~Mpc. The rising bulk flow curve is unexpected in\nstandard cosmology, causing $4.8\\sigma$ tension at $200 \\, h^{-1}$~Mpc. In this\nwork, we determine what the semi-analytic void model of Haslbauer et al.\npredicts for the bulk flows on these scales. We find qualitative agreement with\nthe observations, especially if our vantage point is chosen to match the\nobserved bulk flow on a scale of $50 \\, h^{-1}$~Mpc. This represents a highly\nnon-trivial success of a previously published model that was not constrained by\nbulk flow measurements, but which was shown to solve the Hubble tension and\nexplain the KBC void consistently with the peculiar velocity of the Local\nGroup. Our results suggest that several cosmological tensions can be\nsimultaneously resolved if structure grows more efficiently than in the\n$\\Lambda$CDM paradigm on scales of tens to hundreds of Mpc.",

In large-scale numerical calculations using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC),\ndynamical mean field theory (DMFT), including cluster-DMFT, one usually obtains\nthe Green's function in imaginary-time $G(\\tau)$. The process of inverting a\nLaplace transform to obtain the spectral function $A(\\omega)$ in real-frequency\nis an ill-posed problem and forms the core of the analytic continuation\nproblem. In this Letter, we propose to use a completely unsupervised\nautoencoder-type neural network to solve the analytic continuation problem. We\nintroduce an encoder-decoder approach that, together with only minor physical\nassumptions, can extract a high-quality frequency response from the imaginary\ntime domain. With a deeply tunable architecture, this method can, in principle,\nlocate sharp features of spectral functions that might normally be lost using\nalready well-established methods, such as maximum entropy (MaxEnt) methods. We\ndemonstrate the strength of the autoencoder approach by applying it to QMC\nresults of $G(\\tau)$ for a single-band Hubbard model.

Many generative models have been developed\nin the last few years. However, these models so far lack the capacity to\nproduce crystals that obey the fundamental rules of crystal symmetry. This is\nbecause an important step in these previous approaches involves energy\nrelaxation on the generated crystal structures to find the ground state crystal\nstructure, typically using Density Functional Theory (DFT). More often than\nnot, this changes the symmetry of the structure, thereby changing the desired\nproperty and hence invalidating the original CSP. To address this, we introduce\na generative design framework (WyCryst), composed of three pivotal components:\n1) a Wyckoff position based inorganic crystal representation, 2) a\nproperty-directed VAE model and 3) an automated DFT workflow for structure\nrefinement. By implementing loss functions that punish non-realistic crystal\nstructures, our model selectively generates materials that follow the ground\ntruth of crystal symmetry in the form of Wyckoff representation for each Space\nGroup. In leave-one-out validation experiments, we successfully reproduce a\nvariety of existing materials: CaTiO3 (space group, SG No. 62 and 221), CsPbI3\n(SG No. 221), BaTiO3 (SG No. 160), and CuInS2 (SG No.122) for both ground state\nas well as polymorphic crystal structure predictions for desired compositions.\nWe also generate several new ternary materials not found in the inorganic\nmaterials database (Materials Project), which are proved to be stable,\nretaining their symmetry, and we also check their phonon stability, using our\nautomated DFT workflow highlighting the validity of our approach.",

            "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for\nvarious vision tasks. One reason behind the success lies in their ability to\nprovide plausible innate explanations for the behavior of neural architectures.\nHowever, ViTs suffer from issues with explanation faithfulness, as their focal\npoints are fragile to adversarial attacks and can be easily changed with even\nslight perturbations on the input image. In this paper, we propose a rigorous\napproach to mitigate these issues by introducing Faithful ViTs (FViTs). Briefly\nspeaking, an FViT should have the following two properties: (1) The top-$k$\nindices of its self-attention vector should remain mostly unchanged under input\nperturbation, indicating stable explanations; (2) The prediction distribution\nshould be robust to perturbations. To achieve this, we propose a new method\ncalled Denoised Diffusion Smoothing (DDS), which adopts randomized smoothing\nand diffusion-based denoising. We theoretically prove that processing ViTs\ndirectly with DDS can turn them into FViTs. We also show that Gaussian noise is\nnearly optimal for both $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$-norm cases. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments\nand evaluations. Specifically, we compare our FViTs with other baselines\nthrough visual interpretation and robustness accuracy under adversarial\nattacks. Results show that FViTs are more robust against adversarial attacks\nwhile maintaining the explainability of attention, indicating higher\nfaithfulness.",

Training data for distances\ncomes from Gaia EDR3, supplemented by literature distances for star clusters.\nFor masses, the network is trained using asteroseismic masses for evolved stars\nand isochrone masses for main sequence stars. The models are trained on\neffective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and carbon and nitrogen\nabundances.

The mass predictions have a\nstandard deviation of $\\pm 12\\%$. Using the masses, we derive ages for evolved\nstars based on the correspondence between mass and age for giant stars given by\nisochrones. The results are compiled into a Value Added Catalog (VAC) called\nDistMass that contains distances and masses for 733901 independent spectra,\nplus ages for 396548 evolved stars.",

Such a question depends on the kind of ensemble considered, as\nwell as the predictive metric chosen. We focus on situations where all members\nof the ensemble are a priori expected to perform as well, which is the case of\nseveral popular methods like random forests or deep ensembles. In this setting,\nwe essentially show that ensembles are getting better all the time if, and only\nif, the considered loss function is convex. More precisely, in that case, the\naverage loss of the ensemble is a decreasing function of the number of models.\nWhen the loss function is nonconvex, we show a series of results that can be\nsummarised by the insight that ensembles of good models keep getting better,\nand ensembles of bad models keep getting worse. To this end, we prove a new\nresult on the monotonicity of tail probabilities that may be of independent\ninterest. We illustrate our results on a simple machine learning problem\n(diagnosing melanomas using neural nets).",

To draw reliable conclusions from their\nexperimental constraints, it is necessary to have accurate predictions of the\nunderlying hadronic interactions described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a\nnon-Abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group SU(3). QCD predictions require\nnon-perturbative methods for calculating observables, and lattice QCD (LQCD), a\nnumerical method based on QCD formulated on a finite space-time grid, is the\nonly reliable first-principles technique for obtaining quantitative results.\nHowever, LQCD needs formal prescriptions to match numerical results with\nobservables. This thesis provides such prescriptions for double beta decays\nusing the finite volume effects in the LQCD framework. Matching relations that\nconnect two-nucleon double beta decay amplitudes to quantities accessible via\nLQCD calculations, namely the nuclear matrix elements and two-nucleon energy\nspectra in a finite volume are provided. The impact of uncertainties is\nexamined on the precision with which low-energy constants of the corresponding\neffective field theories can be determined from future LQCD calculations.\n  Hamiltonian simulation of QCD is another non-perturbative method of solving\nQCD which can be more suitable in some cases than the conventional LQCD. The\nrise of tensor network methods and quantum simulation has made Hamiltonian\nsimulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) a reality. Towards the goal of\nsimulating QCD, a loop-string-hadron (LSH) formulation of an SU(3) LGT with\nmatter in 1+1 dimensions is developed in this thesis, motivated by recent\nstudies that showed the LSH formulation of an SU(2) LGT to be advantageous over\nother formulations.",

We then use these models to predict the forced response of the FE\nmodel without performing any costly forced simulation. This approach yields\naccurate forced response predictions even in the presence of internal\nresonances or quasi-periodic forcing, as we illustrate on several FE models.\nOur examples range from simple structures, such as beams and shells, to more\ncomplex geometries, such as a micro-resonator model containing more than a\nmillion degrees of freedom. In the latter case, our algorithm predicts accurate\nforced response curves in a small fraction of the time it takes to verify just\na few points on those curves by simulating the full forced-response.",

            "summary": "Regression adjustment, sometimes known as Controlled-experiment Using\nPre-Experiment Data (CUPED), is an important technique in internet\nexperimentation. It decreases the variance of effect size estimates, often\ncutting confidence interval widths in half or more while never making them\nworse. It does so by carefully regressing the goal metric against\npre-experiment features to reduce the variance. The tremendous gains of\nregression adjustment begs the question: How much better can we do by\nengineering better features from pre-experiment data, for example by using\nmachine learning techniques or synthetic controls? Could we even reduce the\nvariance in our effect sizes arbitrarily close to zero with the right\npredictors? Unfortunately, our answer is negative. A simple form of regression\nadjustment, which uses just the pre-experiment values of the goal metric,\ncaptures most of the benefit. Specifically, under a mild assumption that\nobservations closer in time are easier to predict that ones further away in\ntime, we upper bound the potential gains of more sophisticated feature\nengineering, with respect to the gains of this simple form of regression\nadjustment. The maximum reduction in variance is $50\\%$ in Theorem 1, or\nequivalently, the confidence interval width can be reduced by at most an\nadditional $29\\%$.",

Secondly, we show that aggregated annotations are\nuseful for prompt-chaining; they help improve downstream VLM predictions (e.g.,\nof object material when the object's type is specified as an auxiliary input in\nthe prompt). Such auxiliary inputs allow ablating and measuring the\ncontribution of visual reasoning over language-only reasoning.

            "summary": "Lattice gauge-equivariant convolutional neural networks (L-CNNs) can be used\nto form arbitrarily shaped Wilson loops and can approximate any gauge-covariant\nor gauge-invariant function on the lattice. Here we use L-CNNs to describe\nfixed point (FP) actions which are based on renormalization group\ntransformations. FP actions are classically perfect, i.e., they have no lattice\nartifacts on classical gauge-field configurations satisfying the equations of\nmotion, and therefore possess scale invariant instanton solutions. FP actions\nare tree-level Symanzik-improved to all orders in the lattice spacing and can\nproduce physical predictions with very small lattice artifacts even on coarse\nlattices. We find that L-CNNs are much more accurate at parametrizing the FP\naction compared to older approaches. They may therefore provide a way to\ncircumvent critical slowing down and topological freezing towards the continuum\nlimit.",

            "summary": "Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and\npathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images\n(WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a\nfeature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are\nsubsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI\nlabel. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new\nfeature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged.\nTraditional evaluation methods, however, rely on fixed aggregation model\nhyperparameters, a framework we identify as potentially biasing the results.\nOur study uncovers a co-dependence between feature extractor models and\naggregation model hyperparameters, indicating that performance comparability\ncan be skewed based on the chosen hyperparameters. By accounting for this\nco-dependency, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor\nmodels is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature\nextractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation\nmodel configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced\nunderstanding of the relationship between feature extractors and aggregation\nmodels, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of feature extractor\nmodels in digital pathology.",

            "summary": "Recent technological advances have enabled the recording of neurons in intact\ncircuits with a high spatial and temporal resolution, creating the need for\nmodeling with the same precision. In particular, the development of ultra-fast\ntwo-photon microscopy combined with fluorescence-based genetically-encoded\nCa2+-indicators allows capture of full-dendritic arbor and somatic responses\nassociated with synaptic input and action potential output. The complexity of\ndendritic arbor structures and distributed patterns of activity over time\nresults in the generation of incredibly rich 4D datasets that are challenging\nto analyze (Sakaki, 2020). Interpreting neural activity from fluorescence-based\nCa2+ biosensors is challenging due to non-linear interactions between several\nfactors influencing intracellular calcium ion concentration and its binding to\nsensors, including the ionic dynamics driven by diffusion, electrical gradients\nand voltage-gated conductance.To investigate those dynamics, we designed a\nmodel based on a Cable-like equation coupled to the Nernst-Planck equations for\nionic fluxes in electrolytes. We employ this model to simulate signal\npropagation and ionic electrodiffusion across a dendritic arbor. Using these\nsimulation results, we then designed an algorithm to detect synapses from Ca2+\nimaging datasets. We finally apply this algorithm to experimental\nCa2+-indicator datasets from neurons expressing jGCaMP7s (Dana et al., 2019),\nusing full-dendritic arbor sampling in vivo in the Xenopus laevis optic tectum\nusing fast random-access two-photon microscopy.Our model reproduces the\ndynamics of visual stimulus-evoked jGCaMP7s-mediated calcium signals observed\nexperimentally, and the resulting algorithm allows prediction of the location\nof synapses across the dendritic arbor.Our study provides a way to predict\nsynaptic activity and location on dendritic arbors, from fluorescence data in\nthe full dendritic arbor of a neuron recorded in the intact and awake\ndeveloping vertebrate brain.",

To that end, improving the efficiency of the pipe leakage and repair\nprocess and aiding the selection of the pipes that are to be renewed or\nrehabilitated are essential. To help addressing these tasks, in this work, we\ndevelop a model predicting the probability of a pipe to be leaking. This work\nis set the context of a multidisciplinary project with Soci{\\'e}t{\\'e} Wallone\ndes Eaux and it is aligned with their goal to improve their Infrastructure\nAsset Management in the short and the long terms. Developing and feeding this\nleakage probability model relies on an intense data processing phase,\nmobilizing data and water engineering sciences, since the raw data from SWDE is\nnot ready to be used in the model. Complementarily, we thus employ techniques\nfrom sociology (e.g., interviews, analyses of the human/non-human actors and of\nthe tools, sociotechnical translations) in order to complete the data, to\nimprove our understanding of its production, and to increase its value and its\navailability for the prediction of the pipe leakage probability. This model\nwill be implemented in SWDE's information system and used for strategies to\nreduce water losses.",

The study of multi-planetary systems offers an opportunity to\ninvestigate the outcomes of planet formation and evolution while controlling\nfor initial conditions and environment. Those in resonance (with their orbital\nperiods related by a ratio of small integers) are particularly valuable because\nthey imply a system architecture practically unchanged since its birth. Here,\nwe present the observations of six transiting planets around the bright nearby\nstar HD 110067. We find that the planets follow a chain of resonant orbits. A\ndynamical study of the innermost planet triplet allowed the prediction and\nlater confirmation of the orbits of the rest of the planets in the system. The\nsix planets are found to be sub-Neptunes with radii ranging from 1.94 to 2.85\nRe.

            "summary": "Text-to-3D generation by distilling pretrained large-scale text-to-image\ndiffusion models has shown great promise but still suffers from inconsistent 3D\ngeometric structures (Janus problems) and severe artifacts. The aforementioned\nproblems mainly stem from 2D diffusion models lacking 3D awareness during the\nlifting. In this work, we present GeoDream, a novel method that incorporates\nexplicit generalized 3D priors with 2D diffusion priors to enhance the\ncapability of obtaining unambiguous 3D consistent geometric structures without\nsacrificing diversity or fidelity. Specifically, we first utilize a multi-view\ndiffusion model to generate posed images and then construct cost volume from\nthe predicted image, which serves as native 3D geometric priors, ensuring\nspatial consistency in 3D space. Subsequently, we further propose to harness 3D\ngeometric priors to unlock the great potential of 3D awareness in 2D diffusion\npriors via a disentangled design. Notably, disentangling 2D and 3D priors\nallows us to refine 3D geometric priors further. We justify that the refined 3D\ngeometric priors aid in the 3D-aware capability of 2D diffusion priors, which\nin turn provides superior guidance for the refinement of 3D geometric priors.\nOur numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate that GeoDream generates more\n3D consistent textured meshes with high-resolution realistic renderings (i.e.,\n1024 $\\times$ 1024) and adheres more closely to semantic coherence.",

Our approach\ninvolves an optimization-based strategy that actively penalizes the prediction\nof a large number of distinct classes within each window.

            "summary": "I present a review of how late observations of supernovae, of the nebular\nphase, and much later of supernova remnants (SNRs), and their analysis in 2023\nmade progress towards breakthroughs in supporting the jittering jets explosion\nmechanism (JJEM) for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and in introducing the\ngroup of lonely white dwarf (WD) scenarios for type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The\nnew analyses of CCSN remnants (CCSNRs) reveal point-symmetric morphologies in a\nway unnoticed before in three CCSNRs. Comparison to multipolar planetary\nnebulae that are shaped by jets suggests that jets exploded these CCSNe, as\npredicted by the JJEM, but incompatible with the prediction of the delayed\nneutrino explosion mechanism. The spherical morphology of the ejecta Pa 30 of\nthe historical type Iax supernova (SN Iax) of 1181 AD, which studies in 2023\nrevealed, is mostly compatible with the explosion of a lonely WD. Namely, at\nthe explosion time, there is only a WD, without any close companion, although\nthe WD was formed via a close binary interaction, i.e., binary merger. An\nidentification of point-symmetry in SNR G1.9+0.3, a normal SN Ia and the\nyoungest SN in the Galaxy, suggests an SN explosion of a lonely WD inside a\nplanetary nebula (an SNIP). The group of lonely WD scenarios includes the core\ndegenerate scenario and the double degenerate scenario with a merger to\nexplosion delay (MED) time. SN Ia explosions of lonely WDs are common, and\nmight actually account for most (or even all) normal SNe Ia.",

Sentence transformers\nare the NLP counterparts to this architecture, and have been growing in\npopularity due to their rich and effective sentence representations. Having\neffective sentence representations is paramount in multiple tasks, such as\ninformation retrieval, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and sentence\ncomparison. Keeping in mind the deployability factor of transformers,\nevaluating the robustness of sentence transformers is of utmost importance.\nThis work focuses on evaluating the robustness of the sentence encoders. We\nemploy several adversarial attacks to evaluate its robustness. This system uses\ncharacter-level attacks in the form of random character substitution,\nword-level attacks in the form of synonym replacement, and sentence-level\nattacks in the form of intra-sentence word order shuffling. The results of the\nexperiments strongly undermine the robustness of sentence encoders. The models\nproduce significantly different predictions as well as embeddings on perturbed\ndatasets. The accuracy of the models can fall up to 15 percent on perturbed\ndatasets as compared to unperturbed datasets. Furthermore, the experiments\ndemonstrate that these embeddings does capture the semantic and syntactic\nstructure (sentence order) of sentences. However, existing supervised\nclassification strategies fail to leverage this information, and merely\nfunction as n-gram detectors.",

Free\nperiods of a complex director field, which correspond to topological defect\npositioning and net topological charge, are determined numerically to minimize\na global stored elastic energy, including a contribution of a weak (finite)\nanchoring strength on the body surfaces.

Given the\n3D point cloud and multiple posed 2D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments\n3D scenes by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames.\nOur key idea involves locating 3D points in scenes as natural 3D prompts to\nalign their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring frame-consistency\nin both pixel prompts and their SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest\nfiltering out low-quality 3D prompts based on feedback from all 2D frames, for\nenhancing segmentation quality. We also propose to consolidate different 3D\nprompts if they are segmenting the same object, bringing a more comprehensive\nsegmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training on\ndomain-specific data, enabling us to preserve the zero-shot power of SAM.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative results show that our method\nconsistently achieves higher quality and more diverse segmentation than\nprevious zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases even\nsurpasses human-level annotations.

            "summary": "Context: Bug-fix pattern detection has been investigated in the past in the\ncontext of classical software. However, while quantum software is developing\nrapidly, the literature still lacks automated methods and tools to identify,\nanalyze, and detect bug-fix patterns. To the best of our knowledge, our work\npreviously published in SEKE'23 was the first to leverage classical techniques\nto detect bug-fix patterns in quantum code.\n  Objective: To extend our previous effort, we present a research agenda\n(Q-Repair), including a series of testing and debugging methodologies, to\nimprove the quality of quantum software. The ultimate goal is to utilize\nmachine learning techniques to automatically predict fix patterns for existing\nquantum bugs.\n  Method: As part of the first stage of the agenda, we extend our initial study\nand propose a more comprehensive automated framework, called Q-PAC, for\ndetecting bug-fix patterns in IBM Qiskit quantum code. In the framework, we\ndevelop seven bug-fix pattern detectors using abstract syntax trees, syntactic\nfilters, and semantic checks.\n  Results: To demonstrate our method, we run Q-PAC on a variety of quantum\nbug-fix patterns using both real-world and handcrafted examples of bugs and\nfixes. The experimental results show that Q-PAC can effectively identify\nbug-fix patterns in IBM Qiskit.\n  Conclusion: We hope our initial study on quantum bug-fix detection can bring\nawareness of quantum software engineering to both researchers and\npractitioners. Thus, we also publish Q-PAC as an open-source software on\nGitHub. We would like to encourage other researchers to work on research\ndirections (such as Q-Repair) to improve the quality of the quantum\nprogramming.",

Employing\na suitable procedure, we construct the regularized matrix model for these\ntheories and show that, at order g^4, the predictions for the 1/2 BPS Wilson\nloop match standard perturbative renormalization based on the direct evaluation\nof Feynman diagrams on S4. Despite conformal symmetry begin broken at the\nquantum level, we also demonstrate that the matrix model approaches perfectly\ncaptures the expression of the renormalized observable in flat space at this\nperturbative order.

Surprisingly, this continuous-time Markov process is\nthe well-known and well-studied Ornstein-Ohlenbeck (OU) process, which was\ndeveloped in 1930's for studying Brownian particles in Harmonic potentials. We\nestablish the formal equivalence between DDPM and the OU process using its\nanalytical solution. We further demonstrate that the design problem of the\nnoise scheduler for non-homogeneous DDPM is equivalent to designing observation\ntimes for the OU process. We present several heuristic designs for observation\ntimes based on principled quantities such as auto-variance and Fisher\nInformation and connect them to ad hoc noise schedules for DDPM. Interestingly,\nwe show that the Fisher-Information-motivated schedule corresponds exactly the\ncosine schedule, which was developed without any theoretical foundation but is\nthe current state-of-the-art noise schedule.",

Recent occupancy estimation techniques using only camera images\nas input can provide dense occupancy representations of large-scale scenes\nbased on the current observation. However, they are mostly limited to\nrepresenting the current 3D space and do not consider the future state of\nsurrounding objects along the time axis. To extend camera-only occupancy\nestimation into spatiotemporal prediction, we propose Cam4DOcc, a new benchmark\nfor camera-only 4D occupancy forecasting, evaluating the surrounding scene\nchanges in a near future. We build our benchmark based on multiple publicly\navailable datasets, including nuScenes, nuScenes-Occupancy, and Lyft-Level5,\nwhich provides sequential occupancy states of general movable and static\nobjects, as well as their 3D backward centripetal flow. To establish this\nbenchmark for future research with comprehensive comparisons, we introduce four\nbaseline types from diverse camera-based perception and prediction\nimplementations, including a static-world occupancy model, voxelization of\npoint cloud prediction, 2D-3D instance-based prediction, and our proposed novel\nend-to-end 4D occupancy forecasting network. Furthermore, the standardized\nevaluation protocol for preset multiple tasks is also provided to compare the\nperformance of all the proposed baselines on present and future occupancy\nestimation with respect to objects of interest in autonomous driving scenarios.\nThe dataset and our implementation of all four baselines in the proposed\nCam4DOcc benchmark will be released here: https://github.com/haomo-ai/Cam4DOcc.",

            "summary": "Relaying increases the coverage area and reliability of wireless\ncommunications systems by mitigating the fading effect on the received signal.\nMost technical contributions in the context of these systems assume ideal\nhardware (ID) by neglecting the non-idealities of the transceivers, which\ninclude phase noise, in-phase/quadrature mismatch and high power amplifier\nnonlinearities. These non-idealities create distortion on the received signal\nby causing variations in the phase and attenuating the amplitude. The resulting\ndeterioration of the performance of wireless communication systems is further\nmagnified as the frequency of transmission increases. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the aggregate impact of hardware impairments (HI) on the general\nmulti-hop relay system using amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward\n(DF) relaying techniques over a general H-fading model. H-fading model includes\nfree space optics, radio frequency, millimeter wave, Terahertz, and underwater\nfading models. Closed-form expressions of outage probability, bit error\nprobability and ergodic capacity are derived in terms of H-functions. Following\nan asymptotic analysis at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), practical\noptimization problems have been formulated with the objective of finding the\noptimal level of HI subject to the limitation on the total HI level. The\nanalytical solution has been derived for the Nakagami-m fading channel which is\na special case of H-fading for AF and DF relaying techniques. The overall\ninstantaneous signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio has been demonstrated to\nreach a ceiling at high SNRs which has a reciprocal proportion to the HI level\nof all hops transceivers on the contrary to the ID.",

            "summary": "The identification of integrable dynamics remains a formidable challenge, and\ndespite centuries of research, only a handful of examples are known to date. In\nthis article, we explore a special form of area-preserving (symplectic)\nmappings derived from the stroboscopic Poincare cross-section of a kicked\nrotator. Notably, Suris' theorem constrains the integrability within this\ncategory of mappings, outlining potential scenarios with analytic invariants of\nmotion. In this paper, we challenge the assumption of the analyticity of the\ninvariant, by exploring piecewise linear transformations on a torus and\nassociated systems on the plane, incorporating arithmetic quasiperiodicity and\ndiscontinuities. By introducing a new automated technique, we discovered\npreviously unknown scenarios featuring polygonal invariants that form perfect\ntessellations and, moreover, fibrations of the plane/torus. In this way, this\nwork reveals a novel category of planar tilings characterized by discrete\nsymmetries that emerge from the invertibility of transformations and are\nintrinsically linked to the presence of integrability. Our algorithm relies on\nthe analysis of the Poincare rotation number and its piecewise monotonic nature\nfor integrable cases, contrasting with the noisy behavior in the case of chaos,\nthereby allowing for clear separation. Some of the newly discovered systems\nexhibit the peculiar behavior of integrable diffusion, marked by infinite and\nquasi-random hopping between tiles while being confined to a set of invariant\nsegments. Finally, through the implementation of a smoothening procedure, all\nmappings can be generalized to quasi-integrable scenarios with smooth invariant\nmotion, thereby opening doors to potential practical applications.",

This issue has recently garnered much interest with the\nfocus being on the inversion of the $\\Delta$E$_{ST}$, although experiments have\nindicated near degenerate levels with both positive and negative being within\nthe experimental error bar (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 102: 6068 , J. Am. Chem. Soc.,\n108: 17 ). We have carried out a systematic and exhaustive study of various\nexcited state electronic structure methodologies and identified the strengths\nand shortcomings of the various approaches and approximations in view of this\nchallenging case. We have found that near degeneracy can be achieved either\nwith a proper balance of static and dynamic correlation in multireference\ntheories or with state-specific orbital corrections including its coupling with\ncorrelation. The role of spin contamination is also discussed. Eventually, this\npaper seeks to produce benchmark numbers for establishing cheaper theories\nwhich can then be used for screening derivatives of these templates with\ndesirable optical and structural properties. Additionally we would like to\npoint out that the use of DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD as the benchmark for\n$\\Delta$E$_{ST}$ (as used in J. Phys. Chem. A, 126: 8: 1378, Chem. Phys.

The reliability of graph\nembeddings directly depends on how much the geometry of the continuous space\nmatches the graph structure. Manifolds are mathematical structure that can\nenable to incorporate in their topological spaces the graph characteristics,\nand in particular nodes distances. State-of-the-art of manifold-based graph\nembedding algorithms take advantage of the assumption that the projection on a\ntangential space of each point in the manifold (corresponding to a node in the\ngraph) would locally resemble a Euclidean space. Although this condition helps\nin achieving efficient analytical solutions to the embedding problem, it does\nnot represent an adequate set-up to work with modern real life graphs, that are\ncharacterized by weighted connections across nodes often computed over sparse\ndatasets with missing records. In this work, we introduce a new class of\nmanifold, named soft manifold, that can solve this situation. In particular,\nsoft manifolds are mathematical structures with spherical symmetry where the\ntangent spaces to each point are hypocycloids whose shape is defined according\nto the velocity of information propagation across the data points. Using soft\nmanifolds for graph embedding, we can provide continuous spaces to pursue any\ntask in data analysis over complex datasets. Experimental results on\nreconstruction tasks on synthetic and real datasets show how the proposed\napproach enable more accurate and reliable characterization of graphs in\ncontinuous spaces with respect to the state-of-the-art.",

            "summary": "When a liquid jet plunges into a pool, it can generate a bubble-laden jet\nflow underneath the surface. This common and simple phenomenon is investigated\nexperimentally for circular jets to illustrate and quantify the role played by\nthe net gas/liquid void fraction on the maximum bubble penetration depth. It is\nfirst shown that an increase in either the impact diameter or the jet fall\nheight to diameter ratio at constant impact momentum leads to a reduction in\nthe bubble cloud size. By systematically measuring the local void fraction\nusing optical probes in the biphasic jet, it is then demonstrated that this\neffect is a direct consequence of the increase in the air content within the\ncloud. A simple momentum balance model, including only inertia and the buoyancy\nforce, is shown to predict the bubble cloud depth without any fitting\nparameters. Finally, a Froude number based on the bubble terminal velocity, the\ncloud depth, and also the net void fraction is introduced to propose a simple\ncriterion for the threshold between the inertia-dominated and\nbuoyancy-dominated regimes.",

            "summary": "Subjected to the tidal field of its companion, each component of a coalescing\nbinary suffers a slow change in its mass (tidal heating) and spin (tidal\ntorquing) during the inspiral and merger. For black holes, these changes are\nassociated with their absorption of energy and angular momentum fluxes. This\neffect modifies the inspiral rate of the binary, and consequently, the phase\nand amplitude of its gravitational waveform. Numerical relativity waveforms\ncontain these effects inherently, whereas analytical approximants for the early\ninspiral phase have to include them manually in the energy balance equation. In\nthis work, we construct a frequency-domain gravitational waveform model that\nincorporates the effects of tidal heating of black holes. This is achieved by\nrecalibrating the inspiral phase of the waveform model IMRPhenomD to\nincorporate the phase corrections for tidal heating. We also include\ncorrections to the amplitude, but add them directly to the inspiral amplitude\nmodel of IMRPhenomD. We show that the new model is faithful, with less than 1%\nmismatch, against a set of hybrid waveforms, except for one outlier that barely\nbreaches this limit. The recalibrated model shows mismatches of up to $\\sim\n16\\%$ with IMRPhenomD for high mass ratios and spins. Amplitude corrections\nbecome less significant for higher mass ratios, whereas the phase corrections\nleave more impact - suggesting that the former is practically irrelevant for\ngravitational wave data analysis in Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), Virgo and KAGRA.\nComparing with a set of 219 numerical relativity waveforms, we find that the\nmedian of mismatches decreases by $\\sim 4\\%$ in aLIGO zero-detuned high power\nnoise curve, and by $\\sim 2\\%$ with a flat noise curve. This implies a modest\nbut notable improvement in waveform accuracy.",

Typically, individuals with high risks of adverse outcomes are\nadvised to undergo an intervention while those at low risk are advised to\nrefrain from it. Standard prediction models do not always provide risks that\nare relevant to inform such decisions: e.g., an individual may be estimated to\nbe at low risk because similar individuals in the past received an intervention\nwhich lowered their risk. Therefore, prediction models supporting decisions\nshould target risks belonging to defined intervention strategies. Previous\nworks on prediction under interventions assumed that the prediction model was\nused only at one time point to make an intervention decision. In clinical\npractice, intervention decisions are rarely made only once: they might be\nrepeated, deferred and re-evaluated. This requires estimated risks under\ninterventions that can be reconsidered at several potential decision moments.\nIn the current work, we highlight key considerations for formulating estimands\nin sequential prediction under interventions that can inform such intervention\ndecisions. We illustrate these considerations by giving examples of estimands\nfor a case study about choosing between vaginal delivery and cesarean section\nfor women giving birth. Our formalization of prediction tasks in a sequential,\ncausal, and estimand context provides guidance for future studies to ensure\nthat the right question is answered and appropriate causal estimation\napproaches are chosen to develop sequential prediction models that can inform\nintervention decisions.",

This helps follow the vorticity dynamics of periodic\nfree shear layer flows by solving an extremely accurate algorithm to explain\nvortex interactions that lead to vortex stripping (forward cascade), merger,\nand reconnection (inverse cascade) during various stages of evolution of\nperiodic arrangements of a large number of TGV vortical cells. This latter\naspect has been adopted so as not to be affected by the periodicity constraints\nof a single periodic cell and the various imposed symmetries that attenuate\ndisturbance growth. The analytic solution of the TGV provides the initial\ncondition and the spatially accurate Fourier spectral method enables one to\ntrack the first instability of the initial doubly periodic vortices. Despite a\nplethora of studies following the primary instability to relate it with\ntransition to turbulence and the subsequent decay of turbulence in the\nliterature, the topic of bifurcation sequence for periodic TGV is rare, and\nthat is one of the main aims of the present research. Instead of restricting\none's attention on a single periodic TGV cell, here it is purposely reported\nfor multiple cells of the TGV in both directions, without invoking any\nasymmetries extraneously. For such an ensemble, one can study various vortical\ninteractions giving rise to atypical energy spectra, a topic that has also been\nseldom addressed to distinguish between successive instabilities that can upon\na conjecture, lead to transition and subsequent relaminarization, versus the\nbifurcation sequences leading from one equilibrium state to subsequent ones.\nThe present study shows the dominance of the latter for 2D TGV at post-critical\nReynolds number.",

However, existing LLM frameworks face\nlimitations in handling domain-specific data analytics tasks with rich data\nstructures. Moreover, they struggle with flexibility to meet diverse user\nrequirements. To address these issues, TaskWeaver is proposed as a code-first\nframework for building LLM-powered autonomous agents. It converts user requests\ninto executable code and treats user-defined plugins as callable functions.\nTaskWeaver provides support for rich data structures, flexible plugin usage,\nand dynamic plugin selection, and leverages LLM coding capabilities for complex\nlogic. It also incorporates domain-specific knowledge through examples and\nensures the secure execution of generated code. TaskWeaver offers a powerful\nand flexible framework for creating intelligent conversational agents that can\nhandle complex tasks and adapt to domain-specific scenarios.

            "summary": "Recent one-shot video tuning methods, which fine-tune the network on a\nspecific video based on pre-trained text-to-image models (e.g., Stable\nDiffusion), are popular in the community because of the flexibility. However,\nthese methods often produce videos marred by incoherence and inconsistency. To\naddress these limitations, this paper introduces a simple yet effective noise\nconstraint across video frames. This constraint aims to regulate noise\npredictions across their temporal neighbors, resulting in smooth latents. It\ncan be simply included as a loss term during the training phase. By applying\nthe loss to existing one-shot video tuning methods, we significantly improve\nthe overall consistency and smoothness of the generated videos. Furthermore, we\nargue that current video evaluation metrics inadequately capture smoothness. To\naddress this, we introduce a novel metric that considers detailed features and\ntheir temporal dynamics. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our\napproach in producing smoother videos on various one-shot video tuning\nbaselines.

Instead of analyzing the spectral\nfeatures of temperature-dependent SiV signal, coming from SiV micro-diamond\nfixed on the fiber tip, an alternative parallel detection method based on\nfiltering optics and photon counters is proposed to read out the sample\ntemperature in real-time. The signal collection efficiency of the fiber is also\ninvestigated numerically with semi-analytic ray-optical analysis and then\ncompared with our experimental study. We finally demonstrate the performance of\nthe thermosensor by monitoring the temperature at distinct locations in a\nlab-built graphite-based microheater device.

Several previous works have investigated the effect of\nartifacts that are invoked during downsampling and diverse cures have been\nproposed that facilitate to improve prediction stability and even robustness\nfor image classification. However, equally relevant, artifacts that arise\nduring upsampling have been less discussed. This is significantly relevant as\nupsampling and downsampling approaches face fundamentally different challenges.\nWhile during downsampling, aliases and artifacts can be reduced by blurring\nfeature maps, the emergence of fine details is crucial during upsampling.\nBlurring is therefore not an option and dedicated operations need to be\nconsidered. In this work, we are the first to explore the relevance of context\nduring upsampling by employing convolutional upsampling operations with\nincreasing kernel size while keeping the encoder unchanged. We find that\nincreased kernel sizes can in general improve the prediction stability in tasks\nsuch as image restoration or image segmentation, while a block that allows for\na combination of small-size kernels for fine details and large-size kernels for\nartifact removal and increased context yields the best results.",

We observe that\nincreasing the proportion of motors having faster transitions between two\nstates will always increase the mean velocity of the sample, irrespective of\nthe extent of variation in other microscopic properties. On the other hand,\nchanging the proportion of motors based on their potential energies in a\nparticular state has a noticeable effect on mean velocity only when the sample\nis made homogeneous with respect to most other microscopic properties.

In this work, by adopting a\nmean-field approach considering multiple-channel pairings and the\nKosterlitz-Nelson criterion, we demonstrate giant amplifications of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature and a shrinking of\nthe pseudogap for small energy separations between the conduction and valence\nbands and small density of carriers in the conduction band. The presence of the\nholes in the valence band, generated by intra-band and pair-exchange couplings,\ncontributes constructively to the phase stiffness of the total system, adding\nup to the phase stiffness of the conduction band electrons that is boosted as\nwell, due to the presence of the valence band electrons. This strong\ncooperative effect avoids the suppression of the BKT transition temperature for\nlow density of carriers, that occurs in single-band superconductors where only\nthe conduction band is present. Thus, we predict that in this regime,\nmulti-band superconducting and superfluid systems with valence and conduction\nbands can exhibit much larger BKT critical temperatures with respect to\nsingle-band and single-condensate systems.",

We show that\nintegrating model performance prediction with early stopping methods holds\ngreat potential to speed up the HPO process of deep learning models. Moreover,\nwe propose a novel algorithm called Swift-Hyperband that can use either\nclassical or quantum support vector regression for performance prediction and\nbenefit from distributed High Performance Computing environments. This\nalgorithm is tested not only for the Machine-Learned Particle Flow model used\nin High Energy Physics, but also for a wider range of target models from\ndomains such as computer vision and natural language processing.\nSwift-Hyperband is shown to find comparable (or better) hyperparameters as well\nas using less computational resources in all test cases.",

In contrast, our research reframes the problem as a\nstraightforward regression task by exploring the capabilities of Vision\nTransformers for direct 6D pose estimation through a tailored use of\nclassification tokens. We also introduce a simple method for determining pose\nconfidence, which can be readily integrated into most 6D pose estimation\nframeworks. This involves modifying the transformer architecture by decreasing\nthe number of query elements based on the network's assessment of the scene\ncomplexity. Our method that we call Pose Vision Transformer or PViT-6D provides\nthe benefits of simple implementation and being end-to-end learnable while\noutperforming current state-of-the-art methods by +0.3% ADD(-S) on\nLinemod-Occlusion and +2.7% ADD(-S) on the YCB-V dataset.

In absence of the magnetic field existence of spatially anisotropic\nstructures requires a fractional electron concentration, where a significant\ninfluence of spatial orientation of an electric field is observed. It turns out\nthat the investigated model exhibits a rotating magnetoelectric effect at all\nthree concentrations with one or two consecutive critical points in presence of\nmagnetic field. At the same time, the rotating electric field has a significant\neffect on a critical value of an electrostatic potential, which can be enhanced\nor lowered upon changing the electron hopping and the magnitude of an applied\nmagnetic field.

In such a setting, one can\neither keep the information on both the new standard of care and the other\nactive treatments before the control is changed or one could discard this\ninformation when testing for benefit of the remaining treatments.

We also\nconsider the conditional power of the active treatments, the probability a\ngiven treatment can be found superior against the current control. We prove\nwhen, in a multi-arm multi-stage trial where no arms are added, retaining the\ninformation is detrimental to both overall and conditional power of the\nremaining treatments. This loss of power is studied for a motivating example.\nWe then discuss the effect on platform trials in which arms are added later.

These streamlined\nprocesses allow our framework to adapt to a variety of non-verbal avatar\ninteractions, both monadic and dyadic. Our extensive study, which includes\nexperiments on both newly compiled and existing datasets featuring two types of\nagents -- one capable of monadic interaction with the environment, and the\nother designed for dyadic conversation -- validates the effectiveness and\nversatility of our approach.

            "summary": "Scene flow estimation, which aims to predict per-point 3D displacements of\ndynamic scenes, is a fundamental task in the computer vision field. However,\nprevious works commonly suffer from unreliable correlation caused by locally\nconstrained searching ranges, and struggle with accumulated inaccuracy arising\nfrom the coarse-to-fine structure. To alleviate these problems, we propose a\nnovel uncertainty-aware scene flow estimation network (DifFlow3D) with the\ndiffusion probabilistic model. Iterative diffusion-based refinement is designed\nto enhance the correlation robustness and resilience to challenging cases,\ne.g., dynamics, noisy inputs, repetitive patterns, etc. To restrain the\ngeneration diversity, three key flow-related features are leveraged as\nconditions in our diffusion model. Furthermore, we also develop an uncertainty\nestimation module within diffusion to evaluate the reliability of estimated\nscene flow. Our DifFlow3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 6.7\\% and\n19.1\\% EPE3D reduction respectively on FlyingThings3D and KITTI 2015 datasets.\nNotably, our method achieves an unprecedented millimeter-level accuracy\n(0.0089m in EPE3D) on the KITTI dataset. Additionally, our diffusion-based\nrefinement paradigm can be readily integrated as a plug-and-play module into\nexisting scene flow networks, significantly increasing their estimation\naccuracy.

            "summary": "Converging Zero Trust (ZT) with learning techniques can solve various\noperational and security challenges in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems\n(DCCS). Implementing centralized ZT architecture is seen as unsuitable for the\ncomputing continuum (e.g., computing entities with limited connectivity and\nvisibility, etc.). At the same time, implementing decentralized ZT in the\ncomputing continuum requires understanding infrastructure limitations and novel\napproaches to enhance resource access management decisions. To overcome such\nchallenges, we present a novel learning-driven ZT conceptual architecture\ndesigned for DCCS. We aim to enhance ZT architecture service quality by\nincorporating lightweight learning strategies such as Representation Learning\n(ReL) and distributing ZT components across the computing continuum. The ReL\nhelps to improve the decision-making process by predicting threats or untrusted\nrequests. Through an illustrative example, we show how the learning process\ndetects and blocks the requests, enhances resource access control, and reduces\nnetwork and computation overheads. Lastly, we discuss the conceptual\narchitecture, processes, and provide a research agenda.",

We focus on the singlet and two octet\nchannels, where the poles corresponding to $\\Lambda(1405)$ have been predicted\nin the chiral unitary model. For calculations with $\\Lambda$-baryon source\noperators with zero momentum, we employ the conventional stochastic calculation\ncombined with the covariant-approximation averaging to calculate the all-to-all\npropagators. Due to a zero of the R-correlator (a kind of wave function), the\nleading order (LO) potential obtained by the single channel analysis has a\nsingular point in all channels, which makes it difficult to obtain reliable\nbinding energies. To overcome this problem, we take a linear combination of two\noctet R-correlators with a relative weight such that it does not cross zero, as\ntwo octet channels are suggested to couple to the same low-energy states with\ndifferent weights. The potential calculated from such the linear combination\nshows strong attraction without singularities, though its shape depends on the\nrelative weight. Our estimation for the binding energy in the octet channel is\n$E^{8_{s(a)}}_{\\textrm{bind}}=163(7)(^{+16} _{-64})~\\textrm{MeV}$, which is\nconsistent with 156(8) MeV estimated from the two-point correlation function\nwithin errors.",

Functionalized carbophenes have H$_2$\nadsorption energies usually observed in metal-containing materials. Further,\nthe predicted desorption temperatures of H$_2$ from carbophenes lie within the\nDOE Technical Targets for Onboard Hydrogen Storage for Light-Duty Vehicles\n(DOEHST) operating temperature range. The possibility of tailoring the degree\nof functionalization in combination with selecting sufficiently open carbophene\nstructures that allow for multiple strong interactions without steric hindrance\n(crowding) effects, added to the multiplicity of possible functional groups\nalone or in combination, suggests that these very light materials can be ideal\nadsorbates for many gases.

            "summary": "With recent advancements in observing supermassive black holes with the Event\nHorizon Telescope, there has been persistent exploration into what the images\ncan reveal about fundamental physics, including space-time geometries and\nastrophysical emission sources. Inspired by Penrose's aberration formula for a\nrigid sphere, which clarified that increased speed does not flatten the\nappearance of the sphere, we extend the studies to the behavior of the images\nof accretion emissions. This paper examines the impact of aberration effects on\nthe images of a thin accretion disk around Kerr-de Sitter black holes for\nfinite distant observers, specifically focusing on the primary, secondary, and\n$n=2$ images. We employ the analytical ray-tracing scenario and extend the\nastrometric approach to investigate the images in the presence of aberration.\nThis study is non-trivial because we do not assume a specific form of the\naberration formula, instead, all aberration effects emerge from a\ncoordinate-independent and tetrad-independent framework referred to as the\nastrometric approach. Our study finds that the shapes of the lower-order images\nget highly distorted for finite observers in motion, and the shapes and sizes\nof primary images are more sensitive to aberration than those of the $n=2$\nimages. This finding suggests that the primary images could theoretically be\ndistinguished from the shadow based on their distinctive variations.",

            "summary": "A consequence of QCD axion dark matter being born after inflation is the\nemergence of ultra-small-scale substructures known as miniclusters. Although\nminiclusters merge to form minihalos, this intrinsic granularity is expected to\nremain imprinted on small scales in our galaxy, leading to potentially damning\nconsequences for the campaign to detect axions directly on Earth. This picture,\nhowever, is modified when one takes into account the fact that encounters with\nstars will tidally strip mass from the miniclusters, creating pc-long tidal\nstreams that act to refill the dark matter distribution. Here we ask whether or\nnot this stripping rescues experimental prospects from the worst-case scenario\nin which the majority of axions remain bound up in unobservably small\nminiclusters. We find that the density sampled by the Earth on mpc-scales will\nbe, on average, around 70-90% of the known local DM density, and at a typical\npoint in the solar neighbourhood, we expect most of the dark matter to be\ncomprised of debris from $\\mathcal{O}(10^2$-$10^3)$ overlapping streams. If\nhaloscopes can measure the axion signal with high-enough frequency resolution,\nthen these streams are revealed in the form of an intrinsically spiky\nlineshape, in stark contrast with the standard assumption of a smooth,\nfeatureless Maxwellian distribution -- a unique prediction that constitutes a\nway for experiments to distinguish between pre and post-inflationary axion\ncosmologies.",

The lower pose block\nmodels short-span poses, while the upper action block models long-span action.\nThese are connected by a mid-level feature that represents sub-second series of\nhand poses.Our framework is trained across multiple datasets, where pose and\naction blocks are trained separately to fully utilize pose-action annotations\nof different qualities.

            "summary": "In his recently published article [1], P.M. Stevenson has claimed that the\n\"principle of maximum conformality (PMC) is ineffective and does nothing to\nresolve the renormalization-scheme-dependence problem\", concluding that the\nsuccesses of PMC predictions is due to the fact that the PMC is a \"laborious,\nad hoc, back-door\" version of the principle of minimum sensitivity (PMS). We\npoint out that these conclusions are incorrect, being drawn from a\nmisunderstanding of the PMC and the overestimation of the PMS. The purpose of\nthe PMC is to achieve precise fixed-order pQCD predictions, free from\nconventional renormalization-scheme and -scale ambiguities. We have\ndemonstrated that the PMC predictions satisfy all the self-consistency\nconditions of the renormalization group and standard renormalization-group\ninvariance; the PMC prediction is thus independent of any initial choice of\nrenormalization scheme and scale. Such scheme independence is also ensured by\nthe commensurate scale relations among different observables. In the $N_C\\to 0$\nAbelian limit the PMC method reduces to the well-known Gell-Mann--Low method\nfor precision calculations in Abelian QED. Owing to the elimination of the\nfactorially divergent renormalon terms, the PMC series generally has better\nconvergence behavior than the conventional series, can substantially suppress\nany residual scale dependence due to unknown higher-order terms, and thus\nprovides a reliable basis for estimating the contributions of the unknown\nhigher-order terms.

Accurate human\nmobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as\nwell as traffic or crowd management. While rich textual descriptions about\npublic events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to\nencode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing\nmethods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling\ndata sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public\nevents (LLM-MPE) based on Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their\nunprecedented ability to process textual data, learn from minimal examples, and\ngenerate human-readable explanations. Specifically, LLM-MPE first transforms\nraw, unstructured event descriptions from online sources into a standardized\nformat, and then segments historical mobility data into regular and\nevent-related components. A prompting strategy is designed to direct LLMs in\nmaking and rationalizing demand predictions considering historical mobility and\nevent features. A case study is conducted for Barclays Center in New York City,\nbased on publicly available event information and taxi trip data. Results show\nthat LLM-MPE surpasses traditional models, particularly on event days, with\ntextual data significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, LLM-MPE offers\ninterpretable insights into its predictions.

            "summary": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has great potential for molecular\nrepresentation learning given the complexity of molecular graphs, the large\namounts of unlabelled data available, the considerable cost of obtaining labels\nexperimentally, and the hence often only small training datasets. The\nimportance of the topic is reflected in the variety of paradigms and\narchitectures that have been investigated recently. Yet the differences in\nperformance seem often minor and are barely understood to date. In this paper,\nwe study SSL based on persistent homology (PH), a mathematical tool for\nmodeling topological features of data that persist across multiple scales. It\nhas several unique features which particularly suit SSL, naturally offering:\ndifferent views of the data, stability in terms of distance preservation, and\nthe opportunity to flexibly incorporate domain knowledge. We (1) investigate an\nautoencoder, which shows the general representational power of PH, and (2)\npropose a contrastive loss that complements existing approaches. We rigorously\nevaluate our approach for molecular property prediction and demonstrate its\nparticular features in improving the embedding space: after SSL, the\nrepresentations are better and offer considerably more predictive power than\nthe baselines over different probing tasks; our loss increases baseline\nperformance, sometimes largely; and we often obtain substantial improvements\nover very small datasets, a common scenario in practice.",

However, current dominant\nteacher-student based approaches can suffer from the confirmation bias. To\naddress this challenge, we propose AD-MT, an alternate diverse teaching\napproach in a teacher-student framework. It involves a single student model and\ntwo non-trainable teacher models that are momentum-updated periodically and\nrandomly in an alternate fashion. To mitigate the confirmation bias from the\ndiverse supervision, the core of AD-MT lies in two proposed modules: the Random\nPeriodic Alternate (RPA) Updating Module and the Conflict-Combating Module\n(CCM). The RPA schedules the alternating diverse updating process with\ncomplementary data batches, distinct data augmentation, and random switching\nperiods to encourage diverse reasoning from different teaching perspectives.\nThe CCM employs an entropy-based ensembling strategy to encourage the model to\nlearn from both the consistent and conflicting predictions between the\nteachers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of\nour AD-MT on the 2D and 3D medical segmentation benchmarks across various\nsemi-supervised settings.",

Effective control requires\nknowledge of the dynamics informing feedback compensation to guide the system\ntoward desired states. In many control applications this knowledge is expressed\nmathematically or through data-driven models, however, as complexity grows\nobtaining a satisfactory mathematical representation is increasingly difficult.\nFurther, many data-driven approaches consist of abstract internal\nrepresentations that may have no obvious connection to the underlying dynamics\nand control, or, require a-priori specification of functions to represent the\ndynamics. To remove these constraints we demonstrate that generalized state\nspace embedding and prediction can provide data-driven process model\nrepresentation for control of complex systems. Generalized embedding naturally\nencompasses multivariate dynamics enabling state space variable cross mapping\nfor direct assessment of multivariate contributions to the dynamics. Further,\nstate space kernel regression allows inspection of intervariable dependencies.\nTo illustrate this an agent based model is used to generate nonlinear dynamics\nwhich are then modeled by generalized state space embedding providing state\npredictions to a controller regulating the system dynamics.

Previous studies have\npredominantly addressed a single type of mobility behavior such as queueing and\na series of behaviors under specific scenarios. However, these studies ignore\nthe abstraction of mobility behavior in various scenes and the critical\nexamination of how these abstracted behaviors impact disease propagation. To\naddress these problems, this study considers people's mobility behaviors in a\ngeneral scenario, abstracting them into two main categories: crowding behavior,\nrelated to the spatial aspect, and stopping behavior, related to the temporal\naspect. Accordingly, this study investigates their impacts on disease spreading\nand the impact of individual spatio-temporal distribution resulting from these\nmobility behaviors on epidemic transmission. First, a point of interest (POI)\nmethod is introduced to quantify the crowding-related spatial POI factors\n(i.e., the number of crowdings and the distance between crowdings) and\nstopping-related temporal POI factors (i.e., the number of stoppings and the\nduration of each stopping). Besides, a personal space determined with Voronoi\ndiagrams is used to construct the individual spatio-temporal distribution\nfactor. Second, two indicators (i.e., the daily number of new cases and the\naverage exposure risk of people) are applied to quantify epidemic transmission.\nThese indicators are derived from a fundamental model which accurately predicts\ndisease transmission between moving individuals. Third, a set of 200 indoor\nscenarios is constructed and simulated to help determine variable values.\nConcurrently, the influences and underlying mechanisms of these behavioral\nfactors on disease transmission are examined using structural equation modeling\nand causal inference modeling......",

            "summary": "In this paper, we develop a generic methodology to encode hierarchical\ncausality structure among observed variables into a neural network in order to\nimprove its predictive performance. The proposed methodology, called\ncausality-informed neural network (CINN), leverages three coherent steps to\nsystematically map the structural causal knowledge into the layer-to-layer\ndesign of neural network while strictly preserving the orientation of every\ncausal relationship. In the first step, CINN discovers causal relationships\nfrom observational data via directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning, where causal\ndiscovery is recast as a continuous optimization problem to avoid the\ncombinatorial nature. In the second step, the discovered hierarchical causality\nstructure among observed variables is systematically encoded into neural\nnetwork through a dedicated architecture and customized loss function. By\ncategorizing variables in the causal DAG as root, intermediate, and leaf nodes,\nthe hierarchical causal DAG is translated into CINN with a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between nodes in the causal DAG and units in the CINN while\nmaintaining the relative order among these nodes. Regarding the loss function,\nboth intermediate and leaf nodes in the DAG graph are treated as target outputs\nduring CINN training so as to drive co-learning of causal relationships among\ndifferent types of nodes. As multiple loss components emerge in CINN, we\nleverage the projection of conflicting gradients to mitigate gradient\ninterference among the multiple learning tasks. Computational experiments\nacross a broad spectrum of UCI data sets demonstrate substantial advantages of\nCINN in predictive performance over other state-of-the-art methods. In\naddition, an ablation study underscores the value of integrating structural and\nquantitative causal knowledge in enhancing the neural network's predictive\nperformance incrementally.",

A previous attempt to address this issue considered an\nanisotropic migration model, which takes into account a polarization\norientation along which the velocity is well-defined, and a direction\northogonal to the polarization vector that describes the random walk. Although\nthe numerically and analytically calculated mean square displacement and\nauto-correlation agree with experimental data for that model, the velocity\ndistribution peaks at zero, which contradicts experimental observations of a\nconstant drift in the polarization direction. Moreover, Potts model simulations\nindicate that instantaneous velocity cannot be measured for any direction.\nHere, we consider dynamical equations for cell polarization, which is\nmeasurable and introduce a polarization-dependent displacement, circumventing\nthe problem of ill defined instantaneous velocity. Polarization is a\nwell-defined quantity, preserves memory for short intervals, and provides a\nrobust measurement procedure for characterizing cell migration. We consider\ncell polarization dynamics to follow a modified Langevin equation that yields\ncell displacement distribution that peaks at positive values, in agreement with\nexperiments and Potts model simulations.

            "summary": "Understanding whether a property is priced fairly hinders buyers and sellers\nsince they usually do not have an objective viewpoint of the price distribution\nfor the overall market of their interest. Drawing from data collected of all\npossible available properties for rent in Manhattan as of September 2023, this\npaper aims to strengthen our understanding of model residuals; specifically on\nmachine learning models which generalize for a majority of the distribution of\na well-proportioned dataset. Most models generally perceive deviations from\npredicted values as mere inaccuracies, however this paper proposes a different\nvantage point: when generalizing to at least 75\\% of the data-set, the\nremaining deviations reveal significant insights. To harness these insights, we\nintroduce the Price Anomaly Score (PAS), a metric capable of capturing\nboundaries between irregularly predicted prices. By combining relative pricing\ndiscrepancies with statistical significance, the Price Anomaly Score (PAS)\noffers a multifaceted view of rental valuations. This metric allows experts to\nidentify overpriced or underpriced properties within a dataset by aggregating\nPAS values, then fine-tuning upper and lower boundaries to any threshold to set\nindicators of choice.",

            "summary": "In the previous work of Xu & Peng (2021), we investigated the structural and\nenvironmental dependence on quenching in the nearby universe. In this work we\nextend our investigations to higher redshifts by combining galaxies from SDSS\nand ZFOURGE surveys. In low density, we find a characteristic $\\Sigma_{1\\ kpc}$\nabove which the quenching is initiated as indicated by their\npopulation-averaged color. $\\Sigma^{crit}_{1\\ kpc}$ shows only weakly\nmass-dependency at all redshifts, which suggests that the internal quenching\nprocess is more related to the physics that acts in the central region of\ngalaxies. In high density, $\\Sigma^{crit}_{1\\ kpc}$ for galaxies at $z > 1$ is\nalmost indistinguishable with their low-density counterparts. At $z < 1$,\n$\\Sigma^{crit}_{1\\ kpc}$ for low-mass galaxies becomes progressively strongly\nmass-dependent, which is due to the increasingly stronger environmental effects\nat lower redshifts. $\\Sigma^{crit}_{1\\ kpc}$ in low density shows strong\nredshift evolution with $\\sim 1$ dex decrement from $z = 2.5$ to $z = 0$. It is\nlikely due to that at a given stellar mass, the host halo is on average more\nmassive and gas-rich at higher redshifts, hence a higher level of integrated\nenergy from more massive black hole is required to quench. As the halo evolves\nfrom cold to hot accretion phase at lower redshifts, the gas is shock-heated\nand becomes more vulnerable to AGN feedback processes, as predicted by theory.\nMeanwhile, angular momentum quenching also becomes more effective at low\nredshifts, which complements a lower level of integrated energy from black hole\nto quench.",

To accelerate the discovery of next-generation\nquantum light sources, we employ a multi-scale modeling approach to study\nphase-matching conditions for collinear degenerate type-II spontaneous\nparametric down conversion (SPDC) with MOF-based one dimensional waveguides.\nUsing periodic-DFT calculations to compute the nonlinear optical properties of\nselected zinc-based MOF crystals, we predict polarization-entangled pair\ngeneration rates of $\\sim 10^3-10^6$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$mm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm,\nwhich are comparable with industry materials used in quantum optics.

At its core, SceneTex proposes a multiresolution texture\nfield to implicitly encode the mesh appearance. We optimize the target texture\nvia a score-distillation-based objective function in respective RGB renderings.\nTo further secure the style consistency across views, we introduce a\ncross-attention decoder to predict the RGB values by cross-attending to the\npre-sampled reference locations in each instance.

We find a high degree\nof redundancy between the information carried by the words and prosodic\ninformation across several prosodic features, including intensity, duration,\npauses, and pitch contours. Furthermore, a word's prosodic information is\nredundant with both the word itself and the context preceding as well as\nfollowing it.

By introducing a\nradial-dependent model of this source including viscous heating, we show that\nactive heating is needed to reproduce the steep thermal profile of dust in the\ninner disc of V883 Ori. Our disc modeling combines the effect of stellar\nirradiation and the influence on the disc shape caused by the outburst of\naccretion. The accuracy of our model is tested by comparing synthetic ALMA\nimages with continuum observations of V883 Ori, showing that the model\nsuccessfully reproduces the 1.3 mm emission of V883 Ori at high spatial\nresolution. Our final predictions underline the importance of viscous heating\nas a predominant heat source for this type of object, changing the physical\nconditions (shape and temperature) of the disc, and influencing its evolution.",

The aim of this study was to discover\nand identify urinary BFIs for onion. Methods and results: In a randomized\ncontrolled cross-over trial, 6 overweight participants (age 24-62 years)\nconsumed meals with 20 g/d onion powder or no onion for 2 weeks. Untargeted\nUPLC-qTOF-MS metabolic profiling analysis was performed on urine samples and\nthe profiles were analysed by multilevel-PLSDA, modified PLS, and nearest\nshrunken centroid to select features associated with onion intake. Eight\nbiomarkers were tentatively identified; six of them originated from\nS-substituted cysteine derivatives such as isoalliin and propiin, which are\nconsidered the most specific for onion intake. Most of the biomarkers were\ncompletely excreted within 24 hours and no accumulation was observed during 2\nweeks indicating their ability to reflect only recent intake of onions.\nReceiver-operator curves were made to evaluate the performance of individual\nbiomarkers for predicting onion intake. The area under the curve values for\nthese biomarkers ranged from 0.81 to 1. Conclusion: Promising biomarkers of\nrecent onion intake have been identified in human urine. Further studies with\ncomplex diets are needed to validate the robustness of these biomarkers.",

However, extracting\nrelevant and meaningful characteristics of a location can be challenging, often\nentailing expensive data fusion or data distillation from global imagery\ndatasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Satellite Contrastive\nLocation-Image Pretraining (SatCLIP), a global, general-purpose geographic\nlocation encoder that learns an implicit representation of locations from\nopenly available satellite imagery. Trained location encoders provide vector\nembeddings summarizing the characteristics of any given location for convenient\nusage in diverse downstream tasks. We show that SatCLIP embeddings, pretrained\non globally sampled multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite data, can be used in\nvarious predictive tasks that depend on location information but not\nnecessarily satellite imagery, including temperature prediction, animal\nrecognition in imagery, and population density estimation. Across tasks,\nSatCLIP embeddings consistently outperform embeddings from existing pretrained\nlocation encoders, ranging from models trained on natural images to models\ntrained on semantic context. SatCLIP embeddings also help to improve geographic\ngeneralization. This demonstrates the potential of general-purpose location\nencoders and opens the door to learning meaningful representations of our\nplanet from the vast, varied, and largely untapped modalities of geospatial\ndata.",

Our motivating hypothesis is that a\ntime-to-event prediction of a test patient on inference is more certain given a\nhigher feature-space-similarity to patients in the training set. Therefore, the\nuncertainty for a particular patient-of-interest is represented by the\nconcordance index between a patient similarity rank and a prediction similarity\nrank. Model uncertainty was defined as the increased percentage of the max\nuncertainty-constrained-AUC compared to the model AUC. We evaluated our method\non multiple clinically-relevant endpoints, including time to intracranial\nprogression (ICP), progression-free survival (PFS) after SRS, overall survival\n(OS), and time to ICP and/or death (ICPD), on a variety of both statistical and\nnon-statistical models, including CoxPH, conditional survival forest (CSF), and\nneural multi-task linear regression (NMTLR). Our results show that all models\nhad the lowest uncertainty on ICP (2.21%) and the highest uncertainty (17.28%)\non ICPD. OS models demonstrated high variation in uncertainty performance,\nwhere NMTLR had the lowest uncertainty(1.96%)and CSF had the highest\nuncertainty (14.29%). In conclusion, our method can estimate the uncertainty of\nindividual patient survival modeling results. As expected, our data empirically\ndemonstrate that as model uncertainty measured via our technique increases, the\nsimilarity between a feature-space and its predicted outcome decreases.",

MIRI-MRS observations of the\nlow-mass protostellar binary NGC 1333 IRAS2A are presented from the JWST\nObservations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program, revealing emission from the\nSO$_2~\\nu_3$ asymmetric stretching mode at 7.35 micron. The results are\ncompared to those derived from high-angular resolution SO$_2$ data obtained\nwith ALMA. The SO$_2$ emission from the $\\nu_3$ band is predominantly located\non $\\sim50-100$ au scales around the main component of the binary, IRAS2A1. A\nrotational temperature of $92\\pm8$ K is derived from the $\\nu_3$ lines. This is\nin good agreement with the rotational temperature derived from pure rotational\nlines in the vibrational ground state (i.e., $\\nu=0$) with ALMA ($104\\pm5$ K).\nHowever, the emission of the $\\nu_3$ lines is not in LTE given that the total\nnumber of molecules predicted by a LTE model is found to be a factor\n$2\\times10^4$ higher than what is derived for the $\\nu=0$ state. This\ndifference can be explained by a vibrational temperature that is $\\sim100$ K\nhigher than the derived rotational temperature of the $\\nu=0$ state. The\nbrightness temperature derived from the continuum around the $\\nu_3$ band of\nSO$_2$ is $\\sim180$ K, which confirms that the $\\nu_3=1$ level is not\ncollisionally populated but rather infrared pumped by scattered radiation. This\nis also consistent with the non-detection of the $\\nu_2$ bending mode at 18-20\nmicron. Given the rotational temperature, the extent of the emission ($\\sim100$\nau in radius), and the narrow line widths in the ALMA data (3.5 km/s), the\nSO$_2$ in IRAS2A likely originates from ice sublimation in the central hot core\naround the protostar rather than from an accretion shock at the disk-envelope\nboundary.",

New astronomical sky surveys will soon record unprecedented\nnumbers of transients as sparsely and irregularly sampled multivariate time\nseries. To improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms of transients\nand their progenitor systems, early-time measurements are necessary.\nPrioritizing the follow-up of transients based on their age along with their\nclass is crucial for new surveys. To meet this demand, we present the first\nmethod of predicting the age of transients in real-time from multi-wavelength\ntime-series observations. We build a Bayesian probabilistic recurrent neural\nnetwork. Our method can accurately predict the age of a transient with robust\nuncertainties as soon as it is initially triggered by a survey telescope. This\nwork will be essential for the advancement of our understanding of the numerous\nyoung transients being detected by ongoing and upcoming astronomical surveys.",

Black hole mass and spin evolution during the gas-rich binary\ninspiral are crucial in determining the direction and power of relativistic\njets that radio observations with LOFAR and SKAO will probe, and for predicting\ngravitational wave (GW) emission that IPTA and LISA will measure. We present 3D\nhydrodynamic simulations capturing gas-rich, self-gravitating CBDs around a\n$2\\times 10^6$M$_{\\odot}$ supermassive black hole binary, that probe different\nmass ratios, eccentricities and inclinations. We employ a sub-grid\nShakura-Sunyaev accretion disc to self-consistently model black hole mass and\nspin evolution together with super-Lagrangian refinement techniques to resolve\ngas flows, streams and mini-discs within the cavity, which play a fundamental\nrole in torquing and feeding the binary. We find that higher mass ratio and\neccentric binaries result in larger cavities, while retrograde binaries result\nin smaller cavities. All of the simulated binaries are expected to shrink with\nnet gravitational torques being negative. Unlike previous simulations, we do\nnot find preferential accretion onto the secondary black hole. This implies\nsmaller chirp masses at coalescence and hence a weaker GW background.\nCritically this means that spin-alignment is faster than the binary inspiral\ntimescale even for low mass ratios. However, we find that mini-disc and hence\nspin alignment is not guaranteed in initially misaligned systems, potentially\nleading to a significant fraction of recoiled remnants displaced from their\nhost galaxies if chaotic accretion is the dominant feeding channel.",

For the purpose of predicting such transport\nproperties, computational time evolution methods must be paired with schemes to\ncontrol the growth of entanglement to tractably simulate for sufficiently long\ntimes. One such truncation scheme -- dissipation-assisted operator evolution\n(DAOE) -- controls entanglement by damping out components of operators with\nlarge Pauli weight. In this paper, we generalize DAOE to treat fermionic\nsystems. Our method instead damps out components of operators with large\nfermionic weight. We investigate the performance of DAOE, the new fermionic\nDAOE (FDAOE), and another simulation method, density matrix truncation (DMT),\nin simulating energy transport in an interacting one-dimensional Majorana\nchain. The chain is found to have a diffusion coefficient scaling like\ninteraction strength to the fourth power, contrary to naive expectations based\non Fermi's Golden rule -- but consistent with recent predictions based on the\ntheory of \\emph{weak integrability breaking}. In the weak interaction regime\nwhere the fermionic nature of the system is most relevant, FDAOE is found to\nsimulate the system more efficiently than DAOE.",

However, more accurate simulations and\nobservations suggest that the SFR and ionizing luminosity in galaxies may vary\nconsiderably even if the host halo mass is the same. This astrophysical scatter\ncan introduce an additional non-Gaussianity in the cosmological [H\nI]$_{\\text{21cm}}$ signal, which is already expected to have an inherent\ntime-evolving non-Gaussianity due to reionization. Here, we have studied the\nimpact of the scatter on the [H I]$_{\\text{21cm}}$ bispectrum using\nsemi-numerical simulations. The scatter primarily affects small ionized\nregions, whereas the large ionized bubbles remain largely unaffected. Although,\nthe fractional change in the [H I]$_{\\text{21cm}}$ bispectra due to the scatter\nis found to be more than a factor of $10$ at large scales ($\\lesssim 1\\, {\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}$), it is found to be statistically not significant.

MRL has had\ngreat success with proteins and general biomolecule datasets. Yet, in the\ngrowing sub-field of glycoscience (the study of carbohydrates, where longer\ncarbohydrates are also called glycans), MRL methods have been barely explored.\nThis under-exploration can be primarily attributed to the limited availability\nof comprehensive and well-curated carbohydrate-specific datasets and a lack of\nMachine learning (ML) pipelines specifically tailored to meet the unique\nproblems presented by carbohydrate data.

Conclusion: The overall analysis\nhas led us to state that there is no one single solution available, conversely,\nmultiple methods and techniques can be put in place to guarantee safety and\nsecurity in public spaces. The techniques range from architectural design to\nrethink the design of public spaces keeping security into account in\ncontinuity, to emerging technologies such as AI and predictive surveillance.",

            "summary": "Cellular vehicular-to-everything (C-V2X) systems offer the potential for\nimproving road safety, in part through the exchange of periodic basic safety\nmessages (BSMs) between nearby vehicles. The reliability and latency of these\nmessages is a key metric. Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)\nretransmissions are one technique used to this end. However, HARQ may come at\nthe expense of consuming the limited available wireless resources, especially\nin highly congested scenarios. This paper studies BSM transmission latency and\nreliability when HARQ retransmissions are used with the semi-persistent\nscheduling (SPS) in C-V2X transmission mode 4. We do so through extensive\nsystem-level simulations that closely follow the SPS process. Furthermore, we\nprovide an analytical model for the tail behavior of the BSM latency\ndistribution with HARQ retransmissions that is a good approximation to the\nsimulation results. Our study reveals the impact of several deployment settings\n(e.g., bandwidth configurations and vehicle density).",

            "summary": "One of the main challenges in the study of time-varying networks is the\ninterplay of memory effects with structural heterogeneity. In particular,\ndifferent nodes and dyads can have very different statistical properties in\nterms of both link formation and link persistence, leading to a superposition\nof typical timescales, sub-optimal parametrizations and substantial estimation\nbiases. Here we develop an unbiased maximum-entropy framework to study\nempirical network trajectories by controlling for the observed structural\nheterogeneity and local link persistence simultaneously. An exact mapping to a\nheterogeneous version of the one-dimensional Ising model leads to an analytic\nsolution that rigorously disentangles the hidden variables that jointly\ndetermine both static and temporal properties. Additionally, model selection\nvia likelihood maximization identifies the most parsimonious structural level\n(either global, node-specific or dyadic) accounting for memory effects. As we\nillustrate on a real-world social network, this method enables an improved\nestimation of dyadic transition probabilities, relaxation times and structural\nbreaks between dynamical regimes. In the resulting picture, the graph follows a\ngeneralized configuration model with given degrees and given time-persisting\ndegrees, undergoing transitions between empirically identifiable stationary\nregimes.",

Despite decades of research, the causal link between droplet internal\nflow and particle deposition patterns has not been fully established. In this\nstudy, we employ a 3D imaging technique based on digital inline holography to\nquantitatively assess the evolution of internal flow fields and particle\nmigration in three distinct types of wetting droplets: water, sucrose aqueous\nsolution, and SDS aqueous solution droplets, throughout their entire\nevaporation process. Our imaging reveals the three-stage evolution of the 3D\ninternal flow regimes driven by changes in the relative importance of capillary\nflow, Marangoni flow, and droplet boundary movement during evaporation, each\nexhibiting unique dynamics. The migration of particles from their initial\nlocations to deposition can be divided into five categories, with particles\ndepositing either at the contact line or inside the droplet. We observe the\nchanging migration directions of particles due to competing Marangoni and\ncapillary flows during droplet evaporation. We further develop an analytical\nmodel that predicts the droplet internal flow and deposition patterns and\ndetermines the dependence of the deposition mechanisms of particles on their\ninitial locations and the evolving internal flow field. The model, validated\nusing different types of droplets from our experiment and the literature, can\nbe further expanded to other Newtonian and non-Newtonian droplets, which can\npotentially serve as a real-time assessment tool for particle deposition in\nvarious applications.",

In\nthis paper, we study bias arising from confounders in a causal graph for\nmultimodal data and examine a novel approach that leverages causally-motivated\ninformation minimization to learn the confounder representations. Robust\npredictive features contain diverse information that helps a model generalize\nto out-of-distribution data. Hence, minimizing the information content of\nfeatures obtained from a pretrained biased model helps learn the simplest\npredictive features that capture the underlying data distribution. We treat\nthese features as confounder representations and use them via methods motivated\nby causal theory to remove bias from models. We find that the learned\nconfounder representations indeed capture dataset biases, and the proposed\ndebiasing methods improve out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on multiple\nmultimodal datasets without sacrificing in-distribution performance.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel metric to quantify the sufficiency of\nspurious features in models' predictions that further demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our proposed methods.

In particular, the delicacy of critical systems\nto perturbations can make them ideal sensors. Arguably the simplest realistic\nprobe system is a spin-1/2 impurity, which can be manipulated and measured\nin-situ when embedded in a fermionic environment. Although entanglement between\na single impurity probe and its environment produces nontrivial many-body\neffects, criticality cannot be leveraged for sensing. Here we introduce instead\nthe two-impurity Kondo (2IK) model as a novel paradigm for critical quantum\nmetrology, and examine the multiparameter estimation scenario at finite\ntemperature. We explore the full metrological phase diagram numerically and\nobtain exact analytic results near criticality. Enhanced sensitivity to the\ninter-impurity coupling driving a second-order phase transition is evidenced by\ndiverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) and quantum signal-to-noise ratio\n(QSNR). However, with uncertainty in both coupling strength and temperature,\nthe multiparameter QFI matrix becomes singular -- even though the parameters to\nbe estimated are independent -- resulting in vanishing QSNRs. We demonstrate\nthat by applying a known control field, the singularity can be removed and\nmeasurement sensitivity restored. For general systems, we show that the\ndegradation in the QSNR due to uncertainties in another parameter is controlled\nby the degree of correlation between the unknown parameters.",

            "summary": "Heavy quarks, produced at early stages of heavy-ion collisions, are an\nexcellent probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) also created in these\ncollisions. Electrons from open heavy-flavor hadron decays (HFE) are good\nproxies for heavy quarks, and have been measured extensively in the last two\ndecades to study QGP properties. These measurements are traditionally carried\nout by subtracting all known background sources from the inclusive electron\nsample. More recently, a significant enhancement of $e^+e^-$ pair production at\nvery low transverse momenta was observed in peripheral heavy-ion collisions.\nThe production characteristics is consistent with coherent photon-photon\ninteractions, which should also constitute a background source to the HFE\nmeasurements. In this article, we provide theoretical predictions for the\ncontribution of coherent electron production to HFE as a function of transverse\nmomentum, centrality and collision energy in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions.",

            "summary": "Dexterous grasping aims to produce diverse grasping postures with a high\ngrasping success rate. Regression-based methods that directly predict grasping\nparameters given the object may achieve a high success rate but often lack\ndiversity. Generation-based methods that generate grasping postures conditioned\non the object can often produce diverse grasping, but they are insufficient for\nhigh grasping success due to lack of discriminative information. To mitigate,\nwe introduce a unified diffusion-based dexterous grasp generation model, dubbed\nthe name UGG, which operates within the object point cloud and hand parameter\nspaces. Our all-transformer architecture unifies the information from the\nobject, the hand, and the contacts, introducing a novel representation of\ncontact points for improved contact modeling. The flexibility and quality of\nour model enable the integration of a lightweight discriminator, benefiting\nfrom simulated discriminative data, which pushes for a high success rate while\npreserving high diversity. Beyond grasp generation, our model can also generate\nobjects based on hand information, offering valuable insights into object\ndesign and studying how the generative model perceives objects. Our model\nachieves state-of-the-art dexterous grasping on the large-scale DexGraspNet\ndataset while facilitating human-centric object design, marking a significant\nadvancement in dexterous grasping research.

Our experiments show that SVBP\nrepresents multi-modal distributions better than sampling-based or Gaussian\nbaselines, resulting in improved performance on perception and planning tasks.\nFurthermore, we show that SVBP's ability to represent diverse trajectories for\ndecentralized multi-robot planning makes it less prone to deadlock scenarios\nthan leading baselines.",

Timely transmission of BSMs is crucial to avoid stale\ninformation at VUEs. However, successive packet losses can lead to large\ninter-packet gaps (IPGs), reducing the BSMs' reliability. This paper\ninvestigates the tail behavior of IPG and information age (IA) distributions in\nC-V2X mode 4, a decentralized resource allocation method based on\nsemi-persistent scheduling (SPS). We study the improvements and trade-offs\nintroduced by SAE one-shot transmission to decrease the number of successive\nBSM losses at destination VUEs. The study employs high-fidelity system-level\nsimulations that closely follow the SPS process of CV2X mode 4 to evaluate the\nperformance of interleaved one-shot SPS transmissions. The numerical results\ndemonstrate significant improvement in the IPG and IA tail distributions in\nvarious simulation scenarios. Additionally, we propose an accurate analytical\nmodel to characterize the IPG tail behavior of C-V2X BSM transmissions. The\nproposed model is validated by comparing its results with those obtained using\nthe system-level simulations. Our validation shows that the proposed model\ngenerates analytical results that coincide with the asymptotic slopes of IPG\ndistribution in different BSM transmission modes.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach EBRec, short of\nEnhanced Bundle Recommendation, which incorporates two enhanced modules to\nexplore inherent item-level bundle representations. First, we propose to\nincorporate the bundle-user-item (B-U-I) high-order correlations to explore\nmore collaborative information, thus to enhance the previous bundle\nrepresentation that solely relies on the bundle-item affiliation information.\nSecond, we further enhance the B-U-I correlations by augmenting the observed\nuser-item interactions with interactions generated from pre-trained models,\nthus improving the item-level bundle representations. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets, and the results justify the effectiveness\nof our approach as well as the two core modules.

The most successful\napproaches to date for solving these impurity problems are the various\ncontinuous time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. Here, we consider perhaps the\nsimplest realization of multi-orbital physics: the bilayer Hubbard model on an\ninfinite-coordination Bethe lattice. Despite its simplicity, the majority of\nthis model's phase diagram cannot be predicted by using traditional Monte Carlo\nmethods. We show that these limitations can be largely circumvented by recently\nintroduced Inchworm Monte Carlo techniques.

            "summary": "The evolved stages of massive stars are poorly understood, but invaluable\nconstraints can be derived from spatially resolved observations of nearby red\nsupergiants, such as Betelgeuse. ALMA observations of Betelgeuse showing a\ndipolar velocity field have been interpreted as evidence for a rotation rate of\n$v\\sin i \\sim 5\\, \\mathrm{km\\, s^{-1}}$. This is two orders of magnitude larger\nthan predicted by single-star evolution, leading to the suggestion that\nBetelgeuse is a binary merger product. We propose instead that the velocity\nfield could be due to large-scale convective motions. The resulting surface\nvelocity maps can sometimes be mistaken for rotation, especially when the\nturbulent motions are only partially resolved, as is the case for the current\nALMA beam. We support this claim with 3D CO5BOLD simulations of non-rotating\nred supergiants post-processed to predict synthetic ALMA images and SiO spectra\nto compare with observed radial velocity maps. Our simulations show a $\\sim\n50\\%$ chance to be interpreted as evidence for a rotation rate as high as\nclaimed for Betelgeuse. We conclude that we need at least another ALMA\nobservation to firmly establish whether Betelgeuse is indeed rapidly rotating.\nSuch observations would also provide insight into the role of angular momentum\nand binary interaction in the late evolutionary stages. The data will further\nprobe the structure and complex physical processes in the atmospheres of red\nsupergiants, which are immediate progenitors of supernovae and are believed to\nbe essential in the formation of gravitational wave sources.",

This\nstrategy blends diverse dependency relations prior to the application of GNNs,\nenhancing robustness against parsing errors while avoiding extra computational\nburdens. SynthFusion circumvents the pitfalls of overparameterization and\ndiminishes the risk of overfitting, prevalent in models with stacked GNN\nlayers, by optimizing graph connectivity. Our empirical evaluations on the\nSemEval14 and Twitter14 datasets affirm that SynthFusion not only outshines\nmodels reliant on single dependency trees but also eclipses alternative\nensemble techniques, achieving this without an escalation in model complexity.",

In CTR prediction, most models use binary\ncross-entropy loss function. However, it does not focus on the data\ndistribution shifts occurring over time. To address this problem, we propose a\nfactor for the loss functions by utilizing the sequential nature of user-item\ninteractions. This approach aims to focus on the most recent samples by\npenalizing them more through the loss function without forgetting the long-term\ninformation.

We interpret these features in the context of inside-out galaxy\nformation theories and dynamical models of spiral structure. We confirm the\ngalaxy's radial age gradient, with the mean stellar age decreasing with radius.\nIn the relatively undisturbed main disk, we find that stellar ages get\nprogressively older with distance across a spiral arm, consistent with the\nlarge-scale shock scenario in a quasi-steady spiral wave pattern. Unexpectedly,\nwe find the same pattern across spiral arms in the outer disk as well, beyond\nthe corotation radius of the main spiral pattern. We suggest that M101 has a\ndynamic, or transient, spiral pattern with multiple pattern speeds joined\ntogether via mode coupling to form coherent spiral structure.

            "summary": "The adoption of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in several human-centred\napplications provides robots with autonomous decision-making capabilities and\nadaptability based on the observations of the operating environment. In such\nscenarios, however, the learning process can make robots' behaviours unclear\nand unpredictable to humans, thus preventing a smooth and effective Human-Robot\nInteraction (HRI). As a consequence, it becomes crucial to avoid robots\nperforming actions that are unclear to the user. In this work, we investigate\nwhether including human preferences in RL (concerning the actions the robot\nperforms during learning) improves the transparency of a robot's behaviours.\nFor this purpose, a shielding mechanism is included in the RL algorithm to\ninclude human preferences and to monitor the learning agent's decisions. We\ncarried out a within-subjects study involving 26 participants to evaluate the\nrobot's transparency in terms of Legibility, Predictability, and Expectability\nin different settings. Results indicate that considering human preferences\nduring learning improves Legibility with respect to providing only\nExplanations, and combining human preferences with explanations elucidating the\nrationale behind the robot's decisions further amplifies transparency. Results\nalso confirm that an increase in transparency leads to an increase in the\nsafety, comfort, and reliability of the robot. These findings show the\nimportance of transparency during learning and suggest a paradigm for robotic\napplications with human in the loop.",

The predicted reaction cross sections, as a function of the\ncenter-of-mass energy $E_{\\rm cm}$, show prominent resonances, including the\nHoyle resonance. The positions and widths of these resonances are sensitive to\nthe target deformation ($\\beta_2$ parameter) and the parity of the nuclear\nsurface potential $-$ deeper for the even-parity $L$ partial waves relative to\nthose for the odd-parity $L$ partial waves at the surface region because of the\nBose-Einstein exchange of the $\\alpha$-bosons. Decomposing the reaction cross\nsections to different partial waves, we find that the resonance energies and\nwidths reasonably agree with the available experimental data and previous\nhyperspherical calculations for the $0_2^+$ (Hoyle state), $0_3^+$, $1_1^-$ and\n$3_1^-$ states of $^{12}$C, except for the narrow theoretical width of the\n$2_2^+$ state. Analyzing the wavefunctions and the resonance widths, we\nidentify the narrow and sharp $0_2^+$, $3_1^-$ and $2_2^+$ resonances as pocket\nresonances -- resonances which occur below the potential barrier, while the\nbroad $0_3^+$ and $1_1^-$ resonances as above-the-barrier resonances. For\nastrophysical applications, we also evaluate the astrophysical $S(E_{\\rm\ncm})$-factor for $E_{\\rm cm}$ $<$ 1.0 MeV, for the fusion of $\\alpha$+$^8$Be\ninto the $^{12}$C$(2^+)$ state based on our estimated $s$-wave $\\alpha$+$^8$Be\nreaction cross section and the associated $\\gamma$- and $\\alpha$-decay widths\nfor the decay of $^{12}$C excited states in the potential pocket.",

Although deep learning models have shown excellent\npredictive performance for time series, they have been criticised for being\n\"black-boxes\" or non-interpretable. This paper proposes a novel modular neural\nnetwork model for multivariate time series prediction that is interpretable by\nconstruction. A recurrent neural network learns the temporal dependencies in\nthe data while an attention-based feature selection component selects the most\nrelevant features and suppresses redundant features used in the learning of the\ntemporal dependencies. A modular deep network is trained from the selected\nfeatures independently to show the users how features influence outcomes,\nmaking the model interpretable. Experimental results show that this approach\ncan outperform state-of-the-art interpretable Neural Additive Models (NAM) and\nvariations thereof in both regression and classification of time series tasks,\nachieving a predictive performance that is comparable to the top\nnon-interpretable methods for time series, LSTM and XGBoost.",

The sequential model uses 3D Swin-Transformers for\nspatio-temporal encoding and 3D U-Nets as prediction heads for individual parts\nof the decomposition.

This study presents an innovative design solution for a\nreversible omnidirectional mobile robot denoted as CuRobot, featuring a cube\nstructure, thereby facilitating uninterrupted omnidirectional movement even in\nthe event of flipping. The incorporation of eight conical wheels at the cube\nvertices ensures consistent omnidirectional motion no matter which face of the\ncube contacts the ground. Additionally, a kinematic model is formulated for\nCuRobot, accompanied by the development of a trajectory tracking controller\nutilizing model predictive control. Through simulation experiments, the\ncorrelation between trajectory tracking accuracy and the robot's motion\ndirection is examined. Furthermore, the robot's proficiency in omnidirectional\nmobility and sustained movement post-flipping is substantiated via both\nsimulation and prototype experiments. This design reduces the inefficiencies\nassociated with manual intervention, thereby increasing the operational\nrobustness of robots in field environments.",

In two-dimensional materials, a wide variety of tuning knobs\npresents extraordinary opportunities for engineering symmetry breaking, leading\nto the emergence and manipulation of novel physical properties. Recently,\ntetralayer graphene with ABCB stacking order is predicted to possess atypical\nelemental ferroelectricity arising from the symmetry breaking induced by its\nspecific stacking configuration. Experimentally unveiling the stacking-order\ndependent symmetry in tetralayer graphene is crucial to understand the\nintricate properties in the emergent graphene allotropes. Here, we observe\npronounced nonlinear optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in ABCB-stacked\ntetralayer graphene, but absent in both ABAB- and ABCA-stacked allotropes. Our\nresults provide direct evidence of symmetry breaking in ABCB-stacked tetralayer\ngraphene. The remarkable contrast in the SHG spectra of tetralayer graphene\nallows straightforward identification of ABCB domains from the other two kinds\nof stacking order and facilitates the characterization of their crystalline\norientation. The employed SHG technique serves as a convenient tool for\nexploring the intriguing physics and novel nonlinear optics in ABCB-stacked\ngraphene, where spontaneous polarization and intrinsic gapped flat bands\ncoexist. Our results establish ABCB-stacked graphene as a unique platform for\nstudying the rare ferroelectricity in non-centrosymmetric elemental structures.",

            "summary": "Remote sensing visual question answering (RSVQA) opens new opportunities for\nthe use of overhead imagery by the general public, by enabling human-machine\ninteraction with natural language. Building on the recent advances in natural\nlanguage processing and computer vision, the goal of RSVQA is to answer a\nquestion formulated in natural language about a remote sensing image. Language\nunderstanding is essential to the success of the task, but has not yet been\nthoroughly examined in RSVQA. In particular, the problem of language biases is\noften overlooked in the remote sensing community, which can impact model\nrobustness and lead to wrong conclusions about the performances of the model.\nThus, the present work aims at highlighting the problem of language biases in\nRSVQA with a threefold analysis strategy: visual blind models, adversarial\ntesting and dataset analysis. This analysis focuses both on model and data.\nMoreover, we motivate the use of more informative and complementary evaluation\nmetrics sensitive to the issue. The gravity of language biases in RSVQA is then\nexposed for all of these methods with the training of models discarding the\nimage data and the manipulation of the visual input during inference. Finally,\na detailed analysis of question-answer distribution demonstrates the root of\nthe problem in the data itself. Thanks to this analytical study, we observed\nthat biases in remote sensing are more severe than in standard VQA, likely due\nto the specifics of existing remote sensing datasets for the task, e.g.\ngeographical similarities and sparsity, as well as a simpler vocabulary and\nquestion generation strategies. While new, improved and less-biased datasets\nappear as a necessity for the development of the promising field of RSVQA, we\ndemonstrate that more informed, relative evaluation metrics remain much needed\nto transparently communicate results of future RSVQA methods.",

In this paper, we develop\na comprehensive model which uses this data to predict Wordle player performance\nand reporting given any word and date. To do so, we first decompose words into\nquantifiable traits associated with relevant difficulty characteristics. Most\nnotably, we formulate a novel Wordle-specific entropy measure which quantifies\nthe average amount of information revealed by typical players after initial\nguesses. We also develop a method to represent the distribution of player\nattempts, and hence the observed difficulty of a word, using just two values\ncorresponding to the cumulative mass function of the Beta distribution.\nConsequently, we are able to use a preliminary Lasso regression to isolate the\nmost relevant predictors of word difficulty, which we then use in a Bayesian\nmodel.\n  For a given word and date, our Bayesian model predicts the distribution of\nthe number of guesses by players (i.e. the reported player performance), the\nnumber of player reports, and the number of players reporting playing in\nhard-mode. To accomplish these three tasks, it is made up of three submodels\nwhich are conditionally independent given the data, making it efficient to\nsample from its posterior using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Our model is\nable to predict outcomes for new data and retrodict for old data, and we\nempirically demonstrate the success of our model through retrodictions on\nunseen data. Most notably, our model does not just provide such simple point\nestimates and prediction intervals, but full posterior distributions.",

In this scenario,\nmodels must learn to avoid making predictions when label confidence is low,\nespecially when tested with samples far removed from the training set\n(covariate shift). Such uncertain cases are typically referred to the clinician\nfor further analysis and evaluation. Yet, we show that even state-of-the-art\ndomain generalization approaches fail severely during referral when tested on\nmedical images acquired from a different demographic or using a different\ntechnology. We examine two benchmark diagnostic medical imaging datasets\nexhibiting strong covariate shifts: i) diabetic retinopathy prediction with\nretinal fundus images and ii) multilabel disease prediction with chest X-ray\nimages. We show that predictive uncertainty estimates do not generalize well\nunder covariate shifts leading to non-monotonic referral curves, and severe\ndrops in performance (up to 50%) at high referral rates (>70%). We evaluate\nnovel combinations of robust generalization and post hoc referral approaches,\nthat rescue these failures and achieve significant performance improvements,\ntypically >10%, over baseline methods.

            "summary": "Nonlocality is the defining feature of quantum entanglement. Entangled states\nwith multiple particles are of crucial importance in fundamental tests of\nquantum physics as well as in many quantum information tasks. One of the\narchetypal multipartite quantum states, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nstate, allows one to observe the striking conflict of quantum physics to local\nrealism in the so-called all-versus-nothing way. This is profoundly different\nfrom Bell's theorem for two particles, which relies on statistical predictions.\nHere, we demonstrate an integrated photonic chip capable of generating and\nmanipulating the four-photon GHZ state. We perform a complete characterization\nof the four-photon GHZ state using quantum state tomography and obtain a state\nfidelity of 0.729(6). We further use the all-versus-nothing test and the Mermin\ninequalities to witness the quantum nonlocality of GHZ entanglement. Our work\npaves the way to perform fundamental tests of quantum physics with complex\nintegrated quantum devices.",

However, we are only at the very onset of this subject of study.\nIt is still unclear how the potential of LLMs will materialise in research\npractice. With this study, we give first empirical evidence on the use of LLMs\nin the research process. We have investigated a set of use cases for LLM-based\ntools in scientific research, and conducted a first study to assess to which\ndegree current tools are helpful. In this paper we report specifically on use\ncases related to software engineering, such as generating application code and\ndeveloping scripts for data analytics. While we studied seemingly simple use\ncases, results across tools differ significantly. Our results highlight the\npromise of LLM-based tools in general, yet we also observe various issues,\nparticularly regarding the integrity of the output these tools provide.",

            "summary": "Interstitial diffusion is a pivotal process that governs the phase stability\nand irradiation response of materials in non-equilibrium conditions. In this\nwork, we study sluggish and chemically-biased interstitial diffusion in Fe-Ni\nconcentrated solid solution alloys (CSAs) by combining machine learning (ML)\nand kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC), where ML is used to accurately and efficiently\npredict the migration energy barriers on-the-fly. The ML-kMC reproduces the\ndiffusivity that was reported by molecular dynamics results at high\ntemperatures. With this powerful tool, we find that the observed sluggish\ndiffusion and the \"Ni-Ni-Ni\"-biased diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys are ascribed to a\nunique \"Barrier Lock\" mechanism, whereas the \"Fe-Fe-Fe\"-biased diffusion is\ninfluenced by a \"Component Dominance\" mechanism. Inspired by the mentioned\nmechanisms, a practical AvgS-kMC method is proposed for conveniently and\nswiftly determining interstitial-mediated diffusivity by only relying on the\nmean energy barriers of migration patterns. Combining the AvgS-kMC with the\ndifferential evolutionary algorithm, an inverse design strategy for optimizing\nsluggish diffusion properties is applied to emphasize the crucial role of\nfavorable migration patterns.",

            "summary": "We present a noteworthy transient event in the optical light curves of\nztf18aanlzzf (SDSS J161259.83+421940.3), identified as a Narrow Line Seyfert 1\n(NLS1) exhibiting merging patterns in the optical image. The 16-year long-term\narchived light curve revealed that this target stays in a steady state, while\nthree flares occurred within the past 5 years with time separations ranging\nfrom 1 year to 3.5 years. The flare patterns of rapid brightening and slow\ndecline following the peak, coupled with distinctive spectral features with\nstrong He {\\sc ii} and rare appearance of Bowen fluorescence line emissions,\nindicate at least two Tidal Eruption Event (TDE) flares in ztf18aanlzzf with a\ntime separation of 3.5 years. We also apply TiDE light curve modeling and yield\na Black Hole (BH) mass of $\\sim 10^{6}\\ M_{\\odot}$, which is consistent with\nthe BH mass measured from single-epoch spectra. Besides, the observed time lags\n$3.90_{-2.00}^{+2.06}$ days between the g and r bands strongly disagree with\nthe prediction of the standard accretion disk model, highlighting the intricate\ninteraction in the inner region related to the TDE. The reoccurrence gap of\nthese TDEs, surpassing the previously reported repeated TDEs, can be attributed\nto binary star tidal disruption by a binary SMBH. Notably, the frequent TDE\nflares observed in this ULIRG-like target align with findings in a previous\nreport for another ULIRG, suggesting a potentially elevated TDE rate in ULIRGs.\nSystematic variability studies of ULIRGs may help verify whether ULIRGs indeed\nhave higher TDE rates.",

However, due to the complex composition and porous structure of\ncancellous bone, the PA signals generated and propagated in cancellous bone are\ncomplex and difficult to be directly used in cancellous bone analysis. In this\npaper, a photoacoustic differential attenuation spectrum (PA-DAS) method is\nproposed. By eliminating the PA spectrum of the optical absorption sources, the\npropagation attenuation characteristics of cancellous bone are studied\ntheoretically and experimentally. An analytical solution for the propagation\nattenuation of broadband ultrasound waves in cancellous bone is given by\napplying high-frequency and viscous corrections to Biot's theory. An\nexperimental system of PA-DAS with an eccentric excitation differential\ndetection system is established to obtain the PA-DAS of cancellous bone and its\nacoustic propagation characteristic on the rabbit osteoporosis model. The\nPA-DAS quantization parameter slope is further extracted to quantify the\nattenuation of high and low frequency components. The results show that the\nPA-DAS can distinguish osteoporotic bone from normal bone, enabling\nquantitative assessment of bone mineral density and the diagnosis of\nosteoporosis.",

The eigenvalues of the\nMarkovian process are related to cut sets in the contact graph between nodes\nwith different viral states.
