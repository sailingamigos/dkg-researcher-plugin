In order to account for the performance loss\ncaused by the spherical wavefront of ELAA in the mobility scenario, we propose\na wavefront transformation-based matrix pencil (WTMP) channel prediction\nmethod. In particular, we design a matrix to transform the spherical wavefront\ninto a new wavefront, which is closer to the plane wave. We also design a\ntime-frequency projection matrix to capture the time-varying path delay due to\nuser movement. Furthermore, we adopt the matrix pencil (MP) method to estimate\nchannel parameters. Our proposed WTMP method can mitigate the effect of\nnear-field radiation when predicting future channels. Theoretical analysis\nshows that the designed matrix is asymptotically determined by the distance\nbetween the base station (BS) antenna array and the scatterers or the user when\nthe number of BS antennas is large enough. For an ELAA communication system in\nthe mobility scenario, we prove that the prediction error converges to zero\nwith the increasing number of BS antennas. Simulation results demonstrate that\nour designed transform matrix efficiently mitigates the near-field effect, and\nthat our proposed WTMP method can overcome the ELAA mobility challenge and\napproach the performance in stationary setting.",

Machine learning, which reduces the reliance on such assumptions,\ncan be used to determine how well present-day observations can yield\npredictions for the distributions of stellar and dark matter. In this work, we\nuse a general sample of galaxies from the TNG100 simulation to investigate the\nability of multi-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) based machine\nlearning methods to predict the central (i.e., within $1-2$ effective radii)\nstellar and total masses, and the stellar mass-to-light ratio $M_*/L$. These\nmodels take galaxy images and spatially-resolved mean velocity and velocity\ndispersion maps as inputs. Such CNN-based models can in general break the\ndegeneracy between baryonic and dark matter in the sense that the model can\nmake reliable predictions on the individual contributions of each component.\nFor example, with $r$-band images and two galaxy kinematic maps as inputs, our\nmodel predicting $M_*/L$ has a prediction uncertainty of 0.04 dex. Moreover, to\ninvestigate which (global) features significantly contribute to the correct\npredictions of the properties above, we utilize a gradient boosting machine. We\nfind that galaxy luminosity dominates the prediction of all masses in the\ncentral regions, with stellar velocity dispersion coming next. We also\ninvestigate the main contributing features when predicting stellar and dark\nmatter mass fractions ($f_*$, $f_{\\rm DM}$) and the dark matter mass $M_{DM}$,\nand discuss the underlying astrophysics.",

            "summary": "Current subject-driven image generation methods encounter significant\nchallenges in person-centric image generation. The reason is that they learn\nthe semantic scene and person generation by fine-tuning a common pre-trained\ndiffusion, which involves an irreconcilable training imbalance. Precisely, to\ngenerate realistic persons, they need to sufficiently tune the pre-trained\nmodel, which inevitably causes the model to forget the rich semantic scene\nprior and makes scene generation over-fit to the training data. Moreover, even\nwith sufficient fine-tuning, these methods can still not generate high-fidelity\npersons since joint learning of the scene and person generation also lead to\nquality compromise. In this paper, we propose Face-diffuser, an effective\ncollaborative generation pipeline to eliminate the above training imbalance and\nquality compromise. Specifically, we first develop two specialized pre-trained\ndiffusion models, i.e., Text-driven Diffusion Model (TDM) and Subject-augmented\nDiffusion Model (SDM), for scene and person generation, respectively. The\nsampling process is divided into three sequential stages, i.e., semantic scene\nconstruction, subject-scene fusion, and subject enhancement. The first and last\nstages are performed by TDM and SDM respectively. The subject-scene fusion\nstage, that is the collaboration achieved through a novel and highly effective\nmechanism, Saliency-adaptive Noise Fusion (SNF). Specifically, it is based on\nour key observation that there exists a robust link between classifier-free\nguidance responses and the saliency of generated images. In each time step, SNF\nleverages the unique strengths of each model and allows for the spatial\nblending of predicted noises from both models automatically in a saliency-aware\nmanner. Extensive experiments confirm the impressive effectiveness and\nrobustness of the Face-diffuser.",

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) can\nconstruct a hierarchical sequence of maximal correlations of up to two paired\ndata sets in these Euclidean spaces. We present a method to generalize this\nconcept to Lie Manifolds and demonstrate its efficacy through the substantial\nimprovements it achieves in making structure-consistent predictions about\nchanges in the state of a robotic hand.",

            "summary": "Recently, the selection of machine learning model based on only the data\ndistribution without concerning the noise of the data. This study aims to\ndistinguish, which models perform well under noisy data, and establish whether\nstacking machine learning models actually provide robustness to otherwise\nweak-to-noise models. The electrochemical data were tested with 12 standalone\nmodels and stacking model. This includes XGB, LGBM, RF, GB, ADA, NN, ELAS,\nLASS, RIDGE, SVM, KNN, DT, and the stacking model. It is found that linear\nmodels handle noise well with the average error of (slope) to 1.75 F g-1 up to\nerror per 100% percent noise added; but it suffers from prediction accuracy due\nto having an average of 60.19 F g-1 estimated at minimal error at 0% noise\nadded. Tree-based models fail in terms of noise handling (average slope is\n55.24 F g-1 at 100% percent noise), but it can provide higher prediction\naccuracy (lowest error of 23.9 F g-1) than that of linear. To address the\ncontroversial between prediction accuracy and error handling, the stacking\nmodel was constructed, which is not only show high accuracy (intercept of 25.03\nF g-1), but it also exhibits good noise handling (slope of 43.58 F g-1), making\nstacking models a relatively low risk and viable choice for beginner and\nexperienced machine learning research in electrochemistry. Even though neural\nnetworks (NN) are gaining popularity in the electrochemistry field. However,\nthis study presents that NN is not suitable for electrochemical data, and\nimproper tuning resulting in a model that is susceptible to noise. Thus, STACK\nmodels should provide better benefits in that even with untuned base models,\nthey can achieve an accurate and noise-tolerant model. Overall, this work\nprovides insight into machine learning model selection for electrochemical\ndata, which should aid the understanding of data science in chemistry context.",

Next, we introduced the cycle\nconsistency constraints to enforce that initial cellular state subjected to\ndrug perturbations would produce the perturbed cellular responses, and,\nconversely, removal of drug perturbation from the perturbed cellular states\nwould restore the initial cellular states. The cycle consistency constraints\nand linear modeling in latent space enable to learn interpretable and\ntransferable drug perturbation representations, so that our model can predict\ncellular response to unseen drugs.

To address\nthese difficulties and cater to this need, we present MPSeg, an innovative\nmulti-phase strategy designed for coronary artery segmentation. Our approach\nspecifically accommodates these structural complexities and adheres to the\nprinciples of the SYNTAX Score.

Specialized ensemble\nmodels are then deployed for each category to execute the challenging\nsegmentation task. Due to LCA's higher complexity over RCA, a refinement model\nis utilized to scrutinize and correct initial class predictions on segmented\nareas.

We exploit the extracted\nfeatures for the metastatic nodules and surrounding tissue to train a prognosis\nmodel. In parallel, we train a vision Transformer (ViT) in a knowledge\ndistillation framework to replicate and enhance the performance of the\nprognosis prediction.

Each stochastic\ntrajectory starts from a positive position $x_0$ and terminates whenever the\nparticle hits the origin for the first time. By deriving the exit probability\nof the particle confined in an interval $\\left[0, M \\right] $ through zero, we\nobtain the exact expression for the marginal distribution $P_r(M|x_0)$ of the\nmaximum displacement $M$. Stochastic resetting has a profound impact on\n$P_r(M|x_0)$ and the expected value $\\langle M \\rangle$ of $M$. Depending on\nthe drift velocity $v$, $\\langle M \\rangle$ shows three distinct trends of\nchange with $r$. For $v \\geq 0$, $\\langle M \\rangle$ decreases monotonically\nwith $r$, and tends to $2x_0$ as $r \\to \\infty$. For $v_c<v<0$, $\\langle M\n\\rangle$ shows a nonmonotonic dependence on $r$, in which a minimum $\\langle M\n\\rangle$ exists for an intermediate level of $r$. For $v\\leq v_c$, $\\langle M\n\\rangle$ increases monotonically with $r$. Moreover, by deriving the propagator\nand using path decomposition technique, we obtain in the Laplace domain the\njoint distribution of $M$ and the time $t_m$ at which the maximum $M$ is\nreached. Interestingly, the dependence of the expected value $\\langle t_m\n\\rangle$ of $t_m$ on $r$ is either monotonic or nonmonotonic, depending on the\nvalue of $v$. For $v>v_m$, there is a nonzero resetting rate at which $\\langle\nt_m \\rangle$ attains its minimum. Otherwise, $\\langle t_m \\rangle$ increases\nmonotonically with $r$. We provide an analytical determination of two critical\nvalues of $v$, $v_c\\approx -1.69415 D/x_0$ and $v_m\\approx -1.66102 D/x_0$,\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion constant.

Our\nevaluation across several settings in image and language benchmarks shows that\nFedFish outperforms FedAvg as local training epochs increase. Further, FedFish\nresults in global networks that are more amenable to efficient personalization\nvia local fine-tuning on the same or shifted data distributions.

In this study, we\nemploy attention mechanisms (AM) to develop data-driven models for predicting\nLIB lifespan using easily measurable inputs such as voltage, current,\ntemperature, and capacity data. The developed model integrates recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) components, featuring two\ntypes of attention mechanisms: temporal attention (TA) and cyclic attention\n(CA). The inclusion of TA aims to identify important time steps within each\ncycle by scoring the hidden states of the RNN, whereas CA strives to capture\nkey features of inter-cycle correlations through self-attention (SA). This\nenhances model accuracy and elucidates critical features in the input data. To\nvalidate our method, we apply it to publicly available cycling data consisting\nof three batches of cycling modes. The calculated TA scores highlight the rest\nphase as a key characteristic distinguishing LIB data among different batches.\nAdditionally, CA scores reveal variations in the importance of cycles across\nbatches.

            "summary": "We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial\ncomplexes, which we call \\emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs).\nOur construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial\ncomplexes, i.e., the $\\kappa$-GHWT and $\\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently\ndeveloped for simplices of dimension $\\kappa \\in \\N$ in a given simplicial\ncomplex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT)\nand Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\\kappa$-GHWT and\nthe $\\kk$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale\nbasis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal.\nOur MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The\nresulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node\npermutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis\ndictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to\nlocal pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale.\nThese pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering\nnetworks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on\nDiffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of\ndescriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine\nlearning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to\nachieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train\nthan most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness\nof our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain\n(i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.",

This can\nserve as a viable model for analysis of elastic instability occurring due to\nfluid-structure interaction of structural components submerged in fluids and\ngases. A linear model with appropriate boundary conditions is developed using\nthe energy formulation. The characteristic equation of the linear model\nestablishes the relationship between the pulsation of the beam and the\nmagnitude of applied follower force. The evolution of temporal eigenvalues with\nrespect to the magnitude of the follower force helps in evaluation of the\ncritical follower forces responsible for different modes of instability. The\npresented model demonstrates the existence of only dynamic instability in the\nsystem. Furthermore, the model predicts that both types of the dynamic\ninstability i.e., flutter and divergence, are possible in the system.",

            "summary": "Modeling environmental ecosystems is critical for the sustainability of our\nplanet, but is extremely challenging due to the complex underlying processes\ndriven by interactions amongst a large number of physical variables. As many\nvariables are difficult to measure at large scales, existing works often\nutilize a combination of observable features and locally available measurements\nor modeled values as input to build models for a specific study region and time\nperiod. This raises a fundamental question in advancing the modeling of\nenvironmental ecosystems: how to build a general framework for modeling the\ncomplex relationships amongst various environmental data over space and time?\nIn this paper, we introduce a new framework, FREE, which maps available\nenvironmental data into a text space and then converts the traditional\npredictive modeling task in environmental science to the semantic recognition\nproblem. The proposed FREE framework leverages recent advances in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to supplement the original input features with natural\nlanguage descriptions. This facilitates capturing the data semantics and also\nallows harnessing the irregularities of input features. When used for long-term\nprediction, FREE has the flexibility to incorporate newly collected\nobservations to enhance future prediction. The efficacy of FREE is evaluated in\nthe context of two societally important real-world applications, predicting\nstream water temperature in the Delaware River Basin and predicting annual corn\nyield in Illinois and Iowa. Beyond the superior predictive performance over\nmultiple baseline methods, FREE is shown to be more data- and\ncomputation-efficient as it can be pre-trained on simulated data generated by\nphysics-based models.",

In comparison with the\nnumerically exact solutions, we find that the analytical results accurately\ndescribe the geometric quantities in a wide parameter space. We unveil the\neffect of the bias on the resonance of geometric quantities, (1) the positions\nof all harmonic resonances stemming from the shift of the Rabi frequency at the\npresence of the bias; (2) the occurrence of even order harmonic resonance due\nto the bias. When the driving frequency is equal to the subharmonics of the\nbias, the odd higher-order harmonic resonances disappear.

To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a QNN trained through\nconvex optimization is employed as the Q-function approximator (QFA). The main\nadvantage is that the QNN's input-output mapping has an analytical expression\nas a quadratic form, which can then be used to obtain an analytical expression\nfor policy improvement. This is in stark contrast to the available techniques\nin the literature that must train a second neural network to obtain policy\nimprovement.

The safety framework includes several features, such as an ensemble of\nconvolutional neural networks to perform image classification, a manager to\nrecord confidences and determine the best answer from the ensemble, a model of\nthe environment to predict when the system may fail to meet minimum performance\nmetrics, a performance monitor to log system and domain performance and check\nagainst requirements, and a retraining component to update the ensemble and\nmanager to maintain performance. The authors validated the proposed method\nusing extensive simulation studies based on dynamic image classification. The\nauthors showed the safety framework could probabilistically detect out of\ndistribution data. The results also show the framework can detect when the\nsystem is no longer performing safely and can significantly extend the working\nenvelope of an image classifier.",

This work shows that the Hamiltonian of generic\ndynamical systems constitutes a class of generative models, thus rendering\ntheir Helmholtz energy naturally equivalent to variational free energy under\nthe identified generative model. The self-organisation that minimises the\nHelmholtz energy entails matching the system's Hamiltonian with that of the\nenvironment, leading to an ensuing emergence of their generalised synchrony. In\nshort, these self-organising systems can be read as performing variational\nBayesian inference of the interacting environment. These properties have been\ndemonstrated with coupled oscillators, simulated and living neural networks,\nand quantum computers. This notion offers foundational characterisations and\npredictions regarding asymptotic properties of self-organising systems\nexchanging with the environment, providing insights into potential mechanisms\nunderlying emergence of intelligence.",

            "summary": "Context: The measurement of the Yarkovsky effect on near-Earth asteroids\n(NEAs) is common practice in orbit determination today, and the number of\ndetections will increase with the developments of new and more accurate\ntelescopic surveys. However, the process of finding new detections and\nidentifying spurious ones is not yet automated, and it often relies on personal\njudgment. Aims: We aim to introduce a more automated procedure that can search\nfor NEA candidates to measure the Yarkovsky effect, and that can identify\nspurious detections. Methods: The expected semi-major axis drift on an NEA\ncaused by the Yarkovsky effect was computed with a Monte Carlo method on a\nstatistical model of the physical parameters of the asteroid that relies on the\nmost recent NEA population models and data. The expected drift was used to\nselect candidates in which the Yarkovsky effect might be detected, according to\nthe current knowledge of their orbit and the length of their observational arc.\nThen, a nongravitational acceleration along the transverse direction was\nestimated through orbit determination for each candidate. If the detected\nacceleration was statistically significant, we performed a statistical test to\ndetermine whether it was compatible with the Yarkovsky effect model. Finally,\nwe determined the dependence on an isolated tracklet. Results: Among the known\nNEAs, our procedure automatically found 348 detections of the Yarkovsky effect\nthat were accepted. The results are overall compatible with the predicted trend\nwith the the inverse of the diameter, and the procedure appears to be efficient\nin identifying and rejecting spurious detections. This algorithm is now adopted\nby the ESA NEO Coordination Centre to periodically update the catalogue of NEAs\nwith a measurable Yarkovsky effect, and the results are automatically posted on\nthe web portal.",

            "summary": "The recently-discovered stellar system Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is\nthe faintest known Milky Way satellite to date. With a stellar mass of\n$16^{+6}_{-5}\\,\\rm M_\\odot$ and a half-light radius of $3\\pm1$ pc, it is either\nthe darkest galaxy ever discovered or the faintest self-gravitating star\ncluster known to orbit the Galaxy. Its line-of-sight velocity dispersion\nsuggests the presence of dark matter, although current measurements are\ninconclusive because of the unknown contribution to the dispersion of potential\nbinary stars. We use N-body simulations to show that, if self-gravitating, the\nsystem could not survive in the Milky Way tidal field for more than a single\norbit (roughly 0.4 Gyr), which strongly suggests that the system is stabilized\nby the presence of large amounts of dark matter. If UMa3/U1 formed at the\ncentre of a ~$10^9\\rm M_\\odot$ cuspy LCDM halo, its velocity dispersion would\nbe predicted to be of order ~1 km/s. This is roughly consistent with the\ncurrent estimate, which, neglecting binaries, places $\\sigma_{\\rm los}$ in the\nrange 1 to 4 km/s. Because of its dense cusp, such a halo should be able to\nsurvive the Milky Way tidal field, keeping UMa3/U1 relatively unscathed until\nthe present time. This implies that UMa3/U1 is in all likelihood the faintest\nand densest dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, with important\nimplications for alternative dark matter models, and for the minimum halo mass\nthreshold for luminous galaxy formation in the LCDM cosmology.",

Phase-averaged and\ntime-averaged results reveal that both whole SJA and neck-only methods\ngenerated nearly identical flow fields. For the neck-only case, a notable\nreduction in computational cost is achieved through the implementation of an\nanalytical jet profile. The jet-slot-only method, on the other hand, introduces\nreversed flow during the ingestion cycle, leading to the injection of\nfalse-momentum into the crossflow. However, the false-momentum primarily\naffects the flow immediately downstream of the jet exit, with the boundary\nlayer profile recovering rapidly.

Entanglement\npurification protocols offer a solution by converting multiple low-quality\nentangled states into a smaller number of higher-quality ones. In this work, we\nintroduce a framework to analyse the performance of entanglement buffering\nsetups that combine entanglement consumption, decoherence, and entanglement\npurification. We propose two key metrics: the availability, which is the\nsteady-state probability that an entangled link is present, and the average\nconsumed fidelity, which quantifies the steady-state quality of consumed links.\nWe then investigate a two-node system, where each node possesses two quantum\nmemories: one for long-term entanglement storage, and another for entanglement\ngeneration. We model this setup as a continuous-time stochastic process and\nderive analytical expressions for the performance metrics. Our findings unveil\na trade-off between the availability and the average consumed fidelity. We also\nbound these performance metrics for a buffering system that employs the\nwell-known bilocal Clifford purification protocols. Importantly, our analysis\ndemonstrates that, in the presence of noise, consistently purifying the\nbuffered entanglement increases the average consumed fidelity, even when some\nbuffered entanglement is discarded due to purification failures.",

            "summary": "Conventional Time Series Classification (TSC) methods are often black boxes\nthat obscure inherent interpretation of their decision-making processes. In\nthis work, we leverage Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to overcome this issue,\nand propose a new framework called MILLET: Multiple Instance Learning for\nLocally Explainable Time series classification. We apply MILLET to existing\ndeep learning TSC models and show how they become inherently interpretable\nwithout compromising (and in some cases, even improving) predictive\nperformance. We evaluate MILLET on 85 UCR TSC datasets and also present a novel\nsynthetic dataset that is specially designed to facilitate interpretability\nevaluation. On these datasets, we show MILLET produces sparse explanations\nquickly that are of higher quality than other well-known interpretability\nmethods. To the best of our knowledge, our work with MILLET, which is available\non GitHub (https://github.com/JAEarly/MILTimeSeriesClassification), is the\nfirst to develop general MIL methods for TSC and apply them to an extensive\nvariety of domains",

To this\nend, in this work, we quantify the relative contributions of the known cues of\ndepth in a monocular depth estimation setting using an indoor scene data set.\nOur work uses feature extraction techniques to relate the single features of\nshape, texture, colour and saturation, taken in isolation, to predict depth. We\nfind that the shape of objects extracted by edge detection substantially\ncontributes more than others in the indoor setting considered, while the other\nfeatures also have contributions in varying degrees. These insights will help\noptimise depth estimation models, boosting their accuracy and robustness.

While\ngradient-based approaches in reinforcement learning have achieved tremendous\nsuccess in learning policies for continuous control problems such as robotics\nand autonomous driving, the lack of interpretability is a fundamental barrier\nto adoption. We propose Interpretable Continuous Control Trees (ICCTs), a\ntree-based model that can be optimized via modern, gradient-based,\nreinforcement learning approaches to produce high-performing, interpretable\npolicies. The key to our approach is a procedure for allowing direct\noptimization in a sparse decision-tree-like representation. We validate ICCTs\nagainst baselines across six domains, showing that ICCTs are capable of\nlearning policies that parity or outperform baselines by up to 33% in\nautonomous driving scenarios while achieving a 300x-600x reduction in the\nnumber of parameters against deep learning baselines. We prove that ICCTs can\nserve as universal function approximators and display analytically that ICCTs\ncan be verified in linear time. Furthermore, we deploy ICCTs in two realistic\ndriving domains, based on interstate Highway-94 and 280 in the US. Finally, we\nverify ICCT's utility with end-users and find that ICCTs are rated easier to\nsimulate, quicker to validate, and more interpretable than neural networks.",

            "summary": "With the growth of machine learning techniques, privacy of data of users has\nbecome a major concern. Most of the machine learning algorithms rely heavily on\nlarge amount of data which may be collected from various sources. Collecting\nthese data yet maintaining privacy policies has become one of the most\nchallenging tasks for the researchers. To combat this issue, researchers have\nintroduced federated learning, where a prediction model is learnt by ensuring\nthe privacy of data of clients data. However, the prevalent federated learning\nalgorithms possess an accuracy and efficiency trade-off, especially for non-IID\ndata. In this research, we propose a centralized, neural network-based\nfederated learning system. The centralized algorithm incorporates micro-level\nparallel processing inspired by the traditional mini-batch algorithm where the\nclient devices and the server handle the forward and backward propagation\nrespectively. We also devise a semi-centralized version of our proposed\nalgorithm. This algorithm takes advantage of edge computing for minimizing the\nload from the central server, where clients handle both the forward and\nbackward propagation while sacrificing the overall train time to some extent.\nWe evaluate our proposed systems on five well-known benchmark datasets and\nachieve satisfactory performance in a reasonable time across various data\ndistribution settings as compared to some existing benchmark algorithms.",

The method is based on SINDy, a data-driven technique\ncapable of identifying the underlying dynamics of complex physical systems from\ntime series data. SINDy is utilized to uncover PDEs that describe the laws of\nphysics in space, which are non-deterministic and influenced by various factors\nsuch as drag or the reference area (related to the attitude of the satellite).\nIn contrast to prior works, the physically interpretable coordinate system is\nmaintained, and no dimensionality reduction technique is applied to the data.\nBy training the model with multiple representative trajectories of LEO -\nencompassing various inclinations, eccentricities, and altitudes - and testing\nit with unseen orbital motion patterns, a mean error of around 140 km for the\npositions and 0.12 km/s for the velocities is achieved. The method offers the\nadvantage of delivering interpretable, accurate, and complex models of orbital\nmotion that can be employed for propagation or as inputs to predictive models\nfor other variables of interest, such as atmospheric drag or the probability of\ncollision in an encounter with a spacecraft or space objects. In conclusion,\nthe work demonstrates the promising potential of using SINDy to discover the\nequations governing the behaviour of satellites in space. The technique has\nbeen successfully applied to uncover PDEs describing the motion of satellites\nin LEO with high accuracy. The method possesses several advantages over\ntraditional models, including the ability to provide physically interpretable,\naccurate, and complex models of orbital motion derived from high-entropy\ndatasets.

            "summary": "The class-agnostic counting (CAC) task has recently been proposed to solve\nthe problem of counting all objects of an arbitrary class with several\nexemplars given in the input image. To address this challenging task, existing\nleading methods all resort to density map regression, which renders them\nimpractical for downstream tasks that require object locations and restricts\ntheir ability to well explore the scale information of exemplars for\nsupervision. To address the limitations, we propose a novel localization-based\nCAC approach, termed Scale-modulated Query and Localization Network (SQLNet).\nIt fully explores the scales of exemplars in both the query and localization\nstages and achieves effective counting by accurately locating each object and\npredicting its approximate size. Specifically, during the query stage, rich\ndiscriminative representations of the target class are acquired by the\nHierarchical Exemplars Collaborative Enhancement (HECE) module from the few\nexemplars through multi-scale exemplar cooperation with equifrequent size\nprompt embedding. These representations are then fed into the Exemplars-Unified\nQuery Correlation (EUQC) module to interact with the query features in a\nunified manner and produce the correlated query tensor. In the localization\nstage, the Scale-aware Multi-head Localization (SAML) module utilizes the query\ntensor to predict the confidence, location, and size of each potential object.\nMoreover, a scale-aware localization loss is introduced, which exploits\nflexible location associations and exemplar scales for supervision to optimize\nthe model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SQLNet\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular CAC benchmarks, achieving\nexcellent performance not only in counting accuracy but also in localization\nand bounding box generation.

Typically, CME properties are\nreconstructed from stereoscopic coronal images and then used to forward model a\nCME's interplanetary evolution. Knowing the uncertainty in the coronal\nreconstructions is then a critical factor in determining the uncertainty of any\npredictions. A growing number of catalogs of coronal CME reconstructions exist,\nbut no extensive comparison between these catalogs has yet been performed. Here\nwe develop a Living List of Attributes Measured in Any Coronal Reconstruction\n(LLAMACoRe), an online collection of individual catalogs, which we intend to\ncontinually update. In this first version, we use results from 24 different\ncatalogs with 3D reconstructions using STEREO observations between 2007--2014.\nWe have collated the individual catalogs, determining which reconstructions\ncorrespond to the same events. LLAMACoRe contains 2954 reconstructions for 1863\nCMEs. Of these, 510 CMEs contain multiple reconstructions from different\ncatalogs. Using the best-constrained values for each CME, we find that the\ncombined catalog reproduces the generally known solar cycle trends. We\ndetermine the typical difference we would expect between two independent\nreconstructions of the same event and find values of 4.0 deg in the latitude,\n8.0 deg in the longitude, 24.0 deg in the tilt, 9.5 deg in the angular width,\n0.1 in the shape parameter kappa, 115 km/s in the velocity, and 2.5e15 g in the\nmass.

Such data pose problems for prediction\nand variable selection, especially when the covariate-response relationship is\ncomplicated. To address these challenges, we propose to incorporate co-data,\ni.e. external information on the covariates, into Bayesian additive regression\ntrees (BART), a sum-of-trees prediction model that utilizes priors on the tree\nparameters to prevent overfitting. To incorporate co-data, an empirical Bayes\n(EB) framework is developed that estimates, assisted by a co-data model, prior\ncovariate weights in the BART model. The proposed method can handle multiple\ntypes of co-data simultaneously. Furthermore, the proposed EB framework enables\nthe estimation of the other hyperparameters of BART as well, rendering an\nappealing alternative to cross-validation. We show that the method finds\nrelevant covariates and that it improves prediction compared to default BART in\nsimulations. If the covariate-response relationship is nonlinear, the method\nbenefits from the flexibility of BART to outperform regression-based co-data\nlearners.

            "summary": "Surgical phase recognition is crucial to providing surgery understanding in\nsmart operating rooms. Despite great progress in automatic surgical phase\nrecognition, most existing methods are still restricted by two problems. First,\nthese methods cannot capture discriminative visual features for each frame and\nmotion information with simple 2D networks. Second, the frame-by-frame\nrecognition paradigm degrades the performance due to unstable predictions\nwithin each phase, termed as phase shaking. To address these two challenges, we\npropose a Surgical Phase LocAlization Network, named SurgPLAN, to facilitate a\nmore accurate and stable surgical phase recognition with the principle of\ntemporal detection. Specifically, we first devise a Pyramid SlowFast (PSF)\narchitecture to serve as the visual backbone to capture multi-scale spatial and\ntemporal features by two branches with different frame sampling rates.\nMoreover, we propose a Temporal Phase Localization (TPL) module to generate the\nphase prediction based on temporal region proposals, which ensures accurate and\nconsistent predictions within each surgical phase. Extensive experiments\nconfirm the significant advantages of our SurgPLAN over frame-by-frame\napproaches in terms of both accuracy and stability.",

After demonstrating the\nefficacy of our chosen method of self-supervised pretraining, we investigate\nSSL for multi-modal models. A late-fusion model is proposed, where each omics\nis passed through its own sub-network, the outputs of which are averaged and\npassed to the pretraining or downstream objective function. Multi-modal\npretraining is shown to improve predictions from a single omics, and we argue\nthat this is useful for datasets with many unlabelled multi-modal samples, but\nfew labelled unimodal samples.

This paper proposes VertDetect, a fully\nautomated end-to-end 3D vertebral instance segmentation Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) model to predict vertebral level labels and segmentations for all\nvertebrae present in a CT scan.

The transition between the two is predicted by a dimensionless\nparameter, which can be interpreted as the ratio between two time scales that\nare the time that it takes for the surface waves to warn the leading edge of\nthe impactor of the forthcoming impact, and the characteristic duration of the\nfinal viscous phase of the approach. Additionally, we assess the role of solid\ncompressibility and elucidate why nearly-incompressible solids feature (a)\nsubstancial \"gliding\" prior to contact at the transition between regimes, (b)\nthe largest size of entrapped bubble between the deformed tip of the impactor\nand the flat surface, and (c) a sudden drop in entrapped bubble radius past the\ntransition between regimes.

In particular, we derive high-order strain-energy expansions\nfor pairwise energies under athermal quasistatic dynamics. We then use the\npresented formalism to study the statistical properties of pairwise expansion\ncoefficients and their link with the statistics of soft, quasilocalized modes,\nfor a wide range of formation histories in both two- and three-dimensional\nsystems. We further exploit the presented framework to access local yield\nstress maps by performing a non-linear stress-strain expansion within a cavity\nembedded in a frozen matrix. We show that our \"bond micromechanics\" compare\nwell with the original \"frozen matrix\" method, with the caveat of\noverestimating large stress activations. We additionally show how local yield\nrules can be used as input for a scalar elasto-plastic model (EPM) to predict\nthe stress response of materials ranging from ductile to brittle. Finally, we\nhighlight some of the limits of simple mesoscale models in capturing the aging\ndynamics of post-yielding systems. Intriguingly, we observe subdiffusive and\ndiffusive shearband growths for particle-based simulations and EPMs,\nrespectively.",

            "summary": "The quantization of systems composed of transmission lines connected to\nlumped circuits poses significant challenges, arising from the interplay\nbetween continuous and discrete degrees of freedom. A widely adopted strategy,\nbased on the pioneering work of Yurke and Denker, entails representing the\nlumped circuit contributions using Lagrangian densities that incorporate Dirac\n$\\delta$-functions. However, this approach introduces complications, as\nhighlighted in the recent literature, including divergent momentum densities,\nnecessitating the use of regularization techniques. In this work, we introduce\na $\\delta$-free Lagrangian formulation without the need for a discretization of\nthe transmission line or mode expansions. This is achieved by explicitly\nenforcing boundary conditions at the line ends. In this framework, the\nderivation of the Heisenberg equations of the network is straightforward. We\ndemonstrate that, in the Heisenberg representation a finite-length transmission\nline can be described as a two-port system composed of two resistors and two\ncontrolled sources with delay. This equivalent model extends the one-port model\nwhich is commonly used in the literature for semi-infinite transmission lines.\nFinally, we apply our approach to analytically solvable networks.",

We developed a\nmicroscopic theory addressing polariton thermalization through electron-phonon\ninteractions (known as vibronic coupling) with low-energy molecular vibrations.\nThis theory presents a simple analytical method to calculate the\ntemperature-dependent polariton thermalization rate, utilizing experimentally\naccessible spectral properties of bare molecules, such as the Stokes shift and\ntemperature-dependent linewidth of photoluminescence, in conjunction with\nwell-known parameters of optical cavities. Our findings demonstrate remarkable\nagreement with recent experimental reports of nonequilibrium polariton\ncondensation in both ground and excited states, and explain the thermalization\nbottleneck effect observed at low temperatures.

MPRL calculates\na series of waypoints for the vessel to follow. The environment is represented\nas an occupancy grid map, allowing us to deal with any shape of waterway and\nany number and shape of obstacles. We demonstrate our approach on two scenarios\nand compare the resulting path with path planning using a Frenet frame and path\nplanning based on a proximal policy optimization (PPO) agent. Our results show\nthat MPRL outperforms both baselines in both test scenarios. The PPO based\napproach was not able to reach the goal in either scenario while the Frenet\nframe approach failed in the scenario consisting of a corner with obstacles.\nMPRL was able to safely (collision free) navigate to the goal in both of the\ntest scenarios.",

            "summary": "In surgical procedures, correct instrument counting is essential. Instance\nsegmentation is a location method that locates not only an object's bounding\nbox but also each pixel's specific details. However, obtaining mask-level\nannotations is labor-intensive in instance segmentation. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel yet effective weakly-supervised surgical instrument instance\nsegmentation approach, named Point-based Weakly-supervised Instance\nSegmentation (PWISeg). PWISeg adopts an FCN-based architecture with\npoint-to-box and point-to-mask branches to model the relationships between\nfeature points and bounding boxes, as well as feature points and segmentation\nmasks on FPN, accomplishing instrument detection and segmentation jointly in a\nsingle model. Since mask level annotations are hard to available in the real\nworld, for point-to-mask training, we introduce an unsupervised projection\nloss, utilizing the projected relation between predicted masks and bboxes as\nsupervision signal. On the other hand, we annotate a few pixels as the key\npixel for each instrument. Based on this, we further propose a key pixel\nassociation loss and a key pixel distribution loss, driving the point-to-mask\nbranch to generate more accurate segmentation predictions. To comprehensively\nevaluate this task, we unveil a novel surgical instrument dataset with manual\nannotations, setting up a benchmark for further research. Our comprehensive\nresearch trial validated the superior performance of our PWISeg. The results\nshow that the accuracy of surgical instrument segmentation is improved,\nsurpassing most methods of instance segmentation via weakly supervised bounding\nboxes. This improvement is consistently observed in our proposed dataset and\nwhen applied to the public HOSPI-Tools dataset.",

To alleviate this, we propose including some of a user's preferences\nand instructions in natural language -- collectively termed standing\ninstructions -- as additional context for such interfaces. For example, when a\nuser states I'm hungry, their previously expressed preference for Persian food\nwill be automatically added to the LLM prompt, so as to influence the search\nfor relevant restaurants. We develop NLSI, a language-to-program dataset\nconsisting of over 2.4K dialogues spanning 17 domains, where each dialogue is\npaired with a user profile (a set of users specific standing instructions) and\ncorresponding structured representations (API calls). A key challenge in NLSI\nis to identify which subset of the standing instructions is applicable to a\ngiven dialogue. NLSI contains diverse phenomena, from simple preferences to\ninterdependent instructions such as triggering a hotel search whenever the user\nis booking tickets to an event. We conduct experiments on NLSI using prompting\nwith large language models and various retrieval approaches, achieving a\nmaximum of 44.7% exact match on API prediction.

            "summary": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved a notable success in\ntwo-dimensional image segmentation in natural images. However, the substantial\ngap between medical and natural images hinders its direct application to\nmedical image segmentation tasks. Particularly in 3D medical images, SAM\nstruggles to learn contextual relationships between slices, limiting its\npractical applicability. Moreover, applying 2D SAM to 3D images requires\nprompting the entire volume, which is time- and label-consuming. To address\nthese problems, we propose Slide-SAM, which treats a stack of three adjacent\nslices as a prediction window. It firstly takes three slices from a 3D volume\nand point- or bounding box prompts on the central slice as inputs to predict\nsegmentation masks for all three slices. Subsequently, the masks of the top and\nbottom slices are then used to generate new prompts for adjacent slices.\nFinally, step-wise prediction can be achieved by sliding the prediction window\nforward or backward through the entire volume. Our model is trained on multiple\npublic and private medical datasets and demonstrates its effectiveness through\nextensive 3D segmetnation experiments, with the help of minimal prompts.

A\nviable approach for the execution of quantum classification algorithms is the\nintroduction of a well-known machine learning paradigm, namely, the ensemble\nmethods. Indeed, the ensembles combine multiple internal classifiers, which are\ncharacterized by compact sizes due to the smaller data subsets used for\ntraining, to achieve more accurate and robust prediction performance. In this\nway, it is possible to reduce the qubits requirements with respect to a single\nlarger classifier while achieving comparable or improved performance. In this\nwork, we present an implementation and an extensive empirical evaluation of\nensembles of quantum classifiers for binary classification, with the purpose of\nproviding insights into their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for\nenhancing the performance of basic quantum models. In particular, three\nclassical ensemble methods and three quantum classifiers have been taken into\naccount here. Hence, the scheme that has been implemented (in Python) has a\nhybrid nature. The results (obtained on real-world datasets) have shown an\naccuracy advantage for the ensemble techniques with respect to the single\nquantum classifiers, and also an improvement in robustness. In fact, the\nensembles have turned out to be able to mitigate both unsuitable data\nnormalizations and repeated measurement inaccuracies, making quantum\nclassifiers more stable.",

            "summary": "Altering chemical reactivity and material structure in confined optical\nenvironments is on the rise, and yet, a conclusive understanding of the\nmicroscopic mechanisms remains elusive. This originates mostly from the fact\nthat accurately predicting vibrational and reactive dynamics for soluted\nensembles of realistic molecules is no small endeavor, and adding (collective)\nstrong light-matter interaction does not simplify matters. Here, we establish a\nframework based on a combination of machine learning (ML) models, trained using\ndensity-functional theory calculations, and molecular dynamics to accelerate\nsuch simulations. We then apply this approach to evaluate strong coupling,\nchanges in reaction rate constant, and their influence on enthalpy and entropy\nfor the deprotection reaction of 1-phenyl-2-trimethylsilylacetylene, which has\nbeen studied previously both experimentally and using ab initio simulations.\nWhile we find qualitative agreement with critical experimental observations,\nespecially with regard to the changes in kinetics, we also find differences in\ncomparison with previous theoretical predictions. The features for which the\nML-accelerated and ab initio simulations agree show the experimentally\nestimated kinetic behavior. Conflicting features indicate that a contribution\nof electronic polarization to the reaction process is more relevant then\ncurrently believed. Our work demonstrates the practical use of ML for\npolaritonic chemistry, discusses limitations of common approximations and paves\nthe way for a more holistic description of polaritonic chemistry.",

In this work we focus on news coverage of local\npublic policy in the San Francisco Bay Area by the San Francisco Chronicle.\nFirst, we gather news articles, public policy documents and meeting recordings\nand link them using probabilistic relational modeling, which we show is a\nlow-annotation linking methodology that outperforms other retrieval-based\nbaselines. Second, we define a new task: newsworthiness prediction, to predict\nif a policy item will get covered. We show that different aspects of public\npolicy discussion yield different newsworthiness signals.

We\nfind that for both tasks, model predictions are closer to the labels from White\nand female participants. We further explore prompting with the target\ndemographic labels and show that including the target demographic in the prompt\nactually worsens the model's performance. More specifically, when being\nprompted to respond from the perspective of \"Black\" and \"Asian\" individuals,\nmodels show lower performance in predicting both overall scores as well as the\nscores from corresponding groups.

The fluid force/torque\nexerted on the particles comprise a steady part due to the difference in the\nparticle velocity/angular velocity and the fluid mean velocity/rotation rate,\nand a fluctuating part due to the turbulent velocity/vorticity fluctuations.\nThe fluctuations are modeled as Gaussian white noise whose variance is\ndetermined from the fluid velocity and vorticity fluctuations. The smooth and\nrough inelastic collision models are considered for particle-particle and\nparticle-wall collisions. The results show that inclusion of roughness is\nimportant for accurately predicting the particle dynamics; the second moments\nof the velocity fluctuations for rough particles are higher than those for\nsmooth particles by a factor of 2-10, while the second moments of the angular\nvelocity fluctuations are higher by 1-2 orders of magnitude.

Knowing the latency of running a DNN model or\ntensor program on a specific device is useful in various tasks, such as DNN\ngraph- or tensor-level optimization and device selection. Considering the large\nspace of DNN models and devices that impede direct profiling of all\ncombinations, recent efforts focus on building a predictor to model the\nperformance of DNN models on different devices. However, none of the existing\nattempts have achieved a cost model that can accurately predict the performance\nof various tensor programs while supporting both training and inference\naccelerators. We propose CDMPP, an efficient tensor program latency prediction\nframework for both cross-model and cross-device prediction. We design an\ninformative but efficient representation of tensor programs, called compact\nASTs, and a pre-order-based positional encoding method, to capture the internal\nstructure of tensor programs. We develop a domain-adaption-inspired method to\nlearn domain-invariant representations and devise a KMeans-based sampling\nalgorithm, for the predictor to learn from different domains (i.e., different\nDNN operators and devices). Our extensive experiments on a diverse range of DNN\nmodels and devices demonstrate that CDMPP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines with 14.03% and 10.85% prediction error for\ncross-model and cross-device prediction, respectively, and one order of\nmagnitude higher training efficiency.

In this study, we address the\nchallenge of understanding political bias in digitized discourse using LLMs.\nWhile traditional approaches often rely on finetuning separate models for each\npolitical faction, our work innovates by employing a singular,\ninstruction-tuned LLM to reflect a spectrum of political ideologies. We present\na comprehensive analytical framework, consisting of Partisan Bias Divergence\nAssessment and Partisan Class Tendency Prediction, to evaluate the model's\nalignment with real-world political ideologies in terms of stances, emotions,\nand moral foundations. Our findings reveal the model's effectiveness in\ncapturing emotional and moral nuances, albeit with some challenges in stance\ndetection, highlighting the intricacies and potential for refinement in NLP\ntools for politically sensitive contexts. This research contributes\nsignificantly to the field by demonstrating the feasibility and importance of\nnuanced political understanding in LLMs, particularly for applications\nrequiring acute awareness of political bias.",

These objects have infinite degrees of freedom,\nresulting in non-trivial perception and state estimation, and complex dynamics,\ncomplicating the prediction of future configurations. Although recent research\nhas focused on deformable object manipulation, most approaches rely on static\nvision and simple manipulation techniques, limiting the performance level. This\npaper proposes two solutions to enhance the performance: interactive perception\nand the use of assistive tools. The first solution posits that optimal\nperspectives exist during deformable object manipulation, facilitating easier\nstate estimation. By exploring the action-perception regularity, interactive\nperception facilitates better manipulation and perception. The second solution\nadvocates for the use of assistive tools, a hallmark of human intelligence, to\nimprove manipulation performance. For instance, a folding board can aid in\ngarment folding tasks by reducing object deformation and managing complex\ndynamics. Hence, this research aims to address the deformable object\nmanipulation problem by incorporating interactive perception and assistive\ntools to augment manipulation performance.",

            "summary": "In-Context Learning (ICL) is an emergent capability of Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Only a few demonstrations enable LLMs to be used as blackbox for new\ntasks. Previous studies have shown that using LLMs' outputs as labels is\neffective in training models to select demonstrations. Such a label is expected\nto estimate utility of a demonstration in ICL; however, it has not been well\nunderstood how different labeling strategies affect results on target tasks.\nThis paper presents an analysis on different utility functions by focusing on\nLLMs' output probability given ground-truth output, and task-specific reward\ngiven LLMs' prediction. Unlike the previous work, we introduce a novel labeling\nmethod, incremental utility, which estimates how much incremental knowledge is\nbrought into the LLMs by a demonstration. We conduct experiments with\ninstruction-tuned LLMs on binary/multi-class classification, segmentation, and\ntranslation across Arabic, English, Finnish, Japanese, and Spanish. Our results\nshow that (1) the probability is effective when the probability values are\ndistributed across the whole value range (on the classification tasks), and (2)\nthe downstream metric is more robust when nuanced reward values are provided\nwith long outputs (on the segmentation and translation tasks). We then show\nthat the proposed incremental utility further helps ICL by contrasting how the\nLLMs perform with and without the demonstrations.",

We\nincorporate the outputs of such OCR tools, LLMs, and larger multimodal models\nas intermediate ``rationales'' on training data, and train a small student\nmodel to predict both rationales and answers for input questions based on those\ntraining examples.

In this letter, we\ndemonstrate the control of the trigonal crystal field of Co ions is a key to\ndestabilizing classical antiferromagnetic ordering in layered honeycomb\ncobaltates.

The original N\\'eel temperature of 16 K in bulk Cu3Co2SbO6\ndecreases (increases) to 7.8 K (22.7 K) in strained Cu3Co2SbO6 films by\nreducing (raising) the magnitude of the trigonal crystal fields.

Previous work has found that\ndatasets with paired inputs are prone to correlations between a specific part\nof the input (e.g., the hypothesis in NLI) and the label; consequently, models\ntrained only on those outperform chance. Are these correlations picked up by\nmodels trained on the full input data? To address this question, we propose a\nnew evaluation method, Counterfactual Attentiveness Test (CAT). CAT uses\ncounterfactuals by replacing part of the input with its counterpart from a\ndifferent example (subject to some restrictions), expecting an attentive model\nto change its prediction. Using CAT, we systematically investigate established\nsupervised and in-context learning models on ten datasets spanning four tasks:\nnatural language inference, reading comprehension, paraphrase detection, and\nvisual & language reasoning. CAT reveals that reliance on such correlations is\nmainly data-dependent. Surprisingly, we find that GPT3 becomes less attentive\nwith an increased number of demonstrations, while its accuracy on the test data\nimproves. Our results demonstrate that augmenting training or demonstration\ndata with counterfactuals is effective in improving models' attentiveness.

The $N$-electron quantum system is considered as $N$ streams\ncoupled, through the Poisson's relation, which are localized in momentum space\nrather than electron localization in real space, assumed in ordinary many body\ntheories. Using a new wavefunction representation, the $N+1$-coupled system is\nreduced to simple pseudoforce equations via quasiparticle (collective quantum)\nmodel leading to a generalized matter wave dispersion relation. It is shown\nthat the resulting dual lengthscale de Broglie's matter wave theory predicts\nmacroscopic quantum effects and deterministic field trajectories for charges\nmoving in the electron gas due to the coupling of the electrostatic field to\nthe local electron number density. It is remarked that any quantum many body\nsystem composed of large number of interacting particles acts as a dual arm\ndevice controlling the microscopic single particle effects with one hand and\nthe macroscopic phenomena with the other.

We find that LLMs\noften contradict themselves when performing reasoning tasks that involve\ncontextual information and commonsense. The model may miss evidence or use\nshortcuts, thereby exhibiting self-contradictory behaviors. We also employ the\nPoint-of-View (POV) method, which probes models to generate reasoning from\nmultiple perspectives, as a diagnostic tool for further analysis. We find that\nthough LLMs may appear to perform well in one-perspective settings, they fail\nto stabilize such behavior in multi-perspectives settings. Even for correct\npredictions, the reasoning may be messy and incomplete, and LLMs can easily be\nled astray from good reasoning. \\textsc{SCORE}'s results underscore the lack of\nrobustness required for trustworthy reasoning and the urgency for further\nresearch to establish best practices for a comprehensive evaluation of\nreasoning beyond accuracy-based metrics.",

            "summary": "In task-oriented dialogue, a system often needs to follow a sequence of\nactions, called a workflow, that complies with a set of guidelines in order to\ncomplete a task. In this paper, we propose the novel problem of multi-step\nworkflow action prediction, in which the system predicts multiple future\nworkflow actions. Accurate prediction of multiple steps allows for multi-turn\nautomation, which can free up time to focus on more complex tasks. We propose\nthree modeling approaches that are simple to implement yet lead to more action\nautomation: 1) fine-tuning on a training dataset, 2) few-shot in-context\nlearning leveraging retrieval and large language model prompting, and 3)\nzero-shot graph traversal, which aggregates historical action sequences into a\ngraph for prediction. We show that multi-step action prediction produces\nfeatures that improve accuracy on downstream dialogue tasks like predicting\ntask success, and can increase automation of steps by 20% without requiring as\nmuch feedback from a human overseeing the system.",

            "summary": "As a useful and efficient alternative to generic model-based control scheme,\ndata-driven predictive control is subject to bias-variance trade-off and is\nknown to not perform desirably in face of uncertainty. Through the connection\nbetween direct data-driven control and subspace predictive control, we gain\ninsight into the reason being the lack of causality as a main cause for high\nvariance of implicit prediction. In this article, we seek to address this\ndeficiency by devising a novel causality-informed formulation of direct\ndata-driven control. Built upon LQ factorization, an equivalent two-stage\nreformulation of regularized data-driven control is first derived, which bears\nclearer interpretability and a lower complexity than generic forms. This paves\nthe way for deriving a two-stage causality-informed formulation of data-driven\npredictive control, as well as a regularized form that balances between control\ncost minimization and implicit identification of multi-step predictor. Since it\nonly calls for block-triangularization of a submatrix in LQ factorization, the\nnew causality-informed formulation comes at no excess cost as compared to\ngeneric ones. Its efficacy is investigated based on numerical examples and\napplication to model-free control of a simulated industrial heating furnace.\nEmpirical results corroborate that the proposed method yields obvious\nperformance improvement over existing formulations in handling stochastic noise\nand process nonlinearity.",

The model\nachieves 95% accuracy (RMSE = 356) during regular period, but it underperforms\nwith 55% accuracy (RMSE = 1084) during the evacuation period. Then, a transfer\nlearning approach is adopted where a pretrained model is used with additional\nevacuation related features to predict evacuation period traffic.

            "summary": "Statistical models for spatial processes play a central role in statistical\nanalyses of spatial data. Yet, it is the simple, interpretable, and well\nunderstood models that are routinely employed even though, as is revealed\nthrough prior and posterior predictive checks, these can poorly characterise\nthe spatial heterogeneity in the underlying process of interest. Here, we\npropose a new, flexible class of spatial-process models, which we refer to as\nspatial Bayesian neural networks (SBNNs). An SBNN leverages the\nrepresentational capacity of a Bayesian neural network; it is tailored to a\nspatial setting by incorporating a spatial \"embedding layer\" into the network\nand, possibly, spatially-varying network parameters. An SBNN is calibrated by\nmatching its finite-dimensional distribution at locations on a fine gridding of\nspace to that of a target process of interest. That process could be easy to\nsimulate from or we have many realisations from it. We propose several variants\nof SBNNs, most of which are able to match the finite-dimensional distribution\nof the target process at the selected grid better than conventional BNNs of\nsimilar complexity. We also show that a single SBNN can be used to represent a\nvariety of spatial processes often used in practice, such as Gaussian processes\nand lognormal processes. We briefly discuss the tools that could be used to\nmake inference with SBNNs, and we conclude with a discussion of their\nadvantages and limitations.",

We calibrate the relationship between the\ngeometrically defined black hole shadow and the observed size of the ring-like\nimages using a library that includes both Kerr and non-Kerr simulations. We use\nthe exquisite prior constraints on the mass-to-distance ratio for Sgr A* to\nshow that the observed image size is within $\\sim$ 10$\\%$ of the Kerr\npredictions. We use these bounds to constrain metrics that are parametrically\ndifferent from Kerr as well as the charges of several known spacetimes. To\nconsider alternatives to the presence of an event horizon we explore the\npossibility that Sgr A* is a compact object with a surface that either absorbs\nand thermally re-emits incident radiation or partially reflects it. Using the\nobserved image size and the broadband spectrum of Sgr A*, we conclude that a\nthermal surface can be ruled out and a fully reflective one is unlikely. We\ncompare our results to the broader landscape of gravitational tests. Together\nwith the bounds found for stellar mass black holes and the M87 black hole, our\nobservations provide further support that the external spacetimes of all black\nholes are described by the Kerr metric, independent of their mass.",

We propose robust predictive runtime\nverification (RPRV) algorithms under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks for\ngeneral stochastic CPS. The RPRV problem faces several challenges: (1) there\nmay not be sufficient data of the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive\nmodels are based on a distribution over system trajectories encountered during\nthe design phase, i.e., there may be a distribution shift during deployment. To\naddress these challenges, we assume to know an upper bound on the statistical\ndistance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the distributions at deployment\nand design time, and we utilize techniques based on robust conformal\nprediction. Motivated by our results in [1], we construct an accurate and an\ninterpretable RPRV algorithm. We use a trajectory prediction model to estimate\nthe system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain\nprobabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. We precisely\nquantify the relationship between calibration data, desired confidence, and\npermissible distribution shift.

We test the models against 11 constraints drawn from EHT 230 GHz\ndata and observations at 86 GHz, 2.2 $\\mu$m, and in the X-ray. All models fail\nat least one constraint. Light curve variability provides a particularly severe\nconstraint, failing nearly all strongly magnetized (MAD) models and a large\nfraction of weakly magnetized (SANE) models. A number of models fail only the\nvariability constraints. We identify a promising cluster of these models, which\nare MAD and have inclination $i \\le$ 30$^\\circ$.

            "summary": "Among the variational wave functions for Fermionic Hamiltonians, neural\nnetwork backflow (NNBF) and hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) are two\nprominent classes to provide accurate approximations to the ground state. Here\nwe develop a unifying view of fermionic neural quantum states casting them all\nin the framework of NNBF. NNBF wave-functions have configuration-dependent\nsingle-particle orbitals (SPO) which are parameterized by a neural network. We\nshow that HFDS with $r$ hidden fermions can be written as a NNBF with an $r\n\\times r$ determinant Jastrow and a restricted low-rank $r$ additive correction\nto the SPO. Furthermore, we show that in NNBF wave-functions, such determinant\nJastrow's can generically be removed at the cost of further complicating the\nadditive SPO correction increasing its rank by $r$. We numerically and\nanalytically compare additive SPO corrections generated by the product of two\nmatrices with inner dimension $r$. We find that larger $r$ wave-functions span\na larger space and give evidence that simpler and more direct updates to the\nSPO's tend to be more expressive and better energetically. These suggest the\nstandard NNBF approach is preferred amongst other related choices. Finally, we\nuncover that the row-selection used to select single-particle orbitals allows\nsignificant sign and amplitude modulation between nearby configurations and is\npartially responsible for the quality of NNBF and HFDS wave-functions.",

            "summary": "Text and vision foundation models can perform many tasks in a zero-shot\nsetting, a desirable property that enables these systems to be applied in\ngeneral and low-resource settings. However, there has been significantly less\nwork on the zero-shot abilities of ASR foundation models, with these systems\ntypically fine-tuned to specific tasks or constrained to applications that\nmatch their training criterion and data annotation. In this work we investigate\nthe ability of Whisper and MMS, ASR foundation models trained primarily for\nspeech recognition, to perform zero-shot audio classification. We use simple\ntemplate-based text prompts at the decoder and use the resulting decoding\nprobabilities to generate zero-shot predictions. Without training the model on\nextra data or adding any new parameters, we demonstrate that Whisper shows\npromising zero-shot classification performance on a range of 8\naudio-classification datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art\nzero-shot baseline's accuracy by an average of 9%. One important step to unlock\nthe emergent ability is debiasing, where a simple unsupervised reweighting\nmethod of the class probabilities yields consistent significant performance\ngains. We further show that performance increases with model size, implying\nthat as ASR foundation models scale up, they may exhibit improved zero-shot\nperformance.",

However, LLMs still\nexhibit limitations, including the generation of factually incorrect\ninformation. In safety-critical applications, it is important to assess the\nconfidence of LLM-generated content to make informed decisions. Retrieval\nAugmented Language Models (RALMs) is relatively a new area of research in NLP.\nRALMs offer potential benefits for scientific NLP tasks, as retrieved\ndocuments, can serve as evidence to support model-generated content. This\ninclusion of evidence enhances trustworthiness, as users can verify and explore\nthe retrieved documents to validate model outputs. Quantifying uncertainty in\nRALM generations further improves trustworthiness, with retrieved text and\nconfidence scores contributing to a comprehensive and reliable model for\nscientific applications. However, there is limited to no research on UQ for\nRALMs, particularly in scientific contexts. This study aims to address this gap\nby conducting a comprehensive evaluation of UQ in RALMs, focusing on scientific\ntasks. This research investigates how uncertainty scores vary when scientific\nknowledge is incorporated as pretraining and retrieval data and explores the\nrelationship between uncertainty scores and the accuracy of model-generated\noutputs. We observe that an existing RALM finetuned with scientific knowledge\nas the retrieval data tends to be more confident in generating predictions\ncompared to the model pretrained only with scientific knowledge. We also found\nthat RALMs are overconfident in their predictions, making inaccurate\npredictions more confidently than accurate ones. Scientific knowledge provided\neither as pretraining or retrieval corpus does not help alleviate this issue.\nWe released our code, data and dashboards at https://github.com/pnnl/EXPERT2.",

This work revealed a rapid depletion of\nsuperfluid density in semiconductor, caused by the in-plane magnetic field\nwhich in presence of spin-orbit coupling creates so-called Bogoliubov Fermi\nsurfaces. The experimental work used a simplified theoretical model that\nneglected the presence of non-magnetic disorder in the semiconductor, hence\ndescribing the data only qualitatively. Motivated by experiments, we introduce\na theoretical model describing a disordered semiconductor with strong\nspin-orbit coupling that is proximitized by a superconductor. Our model\nprovides specific predictions for the density of states and superfluid density.\nPresence of disorder leads to the emergence of a gapless superconducting phase,\nthat may be viewed as a manifestation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface. When applied\nto real experimental data, our model showcases excellent quantitative\nagreement, enabling the extraction of material parameters such as mean free\npath and mobility, and estimating $g$-tensor after taking into account the\norbital contribution of magnetic field.

However, these data are often subject to measurement error,\ndistorting the true relationships. Beyond measurement error, there are likely\ncomplex synergistic and sometimes antagonistic interactions between different\ndietary components, complicating the relationships between diet and health\noutcomes. Flexible models are required to capture the nuance that these complex\ninteractions introduce. This complexity makes research on diet-health\nrelationships an appealing candidate for the application of machine learning\ntechniques, and in particular, neural networks. Neural networks are\ncomputational models that are able to capture highly complex, nonlinear\nrelationships so long as sufficient data are available. While these models have\nbeen applied in many domains, the impacts of measurement error on the\nperformance of predictive modeling has not been systematically investigated.\nHowever, dietary intake data are typically collected using self-report methods\nand are prone to large amounts of measurement error. In this work, we\ndemonstrate the ways in which measurement error erodes the performance of\nneural networks, and illustrate the care that is required for leveraging these\nmodels in the presence of error. We demonstrate the role that sample size and\nreplicate measurements play on model performance, indicate a motivation for the\ninvestigation of transformations to additivity, and illustrate the caution\nrequired to prevent model overfitting. While the past performance of neural\nnetworks across various domains make them an attractive candidate for examining\ndiet-health relationships, our work demonstrates that substantial care and\nfurther methodological development are both required to observe increased\npredictive performance when applying these techniques, compared to more\ntraditional statistical procedures.",

Multi-physics simulation methods can describe the three-dimensional\ndynamics of the melt pool, but are computationally expensive at the mesh\nrefinement required for accurate predictions of complex effects, such as the\nformation of keyhole porosity. Therefore, in this work, we develop a generative\ndeep learning model based on the probabilistic diffusion framework to map\nlow-fidelity, coarse-grained simulation information to the high-fidelity\ncounterpart. By doing so, we bypass the computational expense of conducting\nmultiple high-fidelity simulations for analysis by instead upscaling\nlightweight coarse mesh simulations. Specifically, we implement a 2-D diffusion\nmodel to spatially upscale cross-sections of the coarsely simulated melt pool\nto their high-fidelity equivalent. We demonstrate the preservation of key\nmetrics of the melting process between the ground truth simulation data and the\ndiffusion model output, such as the temperature field, the melt pool dimensions\nand the variability of the keyhole vapor cavity. Specifically, we predict the\nmelt pool depth within 3 $\\mu m$ based on low-fidelity input data 4$\\times$\ncoarser than the high-fidelity simulations, reducing analysis time by two\norders of magnitude.",

It is\nimportant to understand the concordance and behavior of parallel models in\ndeployment. In this study, we focus on two models for the early detection of\nhospital-acquired infections (HAIs): 1) the Infection Risk Index (IRI) and 2)\nthe Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) prediction model. The IRI model was\nbuilt to predict all HAIs, whereas the VAP model identifies patients at risk of\ndeveloping ventilator-associated pneumonia. These models could make important\nimprovements in patient outcomes and hospital management of infections through\nearly detection of infections and in turn, enable early interventions. The two\nmodels vary in terms of infection label definition, cohort selection, and\nprediction schema. In this work, we present a comparative analysis between the\ntwo models to characterize concordances and confusions in predicting HAIs by\nthese models. The learnings from this study will provide important findings for\nhow to deploy multiple concurrent disease-specific models in the future.",

However, high impact velocities\nintroduce compressible effects, leading to material erosion. A gap in\nunderstanding and modeling these effects has motivated this study. We simulated\ndroplet impacts on surfaces and proposed a new analytical model for impact\npressure and droplet turning line, targeting at predictions for enhanced\ncavitation. The highly compressed liquid behind the droplet expands sideways,\ncausing lateral jetting. As the droplet encounters a shock wave, it reflects as\na rarefaction wave, leading to low-pressure zones within the droplet. These\nzones converge at the droplet's center, causing cavitation, which, upon\ncollapse, induces another shock wave, contributing to erosion. Using the\nwell-established model for the low-velocity impact shows a significant\ndiscrepancy. Hence, an analytical model for the turning line radius is\nintroduced, incorporating the lateral jetting's characteristic length scale.\nComparing our model with existing ones, our new model exhibits superior\npredictive accuracy.",

Inspired by the concept of probability calibration, we\nare the first work to focus on the probability distribution for human reading\nsimulation. We propose to use temperature-scaled surprisal, a surprisal\ncalculated by shaped probability, to be the predictor of human reading times.\nOur results across three corpora consistently revealed that such a surprisal\ncan drastically improve the prediction of reading times. Setting the\ntemperature to be approximately 2.5 across all models and datasets can yield up\nto an 89% of increase in delta log-likelihood in our setting.

An important sub-task of structure modeling is protein\nside-chain packing: predicting the conformation of side-chains (rotamers) given\nthe protein's backbone structure and amino-acid sequence. Conventional\napproaches for this task rely on expensive sampling procedures over\nhand-crafted energy functions and rotamer libraries. Recently, several deep\nlearning methods have been developed to tackle the problem in a data-driven\nway, albeit with vastly different formulations (from image-to-image translation\nto directly predicting atomic coordinates). Here, we frame the problem as a\njoint regression over the side-chains' true degrees of freedom: the dihedral\n$\\chi$ angles. We carefully study possible objective functions for this task,\nwhile accounting for the underlying symmetries of the task. We propose\nHolographic Packer (H-Packer), a novel two-stage algorithm for side-chain\npacking built on top of two light-weight rotationally equivariant neural\nnetworks. We evaluate our method on CASP13 and CASP14 targets.

A recent line of\nresearch has hinted in the affirmative, demonstrating that human brain signals\ncan be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language\nmodels (LMs). This is thought to reflect shared computational principles\nbetween LMs and human language processing. However, there are also clear\ndifferences in how LMs and humans acquire and use language, even if the final\ntask they are performing is the same. Despite this, there is little work\nexploring systematic differences between human and machine language processing\nusing brain data. To address this question, we examine the differences between\nLM representations and the human brain's responses to language, specifically by\nexamining a dataset of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses to a written\nnarrative. In doing so we identify three phenomena that, in prior work, LMs\nhave been found to not capture well: emotional understanding, figurative\nlanguage processing, and physical commonsense. By fine-tuning LMs on datasets\nrelated to these phenomena, we observe that fine-tuned LMs show improved\nalignment with human brain responses across these tasks. Our study implies that\nthe observed divergences between LMs and human brains may stem from LMs'\ninadequate representation of these specific types of knowledge.",

Current theoretical models treat the\nsystems in an $s$-orbital kagome representation, unsuited and incorrect both\nquantitatively and qualitatively to the material realities. In this work, we\nlay the basis of a faithful framework of the electronic model for this large\nclass of materials. We show that the complicated ``spaghetti\" of electronic\nbands near the Fermi level can be decomposed into three groups of $d$-Fe\norbitals coupled to specific Ge orbitals. Such decomposition allows for a clear\nanalytical understanding (leading to different results than the simple\n$s$-orbital kagome models) of the flat bands in the system based on the\n$S$-matrix formalism of generalized bipartite lattices. Our three minimal\nHamiltonians can reproduce the quasi-flat bands, van Hove singularities,\ntopology, and Dirac points close to the Fermi level, which we prove by\nextensive ab initio studies. We also obtain the interacting Hamiltonian of $d$\norbitals in FeGe using the constraint random phase approximation (cRPA) method.\nWe then use this as a fundamental ``LEGO\"-like building block for a large\nfamily of 1:6:6 kagome materials, which can be obtained by doubling and\nperturbing the FeGe Hamiltonian. We applied the model to its kagome siblings\nFeSn and CoSn, and also MgFe$_6$Ge$_6$. Our work serves as the first complete\nframework for the study of the interacting phase diagram of kagome compounds.",

For\ngeneric models, new sources of CP violation in the UV must be absent in order\nto raise the axion mass above the QCD prediction.

To this end, we first characterize\nthe analytical bounds of the scalar Gaussian RDPF for the aforementioned\ndivergence functions, also providing the RDPF-achieving forward \"test-channel\"\nrealization. Focusing on the multivariate case, we establish that, for\ntensorizable distortion and perception metrics, the optimal solution resides on\nthe vector space spanned by the eigenvector of the source covariance matrix.\nConsequently, the multivariate optimization problem can be expressed as a\nfunction of the scalar Gaussian RDPFs of the source marginals, constrained by\nglobal distortion and perception levels. Leveraging this characterization, we\ndesign an alternating minimization scheme based on the block nonlinear\nGauss-Seidel method, which optimally solves the problem while identifying the\nGaussian RDPF-achieving realization. Furthermore, the associated algorithmic\nembodiment is provided, as well as the convergence and the rate of convergence\ncharacterization. Lastly, for the \"perfect realism\" regime, the analytical\nsolution for the multivariate Gaussian RDPF is obtained.

For such a\ndaunting task, methods that can produce a direct mapping between dark matter\nhalos from dark matter-only simulations and galaxies are strongly preferred, as\nproducing mocks from full-fledged hydrodynamical simulations or semi-analytical\nmodels is too expensive. Here we present a Graph Neural Network-based model\nthat is able to accurately predict key properties of galaxies such as stellar\nmass, $g-r$ color, star formation rate, gas mass, stellar metallicity, and gas\nmetallicity, purely from dark matter properties extracted from halos along the\nfull assembly history of the galaxies. Tests based on the TNG300 simulation of\nthe IllustrisTNG project show that our model can recover the baryonic\nproperties of galaxies to high accuracy, over a wide redshift range ($z =\n0-5$), for all galaxies with stellar masses more massive than $10^9\\,M_\\odot$\nand their progenitors, with strong improvements over the state-of-the-art\nmethods.

            "summary": "With the wide adoption of machine learning techniques, requirements have\nevolved beyond sheer high performance, often requiring models to be\ntrustworthy. A common approach to increase the trustworthiness of such systems\nis to allow them to refrain from predicting. Such a framework is known as\nselective prediction. While selective prediction for classification tasks has\nbeen widely analyzed, the problem of selective regression is understudied. This\npaper presents a novel approach to selective regression that utilizes\nmodel-agnostic non-parametric uncertainty estimation. Our proposed framework\nshowcases superior performance compared to state-of-the-art selective\nregressors, as demonstrated through comprehensive benchmarking on 69 datasets.\nFinally, we use explainable AI techniques to gain an understanding of the\ndrivers behind selective regression. We implement our selective regression\nmethod in the open-source Python package doubt and release the code used to\nreproduce our experiments.",

Formulating an inverse problem and exploiting\nreservoir computing, we develop a model-free and fully data-driven framework to\naccurately track time-varying parameters from partial state observation in real\ntime. In particular, with training data from a subset of the dynamical\nvariables of the system for a small number of known parameter values, the\nframework is able to accurately predict the parameter variations in time. Low-\nand high-dimensional, Markovian and non-Markovian nonlinear dynamical systems\nare used to demonstrate the power of the machine-learning based\nparameter-tracking framework.

            "summary": "The current best practice approach for the retrospective diagnosis of adverse\ndrug events (ADEs) in hospitalized patients relies on a full patient chart\nreview and a formal causality assessment by multiple medical experts. This\nevaluation serves to qualitatively estimate the probability of causation (PC);\nthe probability that a drug was a necessary cause of an adverse event. This\npractice is manual, resource intensive and prone to human biases, and may thus\nbenefit from data-driven decision support. Here, we pioneer a causal modeling\napproach using observational data to estimate a lower bound of the PC\n(PC$_{low}$). This method includes two key causal inference components: (1) the\ntarget trial emulation framework and (2) estimation of individualized treatment\neffects using machine learning. We apply our method to the clinically relevant\nuse-case of vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury in intensive care patients,\nand compare our causal model-based PC$_{low}$ estimates to qualitative\nestimates of the PC provided by a medical expert.

            "summary": "US corporations regularly spend millions of dollars reviewing\nelectronically-stored documents in legal matters. Recently, attorneys apply\ntext classification to efficiently cull massive volumes of data to identify\nresponsive documents for use in these matters. While text classification is\nregularly used to reduce the discovery costs of legal matters, it also faces a\nperception challenge: amongst lawyers, this technology is sometimes looked upon\nas a \"black box\". Put simply, no extra information is provided for attorneys to\nunderstand why documents are classified as responsive. In recent years,\nexplainable machine learning has emerged as an active research area. In an\nexplainable machine learning system, predictions or decisions made by a machine\nlearning model are human understandable. In legal 'document review' scenarios,\na document is responsive, because one or more of its small text snippets are\ndeemed responsive. In these scenarios, if these responsive snippets can be\nlocated, then attorneys could easily evaluate the model's document\nclassification decisions - this is especially important in the field of\nresponsible AI. Our prior research identified that predictive models created\nusing annotated training text snippets improved the precision of a model when\ncompared to a model created using all of a set of documents' text as training.\nWhile interesting, manually annotating training text snippets is not generally\npractical during a legal document review. However, small increases in precision\ncan drastically decrease the cost of large document reviews. Automating the\nidentification of training text snippets without human review could then make\nthe application of training text snippet-based models a practical approach.",

Our model\nis based on classical nucleation theory, taking the solvent to be a source of\nthe transient conditions in which the solute drops out of solution. Other than\nthat, the solvent is not directly involved in the nucleation process itself. We\napproximately solve the kinetic master equations using a combination of Laplace\ntransforms and singular perturbation theory, providing an analytical expression\nfor the nucleation flux, predicting that (i) the nucleation flux lags slightly\nbehind a commonly used quasi-steady-state approximation, an effect that is\ngoverned by two counteracting effects originating from the solvent evaporation:\nwhile a faster evaporation rate results in an increasingly larger influence of\nthe lag time on the nucleation flux, this lag time itself we find to decrease\nwith increasing evaporation rate, (ii) the nucleation flux and the\nquasi-steady-state nucleation flux are never identical, except trivially in the\nstationary limit and (iii) the initial induction period of the nucleation flux,\nwhich we characterize with a generalized induction time, decreases weakly with\nthe evaporation rate.

The naive $O(n^3)$-time algorithm was\ninitially improved by a $\\log^2{n}$ factor [Arlazarov et al.; RAS'70], then by\n$\\log^{2.25}{n}$ [Bansal and Williams; FOCS'09], then by $\\log^3{n}$ [Chan;\nSODA'15], and finally by $\\log^4{n}$ [Yu; ICALP'15].\n  We design a combinatorial algorithm for BMM running in time $n^3 /\n2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt[7]{\\log n})}$ -- a speed-up over cubic time that is stronger\nthan any poly-log factor. This comes tantalizingly close to refuting the\nconjecture from the 90s that truly subcubic combinatorial algorithms for BMM\nare impossible. This popular conjecture is the basis for dozens of fine-grained\nhardness results.\n  Our main technical contribution is a new regularity decomposition theorem for\nBoolean matrices (or equivalently, bipartite graphs) under a notion of\nregularity that was recently introduced and analyzed analytically in the\ncontext of communication complexity [Kelley, Lovett, Meka; arXiv'23], and is\nrelated to a similar notion from the recent work on $3$-term arithmetic\nprogression free sets [Kelley, Meka; FOCS'23].",

The feedback processes they exert on the interstellar medium\nimpact multiple physical processes, from the chemical to the dynamical\nevolution of the Galaxy. In addition, young and massive stellar clusters might\nact as efficient particle accelerators, possibly contributing to the production\nof cosmic rays. Aims. We aim at evaluating the wind luminosity driven by the\nyoung (< 30 Myr) Galactic open stellar clusters observed by the Gaia space\nmission, which is crucial to determine the energy channeled into accelerated\nparticles. Methods. To this extent, we develop a method relying on the number,\nmagnitude and line-of-sight extinction of the stars observed per cluster.\nAssuming that the stellar mass function follows a Kroupa mass distribution, and\naccounting for the maximum stellar mass allowed by both the parent cluster age\nand mass, we conservatively estimate the mass and wind luminosity of 387 local\nclusters within the second data release of Gaia. Results. We compare the\nresults of our computation with recent estimations of young cluster masses.\nWith respect to these, we provide a sample three times more abundant,\nparticularly above a few thousand solar masses, which is of the utmost\nrelevance for predicting the gamma-ray emission resulting from the interaction\nof accelerated particles. In fact, the cluster wind luminosity distribution we\nobtain is found to extend up to 3 x 10^38 erg/s, a promising feature in terms\nof potential particle acceleration scenarios.",

We consider hybrid stochastic agent-based\nmodels of branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis (new blood vessel creation\nfrom pre-existing vasculature), which treat cells as individuals that are\nguided by underlying continuous chemical and/or mechanical fields. In these\ndescriptions, leader (tip) cells emerge from existing branches and follower\n(stalk) cells build the new sprout in their wake. Vessel branching and fusion\n(anastomosis) occur as a result of tip and stalk cell dynamics. Coarse-graining\nthese hybrid models in appropriate limits produces continuum partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) for endothelial cell densities that are more\nanalytically tractable. While these models differ in nonlinearity, they produce\nsimilar equations at leading order when chemotaxis is dominant. We analyze this\nleading order system in a simple quasi-one-dimensional geometry and show that\nthe numerical solution of the leading order PDE is well described by a soliton\nwave that evolves from vessel to source. This wave is an attractor for\nintermediate times until it arrives at the hypoxic region releasing the growth\nfactor.

            "summary": "Soundscape studies typically attempt to capture the perception and\nunderstanding of sonic environments by surveying users. However, for long-term\nmonitoring or assessing interventions, sound-signal-based approaches are\nrequired. To this end, most previous research focused on psycho-acoustic\nquantities or automatic sound recognition. Few attempts were made to include\nappraisal (e.g., in circumplex frameworks). This paper proposes an artificial\nintelligence (AI)-based dual-branch convolutional neural network with\ncross-attention-based fusion (DCNN-CaF) to analyze automatic soundscape\ncharacterization, including sound recognition and appraisal. Using the DeLTA\ndataset containing human-annotated sound source labels and perceived annoyance,\nthe DCNN-CaF is proposed to perform sound source classification (SSC) and\nhuman-perceived annoyance rating prediction (ARP). Experimental findings\nindicate that (1) the proposed DCNN-CaF using loudness and Mel features\noutperforms the DCNN-CaF using only one of them. (2) The proposed DCNN-CaF with\ncross-attention fusion outperforms other typical AI-based models and\nsoundscape-related traditional machine learning methods on the SSC and ARP\ntasks. (3) Correlation analysis reveals that the relationship between sound\nsources and annoyance is similar for humans and the proposed AI-based DCNN-CaF\nmodel. (4) Generalization tests show that the proposed model's ARP in the\npresence of model-unknown sound sources is consistent with expert expectations\nand can explain previous findings from the literature on sound-scape\naugmentation.",

First, we assume that no\ncompact object grows over the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkof limit which marks the\nborderline between neutron stars and BHs.

In\nthe second test, we assume that masses of BHs at their formation stay the same\nover cosmic history.

In contrast to existing local or edge motion planning\nsolutions that ignore the interdependency between low-level motion planning and\nhigh-level resource allocation, EARN adopts model predictive switching (MPS)\nthat maximizes the expected switching gain w.r.t. robot states and actions\nunder computation and communication resource constraints. As such, each robot\ncan dynamically switch between a point-mass motion planner executed locally to\nguarantee safety (e.g., path-following) and a full-shape motion planner\nexecuted non-locally to guarantee efficiency (e.g., overtaking). The crux to\nEARN is a two-time scale integrated decision-planning algorithm based on\nbilevel mixed-integer optimization, and a fast conditional collision avoidance\nalgorithm based on penalty dual decomposition. We validate the performance of\nEARN in indoor simulation, outdoor simulation, and real-world environments.\nExperiments show that EARN achieves significantly smaller navigation time and\ncollision ratios than state-of-the-art navigation approaches.",

            "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary performance in various\nlanguage tasks, but high computational requirements hinder their widespread\ndeployment. Speculative decoding, which uses amateur models to predict the\ngeneration of expert models, has been proposed as a way to accelerate LLM\ninference. However, speculative decoding focuses on acceleration instead of\nmaking the best use of the token distribution from amateur models. We proposed\nSpeculative Contrastive Decoding (SCD), an accelerated decoding method\nleveraging the natural contrast between expert and amateur models in\nspeculative decoding. Comprehensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that\nSCD can achieve similar acceleration factors as speculative decoding while\nfurther improving the generation quality as the contrastive decoding. The\nanalysis of token probabilities further demonstrates the compatibility between\nspeculative and contrastive decoding. Overall, SCD provides an effective\napproach to enhance the decoding quality of LLMs while saving computational\nresources.",

            "summary": "The proliferation of space debris in LEO has become a major concern for the\nspace industry. With the growing interest in space exploration, the prediction\nof potential collisions between objects in orbit has become a crucial issue. It\nis estimated that, in orbit, there are millions of fragments a few millimeters\nin size and thousands of inoperative satellites and discarded rocket stages.\nGiven the high speeds that these fragments can reach, even fragments a few\nmillimeters in size can cause fractures in a satellite's hull or put a serious\ncrack in the window of a space shuttle. The conventional method proposed by\nAkella and Alfriend in 2000 remains widely used to estimate the probability of\ncollision in short-term encounters. Given the small period of time, it is\nassumed that, during the encounter: (1) trajectories are represented by\nstraight lines with constant velocity; (2) there is no velocity uncertainty and\nthe position exhibits a stationary distribution throughout the encounter; and\n(3) position uncertainties are independent and represented by Gaussian\ndistributions. This study introduces a novel derivation based on first\nprinciples that naturally allows for tight and fast upper and lower bounds for\nthe probability of collision. We tested implementations of both probability and\nbound computations with the original and our formulation on a real CDM dataset\nused in ESA's Collision Avoidance Challenge. Our approach reduces the\ncalculation of the probability to two one-dimensional integrals and has the\npotential to significantly reduce the processing time compared to the\ntraditional method, from 80% to nearly real-time.",

            "summary": "Context: Radio wavelengths offer a unique possibility of tracing the total\nstar-formation rate (SFR) in galaxies, both obscured and unobscured. To prob\nthe dust-unbiased star-formation history, an accurate measurement of the radio\nluminosity function (LF) for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is crucial. Aims: We\nmake use of an SFG sample (5915 sources) from the Very Large Array (VLA) COSMOS\n3 GHz data to perform a new modeling of the radio LF. By integrating the\nanalytical LF we aim to calculate the cosmic SFR density (SFRD) history since\n$z\\sim5$. Methods: For the first time, we use both models of the pure\nluminosity evolution (PLE) and joint luminosity+density evolution (LADE) to fit\nthe LFs directly to the radio data using a full maximum likelihood analysis,\nconsidering the sample completeness correction. We also incorporate the updated\nobservations on local radio LFs and radio source counts into the fitting\nprocess to obtain additional constraints. Results: We find that the PLE model\nis not applicable to describe the evolution of the radio LF at high redshift\n($z>2$). By construct, our LADE models can successfully fit a large amount of\ndata on radio LFs and source counts of SFGs from recent observations. Our SFRD\ncurve shows a good fit to the SFRD points derived by previous radio estimates.\nIn view of that our radio LFs are not biased in contrast to previous studies\nperformed by fitting the $1/V_{\\rm max}$ LF points, our SFRD results should be\nan improvement to these previous estimates. Below $z<2$, our SFRD matches well\nwith the multi-wavelength compilation from Madau \\& Dickinson, while our SFRD\nturns over at a slightly higher redshift ($2<z<2.5$) and falls more rapidly out\nto high redshift.",

            "summary": "Elastic metamaterials are man-made structures with properties that transcend\nnaturally occurring materials. One of the most predominant features of elastic\nmetamaterials is locally-resonant bandgaps, i.e., frequency ranges at which\nwave propagation is blocked. Locally-resonant bandgaps appear at relatively low\nfrequency and arise from the existence of periodically placed mechanical local\nresonators. Typically, elastic metamaterials exhibit both locally-resonant and\nBragg-scattering bandgaps, which can generally be different in width and\nfrequency ranges. This paper proposes two designs of active metamaterials that\nonly exhibit locally-resonant bandgaps, which are infinite in number, evenly\nspaced in the frequency spectrum, and identical in width. The mathematical\nmodel is established using the transfer matrix method (TMM) and synthesis of\nlocally-resonant bandgaps is achieved via an active elastic element with\ncarefully designed frequency-dependent stiffness. A single unit cell of the\nactive metamaterial is thoroughly studied, and its dispersion relation is\nderived analytically, along with the bandgap limits and width. Following the\ndispersion analysis and bandgap parametric studies, finite arrays of the\nproposed active metamaterials are considered, and their frequency response is\ninvestigated and used to verify the analytical predictions from dispersion\nanalyses. The proposed mathematical framework establishes a design methodology\nthat could be further used to synthesize interesting dispersion behaviors in\nthe future.",

Firstly, we postulate that\na good uncertainty measure should indicate predictions likely to be incorrect\nwith high uncertainty values. Second, we investigate the merit of quantifying\nuncertainty at different anatomical scales (voxel, lesion, or patient). We\nhypothesize that uncertainty at each scale is related to specific types of\nerrors. Our study aims to confirm this relationship by conducting separate\nanalyses for in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our primary methodological\ncontributions are (i) the development of novel measures for quantifying\nuncertainty at lesion and patient scales, derived from structural prediction\ndiscrepancies, and (ii) the extension of an error retention curve analysis\nframework to facilitate the evaluation of UQ performance at both lesion and\npatient scales. The results from a multi-centric MRI dataset of 172 patients\ndemonstrate that our proposed measures more effectively capture model errors at\nthe lesion and patient scales compared to measures that average voxel-scale\nuncertainty values.

            "summary": "Exploring the application of powerful large language models (LLMs) on the\nfundamental named entity recognition (NER) task has drawn much attention\nrecently. This work aims to investigate the possibilities of pushing the\nboundary of zero-shot NER with LLM via a training-free self-improving strategy.\nWe propose a self-improving framework, which utilize an unlabeled corpus to\nstimulate the self-learning ability of LLMs on NER. First, we use LLM to make\npredictions on the unlabeled corpus and obtain the self-annotated data. Second,\nwe explore various strategies to select reliable samples from the\nself-annotated dataset as demonstrations, considering the similarity, diversity\nand reliability of demonstrations. Finally, we conduct inference for the test\nquery via in-context learning with the selected self-annotated demonstrations.\nThrough comprehensive experimental analysis, our study yielded the following\nfindings: (1) The self-improving framework further pushes the boundary of\nzero-shot NER with LLMs, and achieves an obvious performance improvement; (2)\nIterative self-improving or naively increasing the size of unlabeled corpus\ndoes not guarantee improvements; (3) There might still be space for improvement\nvia more advanced strategy for reliable entity selection.",

            "summary": "With the detection of black hole mergers by the LIGO gravitational wave\ntelescope, there has been increasing interest in the possibility that dark\nmatter may be in the form of solar mass primordial black holes. One of the\npredictions implicit in this idea is that compact clouds in the broad emission\nline regions of high redshift quasars will be microlensed, leading to changes\nin line structure and the appearance of new emission features. In this paper\nthe effect of microlensing on the broad emission line region is reviewed by\nreference to gravitationally lensed quasar systems where microlensing of the\nemission lines can be unambiguously identified. It is then shown that although\nchanges in Seyfert galaxy line profiles occur on timescales of a few years,\nthey are too nearby for a significant chance that they could be microlensed,\nand are plausibly attributed to intrinsic changes in line structure. In\ncontrast, in a sample of 53 high redshift quasars, 9 quasars show large changes\nin line profile at a rate consistent with microlensing. These changes occur on\na timescale an order of magnitude too short for changes associated with the\ndynamics of the emission line region. The main conclusion of the paper is that\nthe observed changes in quasar emission line profiles are consistent with\nmicrolensing by a population of solar mass compact bodies making up the dark\nmatter, although other explanations like intrinsic variability are possible.\nSuch bodies are most plausibly identified as primordial black holes.",

            "summary": "The majority of primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors in the brain are\namong the most aggressive diseases affecting humans. Early detection of brain\ntumor types, whether benign or malignant, glial or non-glial, is critical for\ncancer prevention and treatment, ultimately improving human life expectancy.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) stands as the most effective technique to\ndetect brain tumors by generating comprehensive brain images through scans.\nHowever, human examination can be error-prone and inefficient due to the\ncomplexity, size, and location variability of brain tumors. Recently, automated\nclassification techniques using machine learning (ML) methods, such as\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN), have demonstrated significantly higher\naccuracy than manual screening, while maintaining low computational costs.\nNonetheless, deep learning-based image classification methods, including CNN,\nface challenges in estimating class probabilities without proper model\ncalibration. In this paper, we propose a novel brain tumor image classification\nmethod, called SIBOW-SVM, which integrates the Bag-of-Features (BoF) model with\nSIFT feature extraction and weighted Support Vector Machines (wSVMs). This new\napproach effectively captures hidden image features, enabling the\ndifferentiation of various tumor types and accurate label predictions.\nAdditionally, the SIBOW-SVM is able to estimate the probabilities of images\nbelonging to each class, thereby providing high-confidence classification\ndecisions. We have also developed scalable and parallelable algorithms to\nfacilitate the practical implementation of SIBOW-SVM for massive images. As a\nbenchmark, we apply the SIBOW-SVM to a public data set of brain tumor MRI\nimages containing four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and normal. Our\nresults show that the new method outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nincluding CNN.",

In\nthe vocabulary curriculum, we analyze methods for constraining the vocabulary\nin the early stages of training to simulate cognitively more plausible learning\ncurves. In the data curriculum experiments, we vary the order of the training\ninstances based on i) infant-inspired expectations and ii) the learning\nbehavior of the model. In the objective curriculum, we explore different\nvariations of combining the conventional masked language modeling task with a\nmore coarse-grained word class prediction task to reinforce linguistic\ngeneralization capabilities. Our results did not yield consistent improvements\nover our own non-curriculum learning baseline across a range of linguistic\nbenchmarks; however, we do find marginal gains on select tasks. Our analysis\nhighlights key takeaways for specific combinations of tasks and settings which\nbenefit from our proposed curricula.

The evolution of\nbulk properties of the low-lying electric dipole response has been investigated\non the basis of the Oslo GSF data and results of a recent systematic study of\nelectric and magnetic dipole strengths in even-even Sn isotopes with\nrelativistic Coulomb excitation. The obtained GSFs reveal a resonance-like peak\non top of the tail of the isovector giant dipole resonance, centered at\n$\\approx$8 MeV and exhausting $\\approx$2\\% of the classical Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn\n(TRK) sum. In contrast to predictions of the relativistic quasiparticle\nrandom-phase and time-blocking approximation calculations (RQRPA and RQTBA), no\nmonotonous increase in the total low-lying $E1$ strength was observed in the\nexperimental data from $^{111}$Sn to $^{124}$Sn, demonstrating rather similar\nstrength distributions in these nuclei.

            "summary": "Recent endeavors in video temporal grounding enforce strong cross-modal\ninteractions through attention mechanisms to overcome the modality gap between\nvideo and text query. However, previous works treat all video clips equally\nregardless of their semantic relevance with the text query in attention\nmodules. In this paper, our goal is to provide clues for query-associated video\nclips within the crossmodal encoding process. With our Correlation-Guided\nDetection Transformer~(CG-DETR), we explore the appropriate clip-wise degree of\ncross-modal interactions and how to exploit such degrees for prediction. First,\nwe design an adaptive cross-attention layer with dummy tokens. Dummy tokens\nconditioned by text query take a portion of the attention weights, preventing\nirrelevant video clips from being represented by the text query. Yet, not all\nword tokens equally inherit the text query's correlation to video clips. Thus,\nwe further guide the cross-attention map by inferring the fine-grained\ncorrelation between video clips and words. We enable this by learning a joint\nembedding space for high-level concepts, i.e., moment and sentence level, and\ninferring the clip-word correlation. Lastly, we use a moment-adaptive saliency\ndetector to exploit each video clip's degrees of text engagement. We validate\nthe superiority of CG-DETR with the state-of-the-art results on various\nbenchmarks for both moment retrieval and highlight detection.

The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting\na suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic\nconditions, variability in the control action, and violations of a\nsafety-critical constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An\nMPC-based RL approach, which merges the advantages of the two paradigms in\norder to overcome the shortcomings of each framework, is proposed to learn to\nefficiently control an on-ramp and to satisfy its constraints despite\nuncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Finally, simulations\nare performed on a benchmark from the literature consisting of a small-scale\nhighway network. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an\nimprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to\neffectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the\nnetwork is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved\nperformance compared to the initial controller.",

The measured rate of change of\nits orbital period is $\\dot{P}_{\\rm orb}=-131^{+20}_{-22}\\mathrm{ms/yr}$, which\ncan be explained by tidal dissipation in the star if its modified tidal quality\nfactor is as low as $Q^{\\,\\prime}\\approx 2.50\\times {10}^{4}$. We explore\nwhether this could plausibly be consistent with theoretical predictions based\non applying up-to-date tidal theory in stellar models (varying stellar mass,\nage, and metallicity) consistent with our newly-derived observational\nconstraints. In most of our models matching the combined constraints on the\nstellar effective temperature and radius, the dissipation in the star is far\ntoo weak, capable of providing $Q^{\\,\\prime}\\gtrsim 10^9$, hence contributing\nnegligibly to orbital evolution. Using only constraints on the stellar radius,\nefficient tidal dissipation sufficient to explain observations is possible due\nto inertial waves in the convective envelope during the sub-giant phase,\nproviding $Q^{\\,\\prime}\\sim 10^4$, but this period in the evolution is very\nshort-lived (shorter than $10^2$ yrs in our models). We show that dissipation\nin the planet is capable of explaining the observed $\\dot{P}_\\mathrm{orb}$ only\nif the planet rotates non-synchronously. Tidally-induced pericentre precession\nis a viable explanation if the periastron argument is near $3\\pi/2$ and the\nquadrupolar Love number is above 0.26.

To address this\nlimitation, we combine electronic friction with Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics\n(RPMD). In particular, we apply the averaged electronic friction from the metal\nsurface to the centroid mode of the ring polymer. We benchmark our approach\nagainst quantum dynamics to show that electronic friction with RPMD (EF-RPMD)\ncan capture zero-point energy as well as transition dynamics accurately. In\naddition, we show EF-RPMD can correctly predict the electronic transfer rate\nnear metal surfaces in the tunneling limit as well as the barrier crossing\nlimit.

This paper lays the\ngroundwork for three theoretical conjectures. First, unexpectedness can be seen\nas a generalization of Bayes' rule. Second, the frequentist core of\nunexpectedness can be connected to the function of tracking ergodic properties\nof the world. Third, unexpectedness can be seen as constituent of various\nmeasures of divergence between the entropy of the world (environment) and the\nvariety of the observer (system).

However, there\nexists significant discrepancy between in vitro cell lines and actual tumors in\nvivo in terms of their response to drug treatments, because of tumors comprise\nof complex cellular compositions and histopathology structure, known as tumor\nmicroenvironment (TME), which greatly influences the drug cytotoxicity against\ntumor cells. To date, no study has focused on modeling the impact of the TME on\nclinical drug response. This paper proposed a domain adaptation network for\nfeature disentanglement to separate representations of cancer cells and TME of\na tumor in patients. Two denoising autoencoders were separately used to extract\nfeatures from cell lines (source domain) and tumors (target domain) for partial\ndomain alignment and feature decoupling. The specific encoder was enforced to\nextract information only about TME. Moreover, to ensure generalizability to\nnovel drugs, we applied a graph attention network to learn the latent\nrepresentation of drugs, allowing us to linearly model the drug perturbation on\ncellular state in latent space. We calibrated our model on a benchmark dataset\nand demonstrated its superior performance in predicting clinical drug response\nand dissecting the influence of the TME on drug efficacy.",

While there has been notable work on scaling up these models for big\ndata, existing methods typically rely on a stationary GP assumption for\napproximation, and can thus perform poorly when the underlying response surface\nis non-stationary, i.e., it has some regions of rapid change and other regions\nwith little change. Such non-stationarity is, however, ubiquitous in real-world\nproblems, including our motivating application for surrogate modeling of\ncomputer experiments. We thus propose a new Product of Sparse GP (ProSpar-GP)\nmethod for scalable GP modeling with massive non-stationary data. The\nProSpar-GP makes use of a carefully-constructed product-of-experts formulation\nof sparse GP experts, where different experts are placed within local regions\nof non-stationarity. These GP experts are fit via a novel variational inference\napproach, which capitalizes on mini-batching and GPU acceleration for efficient\noptimization of inducing points and length-scale parameters for each expert. We\nfurther show that the ProSpar-GP is Kolmogorov-consistent, in that its\ngenerative distribution defines a valid stochastic process over the prediction\nspace; such a property provides essential stability for variational inference,\nparticularly in the presence of non-stationarity. We then demonstrate the\nimproved performance of the ProSpar-GP over the state-of-the-art, in a suite of\nnumerical experiments and an application for surrogate modeling of a satellite\ndrag simulator.",

In this study, we propose a novel graph\nneural network to Disentangle the Potential impacts of Papers into Diffusion,\nConformity, and Contribution values (called DPPDCC). Given a target paper,\nDPPDCC encodes temporal and structural features within the constructed dynamic\nheterogeneous graph. Particularly, to capture the knowledge flow, we emphasize\nthe importance of comparative and co-cited/citing information between papers\nand aggregate snapshots evolutionarily. To unravel popularity, we contrast\naugmented graphs to extract the essence of diffusion and predict the\naccumulated citation binning to model conformity. We further apply orthogonal\nconstraints to encourage distinct modeling of each perspective and preserve the\ninherent value of contribution. To evaluate models' generalization for papers\npublished at various times, we reformulate the problem by partitioning data\nbased on specific time points to mirror real-world conditions. Extensive\nexperimental results on three datasets demonstrate that DPPDCC significantly\noutperforms baselines for previously, freshly, and immediately published\npapers. Further analyses confirm its robust capabilities. We will make our\ndatasets and codes publicly available.",

This study focuses on\nstatic and dynamic Hertzian contact as an example of transient stress field\nreconstructions. For the static Hertzian contact (a solid sphere pressed\nagainst a gel block), all stress components in the urethane gel, which has an\nelastic modulus of 47.4 kPa, were reconstructed by PT using the measured\nphotoelastic parameters. The results were compared with theoretical solutions\nand showed good agreement. For the dynamic Hertzian contact (a sphere impacting\ngel), a high-speed polarization camera was used to reconstruct the transient\nstress field within the gel. PT was used to quantitatively measure the shear\nand axial stress waves and showed different propagation speeds on the\nsubstrate. The technique allowed the simultaneous measurement of stress fields\nranging from $O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^1)$ kPa during large deformations,\ndemonstrating its accuracy in capturing rapidly changing stress tensor\ncomponents in dynamic scenarios. The scaling laws of the calculated impact\nforce agreed with theoretical predictions, validating the accuracy of PT for\nmeasuring dynamic axisymmetric stress fields in soft materials.",

We prove that every\n$\\mbox{Aut}(\\mathfrak{D})$-invariant strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler\nmetric $F$ on a classical domain $\\mathfrak{D}$ of rank $\\geq 2$ is a\nK\\\"ahler-Berwald metric which is not necessary Hermitian quadratic, but it\nenjoys very similar curvature property as that of the Bergman metric on\n$\\mathfrak{D}$. In particular, if $F$ is Hermitian quadratic, then $F$ is must\nbe a constant multiple of the Bergman metric on $\\mathfrak{D}$. This actually\nanswers the $4$-th open problem posed by Bland and Kalka in [7]. We also obtain\na general Schwarz lemma for holomorphic maps from a classical domain\n$\\mathfrak{D}_1$ into another classical domain $\\mathfrak{D}_2$ whenever\n$\\mathfrak{D}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{D}_2$ are endowed with arbitrary holomorphic\ninvariant K\\\"ahler-Berwald metrics $F_1$ and $F_2$, respectively. The method\nused to prove the Schwarz lemma is purely geometric. Our results show that the\nLu constant of $(\\mathfrak{D},F)$ is both an analytic invariant and a geometric\ninvariant which can only be more clearly seen in the complex Finsler setting.\nThis also gives a nontrivial generalization of the classical Schwarz lemma on\nthe classical domains previously established case-by-case by Look [31] with\nrespect to the Bergman metric.",

NER tasks aim to extract entities and\npredict their labels given a text, which is important in information\nextraction.

This work focuses on UE-NER, which aims to estimate uncertainty\nscores for the NER predictions. Previous uncertainty estimation models often\noverlook two unique characteristics of NER: the connection between entities\n(i.e., one entity embedding is learned based on the other ones) and wrong span\ncases in the entity extraction subtask. Therefore, we propose a Sequential\nLabeling Posterior Network (SLPN) to estimate uncertainty scores for the\nextracted entities, considering uncertainty transmitted from other tokens.\nMoreover, we have defined an evaluation strategy to address the specificity of\nwrong-span cases.

            "summary": "Extracting users' interests from their lifelong behavior sequence is crucial\nfor predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR). Most current methods employ a\ntwo-stage process for efficiency: they first select historical behaviors\nrelated to the candidate item and then deduce the user's interest from this\nnarrowed-down behavior sub-sequence. This two-stage paradigm, though effective,\nleads to information loss. Solely using users' lifelong click behaviors doesn't\nprovide a complete picture of their interests, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. In our research, we introduce the Deep Group Interest Network\n(DGIN), an end-to-end method to model the user's entire behavior history. This\nincludes all post-registration actions, such as clicks, cart additions,\npurchases, and more, providing a nuanced user understanding. We start by\ngrouping the full range of behaviors using a relevant key (like item_id) to\nenhance efficiency. This process reduces the behavior length significantly,\nfrom O(10^4) to O(10^2). To mitigate the potential loss of information due to\ngrouping, we incorporate two categories of group attributes. Within each group,\nwe calculate statistical information on various heterogeneous behaviors (like\nbehavior counts) and employ self-attention mechanisms to highlight unique\nbehavior characteristics (like behavior type). Based on this reorganized\nbehavior data, the user's interests are derived using the Transformer\ntechnique. Additionally, we identify a subset of behaviors that share the same\nitem_id with the candidate item from the lifelong behavior sequence. The\ninsights from this subset reveal the user's decision-making process related to\nthe candidate item, improving prediction accuracy. Our comprehensive\nevaluation, both on industrial and public datasets, validates DGIN's efficacy\nand efficiency.",

The market maker rewards these\nliquidity providers with a cut of the trading fees, in exchange for the risk\nthey take on. A handful of protocols for liquidity provisioning have been\nproposed, such as Uniswap V2 and V3, with specific and sometimes complex rules\nfor collecting liquidity deposits, executing trades, and dividing up fees.\nBeyond these examples, and a broader understanding of liquidity provisioning,\nand particularly the design space from which one could choose a different\nprotocols, has been out of reach. In this work, we show that one can view\nliquidity provisioning very broadly as the practice of running several market\nmakers \"in parallel\": each market maker provides its own liquidity, yet the\ncombined group can operate as a single coherent market. We prove that this\ngeneral protocol, when restricted to specific forms of the constituent market\nmakers, recovers Uniswap V2 and V3 as special cases. We then go on to propose a\nnew restriction which may have advantages over Uniswap V3. In the context of\nprediction markets, where computation costs are less constrained, our general\nprotocol gives a maximally flexible way to provision liquidity. We conclude\nwith remarks about the nature of liquidity and fees in markets with more than 2\nassets, and several open questions.",

            "summary": "Uncertainty decomposition refers to the task of decomposing the total\nuncertainty of a model into data (aleatoric) uncertainty, resulting from the\ninherent complexity or ambiguity of the data, and model (epistemic)\nuncertainty, resulting from the lack of knowledge in the model. Performing\nuncertainty decomposition for large language models (LLMs) is an important step\ntoward improving the reliability, trustworthiness, and interpretability of\nLLMs, but this research task is very challenging and remains unresolved. The\nexisting canonical method, Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), cannot be applied to\nLLMs, because BNN requires training and ensembling multiple variants of models,\nwhich is infeasible or prohibitively expensive for LLMs. In this paper, we\nintroduce an uncertainty decomposition framework for LLMs, called input\nclarifications ensemble, which bypasses the need to train new models. Rather\nthan ensembling models with different parameters, our approach generates a set\nof clarifications for the input, feeds them into the fixed LLMs, and ensembles\nthe corresponding predictions. We show that our framework shares a symmetric\ndecomposition structure with BNN. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the\nproposed framework provides accurate and reliable uncertainty quantification on\nvarious tasks.

            "summary": "Nonlinear dynamics bring difficulties to controller design for control-affine\nsystems such as tractor-trailer vehicles, especially when the parameters in\ndynamics are unknown. To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based\nlifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite\ndimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to\nthe original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and\nbounds of state prediction errors caused by the the truncation in derivative\norder. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as\npredictive model in next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control\n(K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the\nbilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input.\nThen the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a\nquadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each\niteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our\nalgorithm on a tractor-trailer dynamic system, taking into account the\nlongitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed\nKoopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has\ngood prediction performance. Closed loop tracking results show the proposed\nK-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision along with commendable\ncomputational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility\nof the proposed method.",

            "summary": "Precise estimation of Crash Modification Factors (CMFs) is central to\nevaluating the effectiveness of various road safety treatments and prioritizing\ninfrastructure investment accordingly. While customized study for each\ncountermeasure scenario is desired, the conventional CMF estimation approaches\nrely heavily on the availability of crash data at given sites. This not only\nmakes the estimation costly, but the results are also less transferable, since\nthe intrinsic similarities between different safety countermeasure scenarios\nare not fully explored. Aiming to fill this gap, this study introduces a novel\nknowledge-mining framework for CMF prediction. This framework delves into the\nconnections of existing countermeasures and reduces the reliance of CMF\nestimation on crash data availability and manual data collection. Specifically,\nit draws inspiration from human comprehension processes and introduces advanced\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract intricate variations\nand patterns from existing CMF knowledge. It effectively encodes unstructured\ncountermeasure scenarios into machine-readable representations and models the\ncomplex relationships between scenarios and CMF values. This new data-driven\nframework provides a cost-effective and adaptable solution that complements the\ncase-specific approaches for CMF estimation, which is particularly beneficial\nwhen availability of crash data or time imposes constraints. Experimental\nvalidation using real-world CMF Clearinghouse data demonstrates the\neffectiveness of this new approach, which shows significant accuracy\nimprovements compared to baseline methods. This approach provides insights into\nnew possibilities of harnessing accumulated transportation knowledge in various\napplications.",

These observations were conducted in 2017 using a\nglobal interferometric array of eight telescopes operating at a wavelength of\n$\\lambda=1.3\\,{\\rm mm}$. The EHT data resolve a compact emission region with\nintrahour variability. A variety of imaging and modeling analyses all support\nan image that is dominated by a bright, thick ring with a diameter of $51.8 \\pm\n2.3$\\,\\uas (68\\% credible interval). The ring has modest azimuthal brightness\nasymmetry and a comparatively dim interior. Using a large suite of numerical\nsimulations, we demonstrate that the EHT images of Sgr A$^*$ are consistent\nwith the expected appearance of a Kerr black hole with mass ${\\sim}4 \\times\n10^6\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$, which is inferred to exist at this location based on\nprevious infrared observations of individual stellar orbits as well as maser\nproper motion studies. Our model comparisons disfavor scenarios where the black\nhole is viewed at high inclination ($i > 50^\\circ$), as well as non-spinning\nblack holes and those with retrograde accretion disks. Our results provide\ndirect evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of\nthe Milky Way galaxy, and for the first time we connect the predictions from\ndynamical measurements of stellar orbits on scales of $10^3-10^5$ gravitational\nradii to event horizon-scale images and variability.

Federated learning is a\ndecentralized approach where model training occurs on client sides, preserving\nprivacy by keeping data localized. Instead of sending raw data to a central\nserver, only model updates are exchanged, enhancing data security. We apply\nthis framework to Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) in this work.

Beside the L1 norm regularization term in\nconventional SPCA, we add a smoothing function to facilitate gradient-based\noptimization methods. Moreover, in order to improve computational efficiency,\nwe introduce a least squares approximation to original SPCA. This enables\nanalytic solutions on the optimization processes, leading to substantial\ncomputational improvements. Within the federated framework, we formulate SPCA\nas a consensus optimization problem, which can be solved using the Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

            "summary": "We study semi-supervised sequence prediction tasks where labeled data are too\nscarce to effectively finetune a model and at the same time few-shot prompting\nof a large language model (LLM) has suboptimal performance. This happens when a\ntask, such as parsing, is expensive to annotate and also unfamiliar to a\npretrained LLM. In this paper, we present a discovery that student models\ndistilled from a prompted LLM can often generalize better than their teacher on\nsuch tasks. Leveraging this finding, we propose a new distillation method,\nmultistage collaborative knowledge distillation from an LLM (MCKD), for such\ntasks. MCKD first prompts an LLM using few-shot in-context learning to produce\npseudolabels for unlabeled data. Then, at each stage of distillation, a pair of\nstudents are trained on disjoint partitions of the pseudolabeled data. Each\nstudent subsequently produces new and improved pseudolabels for the unseen\npartition to supervise the next round of student(s) with. We show the benefit\nof multistage cross-partition labeling on two constituency parsing tasks. On\nCRAFT biomedical parsing, 3-stage MCKD with 50 labeled examples matches the\nperformance of supervised finetuning with 500 examples and outperforms the\nprompted LLM and vanilla KD by 7.5% and 3.7% parsing F1, respectively.",

            "summary": "Traffic congestion event prediction is an important yet challenging task in\nintelligent transportation systems. Many existing works about traffic\nprediction integrate various temporal encoders and graph convolution networks\n(GCNs), called spatio-temporal graph-based neural networks, which focus on\npredicting dense variables such as flow, speed and demand in time snapshots,\nbut they can hardly forecast the traffic congestion events that are sparsely\ndistributed on the continuous time axis. In recent years, neural point process\n(NPP) has emerged as an appropriate framework for event prediction in\ncontinuous time scenarios. However, most conventional works about NPP cannot\nmodel the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and congestion evolution\npatterns. To address these limitations, we propose a spatio-temporal graph\nneural point process framework, named STGNPP for traffic congestion event\nprediction. Specifically, we first design the spatio-temporal graph learning\nmodule to fully capture the long-range spatio-temporal dependencies from the\nhistorical traffic state data along with the road network. The extracted\nspatio-temporal hidden representation and congestion event information are then\nfed into a continuous gated recurrent unit to model the congestion evolution\npatterns. In particular, to fully exploit the periodic information, we also\nimprove the intensity function calculation of the point process with a periodic\ngated mechanism. Finally, our model simultaneously predicts the occurrence time\nand duration of the next congestion. Extensive experiments on two real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in\ncomparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

Sepsis is the result of a dysregulated immune response to infection\nthat can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and death. Due to the wide\nvariability in the causes of sepsis, clinical presentation, and the recovery\ntrajectories identifying sepsis sub-phenotypes is crucial to advance our\nunderstanding of sepsis characterization, identifying targeted treatments and\noptimal timing of interventions, and improving prognostication. Prior studies\nhave described different sub-phenotypes of sepsis with organ-specific\ncharacteristics. These studies applied clustering algorithms to electronic\nhealth records (EHRs) to identify disease sub-phenotypes. However, prior\napproaches did not capture temporal information and made uncertain assumptions\nabout the relationships between the sub-phenotypes for clustering procedures.\nWe develop a time-aware soft clustering algorithm guided by clinical context to\nidentify sepsis sub-phenotypes using data from the EHR. We identified six novel\nsepsis hybrid sub-phenotypes and evaluated them for medical plausibility. In\naddition, we built an early-warning sepsis prediction model using logistic\nregression. Our results suggest that these novel sepsis hybrid sub-phenotypes\nare promising to provide more precise information on the recovery trajectory\nwhich can be important to inform management decisions and sepsis prognosis.",

To accelerate the inference, we propose an approach\nof performing Dynamic Early Exit on Decoder (DEED). We build a multi-exit\nencoder-decoder transformer model which is trained with deep supervision so\nthat each of its decoder layers is capable of generating plausible predictions.\nIn addition, we leverage simple yet practical techniques, including shared\ngeneration head and adaptation modules, to keep accuracy when exiting at\nshallow decoder layers. Based on the multi-exit model, we perform step-level\ndynamic early exit during inference, where the model may decide to use fewer\ndecoder layers based on its confidence of the current layer at each individual\ndecoding step. Considering different number of decoder layers may be used at\ndifferent decoding steps, we compute deeper-layer decoder features of previous\ndecoding steps just-in-time, which ensures the features from different decoding\nsteps are semantically aligned.

The text-VQA task requires a\nmodel to answer a question by understanding multi-modal content: text\n(typically from OCR) and an associated image. To the best of our knowledge,\nalmost all previous approaches for text-VQA process a single question and its\nassociated content to predict a single answer. In order to answer multiple\nquestions from the same image, each question and content are fed into the model\nmultiple times. In contrast, our proposed MQMA approach takes multiple\nquestions and content as input at the encoder and predicts multiple answers at\nthe decoder in an auto-regressive manner at the same time. We make several\nnovel architectural modifications to standard encoder-decoder transformers to\nsupport MQMA. We also propose a novel MQMA denoising pre-training task which is\ndesigned to teach the model to align and delineate multiple questions and\ncontent with associated answers. MQMA pre-trained model achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on multiple text-VQA datasets, each with strong\nbaselines.

The traditional machine learning (ML) based Intrusion\nDetection System (IDS) requires the raw data to be captured and sent to the ML\nprocessor to detect intrusion. In this research, we examine the viability of a\ncross-device federated intrusion detection mechanism where each device runs the\nML model on its data and updates the model weights to the central coordinator.\nThis mechanism ensures the client's data is not shared with any third party,\nterminating privacy leakage. The model examines each data packet separately and\npredicts anomalies. We evaluate our proposed mechanism on a real botnet\npropagation dataset called MedBIoT.

In this paper, we propose the\nFlipFlop experiment: in the first round of the conversation, an LLM responds to\na prompt containing a classification task. In a second round, the LLM is\nchallenged with a follow-up phrase like \"Are you sure?\", offering an\nopportunity for the model to reflect on its initial answer, and decide whether\nto confirm or flip its answer. A systematic study of nine LLMs on seven\nclassification tasks reveals that models flip their answers on average 46% of\nthe time and that all models see a deterioration of accuracy between their\nfirst and final prediction, with an average drop of 17%. The FlipFlop\nexperiment illustrates the universality of sycophantic behavior in LLMs and\nprovides a robust framework to analyze model behavior and evaluate potential\nsolutions.",

            "summary": "Surfactant transport plays an important role in many technical processes and\nindustrial applications such as chemical reactors, microfluidics, printing and\ncoating technology. High fidelity numerical simulations of two-phase flow\nphenomena reveal rich insights into the flow dynamics, heat, mass and species\ntransport. In the present study, a two-field formulation for surfactant\ntransport within the algebraic volume of fluid method is presented. The slight\ndiffuse nature of representing the interface in the algebraic volume of fluid\nmethod is utilized to track the concentration of surfactant at the interface as\na volumetric concentration. Transport of insoluble and soluble surfactants is\ninvestigated by tracking two different concentrations of the surfactant, one\nwithin the bulk of the liquid and the other one at the interface. These two\ntransport equations are in turn coupled by source terms considering the\nad-/desorption processes at a liquid-gas interface. Appropriate boundary\nconditions at a solid-fluid interface are formulated to ensure surfactant\nconservation, while also enabling to study the ad-/desorption processes at a\nsolid-fluid interface. The developed numerical method is verified by comparing\nthe numerical simulations with well-known analytical and numerical reference\nsolutions. The presented numerical methodology offers a seamless integration of\nsurfactant transport into the algebraic volume of fluid method, where the\nlatter has many advantages such as volume conservation and an inherent ability\nof handling large interface deformations and topological changes.",

Assessing the\npresence and severity of pain is imperative to prevent such outcomes and\ndetermine the appropriate intervention. However, the evaluation of pain\nintensity is challenging because different individuals experience pain\ndifferently. To overcome this, researchers have employed machine learning\nmodels to evaluate pain intensity objectively. However, these efforts have\nprimarily focused on point estimation of pain, disregarding the inherent\nuncertainty and variability present in the data and model. Consequently, the\npoint estimates provide only partial information for clinical decision-making.\nThis study presents a neural network-based method for objective pain interval\nestimation, incorporating uncertainty quantification. This work explores three\nalgorithms: the bootstrap method, lower and upper bound estimation (LossL)\noptimized by genetic algorithm, and modified lower and upper bound estimation\n(LossS) optimized by gradient descent algorithm. Our empirical results reveal\nthat LossS outperforms the other two by providing a narrower prediction\ninterval. As LossS outperforms, we assessed its performance in three different\nscenarios for pain assessment: (1) a generalized approach (single model for the\nentire population), (2) a personalized approach (separate model for each\nindividual), and (3) a hybrid approach (separate model for each cluster of\nindividuals). Our findings demonstrate the hybrid approach's superior\nperformance, with notable practicality in clinical contexts. It has the\npotential to be a valuable tool for clinicians, enabling objective pain\nintensity assessment while taking uncertainty into account. This capability is\ncrucial in facilitating effective pain management and reducing the risks\nassociated with improper treatment.",

As greater dispersion of the population risk\ndistribution produces greater separation of patient and nonpatient risks\n(discrimination), its parameters can be used as alternatives to the ROC curve\nAUC and C-statistic. Here continuous probability distributions are employed to\ndevelop insight into the relationship between their parameters and the ROC\ncurve AUC and C-statistic derived from them.\n  The ROC curve AUC and C-statistic are shown to have a straight-line\nrelationship with the SD for uniform, half-sine, and symmetric triangular\nprobability distributions, with slight differences in the slope: AUC approx\n1/2+0.28 SD/(mean(1-mean)). This also characterizes the beta distribution over\nthe same range of SD's. But at larger beta distribution SD's the plot of AUC\nversus SD deviates downward from this straight-line relationship, approaching\nthe ROC curve AUC and SD of a perfect model (AUC=1, SD= $\\sqrt{\\rm\nmean(1-mean)}$).\n  A simpler and more intuitive discrimination metric is the coefficient of\ndiscrimination, the difference between the mean risk in patients and\nnonpatients. This is SD2/(mean(1-mean)), which is also the same for any\ndistribution. Since estimating parameters or metrics discards information, the\npopulation risk distribution should always be presented. As the ROC curve AUC\nand C-statistic are functions of this distribution's parameters, the parameters\nrepresent simpler, intuitive alternatives to these discrimination metrics.\nAmong discrimination metrics, the coefficient of discrimination provides a\nsimple, intuitive alternative to the ROC curve AUC and C-statistic.",

            "summary": "Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a promising modulation scheme for\nwireless communication in high-mobility scenarios. Recently, a reservoir\ncomputing (RC) based approach has been introduced for online subframe-based\nsymbol detection in the OTFS system, where only a limited number of\nover-the-air (OTA) pilot symbols are utilized for training. However, this\napproach does not leverage the domain knowledge specific to the OTFS system.\nThis paper introduces a novel two-dimensional RC (2D-RC) method that\nincorporates the structural knowledge of the OTFS system into the design for\nonline symbol detection on a subframe basis. Specifically, as the channel\nresponse acts as a two-dimensional (2D) operation over the transmitted\ninformation symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, the 2D-RC is designed to\nhave a 2D structure to equalize the channel. With the introduced architecture,\nthe 2D-RC can benefit from the predictable channel representation in the DD\ndomain. Moreover, unlike the previous work that requires multiple RCs to learn\nthe channel feature, the 2D-RC only requires a single neural network for\ndetection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the 2D-RC\napproach across different OTFS system variants and modulation orders.",

            "summary": "In the present study, the axisymmetric natural oscillations of a liquid drop\nsupported by a flat surface is investigated by direct numerical simulation. The\nliquid-gas interface is captured using a geometric volume-of-fluid (VOF)\nmethod. A parametric study is carried out by varying the equilibrium contact\nangle and the gravitational Bond number (Bo). Both positive and negative\ngravities are considered, and thus the results cover both pendant and sessile\ndrops. To incorporate the effect of contact line mobility, the two asymptotic\nlimits, namely the pinned contact line (PCL) and free contact line (FCL)\nconditions, are considered and their effects on the drop oscillation features\nare characterized. The predicted oscillation frequencies for PCL and FCL serve\nas the upper and lower bounds for general situations. The drop oscillation is\ninitiated by increasing the gravity magnitude for a short time. The first mode\ndue to the drop centroid translation dominates the excited oscillation. The\noscillation frequency scales with the capillary frequency, and the normalized\nfrequency monotonically decreases with the equilibrium contact angle. For zero\ngravity, the computed frequencies for all contact angles agree remarkably well\nwith the inviscid theory for both the PCL and FCL conditions. The kinetic\nenergy correction factor is introduced to account for the additional\ncontribution of the oscillation-induced internal flow to the overall kinetic\nenergy of the drop. Both the frequency and the kinetic energy correction factor\nincrease with Bo, decrease with the contact angle, and increase when the\ncontact line condition changed from FCL to PCL. The variation of oscillation\nfrequency due to the change of Bo is particularly significant when the contact\nangle is large.",

Working first with a basic CDD scheme, it is shown that\nthe amplitude and frequency of the (driving) field of control can be\nappropriately chosen to force the non-static random input to have a\n(time-dependent) perturbative character. Moreover, in the dressed-state\npicture, the effect of noise is described in terms of an operative random\nvariable whose properties, dependent on the driving field, can be analytically\ncharacterized.

            "summary": "Safe overtaking, especially in a bidirectional mixed-traffic setting, remains\na key challenge for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The presence of\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs), behavior unpredictability, and blind spots\nresulting from sensor occlusion make this a challenging control problem. To\novercome these difficulties, we propose a cooperative communication-based\napproach that utilizes the information shared between CAVs to reduce the\neffects of sensor occlusion while benefiting from the local velocity prediction\nbased on past tracking data. Our control framework aims to perform overtaking\nmaneuvers with the objective of maximizing velocity while prioritizing safety\nand passenger comfort. Our method is also capable of reactively adjusting its\nplan to dynamic changes in the environment. The performance of the proposed\napproach is verified using realistic traffic simulations.",

We present an annotation\nmethodology incorporating auxiliary information that reduced labeling time by\nover 65%. We establish benchmark performance using state-of-the-art re-id\nmodels including OSNet and ResNet-50. Without fine-tuning, the best models\nachieve only 33% Rank-1 accuracy. Fine-tuning on MUDD boosts results to 79%\nRank-1, but significant room for improvement remains. We analyze the impact of\nreal-world factors including mud, pose, lighting, and more.

Previous work has explored functionality learning by fine-tuning\nmodels on suite data. While this improves performance on seen functionalities,\nit often does not generalize to unseen ones and can harm general performance.\n  This paper analyses a fine-tuning-free approach to functionality learning.\nFor each functionality in a suite, we generate a specification instruction that\nencodes it. We combine the obtained specification instructions to create\nspecification-augmented prompts, which we feed to language models pre-trained\non natural instruction data to generate suite predictions. A core aspect of our\nanalysis is to measure the effect that including a set of specifications has on\na held-out set of unseen, qualitatively different specifications. Our\nexperiments across four tasks and models ranging from 80M to 175B parameters\nshow that smaller models struggle to follow specification instructions.\nHowever, larger models (> 3B params.) can benefit from specifications and even\ngeneralize desirable behaviors across functionalities.",

So far, it has been\nmeasured up to z~2.5 in main-sequence galaxies. In this letter, we aim to put\nconstraints at z~4.5 using a sample of four massive main-sequence galaxies\nobserved by ALMA at high resolution. We obtained ~0.3\"-resolution [CII] and\ncontinuum maps of our objects, which we then converted into gas and obscured\nSFR surface density maps. In addition, we produced unobscured SFR surface\ndensity maps by convolving Hubble ancillary data in the rest-frame UV. We then\nderived the average $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ in various $\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$ bins, and\nestimated the uncertainties using a Monte Carlo sampling. Our galaxy sample\nfollows the KS relation measured in main-sequence galaxies at lower redshift\nand is slightly lower than predictions from simulations. Our data points probe\nthe high end both in terms of $\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$, and\ngas depletion timescales (285-843 Myr) remain similar to z~2 objects. However,\nthree of our objects are clearly morphologically disturbed, and we could have\nexpected shorter gas depletion timescales (~100 Myr) similar to merger-driven\nstarbursts at lower redshifts. This suggests that the mechanisms triggering\nstarbursts at high redshift may be different than in the low- and\nintermediate-z Universe.",

            "summary": "In traditional topology optimization, the computing time required to\niteratively update the material distribution within a design domain strongly\ndepends on the complexity or size of the problem, limiting its application in\nreal engineering contexts. This work proposes a multi-stage machine learning\nstrategy that aims to predict an optimal topology and the related stress fields\nof interest, either in 2D or 3D, without resorting to any iterative analysis\nand design process. The overall topology optimization is treated as regression\ntask in a low-dimensional latent space, that encodes the variability of the\ntarget designs. First, a fully-connected model is employed to surrogate the\nfunctional link between the parametric input space characterizing the design\nproblem and the latent space representation of the corresponding optimal\ntopology. The decoder branch of an autoencoder is then exploited to reconstruct\nthe desired optimal topology from its latent representation. The deep learning\nmodels are trained on a dataset generated through a standard method of topology\noptimization implementing the solid isotropic material with penalization, for\nvarying boundary and loading conditions. The underlying hypothesis behind the\nproposed strategy is that optimal topologies share enough common patterns to be\ncompressed into small latent space representations without significant\ninformation loss. Results relevant to a 2D Messerschmitt-B\\\"olkow-Blohm beam\nand a 3D bridge case demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework to\nprovide accurate optimal topology predictions in a fraction of a second.",

            "summary": "In loop quantum cosmology, ambiguities in the Hamiltonian constraint can\nresult in models with varying phenomenological predictions. In the homogeneous\nisotropic models, these ambiguities were settled, and the improved dynamics was\nfound to be a unique and phenomenologically viable choice. This issue has\nremained unsettled on the inclusion of anisotropies, and in the Bianchi-I model\nthere exist two generalizations of isotropic improved dynamics. In the first of\nthese, labelled as $\\bar \\mu$ quantization, the edge length of holonomies\ndepends on the inverse of the directional scale factor. This quantization has\nbeen favored since it results in universal bounds on energy density and\nanisotropic shear, and can be viably formulated for non-compact as well as\ncompact spatial manifolds. However, there exists an earlier quantization,\nlabelled as $\\bar \\mu'$ quantization, where edge lengths of holonomies depend\non the inverse of the square root of directional triads. This quantization is\nalso non-singular and so far believed to yield a consistent physical picture\nfor spatially compact manifolds. We examine the issue of the physical viability\nof these quantizations for different types of matter in detail by performing a\nlarge number of numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals certain limitations\nwhich have so far remained unnoticed. We find that while being non-singular,\nthe $\\bar \\mu'$ quantization suffers from a surprising problem where one of the\ntriad components and associated polymerized term retains Planckian character\neven at large volumes. As a result, not only is the anisotropic shear not\npreserved across the bounce, which is most highlighted in the vacuum case, but\nthe universe can exhibit an unexpected cyclic evolution. These problematic\nfeatures are absent from the $\\bar \\mu$ quantization leaving it as the only\nviable prescription for loop quantizing the Bianchi-I model.",

They are defined to\nbe the equivariant partition functions of the SCFT on a background with the\ntopology of a two-dimensional torus times an ALE singularity. In this work, we\ncompute the ALE partition functions of M-string orbifold SCFTs, extending our\nprevious results for the M-string SCFTs. Via geometric engineering, our results\nabout ALE partition functions are connected to the theory of higher-rank\nDonaldson-Thomas invariants for resolutions of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefold\nsingularities. We predict that their generating functions satisfy interesting\nmodular properties. The partition functions receive contributions from BPS\nstrings probing the ALE singularity, whose worldsheet theories we determine via\na chain of string dualities. For this class of backgrounds the BPS strings'\nworldsheet theories become relative field theories that are sensitive to\ndiscrete data generalizing to 6d the familiar choices of flat connections at\ninfinity for instantons on ALE spaces. A novel feature we observe in the case\nof M-string orbifold SCFTs, which does not arise for the M-string SCFT, is the\nexistence of frozen BPS strings which are pinned at the orbifold singularity\nand carry fractional instanton charge with respect to the 6d gauge fields.",

In this\nwork, we study magic, as quantified by the stabilizer Renyi entropy, in a class\nof models known as generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson systems, i.e., Hamiltonians\nthat allow a stochastic matrix form (SMF) decomposition. The ground state\nwavefunctions of these systems can be written explicitly throughout their phase\ndiagram, and their properties can be related to associated classical\nstatistical mechanics problems, thereby allowing powerful analytical and\nnumerical approaches that are not usually available in conventional quantum\nmany body settings. As a result, we are able to express the SRE in terms of\nwave function coefficients that can be understood as a free energy difference\nof related classical problems. We apply this insight to a range of quantum many\nbody SMF Hamiltonians, which affords us to study numerically the SRE of large\nhigh-dimensional systems, and in some cases to obtain analytical results. We\nobserve that the behaviour of the SRE is relatively featureless across quantum\nphase transitions in these systems, although it is indeed singular (in its\nfirst or higher order derivative, depending on the nature of the transition).\nOn the contrary, we find that the maximum of the SRE generically occurs at a\ncusp away from the quantum critical point, where the derivative suddenly\nchanges sign. Furthermore, we compare the SRE and the logarithm of overlaps\nwith specific stabilizer states, asymptotically realised in the ground state\nphase diagrams of these systems. We find that they display strikingly similar\nbehaviors, which in turn establish rigorous bounds on the min-relative entropy\nof magic.",

Deep\nChandra observations have spatially resolved the Bondi radii of at least five\nnearby SMBHs. Contrary to earlier hot accretion models that predicted a steep\ntemperature increase within the Bondi radius, none of the resolved temperature\nprofiles exhibit such an increase. The temperature inside the Bondi radius\nappears to be complex, indicative of a multi-temperature phase of hot gas with\na cooler component at about 0.2-0.3 keV. The density profiles within the Bondi\nregions are shallow, suggesting the presence of strong outflows. These findings\nmight be explained by recent realistic numerical simulations that suggest that\nlarge-scale accretion inside the Bondi radius can be chaotic, with cooler gas\nraining down in some directions and hotter gas outflowing in others. With an\nangular resolution similar to Chandra and a significantly larger collecting\narea, AXIS will collect enough photons to map the emerging accretion flow\nwithin and around the \"sphere of influence\" of a sample of active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs).

            "summary": "Localizing and recognizing objects in the open-ended physical world poses a\nlong-standing challenge within the domain of machine perception. Recent methods\nhave endeavored to address the issue by employing a class-agnostic mask (or\nbox) proposal model, complemented by an open-vocabulary classifier (e.g., CLIP)\nusing pre-extracted text embeddings. However, it is worth noting that these\nopen-vocabulary recognition models still exhibit limitations in practical\napplications. On one hand, they rely on the provision of class names during\ntesting, where the recognition performance heavily depends on this predefined\nset of semantic classes by users. On the other hand, when training with\nmultiple datasets, human intervention is required to alleviate the label\ndefinition conflict between them. In this paper, we introduce the OmniScient\nModel (OSM), a novel Large Language Model (LLM) based mask classifier, as a\nstraightforward and effective solution to the aforementioned challenges.\nSpecifically, OSM predicts class labels in a generative manner, thus removing\nthe supply of class names during both training and testing. It also enables\ncross-dataset training without any human interference, exhibiting robust\ngeneralization capabilities due to the world knowledge acquired from the LLM.\nBy combining OSM with an off-the-shelf mask proposal model, we present\npromising results on various benchmarks, and demonstrate its effectiveness in\nhandling novel concepts.

Instead, we provide LLMs with textual narratives and probe\nthem with respect to their common-sense knowledge of the structure and duration\nof events, their ability to order events along a timeline, and self-consistency\nwithin their temporal model (e.g., temporal relations such as after and before\nare mutually exclusive for any pair of events). We evaluate state-of-the-art\nLLMs (such as LLaMA 2 and GPT-4) on three tasks reflecting these abilities.\nGenerally, we find that LLMs lag significantly behind both human performance as\nwell as small-scale, specialised LMs. In-context learning, instruction tuning,\nand chain-of-thought prompting reduce this gap only to a limited degree.\nCrucially, LLMs struggle the most with self-consistency, displaying incoherent\nbehaviour in at least 27.23% of their predictions. Contrary to expectations, we\nalso find that scaling the model size does not guarantee positive gains in\nperformance. To explain these results, we study the sources from which LLMs may\ngather temporal information: we find that sentence ordering in unlabelled\ntexts, available during pre-training, is only weakly correlated with event\nordering. Moreover, public instruction tuning mixtures contain few temporal\ntasks. Hence, we conclude that current LLMs lack a consistent temporal model of\ntextual narratives.

Our quantum\ntransport calculations reveal a switching resistance of up to $10^6 \\%$ when\nthe relative alignment of TMDs goes from $0^{\\circ}$ to $60^{\\circ}$ and when\nthe angle is kept fixed at $60^{\\circ}$ and the Fermi level is varied. By\ncreating vacancies, we evaluate how inter-valley scattering affects the\nefficiency and find that the resistance switching remains large ($10^4 \\%$) for\ntypical values of vacancy concentration.

Nodes wish to have fresh\ninformation, however, they have preference for packets that originated at the\nreliable source and are willing to sacrifice their version age of information\nby up to $G$ versions to switch from an unreliable packet to a reliable packet.\nWe study how this protocol impacts the prevalence of unreliable packets at\nnodes in the network and their version age. Using a stochastic hybrid system\n(SHS) framework, we formulate analytical equations to characterize two\nquantities: expected fraction of nodes with unreliable packets and expected\nversion age of information at network nodes. We show that as $G$ increases,\nfewer nodes have unreliable packet, however, their version age increases as\nwell, thereby inducing a freshness-reliability trade-off in the network. We\npresent numerical results to support our findings.",

It operates\non the Lie algebra parameterisation of spatial transforms (which is compatible\nwith rigid transforms and stationary velocity fields for nonlinear deformation)\nand takes advantage of log-domain properties to solve the problem using\nBayesian inference. USRL estimates rigid and nonlinear registrations that: (i)\nbring all timepoints to an unbiased subject-specific space; and (i) compute a\nsmooth trajectory across the imaging time-series.

On the other hand, transformers are flexible, neural\nsequence models that present the intriguing possibility of providing\ngeneral-purpose prediction methods, even in this mixture setting. In this work,\nwe investigate the hypothesis that transformers can learn an optimal predictor\nfor mixtures of regressions. We construct a generative process for a mixture of\nlinear regressions for which the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is given\nby data-driven exponential weights on a finite set of parameters. We observe\nthat transformers achieve low mean-squared error on data generated via this\nprocess. By probing the transformer's output at inference time, we also show\nthat transformers typically make predictions that are close to the optimal\npredictor. Our experiments also demonstrate that transformers can learn\nmixtures of regressions in a sample-efficient fashion and are somewhat robust\nto distribution shifts. We complement our experimental observations by proving\nconstructively that the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is indeed\nimplementable by a transformer.",

            "summary": "Transformer neural networks can exhibit a surprising capacity for in-context\nlearning (ICL) despite not being explicitly trained for it. Prior work has\nprovided a deeper understanding of how ICL emerges in transformers, e.g.\nthrough the lens of mechanistic interpretability, Bayesian inference, or by\nexamining the distributional properties of training data. However, in each of\nthese cases, ICL is treated largely as a persistent phenomenon; namely, once\nICL emerges, it is assumed to persist asymptotically. Here, we show that the\nemergence of ICL during transformer training is, in fact, often transient. We\ntrain transformers on synthetic data designed so that both ICL and in-weights\nlearning (IWL) strategies can lead to correct predictions. We find that ICL\nfirst emerges, then disappears and gives way to IWL, all while the training\nloss decreases, indicating an asymptotic preference for IWL. The transient\nnature of ICL is observed in transformers across a range of model sizes and\ndatasets, raising the question of how much to \"overtrain\" transformers when\nseeking compact, cheaper-to-run models. We find that L2 regularization may\noffer a path to more persistent ICL that removes the need for early stopping\nbased on ICL-style validation tasks. Finally, we present initial evidence that\nICL transience may be caused by competition between ICL and IWL circuits.",

The controllability of musical aspects, however, has not been\nexplicitly explored in text-to-music systems yet. In this paper, we present\nMustango, a music-domain-knowledge-inspired text-to-music system based on\ndiffusion, that expands the Tango text-to-audio model. Mustango aims to control\nthe generated music, not only with general text captions, but from more rich\ncaptions that could include specific instructions related to chords, beats,\ntempo, and key. As part of Mustango, we propose MuNet, a\nMusic-Domain-Knowledge-Informed UNet sub-module to integrate these\nmusic-specific features, which we predict from the text prompt, as well as the\ngeneral text embedding, into the diffusion denoising process. To overcome the\nlimited availability of open datasets of music with text captions, we propose a\nnovel data augmentation method that includes altering the harmonic, rhythmic,\nand dynamic aspects of music audio and using state-of-the-art Music Information\nRetrieval methods to extract the music features which will then be appended to\nthe existing descriptions in text format. We release the resulting MusicBench\ndataset which contains over 52K instances and includes music-theory-based\ndescriptions in the caption text. Through extensive experiments, we show that\nthe quality of the music generated by Mustango is state-of-the-art, and the\ncontrollability through music-specific text prompts greatly outperforms other\nmodels in terms of desired chords, beat, key, and tempo, on multiple datasets.",

We may never be able to predict the exact times of exceptionally\nstrong solar flares, like the catastrophic Carrington event in September 1859,\nbut we can estimate when such events are more probable. Our results also\nindicate that during the next decades the Sun will no longer help us to cope\nwith the climate change. The inability to find predictability in some\nphenomenon does not prove that this phenomenon itself is stochastic.",

            "summary": "Applying a machine learning model for decision-making in the real world\nrequires to distinguish what the model knows from what it does not. A critical\nfactor in assessing the knowledge of a model is to quantify its predictive\nuncertainty. Predictive uncertainty is commonly measured by the entropy of the\nBayesian model average (BMA) predictive distribution. Yet, the properness of\nthis current measure of predictive uncertainty was recently questioned. We\nprovide new insights regarding those limitations. Our analyses show that the\ncurrent measure erroneously assumes that the BMA predictive distribution is\nequivalent to the predictive distribution of the true model that generated the\ndataset. Consequently, we introduce a theoretically grounded measure to\novercome these limitations. We experimentally verify the benefits of our\nintroduced measure of predictive uncertainty. We find that our introduced\nmeasure behaves more reasonably in controlled synthetic tasks. Moreover, our\nevaluations on ImageNet demonstrate that our introduced measure is advantageous\nin real-world applications utilizing predictive uncertainty.",

The COSMOCal (COsmic Survey of\nMillimeter wavelengths Objects for CMB experiments Calibration) project aims at\nenhancing the accuracy of the absolute calibration of the polarization angle\n$\\psi$ of current and future CMB experiments. The concept includes the build of\na very well known artificial source emitting in the frequency range [20-350]\nGHz that would act as an absolute calibrator for several polarization\nfacilities on Earth. A feasibility study to place the artificial source in\ngeostationary orbit, in the far field for all the telescopes on Earth, is\nongoing. In the meanwhile ongoing hardware work is dedicated to build a\nprototype to test the technology, the precision and the stability of the\npolarization recovering in the 1 mm band (220-300 GHz). High-resolution\nexperiments as the NIKA2 camera at the IRAM 30m telescope will be deployed for\nsuch use.

One promising line\nof work is the cross-domain recommendation, which trains models with data\nacross multiple domains to improve the performance in data-scarce domains.\nRecent proposed cross-domain sequential recommendation models such as PiNet and\nDASL have a common drawback relying heavily on overlapped users in different\ndomains, which limits their usage in practical recommender systems. In this\npaper, we propose a Mixed Attention Network (MAN) with local and global\nattention modules to extract the domain-specific and cross-domain information.\nFirstly, we propose a local/global encoding layer to capture the\ndomain-specific/cross-domain sequential pattern. Then we propose a mixed\nattention layer with item similarity attention, sequence-fusion attention, and\ngroup-prototype attention to capture the local/global item similarity, fuse the\nlocal/global item sequence, and extract the user groups across different\ndomains, respectively. Finally, we propose a local/global prediction layer to\nfurther evolve and combine the domain-specific and cross-domain interests.\nExperimental results on two real-world datasets (each with two domains)\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed model. Further study also\nillustrates that our proposed method and components are model-agnostic and\neffective, respectively. The code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/Guanyu-Lin/MAN.",

In the relativistic quark model, an analysis of the\nHamiltonian figures out the mechanism that the excitation mode with lower\nenergy levels is always associated with the heavy quark(s), and the splitting\nof the energy levels is suppressed by the heavy quark(s). So, the heavy quarks\ndominate the orbital excitation of singly and doubly heavy baryons.\nFurthermore, a physical understanding of this mechanism is given in a\nsemi-classical way. Accordingly, the predicted mass spectra of singly and\ndoubly heavy baryons confirm the rationality of this mechanism. In addition, an\ninteresting consequence of this mechanism is that a heavy-light meson is more\nlikely to be produced in the strong decay of the high-orbital excited states,\nwhich is supported by experiments. This mechanism is rooted in the breakdown of\nthe mass symmetry. Therefore, it may be also valid for other multi-quark\nsystems, such as the tetraquarks Qqqq and QQqq, or the pentaquarks Qqqqq and\nQQqqq.",

His wage, the audit fees, are not\nfixed among all companies, but can be affected by the financial and structural\ncharacteristics of the company, as well as the characteristics of the firm he\nbelongs to. Another factor that may affect his wage in an auditor switching,\nwhich can be resulted from changes in the company that may influence the fees.\nThis paper examines the effect nature of the auditor switching on his wage, and\nthe factors of the company characteristics and the economy data which determine\nthe wage at switching. A product of the research are tools for predicting and\nevaluating the auditor wage at switching. These tools are important for the\nauditor himself, but also for the company manager to correctly determine the\nwage due to the possibility that the quality of the audit work depends on its\nfees. Two main results are obtained. First, the direction of the wage change in\nthe switching year depends on the economic stability of the economy. Second,\nthe switching effect on the direction and the change size in wage depends on\nthe change size in the company characteristics before and after switching - a\nlarge change versus a stable one. We get that forecasting the change size in\nwage for companies with a larger change is their characteristics is paralleled\nto forecasting a wage increasing. And vice versa, forecasting the change size\nin wage for companies with a stable change in their characteristics is\nparalleled to forecasting a wage decreasing. But, whereas the former can be\nachieved based on the company characteristics and macroeconomics factors, the\npredictably of these characteristics and factors is negligible for the letter.",

The scheme is based on the interference of two\nAT doublets created by ionization of the strongly driven atom from the ground\nand the resonantly excited state using tailored bichromatic femtosecond (fs)\nlaser pulses. In this scheme, the quantum phase of the photoelectrons is\ncrucial for the manipulation of the AT doublet. The laser polarization state\nand the relative optical phase between the two colors are used to manipulate\nthe interference pattern. We develop an analytical model to describe the\nbichromatic REMPI process and provide a physical picture of the control\nmechanism. To validate the model, the results are compared to an ab initio\ncalculation based on the solution of the 2D time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for the non-perturbative interaction of an atom with intense\npolarization-shaped bichromatic fs-laser pulses.

Two\ndifferent programs were utilized for the light curve analysis, with results in\npredictably close agreement. The agreement promotes confidence in the analysis\nprocedures. The spectra were analysed using the {\\sc FDBinary} program. The\nmain parameters are as follows: $M_1 = 11.6 \\pm 0.14$ and $M_2 = 4.8 \\pm 0.06$\n(M$_\\odot$). We estimate an approximate mass of the wide companion as $M_3 =\n2.0 \\pm 0.3$ M$_\\odot$. Similarly, $R_{1} = 5.11 \\pm 0.03$, $R_2 = 2.51 \\pm\n0.02$, $R_3 = 1.8 \\pm 0.1$ (R$_\\odot$); $T_{\\rm e 1} = 26600 \\pm 300$, $T_{\\rm\ne 2} = 16300 \\pm 400$ and $T_{\\rm e 3} = 10000 \\pm 1000$ (K).

Examination of the well-defined $\\lambda$6678 He I\nprofiles reveals the primary to have a significantly low projected rotation:\nsome 80\\% of the synchronous value. This can be explained on the basis of the\nprecession of an unaligned spin axis.

Thus, they bear the\npotential to guide the user's interaction with AI systems since they represent\neasy-to-understand explanations. To be applicable, CEs need to be realistic and\nactionable. In the literature, various methods have been proposed to generate\nCEs. However, the majority of research on CEs focuses on classification\nproblems where questions like \"What should I do to get my rejected loan\napproved?\" are raised. In practice, answering questions like \"What should I do\nto increase my salary?\" are of a more regressive nature. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel method to generate CEs for a pre-trained regressor by first\ndisentangling the label-relevant from the label-irrelevant dimensions in the\nlatent space. CEs are then generated by combining the label-irrelevant\ndimensions and the predefined output.

Searching in the latent space could help achieve this goal. We\nshow that our method maintains the characteristics of the query sample during\nthe counterfactual search.

            "summary": "A significant limitation of the LTE-V2X and NR-V2X sidelink scheduling\nmechanisms is their difficulty coping with variations in inter packet arrival\ntimes, also known as aperiodic packets. This conflicts with the fundamental\ncharacteristics of most V2X services which are triggered based on an event.\ne.g. ETSI Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) - vehicle kinematics,\nCooperative Perception Messages (CPMs) - object sensing and Decentralised Event\nNotification Messages (DENMs) - event occurrences. Furthermore, network\nmanagement techniques such as congestion control mechanisms can result in\nvaried inter packet arrival times. To combat this, NR-V2X introduced a dynamic\ngrant mechanism, which we show is ineffective unless there is background\nperiodic traffic to stabilise the sensing history upon which the scheduler\nmakes it decisions. The characteristics of V2X services make it implausible\nthat such periodic application traffic will exist.\n  To overcome this significant drawback, we demonstrate that the standardised\nscheduling algorithms can be made effective if the event triggered arrival rate\nof packets can be accurately predicted. These predictions can be used to tune\nthe Resource Reservation Interval (RRI) parameter of the MAC scheduler to\nnegate the negative impact of aperiodicity. Such an approach allows the\nscheduler to achieve comparable performance to a scenario where packets arrive\nperiodically. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, an ML model has\nbeen devised for the prediction of cooperative awareness messages, but the same\nprinciple can be abstracted to other V2X service types.",

Utilizing the partial preservation of the quark's spin information in\nbaryons in the jet produced by the quark, we examine possible analysis\nstrategies for ATLAS and CMS to measure the quark polarization and spin\ncorrelations. We find polarization measurements for the $b$ and $c$ quarks to\nbe feasible, even with the currently available datasets. Spin correlation\nmeasurements for $b\\bar b$ are possible using the CMS Run 2 parked data, while\nsuch measurements for $c\\bar c$ will become possible with higher integrated\nluminosity. For the $s$ quark, we find the measurements to be challenging with\nthe standard triggers. We also provide leading-order QCD predictions for the\npolarization and spin correlations expected in the $b\\bar b$ and $c\\bar c$\nsamples with the cuts envisioned for the above analyses. Apart from\nestablishing experimentally the existence of spin correlations in $b\\bar b$ and\n$c\\bar c$ systems produced in $pp$ collisions, the proposed measurements can\nprovide new information on the polarization transfer from quarks to baryons and\nmight even be sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model.",

Although promising results on\nconcept prediction were obtained, the aforementioned studies normally ignore\nthe relationship among concepts, which relies on not only objects in the image,\nbut also word dependencies in the text, so that offers a considerable potential\nfor improving the process of generating good descriptions. In this paper, we\npropose a structured concept predictor (SCP) to predict concepts and their\nstructures, then we integrate them into captioning, so as to enhance the\ncontribution of visual signals in this task via concepts and further use their\nrelations to distinguish cross-modal semantics for better description\ngeneration. Particularly, we design weighted graph convolutional networks\n(W-GCN) to depict concept relations driven by word dependencies, and then\nlearns differentiated contributions from these concepts for following decoding\nprocess. Therefore, our approach captures potential relations among concepts\nand discriminatively learns different concepts, so that effectively facilitates\nimage captioning with inherited information across modalities. Extensive\nexperiments and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach as\nwell as each proposed module in this work.",

Two defect-based acoustic interferometers of MZ-type are\nfabricated, one with arms oriented horizontally and another one with arms\noriented diagonally, and their transmission features are experimentally\ncharacterized using ultrasonic spectroscopy. The experimental data are compared\nwith finite element method (FEM) simulations and with tight-binding (TB)\ncalculations in which each defect is treated as a resonator coupled to its\nneighboring ones. Significantly, the results exhibit excellent agreement\nindicating the reliability of the proposed approach. This comprehensive match\nis of paramount importance for accurately predicting and optimizing resonant\nmodes supported by defect arrays, thus enabling the tailoring of phononic\nstructures and defect-based waveguides to meet specific requirements.

            "summary": "Solving mechanics problems using numerical methods requires comprehensive\nintelligent capability of retrieving relevant knowledge and theory,\nconstructing and executing codes, analyzing the results, a task that has thus\nfar mainly been reserved for humans. While emerging AI methods can provide\neffective approaches to solve end-to-end problems, for instance via the use of\ndeep surrogate models or various data analytics strategies, they often lack\nphysical intuition since knowledge is baked into the parametric complement\nthrough training, offering less flexibility when it comes to incorporating\nmathematical or physical insights. By leveraging diverse capabilities of\nmultiple dynamically interacting large language models (LLMs), we can overcome\nthe limitations of conventional approaches and develop a new class of\nphysics-inspired generative machine learning platform, here referred to as\nMechAgents. A set of AI agents can solve mechanics tasks, here demonstrated for\nelasticity problems, via autonomous collaborations. A two-agent team can\neffectively write, execute and self-correct code, in order to apply finite\nelement methods to solve classical elasticity problems in various flavors\n(different boundary conditions, domain geometries, meshes, small/finite\ndeformation and linear/hyper-elastic constitutive laws, and others). For more\ncomplex tasks, we construct a larger group of agents with enhanced division of\nlabor among planning, formulating, coding, executing and criticizing the\nprocess and results. The agents mutually correct each other to improve the\noverall team-work performance in understanding, formulating and validating the\nsolution. Our framework shows the potential of synergizing the intelligence of\nlanguage models, the reliability of physics-based modeling, and the dynamic\ncollaborations among diverse agents, opening novel avenues for automation of\nsolving engineering problems.",

The stability of the bright solitons is also analyzed\nand we map out the stability phase diagram.

            "summary": "Existing works on weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing adopt hybrid\nattention network (HAN) as the multi-modal embedding to capture the cross-modal\ncontext. It embeds the audio and visual modalities with a shared network, where\nthe cross-attention is performed at the input. However, such an early fusion\nmethod highly entangles the two non-fully correlated modalities and leads to\nsub-optimal performance in detecting single-modality events. To deal with this\nproblem, we propose the messenger-guided mid-fusion transformer to reduce the\nuncorrelated cross-modal context in the fusion. The messengers condense the\nfull cross-modal context into a compact representation to only preserve useful\ncross-modal information. Furthermore, due to the fact that microphones capture\naudio events from all directions, while cameras only record visual events\nwithin a restricted field of view, there is a more frequent occurrence of\nunaligned cross-modal context from audio for visual event predictions. We thus\npropose cross-audio prediction consistency to suppress the impact of irrelevant\naudio information on visual event prediction.

The model can be seen as a generalization of the\nharmonic-interaction model for a trapped BEC coupled to a bosonic bath. After\nobtaining the ground-state energy and wavefunction in closed form, we focus on\ncomputing the correlations in the system. The reduced one-particle density\nmatrices of the bosons and the cavity are constructed and diagonalized\nanalytically, and the von Neumann entanglement entropy of the BEC and the\ncavity is also expressed explicitly as a function of the number and mass of the\nbosons, frequencies of the trap and cavity, and the cavity-boson coupling\nstrength. The results allow one to study the impact of the cavity on the bosons\nand vice versa on an equal footing. As an application we investigate a specific\ncase of basic interest for itself, namely, non-interacting bosons in a cavity.\nWe find that both the bosons and the cavity develop correlations in a\ncomplementary manner while increasing the coupling between them. Whereas the\ncavity wavepacket broadens in Fock space, the BEC density saturates in real\nspace. On the other hand, while the cavity depletion saturates, and hence does\nthe BEC-cavity entanglement entropy, the BEC becomes strongly correlated and\neventually increasingly fragmented. The latter phenomenon implies single-trap\nfragmentation of otherwise ideal bosons, where their induced long-range\ninteraction is mediated by the cavity. Finally, as a complimentary\ninvestigation, the mean-field equations for the BEC-cavity system are solved\nanalytically as well, and the breakdown of mean-field theory for the cavity and\nthe bosons with increasing coupling is discussed.

To obtain an energy inequality, the\nconvexity of an energy function for an arbitrary $M$ is proved by finding\nrecurrence relations of the leading principal minors or the quadratic forms of\nthe Hessian matrix of the energy function with respect to the conservative\nvariables, which is more involved than the single-layer case due to the\ncoupling between the layers in the energy function. An important ingredient in\ndeveloping high-order semi-discrete ES schemes is the construction of a\ntwo-point energy conservative (EC) numerical flux. In pursuit of the WB\nproperty, a sufficient condition for such EC fluxes is given with compatible\ndiscretizations of the source terms similar to the single-layer case. It can be\ndecoupled into $M$ identities individually for each layer, making it convenient\nto construct a two-point EC flux for the multi-layer system. To suppress\npossible oscillations near discontinuities, WENO-based dissipation terms are\nadded to the high-order WB EC fluxes, which gives semi-discrete high-order WB\nES schemes. Fully-discrete schemes are obtained by employing high-order\nexplicit SSP-RK methods and proved to preserve the lake at rest. The schemes\nare further extended to moving meshes based on a modified energy function for a\nreformulated system, relying on the techniques proposed in [51]. Numerical\nexperiments are conducted for some two- and three-layer cases to validate the\nhigh-order accuracy, WB and ES properties, and high efficiency of the schemes,\nwith a suitable amount of dissipation chosen by estimating the maximal wave\nspeed due to the lack of an analytical expression for the eigenstructure of the\nmulti-layer system.",

            "summary": "Theta oscillations, ranging from 4-8 Hz, play a significant role in spatial\nlearning and memory functions during navigation tasks. Frontal theta\noscillations are thought to play an important role in spatial navigation and\nmemory. Electroencephalography (EEG) datasets are very complex, making any\nchanges in the neural signal related to behaviour difficult to interpret.\nHowever, multiple analytical methods are available to examine complex data\nstructure, especially machine learning based techniques. These methods have\nshown high classification performance and the combination with feature\nengineering enhances the capability of these methods. This paper proposes using\nhidden Markov and linear mixed effects models to extract features from EEG\ndata. Based on the engineered features obtained from frontal theta EEG data\nduring a spatial navigation task in two key trials (first, last) and between\ntwo conditions (learner and non-learner), we analysed the performance of six\nmachine learning methods (Polynomial Support Vector Machines, Non-linear\nSupport Vector Machines, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbours, Ridge, and Deep\nNeural Networks) on classifying learner and non-learner participants. We also\nanalysed how different standardisation methods used to pre-process the EEG data\ncontribute to classification performance. We compared the classification\nperformance of each trial with data gathered from the same subjects, including\nsolely coordinate-based features, such as idle time and average speed. We found\nthat more machine learning methods perform better classification using\ncoordinate-based data. However, only deep neural networks achieved an area\nunder the ROC curve higher than 80% using the theta EEG data alone. Our\nfindings suggest that standardising the theta EEG data and using deep neural\nnetworks enhances the classification of learner and non-learner subjects in a\nspatial learning task.",

While proactive discussions enhance\nperformance, this approach is currently limited to the inference phase. In this\ncontext, we posit a hypothesis: learning interactive discussions during\ntraining can improve understanding for the instances in the training step and\nproficiency in logical/critical thinking ability and verbalized expression of\nthe model in the inference step. Our proposed SAIE training method involves\nboth supportive and adversarial discussions between the learner and partner\nmodels. The learner model receives a remark from the partner through the\ndiscussion, and the parameters of the learner model are then updated based on\nthis remark. That is, the teacher signal dynamically adjusts in response to the\nevolving model output throughout the training step. By bolstering the capacity\nfor discussion and comprehension of instances, our experiments across datasets,\nincluding GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, and MMLU, reveal that models fine-tuned with\nour method consistently surpass those trained with standard fine-tuning\ntechniques.

            "summary": "Active safety systems on vehicles often face problems with false alarms. Most\nactive safety systems predict the driver's trajectory with the assumption that\nthe driver is always in a normal emotion, and then infer risks. However, the\ndriver's trajectory uncertainty increases under abnormal emotions. This paper\nproposes a new trajectory prediction model: CPSOR-GCN, which predicts vehicle\ntrajectories under abnormal emotions. At the physical level, the interaction\nfeatures between vehicles are extracted by the physical GCN module. At the\ncognitive level, SOR cognitive theory is used as prior knowledge to build a\nDynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) structure. The conditional probability and state\ntransition probability of nodes from the calibrated SOR-DBN quantify the causal\nrelationship between cognitive factors, which is embedded into the cognitive\nGCN module to extract the characteristics of the influence mechanism of\nemotions on driving behavior. The CARLA-SUMO joint driving simulation platform\nwas built to develop dangerous pre-crash scenarios. Methods of recreating\ntraffic scenes were used to naturally induce abnormal emotions. The experiment\ncollected data from 26 participants to verify the proposed model. Compared with\nthe model that only considers physical motion features, the prediction accuracy\nof the proposed model is increased by 68.70%. Furthermore,considering the\nSOR-DBN reduces the prediction error of the trajectory by 15.93%. Compared with\nother advanced trajectory prediction models, the results of CPSOR-GCN also have\nlower errors. This model can be integrated into active safety systems to better\nadapt to the driver's emotions, which could effectively reduce false alarms.",

            "summary": "Analogical reasoning derives information from known relations and generalizes\nthis information to similar yet unfamiliar situations. One of the first\ngeneralized ways in which deep learning models were able to solve verbal\nanalogies was through vector arithmetic of word embeddings, essentially\nrelating words that were mapped to a vector space (e.g., king - man + woman =\n__?). In comparison, most attempts to solve visual analogies are still\npredominantly task-specific and less generalizable. This project focuses on\nvisual analogical reasoning and applies the initial generalized mechanism used\nto solve verbal analogies to the visual realm. Taking the Abstraction and\nReasoning Corpus (ARC) as an example to investigate visual analogy solving, we\nuse a variational autoencoder (VAE) to transform ARC items into low-dimensional\nlatent vectors, analogous to the word embeddings used in the verbal approaches.\nThrough simple vector arithmetic, underlying rules of ARC items are discovered\nand used to solve them. Results indicate that the approach works well on simple\nitems with fewer dimensions (i.e., few colors used, uniform shapes), similar\ninput-to-output examples, and high reconstruction accuracy on the VAE.\nPredictions on more complex items showed stronger deviations from expected\noutputs, although, predictions still often approximated parts of the item's\nrule set. Error patterns indicated that the model works as intended. On the\nofficial ARC paradigm, the model achieved a score of 2% (cf. current world\nrecord is 21%) and on ConceptARC it scored 8.8%. Although the methodology\nproposed involves basic dimensionality reduction techniques and standard vector\narithmetic, this approach demonstrates promising outcomes on ARC and can easily\nbe generalized to other abstract visual reasoning tasks.",

            "summary": "Adaptive live video streaming applications use a fixed predefined\nconfiguration for the bitrate ladder with constant framerate and encoding\npresets in a session. However, selecting optimized framerates and presets for\nevery bitrate ladder representation can enhance perceptual quality, improve\ncomputational resource allocation, and thus, the streaming energy efficiency.\nIn particular, low framerates for low-bitrate representations reduce\ncompression artifacts and decrease encoding energy consumption. In addition, an\noptimized preset may lead to improved compression efficiency. To this light,\nthis paper proposes a Content-adaptive Variable Framerate (CVFR) encoding\nscheme, which offers two modes of operation: ecological (ECO) and high-quality\n(HQ). CVFR-ECO optimizes for the highest encoding energy savings by predicting\nthe optimized framerate for each representation in the bitrate ladder. CVFR-HQ\ntakes it further by predicting each representation's optimized\nframerate-encoding preset pair using low-complexity discrete cosine transform\nenergy-based spatial and temporal features for compression efficiency and\nsustainable storage. We demonstrate the advantage of CVFR using the x264\nopen-source video encoder. The results show that CVFR-ECO yields an average\nPSNR and VMAF increase of 0.02 dB and 2.50 points, respectively, for the same\nbitrate, compared to the fastest preset highest framerate encoding. CVFR-ECO\nalso yields an average encoding and storage energy consumption reduction of\n34.54% and 76.24%, considering a just noticeable difference (JND) of six VMAF\npoints. In comparison, CVFR-HQ yields an average increase in PSNR and VMAF of\n2.43 dB and 10.14 points, respectively, for the same bitrate.

            "summary": "The quest for room-temperature superconductivity has been a long-standing\naspiration in the field of materials science, driving extensive research\nefforts. In this work, we present a novel hydride, YSc$_2$H$_{24}$, which is\nstable at high pressure using a crystal structure prediction approach with a\nfixed composition based on known structures. The discovered material is\ncrystalline in a hexagonal unit cell with space group P6/mmm and has a\nfastinating structure consisting of two distinct cages: Sc@H$_{24}$ and\nY@H$_{30}$. By conducting an extensive numerical investigation of lattice\ndynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and solving the isotropic Eliashberg\nequation, we have revealed a significant value of $\\lambda$ = 2.96 as the\nunderlying factor responsible for the remarkably high critical temperature\n(T$_c$) of 306-332 K in YSc$_2$H$_{24}$. As pressure increases, the T$_c$\nremains above the ambient temperature. Our work has the potential to enhance\nthe existing understanding of high-temperature superconductors, with\nimplications for practical applications. The unique network of these cage-like\nstructures holds great promise for advancing our understanding of\nhigh-temperature superconductors, potentially leading to innovative\napplications.",

Recently, code pre-trained model\n(PTM), which draw from the experiences of the NLP field, have also achieved\nstate-of-the-art results in many software engineering (SE) downstream tasks.\nThese code PTMs take into account the differences between programming languages\nand natural languages during pre-training and make adjustments to pre-training\ntasks and input data. However, researchers in the SE community still inherit\nhabits from the NLP field when using these code PTMs to generate embeddings for\nSE downstream classification tasks, such as generating semantic embeddings for\ncode snippets through special tokens and inputting code and text information in\nthe same way as pre-training the PTMs. In this paper, we empirically study five\ndifferent PTMs (i.e. CodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, CodeGPT and CodeGen) with three\ndifferent architectures (i.e. encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder)\non four SE downstream classification tasks (i.e. code vulnerability detection,\ncode clone detection, just-in-time defect prediction and function docstring\nmismatch detection) with respect to the two aforementioned aspects. Our\nexperimental results indicate that (1) regardless of the architecture of the\ncode PTMs used, embeddings obtained through special tokens do not sufficiently\naggregate the semantic information of the entire code snippet; (2) the quality\nof code embeddings obtained by combing code data and text data in the same way\nas pre-training the PTMs is poor and cannot guarantee richer semantic\ninformation; (3) using the method that aggregates the vector representations of\nall code tokens, the decoder-only PTMs can obtain code embeddings with\nsemantics as rich as or even better quality than those obtained from the\nencoder-only and encoder-decoder PTMs.",

            "summary": "The wavelength-coverage and sensitivity of JWST now enables us to probe the\nrest-frame UV - optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at\nhigh-redshift ($z>4$). From these SEDs it is, in principle, through SED fitting\npossible to infer key physical properties, including stellar masses, star\nformation rates, and dust attenuation. These in turn can be compared with the\npredictions of galaxy formation simulations allowing us to validate and refine\nthe incorporated physics. However, the inference of physical properties,\nparticularly from photometry alone, can lead to large uncertainties and\npotential biases. Instead, it is now possible, and common, for simulations to\nbe \\emph{forward-modelled} to yield synthetic observations that can be compared\ndirectly to real observations. In this work, we measure the JWST broadband\nfluxes and colours of a robust sample of $5<z<10$ galaxies using the Cosmic\nEvolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. We then analyse predictions\nfrom a variety of models using the same methodology and compare the\nNIRCam/F277W magnitude distribution and NIRCam colours with observations. We\nfind that the predicted and observed magnitude distributions are similar, at\nleast at $5<z<8$. At $z>8$ the distributions differ somewhat, though our\nobserved sample size is small and thus susceptible to statistical fluctuations.\nLikewise, the predicted and observed colour evolution show broad agreement, at\nleast at $5<z<8$. There is however some disagreement between the observed and\nmodelled strength of the strong line contribution. In particular all the models\nfails to reproduce the F410M-F444W colour at $z>8$, though, again, the sample\nsize is small here.",

However, segmenting retinal vessels has its own\nset of challenges, with prior techniques failing to generate adequate results\nwhen segmenting branches and microvascular structures. The neural network\napproaches used recently are characterized by the inability to keep local and\nglobal properties together and the failure to capture tiny end vessels make it\nchallenging to attain the desired result. To reduce this retinal vessel\nsegmentation problem, we propose a full-scale micro-vessel extraction mechanism\nbased on an encoder-decoder neural network architecture, sigmoid smoothing, and\nan adaptive threshold method. The network consists of of residual, encoder\nbooster, bottleneck enhancement, squeeze, and excitation building blocks. All\nof these blocks together help to improve the feature extraction and prediction\nof the segmentation map. The proposed solution has been evaluated using the\nDRIVE, CHASE-DB1, and STARE datasets, and competitive results are obtained when\ncompared with previous studies. The AUC and accuracy on the DRIVE dataset are\n0.9884 and 0.9702, respectively. On the CHASE-DB1 dataset, the scores are\n0.9903 and 0.9755, respectively. On the STARE dataset, the scores are 0.9916\nand 0.9750, respectively.

            "summary": "Consider the setting of constrained optimization, with some parameters\nunknown at solving time and requiring prediction from relevant features.\nPredict+Optimize is a recent framework for end-to-end training supervised\nlearning models for such predictions, incorporating information about the\noptimization problem in the training process in order to yield better\npredictions in terms of the quality of the predicted solution under the true\nparameters. Almost all prior works have focused on the special case where the\nunknowns appear only in the optimization objective and not the constraints. Hu\net al.~proposed the first adaptation of Predict+Optimize to handle unknowns\nappearing in constraints, but the framework has somewhat ad-hoc elements, and\nthey provided a training algorithm only for covering and packing linear\nprograms. In this work, we give a new \\emph{simpler} and \\emph{more powerful}\nframework called \\emph{Two-Stage Predict+Optimize}, which we believe should be\nthe canonical framework for the Predict+Optimize setting. We also give a\ntraining algorithm usable for all mixed integer linear programs, vastly\ngeneralizing the applicability of the framework. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the superior prediction performance of our training framework over\nall classical and state-of-the-art methods.",

            "summary": "The photovoltaic (PV) industry is seeing a significant shift toward\nlarge-scale solar plants, where traditional inspection methods have proven to\nbe time-consuming and costly. Currently, the predominant approach to PV\ninspection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is based on photogrammetry.\nHowever, the photogrammetry approach presents limitations, such as an increased\namount of useless data during flights, potential issues related to image\nresolution, and the detection process during high-altitude flights. In this\nwork, we develop a visual servoing control system applied to a UAV with dynamic\ncompensation using a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) capable of\naccurately tracking the middle of the underlying PV array at different frontal\nvelocities and height constraints, ensuring the acquisition of detailed images\nduring low-altitude flights. The visual servoing controller is based on the\nextraction of features using RGB-D images and the Kalman filter to estimate the\nedges of the PV arrays. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the proposal in\nboth simulated and real-world environments using the commercial aerial vehicle\n(DJI Matrice 100), with the purpose of showcasing the results of the\narchitecture.

However, we argue that\nthese teacher-student methods achieve limited performance because poor network\ncalibration produces incorrectly pseudo-labeled samples, leading to error\npropagation. Therefore, we attempt to mitigate this issue by proposing: (1)\nUncertainty-aware Teacher Learning that leverages the prediction uncertainty to\nguide the selection of pseudo-labels, avoiding the number of incorrect\npseudo-labels in the self-training stage. (2) Student-student Collaborative\nLearning that allows the transfer of reliable labels between two student\nnetworks instead of completely relying on all pseudo-labels from its teacher.\nMeanwhile, this approach allows a full exploration of mislabeled samples rather\nthan simply filtering unreliable pseudo-labeled samples. Extensive experimental\nresults on five DS-NER datasets demonstrate that our method is superior to\nstate-of-the-art teacher-student methods.",

            "summary": "Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods blindly predict where each\nobject is at a specific timestep t (\"time indexing\"), which struggles to\npredict precise object movements. Given two images of a baseball, there are\ninfinitely many possible trajectories: accelerating or decelerating, straight\nor curved. This often results in blurry frames as the method averages out these\npossibilities. Instead of forcing the network to learn this complicated\ntime-to-location mapping implicitly together with predicting the frames, we\nprovide the network with an explicit hint on how far the object has traveled\nbetween start and end frames, a novel approach termed \"distance indexing\". This\nmethod offers a clearer learning goal for models, reducing the uncertainty tied\nto object speeds. We further observed that, even with this extra guidance,\nobjects can still be blurry especially when they are equally far from both\ninput frames (i.e., halfway in-between), due to the directional ambiguity in\nlong-range motion. To solve this, we propose an iterative reference-based\nestimation strategy that breaks down a long-range prediction into several\nshort-range steps. When integrating our plug-and-play strategies into\nstate-of-the-art learning-based models, they exhibit markedly sharper outputs\nand superior perceptual quality in arbitrary time interpolations, using a\nuniform distance indexing map in the same format as time indexing.\nAdditionally, distance indexing can be specified pixel-wise, which enables\ntemporal manipulation of each object independently, offering a novel tool for\nvideo editing tasks like re-timing.",

The Large APEX sub-Millimeter Array (LAsMA) multibeam\nreceiver of the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope was used to\nobserve the prestellar cores H-MM1 and Oph D in Ophiuchus in the ground-state\nlines of ortho and para NH2D and NHD2. The fractional abundances of these\nmolecules were derived employing 3D radiative transfer modelling, using\ndifferent assumptions about the abundance profiles as functions of density. We\nalso ran gas-grain chemistry models with different scenarios concerning proton\nor deuteron exchanges and chemical desorption from grains to find out if one of\nthese models can reproduce the observed spin ratios. The observationally\ndeduced ortho/para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 are in both cores within 10% of\ntheir statistical values 3 and 2, respectively, and taking 3-sigma limits,\ndeviations from these of about 20% are allowed. Of the chemistry models tested\nhere, the model that assumes proton hop (as opposed to full scrambling) in\nreactions contributing to ammonia formation, and a constant efficiency of\nchemical desorption, comes nearest to the observed abundances and spin ratios.\nThe nuclear spin ratios derived here are in contrast with spin-state chemistry\nmodels that assume full scrambling in proton donation and hydrogen abstraction\nreactions leading to deuterated ammonia. The efficiency of chemical desorption\ninfluences strongly the predicted abundances of NH3, NH2D, and NHD2, but has a\nlesser effect on their ortho/para ratios. For these the proton exchange\nscenario in the gas is decisive. We suggest that this is because of rapid\nre-processing of ammonia and related cations by gas-phase ion-molecule\nreactions.",

Satellite imagery serves as an effective tool for investigating\nthese interactions, but usually does not provide information on the structure\nof internal waves and their associated dynamics. Considering a three-layer\nconfiguration that approximates ocean stratification, we analytically\ninvestigate two-dimensional internal solitary waves (ISW) in a three-layer\nfluid with shear flow and continuous density distribution using the\n(2+1)-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) model. Firstly, the KP equation\nis derived from the basic governing equations which include mass and momentum\nconservations, along with free surface boundary conditions. The coefficients of\nthe KP equation are determined by the vertical distribution of fluid density,\nshear flow, and layer depth. Secondly, it is found that the interactions of ISW\ncan be carefully classified into five types: ordinary interactions including\nO-type, asymmetric interactions including P-type, TP-type and TO-type, and\nMiles resonance. The genuine existence of these interaction types is observed\nfrom satellite images in the Andaman Sea, the Malacca Strait, and the coast of\nWashington state. Finally, the ``bright\" and ``dark\" internal solitary\ninteractions are discovered in the three-layer fluid, which together constitute\nthe fluctuating forms of oceanic ISW. It is revealed that shear flow is the\nprimary factor to determine whether these types of interactions are ``bright\"\nor ``dark\".

            "summary": "Quantum computing offers significant speedup compared to classical computing,\nwhich has led to a growing interest among users in learning and applying\nquantum computing across various applications. However, quantum circuits, which\nare fundamental for implementing quantum algorithms, can be challenging for\nusers to understand due to their underlying logic, such as the temporal\nevolution of quantum states and the effect of quantum amplitudes on the\nprobability of basis quantum states. To fill this research gap, we propose\nQuantumEyes, an interactive visual analytics system to enhance the\ninterpretability of quantum circuits through both global and local levels. For\nthe global-level analysis, we present three coupled visualizations to delineate\nthe changes of quantum states and the underlying reasons: a Probability Summary\nView to overview the probability evolution of quantum states; a State Evolution\nView to enable an in-depth analysis of the influence of quantum gates on the\nquantum states; a Gate Explanation View to show the individual qubit states and\nfacilitate a better understanding of the effect of quantum gates. For the\nlocal-level analysis, we design a novel geometrical visualization Dandelion\nChart to explicitly reveal how the quantum amplitudes affect the probability of\nthe quantum state. We thoroughly evaluated QuantumEyes as well as the novel\nQuantumEyes integrated into it through two case studies on different types of\nquantum algorithms and in-depth expert interviews with 12 domain experts. The\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach in\nenhancing the interpretability of quantum circuits.",

This paper introduces\nOOD knowledge distillation, a pioneering learning framework applicable whether\nor not training ID data is available, given a standard network. This framework\nharnesses OOD-sensitive knowledge from the standard network to craft a binary\nclassifier adept at distinguishing between ID and OOD samples. To accomplish\nthis, we introduce Confidence Amendment (CA), an innovative methodology that\ntransforms an OOD sample into an ID one while progressively amending prediction\nconfidence derived from the standard network. This approach enables the\nsimultaneous synthesis of both ID and OOD samples, each accompanied by an\nadjusted prediction confidence, thereby facilitating the training of a binary\nclassifier sensitive to OOD. Theoretical analysis provides bounds on the\ngeneralization error of the binary classifier, demonstrating the pivotal role\nof confidence amendment in enhancing OOD sensitivity. Extensive experiments\nspanning various datasets and network architectures confirm the efficacy of the\nproposed method in detecting OOD samples.",

Stat. Mech.: Theory\nExp. 083211]. We show how the equation of motion of point defects, domain\nwalls, disclination lines and any other singularity can be understood with one\nunifying mathematical framework. For disclination lines, this also allows us to\nstudy the interplay between the internal line tension and the interaction with\nother lines. This interplay is non-trivial, allowing defect loops to expand,\ninstead of contracting, due to external interaction. We also use this framework\nto obtain an analytical description of two long-lasting problems in point\ndefect motion, namely the scale dependence of the defect mobility and the role\nof elastic anisotropy in the motion of defects in liquid crystals. For the\nformer, we show that this dependence is strongly problem-dependent, but it can\nbe computed with high accuracy for a pair of annihilating defects. For the\nlatter, we show that at the first order in perturbation theory anisotropy\ncauses a non-radial force, making the trajectory of annihilating defects\ndeviate from a straight line. At higher orders, it also induces a correction in\nthe mobility, which becomes non-isotropic for the $+1/2$ defect. We argue that,\ndue to its generality, our method can help to shed light on the motion of\nsingularities in many different systems, including driven and active\nnon-equilibrium theories.",

To address this, we propose a reasoning with refinement objective\ncalled ART: Ask, Refine, and Trust, which asks necessary questions to decide\nwhen an LLM should refine its output, and either affirm or withhold trust in\nits refinement by ranking the refinement and the initial prediction. On two\nmultistep reasoning tasks of mathematical word problems (GSM8K) and question\nanswering (StrategyQA), ART achieves a performance gain of +5 points over\nself-refinement baselines, while using a much smaller model as the decision\nmaker. We also demonstrate the benefit of using smaller models to make\nrefinement decisions as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning a larger\nmodel.",

            "summary": "Few studies have investigated the diagnostic utilities of biomarkers for\npredicting bacteremia among septic patients admitted to intensive care units\n(ICU). Therefore, this study evaluated the prediction power of laboratory\nbiomarkers to utilize those markers with high performance to optimize the\npredictive model for bacteremia. This retrospective cross-sectional study was\nconducted at the ICU department of Gyeongsang National University Changwon\nHospital in 2019. Adult patients qualifying SEPSIS-3 (increase in sequential\norgan failure score greater than or equal to 2) criteria with at least two sets\nof blood culture were selected. Collected data was initially analyzed\nindependently to identify the significant predictors, which was then used to\nbuild the multivariable logistic regression (MLR) model. A total of 218\npatients with 48 cases of true bacteremia were analyzed in this research. Both\nCRP and PCT showed a substantial area under the curve (AUC) value for\ndiscriminating bacteremia among septic patients (0.757 and 0.845,\nrespectively). To further enhance the predictive accuracy, we combined PCT,\nbilirubin, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets, lactic acid,\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score to\nbuild the predictive model with an AUC of 0.907 (95% CI, 0.843 to 0.956). In\naddition, a high association between bacteremia and mortality rate was\ndiscovered through the survival analysis (0.004). While PCT is certainly a\nuseful index for distinguishing patients with and without bacteremia by itself,\nour MLR model indicates that the accuracy of bacteremia prediction\nsubstantially improves by the combined use of PCT, bilirubin, NLR, platelets,\nlactic acid, ESR, and GCS score.",

            "summary": "Rotating black holes exhibit a remarkable set of hidden symmetries near their\nhorizon. They have been shown to determine phenomena such as absorption\nscattering, superradiance and more recently tidal deformations, also known as\nLove numbers. They have also led to a proposal for a dual thermal CFT with left\nand right movers recovering the entropy of the black hole.\n  In this work we provide a constructive explanation of these hidden symmetries\nvia analytic continuation to Klein signature. We first show that the\nnear-horizon region of extremal black holes is a Kleinian static solution with\nmass $M$ and NUT charge $N$. We then analyze the self-dual solution, namely a\nKerr black hole with a NUT charge $N=\\pm M$. Remarkably, the self-dual solution\nis self-similar to its near-horizon and hence approximate symmetries become\nexact: in particular, the original two isometries of Kerr are promoted to seven\nexact symmetries embedded in a conformal algebra. We analyze its full conformal\ngroup in Kleinian twistor space, where a breaking $SO(4,2) \\to\nSL(2,\\mathbb{R})\\times SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ occurs due to the insertion of a\npreferred time direction for the black hole. Finally, we show that its spectrum\nis integrable and behaves as the Hydrogen atom, being solvable in terms of\nelementary polynomials. Perturbing to astrophysical black holes with $N=0$, we\nobtain a hyperfine splitting structure.",

            "summary": "Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in\ntheir ability to generate synthetic query-document pairs by prompting with as\nfew as 8 demonstrations. This has enabled building better IR models, especially\nfor tasks with no training data readily available. Typically, such synthetic\nquery generation (QGen) approaches condition on an input context (e.g. a text\ndocument) and generate a query relevant to that context, or condition the QGen\nmodel additionally on the relevance label (e.g. relevant vs irrelevant) to\ngenerate queries across relevance buckets. However, we find that such QGen\napproaches are sub-optimal as they require the model to reason about the\ndesired label and the input from a handful of examples. In this work, we\npropose to reduce this burden of LLMs by generating queries simultaneously for\ndifferent labels. We hypothesize that instead of asking the model to generate,\nsay, an irrelevant query given an input context, asking the model to generate\nan irrelevant query relative to a relevant query is a much simpler task setup\nfor the model to reason about. Extensive experimentation across seven IR\ndatasets shows that synthetic queries generated in such a fashion translates to\na better downstream performance, suggesting that the generated queries are\nindeed of higher quality.",

This paper comprehensively investigates\nterahertz channel performance under such conditions, employing a measurement\nsetup operational between 113 and 170 GHz. Analyzing scenarios frequently\ninduced by human activity and environmental factors, like door movements, we\nestablished a comprehensive theoretical model. This model seamlessly integrates\ntransmission, reflection, absorption, and diffraction mechanisms, leveraging\nthe Fresnel formula, multi-layer transmission paradigm, and knife-edge\ndiffraction theory. Our experimental results and theoretical predictions\nharmoniously align, revealing intricate dependencies, such as increased power\nloss at higher frequencies and larger incident angles. Furthermore, door\ninteractions, whether opening or oscillations, significantly impact the\nterahertz channel. Notably, door edges lead to a power blockage surpassing the\ntransmission loss of the glass itself but remaining inferior to metallic handle\ninterferences.

Utilizing data from Tokyo's Bunkyo\nmunicipality, this paper provides evidence of considerable manipulation, with\nparents strategically choosing to be waitlisted to enhance the likelihood of\ntheir child's admission into more selective daycare centers. I extend the\nstatic framework of school choice posited by Agarwal and Somaini (2018) to\nincorporate dynamic incentives and estimate a structural model that allows for\nreapplication if waitlisted. Empirical findings indicate that approximately 30%\nof applicants forgo listing safer options in their initial application, a\nbehavior significantly pronounced among those who stand to benefit from the\nwaitlist prioritization. Counterfactual simulations, conducted under the\nscenario of no additional waitlist priority, predict a 17.7% decrease in the\nnumber of waitlisted applicants and a 1.2% increase in overall welfare.

Traditional numerical simulations often\nrequire vast computational resources, making them infeasible for numerous\nengineering applications. As an alternative, deep learning-based surrogate\nmodels have emerged, offering data-drive solutions. However, these are\ntypically constructed within deterministic settings, leading to shortfall in\ncapturing the innate chaotic and stochastic behaviors of turbulent dynamics. We\nintroduce a novel generative framework grounded in probabilistic diffusion\nmodels for versatile generation of spatiotemporal turbulence. Our method\nunifies both unconditional and conditional sampling strategies within a\nBayesian framework, which can accommodate diverse conditioning scenarios,\nincluding those with a direct differentiable link between specified conditions\nand generated unsteady flow outcomes, and scenarios lacking such explicit\ncorrelations. A notable feature of our approach is the method proposed for\nlong-span flow sequence generation, which is based on autoregressive\ngradient-based conditional sampling, eliminating the need for cumbersome\nretraining processes. We showcase the versatile turbulence generation\ncapability of our framework through a suite of numerical experiments,\nincluding: 1) the synthesis of LES simulated instantaneous flow sequences from\nURANS inputs; 2) holistic generation of inhomogeneous, anisotropic wall-bounded\nturbulence, whether from given initial conditions, prescribed turbulence\nstatistics, or entirely from scratch; 3) super-resolved generation of\nhigh-speed turbulent boundary layer flows from low-resolution data across a\nrange of input resolutions.

Using this identification, we probe how the evolved state spreads in\nthe corresponding conjugate space, by defining a notion of the complexity of\nthe spread of this evolved state. For a sudden quench scenario, where the\nparameters of an initial Hamiltonian (taken as the observable measured in the\ntwo-point measurement protocol) are suddenly changed to a new set of values, we\nfirst obtain the corresponding Krylov basis vectors and the associated Lanczos\ncoefficients for an initial pure state, and obtain the spread complexity.\nInterestingly, we find that in such a protocol, the Lanczos coefficients can be\nrelated to various cost functions used in the geometric formulation of circuit\ncomplexity, for example the one used to define Fubini-Study complexity. We\nillustrate the evolution of spread complexity both analytically, by using Lie\nalgebraic techniques, and by performing numerical computations. This is done\nfor cases when the Hamiltonian before and after the quench are taken as\ndifferent combinations of chaotic and integrable spin chains. We show that the\ncomplexity saturates for large values of the parameter only when the pre-quench\nHamiltonian is chaotic.

With the surge of the Internet of Things (IoT) in recent\nyears, there has arisen a pressing demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nbased anomaly detection methods designed to meet the requirements of IoT\ndevices. Catering to this futuristic vision, we introduce a lightweight\napproach to vehicle anomaly detection by utilizing the power of trajectory\nprediction. Our proposed design identifies vehicles deviating from expected\npaths, indicating highway risks from different camera-viewing angles from\nreal-world highway datasets. On top of that, we present VegaEdge - a\nsophisticated AI confluence designed for real-time security and surveillance\napplications in modern highway settings through edge-centric IoT-embedded\nplatforms equipped with our anomaly detection approach. Extensive testing\nacross multiple platforms and traffic scenarios showcases the versatility and\neffectiveness of VegaEdge. This work also presents the Carolinas Anomaly\nDataset (CAD), to bridge the existing gap in datasets tailored for highway\nanomalies. In real-world scenarios, our anomaly detection approach achieves an\nAUC-ROC of 0.94, and our proposed VegaEdge design, on an embedded IoT platform,\nprocesses 738 trajectories per second in a typical highway setting.

            "summary": "Although deep learning-based segmentation models have achieved impressive\nperformance on public benchmarks, generalizing well to unseen environments\nremains a major challenge. To improve the model's generalization ability to the\nnew domain during evaluation, the test-time training (TTT) is a challenging\nparadigm that adapts the source-pretrained model in an online fashion. Early\nefforts on TTT mainly focus on the image classification task. Directly\nextending these methods to semantic segmentation easily experiences unstable\nadaption due to segmentation's inherent characteristics, such as extreme class\nimbalance and complex decision spaces. To stabilize the adaptation process, we\nintroduce contrastive loss (CL), known for its capability to learn robust and\ngeneralized representations. Nevertheless, the traditional CL operates in the\nrepresentation space and cannot directly enhance predictions. In this paper, we\nresolve this limitation by adapting the CL to the output space, employing a\nhigh temperature, and simplifying the formulation, resulting in a\nstraightforward yet effective loss function called Output Contrastive Loss\n(OCL). Our comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach\nacross diverse evaluation scenarios. Notably, our method excels even when\napplied to models initially pre-trained using domain adaptation methods on test\ndomain data, showcasing its resilience and adaptability.\\footnote{Code and more\ninformation could be found at~ \\url{https://github.com/dazhangyu123/OCL}}",

However, classical optimization techniques encounter\nchallenges in discerning optimal parameters that align with the optimal\nsolution. In this work, we propose a hybrid optimization approach that\nintegrates Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),\nand a bilinear strategy as an innovative alternative to conventional optimizers\nfor predicting optimal parameters of QAOA circuits. GRU serves to\nstochastically initialize favorable parameters for depth-1 circuits, while CNN\npredicts initial parameters for depth-2 circuits based on the optimized\nparameters of depth-1 circuits. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we\nconducted a comparative analysis with traditional initialization methods using\nQAOA on Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph instances, revealing superior optimal\napproximation ratios. We employ the bilinear strategy to initialize QAOA\ncircuit parameters at greater depths, with reference parameters obtained from\nGRU-CNN optimization. This approach allows us to forecast parameters for a\ndepth-12 QAOA circuit, yielding a remarkable approximation ratio of 0.998\nacross 10 qubits, which surpasses that of the random initialization strategy\nand the PPN2 method at a depth of 10.

            "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence features an inverse energy cascade producing\nlarge-scale flow structures such as hurricane-like large-scale vortices (LSVs)\nand jets. We study the dynamics of such structures by direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) of stochastically forced, viscously damped 2D turbulence\nwithin a periodic rectangular domain $[0,L_x]\\times[0,L_y]$. Stable LSVs form\nin the system when the aspect ratio $\\delta = L_x/L_y \\approx 1$, while jets\npredominate at $\\delta\\gtrsim 1.1$. At intermediate values of $\\delta$, both\nstructures are metastable, and noise-induced transitions occur between them.\nBased on large-scale energy balance, we derive and verify predictions for the\nparameter dependence of the total kinetic energy and the flow polarity. We\ncollect detailed statistics on the lifetimes of LSVs and jets from long-time\nsimulations, consistent with a memoryless process. Our DNS results support both\nan exponential and an algebraic dependence of the mean lifetime on $\\delta$. We\nshow that the mean lifetime depends strongly on the Reynolds number $Re$. As\n$Re$ increases, the energy gap between LSV (lower energy) and jet states\n(higher energy) grows, leading to increasing lifetimes following power laws in\n$Re$. Similarly, as the forcing scale decreases, transitions become less\nfrequent. We study the transitions in terms of kinetic energy, flow polarity,\nand 2D phase-space diagrams, revealing that the transitions occur in two\nstages: an initial, efficient redistribution of kinetic energy by nonlinear\ntriadic interactions facilitates a rapid transition from LSVs to jets and vice\nversa. In the second stage, the kinetic energy of the newly formed structure\nslowly adjusts to its associated equilibrium value on a longer, viscous\ntimescale, leading to hysteresis.

Recent\nworks have shown that leveraging data-driven solutions that utilize advances in\ndeep learning methods to learn from past data of an epidemic often outperform\ntraditional mechanistic models. However, in many cases, the past data is sparse\nand may not sufficiently capture the underlying dynamics. While there exists a\nlarge amount of data from past epidemics, leveraging prior knowledge from\ntime-series data of other diseases is a non-trivial challenge. Motivated by the\nsuccess of pre-trained models in language and vision tasks, we tackle the\nproblem of pre-training epidemic time-series models to learn from multiple\ndatasets from different diseases and epidemics. We introduce Pre-trained\nEpidemic Time-Series Models (PEMS) that learn from diverse time-series datasets\nof a variety of diseases by formulating pre-training as a set of\nself-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. We tackle various important challenges\nspecific to pre-training for epidemic time-series such as dealing with\nheterogeneous dynamics and efficiently capturing useful patterns from multiple\nepidemic datasets by carefully designing the SSL tasks to learn important\npriors about the epidemic dynamics that can be leveraged for fine-tuning to\nmultiple downstream tasks.

For individual energies, the hexagonal\nCNN algorithm produced 15-30% improvements in modulation factor compared to\nmoment analysis method for 100% polarized data, and its performance was\ncomparable to rectangle-based CNN algorithm newly developed by IXPE team, but\nat a much less computational cost.",

In the context of\nlaser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing, a digital twin of the\nmanufacturing process can offer predictions for the produced parts, diagnostics\nfor manufacturing defects, as well as control capabilities. This paper\nintroduces a parameterized physics-based digital twin (PPB-DT) for the\nstatistical predictions of LPBF metal additive manufacturing process. We\naccomplish this by creating a high-fidelity computational model that accurately\nrepresents the melt pool phenomena and subsequently calibrating and validating\nit through controlled experiments. In PPB-DT, a mechanistic reduced-order\nmethod-driven stochastic calibration process is introduced, which enables the\nstatistical predictions of the melt pool geometries and the identification of\ndefects such as lack-of-fusion porosity and surface roughness, specifically for\ndiagnostic applications. Leveraging data derived from this physics-based model\nand experiments, we have trained a machine learning-based digital twin\n(PPB-ML-DT) model for predicting, monitoring, and controlling melt pool\ngeometries. These proposed digital twin models can be employed for predictions,\ncontrol, optimization, and quality assurance within the LPBF process,\nultimately expediting product development and certification in LPBF-based metal\nadditive manufacturing.",

Compared to non-ML methods, our method enhances\naccuracy, generalizability, and processing speed. Our approach employs two\nneural networks: a modified U-Net to obtain the 3D droplet field from the\nnumerically reconstructed optical field, followed by a VGG16 classifier to\nreduce false positives from the U-Net prediction. The modified U-Net is trained\nusing holograms generated using a single spray nozzle at three spray locations;\ncenter, half-span, and the spray edge to create training data with various\nnumber densities and droplet size ranges. VGG16 is trained via the minimum\nintensity projection of the droplet 3D point spread function. Data augmentation\nis used to increase the efficiency of classification and make the algorithm\ngeneralizable for different measurement settings. The model is validated via\nNIST traceable glass beads and six agricultural spray nozzles representing\nvarious spray characteristics. The results demonstrate a high accuracy rate,\nwith over 90% droplet extraction and less than 5% false positives. Compared to\ntraditional spray measurement techniques, our method offers a significant leap\nforward in spatial resolution and generalizability. In particular, our method\ncan extract the real cumulative volume distribution of the NIST beads, where\nthe laser diffraction is biased towards droplets moving at slower speeds.\nAdditionally, the ML-based DIH enables the estimation of mass and momentum flux\nat different locations and the calculation of relative velocities of droplet\npairs, which are difficult to obtain via conventional techniques.",

            "summary": "Chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) is a widely adopted manufacturing technique\nused in producing carbon-carbon and carbon-silicon carbide composites. These\nmaterials are especially valued in the aerospace and automotive industries for\ntheir robust strength and lightweight characteristics. The densification\nprocess during CVI critically influences the final performance, quality, and\nconsistency of these composite materials. Experimentally optimizing the CVI\nprocesses is challenging due to long experimental time and large optimization\nspace. To address these challenges, this work takes a modeling-centric\napproach. Due to the complexities and limited experimental data of the\nisothermal CVI densification process, we have developed a data-driven\npredictive model using the physics-integrated neural differentiable (PiNDiff)\nmodeling framework. An uncertainty quantification feature has been embedded\nwithin the PiNDiff method, bolstering the model's reliability and robustness.\nThrough comprehensive numerical experiments involving both synthetic and\nreal-world manufacturing data, the proposed method showcases its capability in\nmodeling densification during the CVI process. This research highlights the\npotential of the PiNDiff framework as an instrumental tool for advancing our\nunderstanding, simulation, and optimization of the CVI manufacturing process,\nparticularly when faced with sparse data and an incomplete description of the\nunderlying physics.",

Being aware of the\nexpected waiting times can lead to better interactions and managed expectations\nfor both the maintainers and the contributor. In this paper, we propose a\nmachine-learning approach to predict the first response latency of the\nmaintainers following the submission of a PR, and the first response latency of\nthe contributor after receiving the first response from the maintainers. We\ncurate a dataset of 20 large and popular open-source projects on GitHub and\nextract 21 features to characterize projects, contributors, PRs, and review\nprocesses. Using these features, we then evaluate seven types of classifiers to\nidentify the best-performing models. We also perform permutation feature\nimportance and SHAP analyses to understand the importance and impact of\ndifferent features on the predicted response latencies. Our best-performing\nmodels achieve an average improvement of 33% in AUC-ROC and 58% in AUC-PR for\nmaintainers, as well as 42% in AUC-ROC and 95% in AUC-PR for contributors\ncompared to a no-skilled classifier across the projects. Our findings indicate\nthat PRs submitted earlier in the week, containing an average or slightly\nabove-average number of commits, and with concise descriptions are more likely\nto receive faster first responses from the maintainers. Similarly, PRs with a\nlower first response latency from maintainers, that received the first response\nof maintainers earlier in the week, and containing an average or slightly\nabove-average number of commits tend to receive faster first responses from the\ncontributors. Additionally, contributors with a higher acceptance rate and a\nhistory of timely responses in the project are likely to both obtain and\nprovide faster first responses.",

A micromechanical model is developed to predict the\ndependence of mode I fracture toughness upon the degree of cementation. In\naddition, the role of the crack tip $T$-stress in dictating kink angle and\ntoughness is determined for mixed mode loading.

These small offsets subsequently introduce\nnoticeable changes in the trace positions of the NIRISS SOSS spectral orders\nbetween visits. This inconsistency, in turn, can lead to variations of the\nwavelength solution. In this report, we present the visit-to-visit\ncharacterization of the NIRISS GR700XD Wavelength Calibration for spectral\norders 1 and 2. Employing data from Calibration Program 1512 (PI: Espinoza),\nwhich intentionally and randomly sampled assorted pupil wheel positions during\nobservations of the A-star BD+60-1753, as well as data from preceding\ncommissioning and calibration activities to model this effect, we demonstrate\nthat the wavelength solution can fluctuate in a predictable fashion between\nvisits by up to a few pixels. We show that via two independent polynomial\nregression models for spectral orders 1 and 2, respectively, using the measured\nx-pixel positions of known Hydrogen absorption features in the A-star spectra\nand pupil wheel positions as regressors, we can accurately predict the\nwavelength solution for a particular visit with an RMS error within a few\ntenths of a pixel. We incorporate these models in PASTASOSS, a Python package\nfor predicting the GR700XD spectral traces, which now allows to accurately\npredict spectral trace positions and their associated wavelengths for any\nNIRISS/SOSS observation.",

            "summary": "In the present work, a rate-dependent cohesive zone model for the fracture of\npolymeric interfaces is presented. Inverse calibration of parameters for such\ncomplex models through trial and error is computationally tedious due to the\nlarge number of parameters and the high computational cost associated. The\nobtained parameter values are often non-unique and the calibration inherits\nhigher uncertainty when the available experimental data is limited. To\nalleviate these difficulties, a Bayesian calibration approach is used for the\nproposed rate-dependent cohesive zone model in this work. The proposed cohesive\nzone model accounts for both reversible elastic and irreversible rate-dependent\nseparation sliding deformation at the interface. The viscous dissipation due to\nthe irreversible opening at the interface is modeled using elastic-viscoplastic\nkinematics that incorporates the effects of strain rate. To quantify the\nuncertainty associated with the inverse parameter estimation, a modular\nBayesian approach is employed to calibrate the unknown model parameters,\naccounting for the parameter uncertainty of the cohesive zone model. Further,\nto quantify the model uncertainties, such as incorrect assumptions or missing\nphysics, a discrepancy function is introduced and it is approximated as a\nGaussian process. The improvement in the model predictions following the\nintroduction of a discrepancy function is demonstrated justifying the need for\na discrepancy term. Finally, the overall uncertainty of the model is quantified\nin a predictive setting and the results are provided as confidence intervals. A\nsensitivity analysis is also performed to understand the effect of the\nvariability of the inputs on the nature of the output.",

            "summary": "Integrating information from multiple modalities is arguably one of the\nessential prerequisites for grounding artificial intelligence systems with an\nunderstanding of the real world. Recent advances in video transformers that\njointly learn from vision, text, and sound over time have made some progress\ntoward this goal, but the degree to which these models integrate information\nfrom modalities still remains unclear. In this work, we present a promising\napproach for probing a pre-trained multimodal video transformer model by\nleveraging neuroscientific evidence of multimodal information processing in the\nbrain. Using brain recordings of participants watching a popular TV show, we\nanalyze the effects of multi-modal connections and interactions in a\npre-trained multi-modal video transformer on the alignment with uni- and\nmulti-modal brain regions. We find evidence that vision enhances masked\nprediction performance during language processing, providing support that\ncross-modal representations in models can benefit individual modalities.\nHowever, we don't find evidence of brain-relevant information captured by the\njoint multi-modal transformer representations beyond that captured by all of\nthe individual modalities. We finally show that the brain alignment of the\npre-trained joint representation can be improved by fine-tuning using a task\nthat requires vision-language inferences. Overall, our results paint an\noptimistic picture of the ability of multi-modal transformers to integrate\nvision and language in partially brain-relevant ways but also show that\nimproving the brain alignment of these models may require new approaches.",

            "summary": "Z-pinch platforms constitute a promising pathway to fusion energy research.\nHere, we present a one-dimensional numerical study of the staged Z-pinch (SZP)\nconcept using the FLASH and MACH2 codes. We discuss the verification of the\ncodes using two analytical benchmarks that include Z-pinch-relevant physics,\nbuilding confidence on the codes' ability to model such experiments. Then,\nFLASH is used to simulate two different SZP configurations: a xenon gas-puff\nliner (SZP1*) and a silver solid liner (SZP2). The SZP2 results are compared\nagainst previously published MACH2 results, and a new code-to-code comparison\non SZP1* is presented. Using an ideal equation of state and analytical\ntransport coefficients, FLASH yields a fuel convergence ratio (CR) of\napproximately 39 and a mass-averaged fuel ion temperature slightly below 1 keV\nfor the SZP2 scheme, significantly lower than the full-physics MACH2\nprediction. For the new SZP1* configuration, full-physics FLASH simulations\nfurnish large and inherently unstable CRs (> 300), but achieve fuel ion\ntemperatures of many keV. While MACH2 also predicts high temperatures, the fuel\nstagnates at a smaller CR. The integrated code-to-code comparison reveals how\nmagnetic insulation, heat conduction, and radiation transport affect platform\nperformance and the feasibility of the SZP concept.",

We conducted experiments on the \"ChestX-ray14\" dataset using various\npre-trained CNNs, transformers, hybrid(CNN+Transformer) models and classical\nmodels. The best individual model was the CoAtNet, which achieved an area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 84.2%.

To demonstrate the use of the two evaluation metrics, we applied both\nmethods to a recent US-based study that reported an improved performance of the\nradiologist-with-device workflow compared to the one without the device by\nretrospectively applying their AI algorithm to a large mammography dataset. We\nfurther applied the ERU method to a European study utilizing their reported\nrecall rates and cancer detection rates at different thresholds of their AI\nalgorithm to compare the potential utility among different thresholds. For the\nstudy using US data, neither the PPV/NPV nor the ERU method can conclude a\nsignificant improvement in diagnostic performance for any of the algorithm\nthresholds reported. For the study using European data, ERU values at lower AI\nthresholds are found to be higher than that at a higher threshold because more\nfalse-negative cases would be ruled-out at higher threshold, reducing the\noverall diagnostic performance. Both PPV/NPV and ERU methods can be used to\ncompare the diagnostic performance between the radiologist-with-device workflow\nand that without. One limitation of the ERU method is the need to measure the\nbaseline, standard-of-care relative utility (RU) value for mammography\nscreening in the US. Once the baseline value is known, the ERU method can be\napplied to large US datasets without knowing the true prevalence of the\ndataset.",

In this paper, we propose a simple and\nnatural reheating mechanism where the particle physics model, namely the Type-I\nseesaw is shown to play a major role in the entire reheating process where\ninflaton is coupled with all the fields only gravitationally. Besides\nsuccessfully resolving the well-known neutrino mass and baryon asymmetry\nproblems, this scenario offers successful reheating, predicts distinct\nprimordial gravitational wave spectrum and non-vanishing lowest active neutrino\nmass. Our novel mechanism opens up a new avenue of integrating particle physics\nand cosmology in the context of reheating.",

            "summary": "Understanding the stability of strongly correlated phases of matter when\ncoupled to environmental degrees of freedom is crucial for identifying the\nconditions under which these states may be observed. Here, we focus on the\nparadigmatic one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, and study the stability of the\nLuttinger liquid and Mott insulating phases in the presence of local particle\nexchange with site-independent baths of non-interacting bosons. We perform a\nnumerically exact analysis of this model by adapting the recently developed\nwormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to a\ncontinuous-time formulation with worm updates; we show how the wormhole updates\ncan be easily implemented in this scheme. For an Ohmic bath, our numerical\nfindings confirm the scaling prediction that the Luttinger-liquid phase becomes\nunstable at infinitesimal bath coupling. We show that the ensuing phase is a\nlong-range ordered superfluid with spontaneously-broken U(1) symmetry. While\nthe Mott insulator remains a distinct phase for small bath coupling, it\nexhibits diverging compressibility and non-integer local boson occupation in\nthe thermodynamic limit. Upon increasing the bath coupling, this phase\nundergoes a transition to a long-range ordered superfluid. Finally, we discuss\nthe effects of super-Ohmic dissipation on the Luttinger-liquid phase. Our\nresults are compatible with a stable dissipative Luttinger-liquid phase that\ntransitions to a long-range ordered superfluid at a finite system-bath\ncoupling.",

            "summary": "The nature and origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain an open\nmatter of debate within the scientific community. While various theoretical\nscenarios have been proposed, each with specific observational signatures, the\nlack of sufficiently sensitive X-ray observations hinders the progress of\nobservational tests. In this white paper, we present how AXIS will contribute\nto solving this issue. With an angular resolution of 1.5$^{\\prime\\prime}$\non-axis and minimal off-axis degradation, we have designed a deep survey\ncapable of reaching flux limits in the [0.5-2] keV range of approximately\n2$\\times$10$^{-18}$ \\fcgs~ over an area of 0.13 deg$^2$ in approximately 7\nmillion seconds (7 Ms). Furthermore, we have planned an intermediate depth\nsurvey covering approximately 2 deg$^2$ and reaching flux limits of about\n2$\\times$10$^{-17}$ \\fcgs ~ in order to detect a significant number of SMBHs\nwith X-ray luminosities (L$_X$) of approximately 10$^{42}$ \\lx up to z$\\sim$10.\nThese observations will enable AXIS to detect SMBHs with masses smaller than\n10$^5$ \\ms, assuming Eddington-limited accretion and a typical bolometric\ncorrection for Type II AGN. AXIS will provide valuable information on the\nseeding and population synthesis models of SMBH, allowing for more accurate\nconstraints on their initial mass function (IMF) and accretion history from\nz$\\sim$0-10. To accomplish this, AXIS will leverage the unique synergy of\nsurvey telescopes such as JWST, Roman, Euclid, LSST, and the new generation of\n30m class telescopes. These instruments will provide optical identification and\nredshift measurements, while AXIS will discover the smoking gun of nuclear\nactivity, particularly in the case of highly obscured AGN or peculiar UV\nspectra as predicted and recently observed in the early Universe.",

The\nstructure of the source shows two reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane.\nThe source extent is dominated by the extended filamentary envelope at\n$\\sim$4.4$\\mu$m and shorter wavelengths, transitioning at 7$\\mu$m and longer\nwavelengths to more compact lobes of scattered light from the disk itself. The\ndark lane thickness does not vary significantly with wavelength, which we\ninterpret as an indication for intermediate-sized ($\\sim10\\mu$m) grains in the\nupper layers of the disk. Intriguingly, we find that the brightest nebula of\nIRAS40302 switches side between 12.8$\\mu$m and 21$\\mu$m. We explore the effect\nof a tilted inner region on the general appearance of edge-on disks. We find\nthat radiative transfer models of a disk including a tilted inner region can\nreproduce an inversion in the brightest nebula. In addition, for specific\norientations, the model also predicts strong lateral asymmetries, which can\noccur for more than half possible viewing azimuths. A large number of edge-on\nprotoplanetary disks observed in scattered light show such lateral asymmetries\n(15/20), which suggests that a large fraction of protoplanetary disks might\nhost a tilted inner region. Stellar spots may also induce lateral asymmetries,\nwhich are expected to vary over a significantly shorter timescale. Variability\nstudies of edge-on disks would allow to test the dominant scenario for the\norigin of these asymmetries.",

Earlier work based on linear theory predicted an\nincrease in dynamical friction when dark halos have a net forward rotation,\nbecause prograde orbits couple to bars more strongly than retrograde orbits.\nSubsequent numerical studies, however, found the opposite trend: dynamical\nfriction weakens with increasing spin of the halo. We revisit this problem and\ndemonstrate that linear theory in fact correctly predicts a reduced torque in\nforward-rotating halos. We show that shifting the halo mass from retrograde to\nprograde phase space generates a positive gradient in the distribution function\nnear the origin of the z-angular momentum (Lz=0), which results in a resonant\ntransfer of Lz to the bar, making the net dynamical friction weaker. While this\neffect is subdominant for the major resonances, including the corotation\nresonance, it leads to a significant positive torque on the bar for the series\nof direct radial resonances, as these resonances are strongest at Lz=0. The\noverall dynamical friction from spinning halos is shown to decrease with the\nhalo's spin, in agreement with the secular behavior of N-body simulations. We\nvalidate our linear calculation by computing the nonlinear torque from\nindividual resonances using the angle-averaged Hamiltonian.",

Our feedback recipe accounts for\nthe angular dependence of radiative feedback upon black hole spin. We\nself-consistently evolve in time i) the gas accretion process from resolved\nscales to an unresolved AGN disc, ii) the evolution of the spin of the massive\nblack hole (MBH), iii) the injection of AGN-driven winds into the resolved\nscales, and iv) the spin-induced anisotropy of the overall feedback process. We\ntest our implementation by following the propagation of the wind-driven outflow\ninto a homogeneous medium, and we compare the results against simple analytical\nmodels. Then, we consider an isolated galaxy setup and there we study the\nimpact of the AGN feedback on the evolution of the MBH and the of the host\ngalaxy. We find that: i) AGN feedback limits the gas inflow that powers the\nMBH, with a consequent weak impact on the host galaxy characterized by a star\nformation (SF) suppression of about a factor of two in the nuclear region; ii)\nthe impact of AGN feedback on the host galaxy and on MBH growth is primarily\ndetermined by the AGN luminosity, rather than by its angular pattern set by the\nMBH spin; iii) the imprint of the angular pattern of the AGN radiation emission\nmanifest in a more clear way at high accretion rates. At such high rates the\nmore isotropic angular patterns, proper to higher spin values, sweep away gas\nin the nuclear region more easily, hence causing a slower MBH mass and spin\ngrowths and a higher quenching of the SF. We argue that the influence of\nspin-dependent anisotropy of AGN feedback on MBH and galaxy evolution is likely\nto be relevant in those scenarios characterized by high and prolonged MBH\naccretion episodes and by high AGN wind-galaxy coupling.

We also obtain\nan exact analytical result for the critical MZM occupation number ${{\\cal\nN}}_{\\rm MZM}$ which depends on the Catalan's constant ${\\cal G}\\approx\n0.91596559$, for both the ground-state (${{\\cal N}}_{\\rm\nMZM}=1/2-4{\\cal{G}}/\\pi^2\\approx 0.12877$) and the first excited state (${{\\cal\nN}}_{\\rm MZM}=1/2+(8-4{\\cal{G}})/\\pi^2\\approx 0.93934$).

While there have been\nsignificant recent strides in some cases towards understanding how neural\nnetworks implement specific target functions, this paper explores a\ncomplementary question -- why do networks arrive at particular computational\nstrategies? Our inquiry focuses on the algebraic learning tasks of modular\naddition, sparse parities, and finite group operations. Our primary theoretical\nfindings analytically characterize the features learned by stylized neural\nnetworks for these algebraic tasks. Notably, our main technique demonstrates\nhow the principle of margin maximization alone can be used to fully specify the\nfeatures learned by the network. Specifically, we prove that the trained\nnetworks utilize Fourier features to perform modular addition and employ\nfeatures corresponding to irreducible group-theoretic representations to\nperform compositions in general groups, aligning closely with the empirical\nobservations of Nanda et al. and Chughtai et al. More generally, we hope our\ntechniques can help to foster a deeper understanding of why neural networks\nadopt specific computational strategies.",

More recently, DNNs for tabular data have gained increasing\nattention due to the rise of transformer models.\n  Our research presents a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on tabular\ndata using DNNs, particularly focusing on transformer-based networks. Given the\ninherent complexities of tabular data, we explore the challenges of embedding\nbackdoors. Through systematic experimentation across benchmark datasets, we\nuncover that transformer-based DNNs for tabular data are highly susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks, even with minimal feature value alterations. Our results\nindicate nearly perfect attack success rates (approx100%) by introducing novel\nbackdoor attack strategies to tabular data.

These are also independent of charm fragmentation, while practical\nmeasurements of charm hadrons in a fiducial phase space are not. Recently the\nLHC experiments have reported non-universality of charm fragmentation, which\nshows that e.g. charm baryon-to-meson ratios are not universal in different\ncollision systems, and that the related production fractions also depend on\ntransverse momentum. This breaks the charm fragmentation universality that was\nassumed until recently for the extrapolation of experimental measurements to\nthe full total charm cross section phase space. A proposal is made how to\naddress this non-universality in a data driven way without the need to\nimplement any particular non-universal fragmentation model. As a practical\nexample, this method is applied to the extrapolation of published LHC\nmeasurements of $D^0$ production at $\\sqrt{s}=5$ TeV to the corresponding total\ncharm cross section, which fully accounts for charm fragmentation\nnon-universality for the first time. The result, $8.43\n^{+1.05}_{-1.16}(\\text{total})$ mb, differs substantially from the one assuming\ncharm fragmentation universality, but still compares well to theoretical QCD\npredictions up to NNLO.",

An interactive sky server with the SPTpol maps and Dark Energy Survey\ndata release 2 images is also available at NCSA\nhttps://skyviewer.ncsa.illinois.edu.",

            "summary": "To form precipitation datasets that are accurate and, at the same time, have\nhigh spatial densities, data from satellites and gauges are often merged in the\nliterature. However, uncertainty estimates for the data acquired in this manner\nare scarcely provided, although the importance of uncertainty quantification in\npredictive modelling is widely recognized. Furthermore, the benefits that\nmachine learning can bring to the task of providing such estimates have not\nbeen broadly realized and properly explored through benchmark experiments. The\npresent study aims at filling in this specific gap by conducting the first\nbenchmark tests on the topic. On a large dataset that comprises 15-year-long\nmonthly data spanning across the contiguous United States, we extensively\ncompared six learners that are, by their construction, appropriate for\npredictive uncertainty quantification. These are the quantile regression (QR),\nquantile regression forests (QRF), generalized random forests (GRF), gradient\nboosting machines (GBM), light gradient boosting machines (LightGBM) and\nquantile regression neural networks (QRNN). The comparison referred to the\ncompetence of the learners in issuing predictive quantiles at nine levels that\nfacilitate a good approximation of the entire predictive probability\ndistribution, and was primarily based on the quantile and continuous ranked\nprobability skill scores. Three types of predictor variables (i.e., satellite\nprecipitation variables, distances between a point of interest and satellite\ngrid points, and elevation at a point of interest) were used in the comparison\nand were additionally compared with each other. This additional comparison was\nbased on the explainable machine learning concept of feature importance. The\nresults suggest that the order from the best to the worst of the learners for\nthe task investigated is the following: LightGBM, QRF, GRF, GBM, QRNN and QR...",

            "summary": "The combination of quantum many-body and machine learning techniques has\nrecently proved to be a fertile ground for new developments in quantum\ncomputing. Several works have shown that it is possible to classically\nefficiently predict the expectation values of local observables on all states\nwithin a phase of matter using a machine learning algorithm after learning from\ndata obtained from other states in the same phase. However, existing results\nare restricted to phases of matter such as ground states of gapped Hamiltonians\nand Gibbs states that exhibit exponential decay of correlations. In this work,\nwe drop this requirement and show how it is possible to learn local expectation\nvalues for all states in a phase, where we adopt the Lindbladian phase\ndefinition by Coser \\& P\\'erez-Garc\\'ia [Coser \\& P\\'erez-Garc\\'ia, Quantum 3,\n174 (2019)], which defines states to be in the same phase if we can drive one\nto other rapidly with a local Lindbladian. This definition encompasses the\nbetter-known Hamiltonian definition of phase of matter for gapped ground state\nphases, and further applies to any family of states connected by short unitary\ncircuits, as well as non-equilibrium phases of matter, and those stable under\nexternal dissipative interactions. Under this definition, we show that $N =\nO(\\log(n/\\delta)2^{polylog(1/\\epsilon)})$ samples suffice to learn local\nexpectation values within a phase for a system with $n$ qubits, to error\n$\\epsilon$ with failure probability $\\delta$. This sample complexity is\ncomparable to previous results on learning gapped and thermal phases, and it\nencompasses previous results of this nature in a unified way. Furthermore, we\nalso show that we can learn families of states which go beyond the Lindbladian\ndefinition of phase, and we derive bounds on the sample complexity which are\ndependent on the mixing time between states under a Lindbladian evolution.",

We provide a general recipe for incorporating\nbiaxial liquid crystal order parameters into fundamental measure theory and use\nthis framework to obtain the phase boundaries for the emergence of\norientational order in the considered systems.

            "summary": "Aims. We aim to characterize the gas properties in the cluster outskirts\n($R_{500}<r<R_{200}$) and in the detected inter-cluster filaments ($>R_{200}$)\nof the A3391/95 system and to compare them to predictions. Methods. We\nperformed X-ray image and spectral analyses using the eROSITA PV data to assess\nthe gas morphology and properties in the outskirts and the filaments in the\ndirections of the previously detected Northern and Southern Filament of the\nA3391/95 system. We took particular care of the foreground. Results. In the\nfilament-facing outskirts of A3391 and the Northern Clump, we find higher\ntemperatures than typical cluster outskirts profiles, with a significance of\n$1.6-2.8\\sigma$, suggesting heating due to their connections with the\nfilaments. We confirm SB excess in the profiles of the Northern, Eastern, and\nSouthern Filaments. From spectral analysis, we detect hot gas of ~1 keV for the\nNorthern and Southern Filaments. The filament metallicities are below 10% solar\nmetallicity and the $n_e$ range between 2.6 and\n$6.3\\times10^{-5}~\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. The characteristic properties of the\nLittle Southern Clump (~1.5$R_{200}$ from A3395S in the Southern Filament)\nsuggest that it is a small galaxy group. Excluding the LSC from the analysis of\nthe Southern Filament decreases the gas density by 30%. This shows the\nimportance of taking into account any clumps to avoid overestimation of the gas\nmeasurement in the outskirts and filament regions. Conclusions. The $n_e$ of\nthe filaments are consistent with the WHIM properties as predicted by\ncosmological simulations, but the temperatures are higher, close to the upper\nWHIM temperature limit. As both filaments are short and located in a denser\nenvironment, stronger gravitational heating may be responsible for this\ntemperature enhancement. The metallicities are low, but still within the\nexpected range from the simulations.",

In other words, instruction tuning, which helps LLMs\nprovide human-preferred responses, does not always make them human-like from\nthe computational psycholinguistics perspective. In addition, we explore\nprompting methodologies in simulating human reading behavior with LLMs, showing\nthat prompts reflecting a particular linguistic hypothesis lead LLMs to exhibit\nbetter PPP but are still worse than base LLMs. These highlight that recent\ninstruction tuning and prompting do not offer better estimates than direct\nprobability measurements from base LLMs in cognitive modeling.",

            "summary": "There is growing interest in automating agricultural tasks that require\nintricate and precise interaction with specialty crops, such as trees and\nvines. However, developing robotic solutions for crop manipulation remains a\ndifficult challenge due to complexities involved in modeling their deformable\nbehavior. In this study, we present a framework for learning the deformation\nbehavior of tree-like crops under contact interaction. Our proposed method\ninvolves encoding the state of a spring-damper modeled tree crop as a graph.\nThis representation allows us to employ graph networks to learn both a forward\nmodel for predicting resulting deformations, and a contact policy for inferring\nactions to manipulate tree crops. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments\nin a simulated environment and demonstrate generalizability of our method on\npreviously unseen trees.

The prognostic model first\nemploys multivariate functional principal component analysis to fuse the\nmulti-stream degradation signals.

To estimate parameters using distributed datasets and\nkeep the data privacy of all participants, we propose a new federated algorithm\nfor feature extraction.

            "summary": "The leading-order chiral Lagrangian for the baryon octet and decuplet states\ncoupled to Goldstone bosons and external sources contains six low-energy\nconstants. Five of them are fairly well known from phenomenology, but the sixth\none is practically unknown. This coupling constant provides the strength of the\n(p-wave) coupling of Goldstone bosons to decuplet states. Its size and even\nsign are under debate. Quark model and QCD for a large number of colors provide\npredictions, but some recent phenomenological analyses suggest even an opposite\nsign for the Delta-pion coupling. The Goldberger-Treiman relation connects this\ncoupling constant to the axial charge of the Delta baryon. This suggests a\nWu-type experiment to determine the unknown low-energy constant. While this is\nnot feasible in the Delta sector because of the large hadronic width of the\nDelta, there is a flavor symmetry related process that is accessible: the weak\nsemileptonic decay of the Omega baryon to a spin 3/2 cascade baryon. A broad\nresearch program is suggested that can pin down at least the rough size and the\nsign of the last unknown low-energy constant of the leading-order Lagrangian.\nIt encompasses experimental measurements, in particular the forward-backward\nasymmetry of the semileptonic decay, together with a determination of the\nquark-mass dependences using lattice QCD for the narrow decuplet states and\nchiral perturbation theory to extrapolate to the Delta sector. Besides\ndiscussing the strategy of the research program, the present work provides a\nfeasibility check based on a simple leading-order calculation.",

            "summary": "Recent studies have highlighted a phenomenon in large language models (LLMs)\nknown as \"the reversal curse,\" in which the order of knowledge entities in the\ntraining data biases the models' comprehension. For example, if a model is\ntrained on sentences where entity A consistently appears before entity B, it\ncan respond to queries about A by providing B as the answer. However, it may\nencounter confusion when presented with questions concerning B. We contend that\nthe reversal curse is partially a result of specific model training objectives,\nparticularly evident in the prevalent use of the next-token prediction within\nmost causal language models. For the next-token prediction, models solely focus\non a token's preceding context, resulting in a restricted comprehension of the\ninput. In contrast, we illustrate that the GLM, trained using the\nautoregressive blank infilling objective where tokens to be predicted have\naccess to the entire context, exhibits better resilience against the reversal\ncurse. We propose a novel training method, BIdirectional Casual language\nmodeling Optimization (BICO), designed to mitigate the reversal curse when\nfine-tuning pretrained causal language models on new data. BICO modifies the\ncausal attention mechanism to function bidirectionally and employs a mask\ndenoising optimization. In the task designed to assess the reversal curse, our\napproach improves Llama's accuracy from the original 0% to around 70%. We hope\nthat more attention can be focused on exploring and addressing these inherent\nweaknesses of the current LLMs, in order to achieve a higher level of\nintelligence.",

To do so, we construct two-component matter\ndensity models, where one component describes the dark matter distribution, the\nother one for the stellar mass, which is made to follow the light profile by\nassuming a constant factor of $M_{\\star}/L$. Specifically, we adopt multiple\ncommonly used dark matter models and light distributions. We fit the\ntwo-component models directly to the {\\it total} matter density distributions\nof simulated galaxies to eliminate systematics from other modelling procedures.\nWe find that galaxies in general have more centrally-concentrated stellar mass\nprofile than their light distribution. This is more significant among more\nmassive galaxies, for which the $M_{\\star}/L$ profile rises up markedly towards\nthe centre and may often exhibit a dented feature due to on-going star\nformation at about one effective radius, encompassing a quenched bulge region.\nAs a consequence, a constant $M_{\\star}/L$ causes a model degeneracy to be\nartificially broken under specific model assumptions, resulting in strong and\nmodel-dependent biases on estimated properties, such as the central dark matter\nfraction and the initial mass function. Either a steeper dark matter profile\nwith an over-predicted density fraction, or an over-predicted stellar mass\nnormalization ($M_{\\star}/L$) is often obtained through model fitting. The\nexact biased behaviour depends on the slope difference between mass and light,\nas well as on the adopted models for dark matter and light.",

Pivoting via\nhigh-resource languages remains a strong strategy for low-resource directions,\nand in this paper we revisit ways of pivoting through multiple languages.\nPrevious work has used a simple averaging of probability distributions from\nmultiple paths, but we find that this performs worse than using a single pivot,\nand exacerbates the hallucination problem because the same hallucinations can\nbe probable across different paths. As an alternative, we propose MaxEns, a\ncombination strategy that is biased towards the most confident predictions,\nhypothesising that confident predictions are less prone to be hallucinations.\nWe evaluate different strategies on the FLORES benchmark for 20 low-resource\nlanguage directions, demonstrating that MaxEns improves translation quality for\nlow-resource languages while reducing hallucination in translations, compared\nto both direct translation and an averaging approach. On average, multi-pivot\nstrategies still lag behind using English as a single pivot language, raising\nthe question of how to identify the best pivoting strategy for a given\ntranslation direction.",

However, many energy, environmental, and\nindustrial processes rely on the mixing of solutes in porous media where\nconfinement suppresses inertial turbulence. As a result, mixing is drastically\nhindered, requiring fluid to permeate long distances for appreciable mixing and\nintroducing additional steps to drive mixing that can be expensive and\nenvironmentally harmful. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be\novercome just by adding dilute amounts of flexible polymers to the fluid.\nFlow-driven stretching of the polymers generates an elastic instability (EI),\ndriving turbulent-like chaotic flow fluctuations, despite the pore-scale\nconfinement that prohibits typical inertial turbulence. Using in situ imaging,\nwe show that these fluctuations stretch and fold the fluid within the pores\nalong thin layers (``lamellae'') characterized by sharp solute concentration\ngradients, driving mixing by diffusion in the pores. This process results in a\n$3\\times$ reduction in the required mixing length, a $6\\times$ increase in\nsolute transverse dispersivity, and can be harnessed to increase the rate at\nwhich chemical compounds react by $3\\times$ -- enhancements that we rationalize\nusing turbulence-inspired modeling of the underlying transport processes. Our\nwork thereby establishes a simple, robust, versatile, and predictive new way to\nmix solutes in porous media, with potential applications ranging from\nlarge-scale chemical production to environmental remediation.",

For this purpose, detecting\nhuman locomotion modes (e.g., level walking or stair ascent) in advance is\ncrucial for improving the intelligence and transparency of such robotic\nsystems. This study proposes Deep-STF, a unified end-to-end deep learning model\ndesigned for integrated feature extraction in spatial, temporal, and frequency\ndimensions from surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. Our model enables\naccurate and robust continuous prediction of nine locomotion modes and 15\ntransitions at varying prediction time intervals, ranging from 100 to 500 ms.\nIn addition, we introduced the concept of 'stable prediction time' as a\ndistinct metric to quantify prediction efficiency. This term refers to the\nduration during which consistent and accurate predictions of mode transitions\nare made, measured from the time of the fifth correct prediction to the\noccurrence of the critical event leading to the task transition. This\ndistinction between stable prediction time and prediction time is vital as it\nunderscores our focus on the precision and reliability of mode transition\npredictions. Experimental results showcased Deep-STP's cutting-edge prediction\nperformance across diverse locomotion modes and transitions, relying solely on\nsEMG data. When forecasting 100 ms ahead, Deep-STF surpassed CNN and other\nmachine learning techniques, achieving an outstanding average prediction\naccuracy of 96.48%. Even with an extended 500 ms prediction horizon, accuracy\nonly marginally decreased to 93.00%. The averaged stable prediction times for\ndetecting next upcoming transitions spanned from 28.15 to 372.21 ms across the\n100-500 ms time advances.",

            "summary": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into cyber-physical systems (CPS)\noffers significant benefits, including enhanced efficiency, predictive\ncapabilities, real-time responsiveness, and the enabling of autonomous\noperations. This convergence has accelerated the development and deployment of\na range of real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, delivery\ndrones, service robots, and telemedicine procedures. However, the software\ndevelopment life cycle (SDLC) for AI-infused CPS diverges significantly from\ntraditional approaches, featuring data and learning as two critical components.\nExisting verification and validation techniques are often inadequate for these\nnew paradigms. In this study, we pinpoint the main challenges in ensuring\nformal safety for learningenabled CPS.We begin by examining testing as the most\npragmatic method for verification and validation, summarizing the current\nstate-of-the-art methodologies. Recognizing the limitations in current testing\napproaches to provide formal safety guarantees, we propose a roadmap to\ntransition from foundational probabilistic testing to a more rigorous approach\ncapable of delivering formal assurance.",

A primary goal of this work is to produce mock\ngalaxy catalogs for the purpose of validating existing models and methods for\nthe mitigation of IA in weak lensing measurements. This technique can also be\nused to produce new, simulation-based predictions for IA and galaxy clustering.\nOur model is probabilistically formulated, and rests upon the assumption that\nthe orientations of galaxies exhibit a correlation with their host dark matter\n(sub)halo orientation or with their position within the halo. We examine the\nnecessary components and phenomenology of such a model by considering the\nalignments between (sub)halos in a cosmological dark matter only simulation. We\nthen validate this model for a realistic galaxy population in a set of\nsimulations in the Illustris-TNG suite. We create an HOD mock with\nIllustris-like correlations using our method, constraining the associated IA\nmodel parameters, with the $\\chi^2_{\\rm dof}$ between our model's correlations\nand those of Illustris matching as closely as 1.4 and 1.1 for\norientation--position and orientation--orientation correlation functions,\nrespectively. By modeling the misalignment between galaxies and their host\nhalo, we show that the 3-dimensional two-point position and orientation\ncorrelation functions of simulated (sub)halos and galaxies can be accurately\nreproduced from quasi-linear scales down to $0.1~h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$. We also find\nevidence for environmental influence on IA within a halo. Our\npublicly-available software provides a key component enabling efficient\ndetermination of Bayesian posteriors on IA model parameters using observational\nmeasurements of galaxy-orientation correlation functions in the highly\nnonlinear regime.",

The\nproposed model learns discriminative graph node representations by\nincorporating both imaging and non-imaging features into the graph nodes and\nedges, respectively, with the aim of augmenting predictive capabilities and\nproviding a holistic perspective on the underlying mechanisms of brain\ndisorders. Skip connections enable the direct flow of information from the\ninput features to later layers of the network, while identity mapping helps\nmaintain the structural information of the graph during feature learning. We\nbenchmark our model against several recent baseline methods on two large\ndatasets, Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), for the prediction of autism spectrum disorder\nand Alzheimer's disease, respectively.

We have also found in our\nprevious study a universal quadratic correlation between the wall pressure\ndifference (pressure difference near the bubble wall) to the non-relativistic\nterminal wall velocity regardless of wall geometries. In this paper, we will\ngeneralize these analytic relations between the phase/wall pressure difference\nand terminal wall velocity into a more realistic equation of state beyond the\nsimple bag model, providing the most general predictions so far for future\ntests from holographic numerical simulations of strongly-coupled first-order\nphase transitions",

            "summary": "Various oscillatory phenomena occur in the world. Because some oscillations\nare related to abnormal states (e.g., particular diseases), establishing\nstate-transition methods from an oscillatory to a resting state is important.\nIn this study, we construct a simple metronome model and analyze the\noscillation-quenching phenomenon of metronomes on a platform as an example of\nsuch state transitions. Although numerous studies were conducted on the\nmetronome dynamics, most of them focused on the synchronization, and few\nstudies treated the oscillation quenching because of the difficulty in\nanalysis. To facilitate the analysis, we model a metronome as a linear spring\npendulum with an impulsive force (escapement mechanism) described by a\nfifth-order polynomial. By performing an averaging approximation, we obtain a\nphase diagram for the in-phase synchronization, anti-phase synchronization, and\noscillation quenching. We also numerically integrate the equation of motion and\nconfirm the agreement between the analytical and numerical results. Despite the\nsimplicity, our model successfully reproduces essential phenomena in\ninteracting mechanical clocks, such as the bistability of in-phase and\nanti-phase synchrony and oscillation quenching occurring for a large mass ratio\nbetween the oscillator and the platform. We believe that our simple model will\ncontribute to future analyses of other dynamics observed in metronomes.",

            "summary": "Lattice studies suggest that at zero baryon chemical potential and increasing\ntemperature there are three characteristic regimes in QCD that are connected by\nsmooth analytical crossovers: a hadron gas regime at T < T_ch ~ 155 MeV, an\nintermediate regime, called stringy fluid, at T_ch < T < ~ 3 T_ch, and a\nquark-gluon plasma regime at higher temperatures. These regimes have been\ninterpreted to reflect different approximate symmetries and effective degrees\nof freedom. In the hadron gas the effective degrees of freedom are hadrons and\nthe approximate chiral symmetry of QCD is spontaneously broken. The\nintermediate regime has been interpreted as lacking spontaneous chiral symmetry\nbreaking along with the emergence of new approximate symmetry, chiral spin\nsymmetry, that is not a symmetry of the Dirac Lagrangian, but is a symmetry of\nthe confining part of the QCD Lagrangian. While the high temperature regime is\nthe usual quark-gluon plasma which is often considered to reflect\n\"deconfinement\" in some way. This paper explores the behavior of these regimes\nof QCD as the number of colors in the theory, N_c, gets large. In the large N_c\nlimit the theory is center-symmetric and notions of confinement and\ndeconfinement are unambiguous. The energy density is O(N_c^0) in the meson gas,\nO(N_c^1) in the intermediate regime and O(N_c^2) in the quark-gluon plasma\nregime. In the large N_c limit these regimes may become distinct phases\nseparated by first order phase transitions. The intermediate phase has the\npeculiar feature that glueballs should exist and have properties that are\nunchanged from what is seen in the vacuum (up to 1/N_c corrections), while the\nordinary dilute gas of mesons with broken chiral symmetry disappears and\napproximate chiral spin symmetry should emerge.",

The\nconcise formulation of these laws is a crucial objective in scientific research\nand an important challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). While traditional\nartificial neural networks (MLP) excel at data fitting, they often yield\nuninterpretable black box results that hinder our understanding of the\nrelationship between variables x and predicted values y. Moreover, the fixed\nnetwork architecture in MLP often gives rise to redundancy in both network\nstructure and parameters. To address these issues, we propose MetaSymNet, a\nnovel neural network that dynamically adjusts its structure in real-time,\nallowing for both expansion and contraction. This adaptive network employs the\nPANGU meta function as its activation function, which is a unique type capable\nof evolving into various basic functions during training to compose\nmathematical formulas tailored to specific needs. We then evolve the neural\nnetwork into a concise, interpretable mathematical expression. To evaluate\nMetaSymNet's performance, we compare it with four state-of-the-art symbolic\nregression algorithms across more than 10 public datasets comprising 222\nformulas. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms\nothers consistently regardless of noise presence or absence. Furthermore, we\nassess MetaSymNet against MLP and SVM regarding their fitting ability and\nextrapolation capability, these are two essential aspects of machine learning\nalgorithms. The findings reveal that our algorithm excels in both areas.\nFinally, we compared MetaSymNet with MLP using iterative pruning in network\nstructure complexity. The results show that MetaSymNet's network structure\ncomplexity is obviously less than MLP under the same goodness of fit.",

Conventional methods can struggle to\nsurmount the complexities of such tasks. Quantum computing and quantum\nannealing emerge as avant-garde contenders to transcend conventional\ncomputational constraints. We convert a dynamic optimization problem,\ncharacterized by a system of differential equations, into a Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimization problem, enabling quantum computational\napproaches. The empirical findings synthesized from classical methods,\nsimulated annealing, quantum annealing via D-Wave's quantum annealer, and\nhybrid solver methodologies, illuminate the intricate landscape of\ncomputational prowess essential for tackling complex and high-dimensional\ndynamic optimization problems. Our findings suggest that while quantum\nannealing is a maturing technology that currently does not outperform\nstate-of-the-art classical solvers, continuous improvements could eventually\naid in increasing efficiency within the chemical process industry.",

The period of oscillations of two planes is found\nanalytically to be given by Euler beta functions, and its scaling with\nnon-linearity parameter and amplitude of oscillations, or applied shear\npressure is discussed on examples of time dependencies of displacement,\nvelocities, and forces acting on masses (planes). The relationship between\nphysical quantities (displacement, velocities, pressure) is explained. The\ndynamics of stress penetration from the sample surface towards its interior is\nconfirmed to be given exactly by a series of Bessel functions when n=2 (in\nharmonic case). When n <> 2 the stress dynamics (wave propagation) in bulk\nmaterial remains qualitatively of the same nature as in the linear case. In\nparticular, results suggest that the quasi-linear relationship between\nfrequency and wave number is preserved. Speed of the transverse sound\ncomponent, dependent on sound wave amplitude, is found to be a strongly\ndecreasing function of n. The results are useful in the analysis of any MD\nsimulations under pressure, as they help to understand the dynamics of pressure\nretarded effects, as well help design the proper methodology of performing MD\nsimulations, such as studies of dynamics of dislocations.",

This belongs to a class of impact and collision\nproblems with a wide range of applications in science and engineering, and\nmotivated here by splashing processes in breaking ocean waves. Interfacial\nperturbations with a truncated white noise frequency profile are introduced to\nthe rims before their collision, whose subsequent morphological development is\nsimulated by solving the two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with\nthe adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique, within the Basilisk software\nenvironment. We first derive analytical solutions predicting the unsteady\ninterfacial and velocity profiles of the expanding sheet forming between the\ntwo rims, and develop scaling laws for the evolution of the lamella rim under\ncapillary deceleration. We then analyse the formation and growth of transverse\nligaments ejected from the lamella rims, which we find to originate from the\ninitial corrugated geometry of the perturbed rim surface. Novel scaling models\nare proposed for predicting the decay of the ligament number density due to the\nongoing ligament merging phenomenon, and found to agree well with the numerical\nresults presented here. The role of the mechanism in breaking waves is\ndiscussed further and necessary next steps in the problem identified.",

Simulations of nitrogen seeding with baffles is found to yield\nlower target temperatures and heat fluxes than in baffle-only and seeding-only\nsimulations. The neutral compression increases with both baffles and seeding,\nbut due to different mechanism according to the proposed neutral transport\nmodel. The nitrogen retention, defined as the divertor-to-main chamber nitrogen\ndensity ratio, increases with the seeding rate if baffled. Baffled nitrogen\nretentions are lower than the unbaffled retentions at low seeding levels and\nare higher at high seeding levels. The baffled carbon retentions are always\nabove the unbaffled retentions due to increased target particle flux and\nsputtering by baffling. Baffles also relocate more impurity radiations from the\nmain chamber region into the divertor. The predicted trends of target\nparameters, radiation and neutral distributions are well supported by TCV\nexperiments, though discrepancies in absolute values remain. The simulations\ngenerally yield a colder and denser divertor, consistent with previous\nSOLPS-ITER simulations of Ohmically heated L-modes in TCV.

However, it remains widely unexplored how both\nparadigms could benefit from one another to address today's major challenges in\nhealthcare. One of these is smarter planning of resource capacities for frail\nand elderly inpatient wards, addressing the societal challenge of an aging\npopulation. Frail and elderly patients typically suffer from multimorbidity and\nrequire more care while receiving medical treatment. The aim of this research\nis to assess how various predictive and prescriptive analytical methods, both\nindividually and in tandem, contribute to addressing the operational challenges\nwithin an area of healthcare that is growing in demand. Clinical and\ndemographic patient attributes are gathered from more than 165,000 patient\nrecords and used to explain and predict length of stay. To that extent, we\nemploy Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis to establish this\nrelationship. On the prescriptive side, deterministic and two-stage stochastic\nprograms are developed to determine how to optimally plan for beds and ward\nstaff with the objective to minimize cost. Furthermore, the two analytical\nmethodologies are linked by generating demand for the prescriptive models using\nthe CART groupings. The results show the linked methodologies provided\ndifferent but similar results compared to using averages and in doing so,\ncaptured a more realistic real-world variation in the patient length of stay.\nOur research reveals that healthcare managers should consider using predictive\nand prescriptive models to make more informed decisions. By combining\npredictive and prescriptive analytics, healthcare managers can move away from\nrelying on averages and incorporate the unique characteristics of their\npatients to create more robust planning decisions, mitigating risks caused by\nvariations in demand.",

The study unveils some distinctive\nfeatures of these solutions. In this paper, we compute the gravitational waves\nemitted from the \\ac{EMRI} around these quantum-corrected rotating black holes\nusing the kludge approximate method. Firstly, we derive the orbital energy,\nangular momentum and fundamental frequencies for orbits on the equatorial\nplane. We find that, for the gravitational radiation described by quadrupole\nformulas, the contribution from the trace anomaly only appears at higher-order\nterms in the energy flux when compared with the standard Kerr case. Therefore,\nwe can compute the EMRI waveforms from the quantum-corrected rotating black\nhole using the Kerr fluxes. We assess the differences between the EMRI\nwaveforms from rotating black holes with and without the trace anomaly by\ncalculating the dephasing and mismatch. Our results demonstrate that\nspace-borne gravitational wave detectors can distinguish the EMRI waveform from\nthe quantum-corrected black holes with a fractional coupling constant of $\\sim\n10^{-3}$ within one year observation. Finally, we compute the constraint on the\ncoupling constant using the Fisher information matrix method and find that the\npotential constraint on the coupling constant by LISA can be within the error\n$\\sim 10^{-4}$ in suitable scenarios.",

In the literature, several\nalgorithms have been developed for solving this problem.

The analytical model, in turn, represents the probability for the\nplanetary bulk density as three generalised Student's t-distributions with\nradius-dependent weights and means based on theoretical composition models. The\napproach is based on Bayesian inference and aims to overcome the rigidity of\nsimple parametric mass-radius relations and the danger of overfitting of\nnon-parametric mass-radius relations.\n  The package includes a set of pre-trained and ready-to-use relations based on\ntwo M dwarf catalogues, one FGK star catalogue, and two theoretical composition\nmodels for water-rich planets. The inference of new models is easy and fast,\nand the package includes a command line tool that allows for coding-free use of\nthe relation, including the creation of publication-quality plots.\n  Additionally, we study whether the current mass and radius observations of\nsmall exoplanets support the presence of a population of water-rich planets\npositioned between rocky planets and sub-Neptunes. The study is based on\nBayesian model comparison and shows somewhat strong support against the\nexistence of a water-world population around M dwarfs. However, the results of\nthe study depend on the chosen theoretical water-world density model. A more\nconclusive result requires a larger sample of precisely characterised planets\nand community consensus on a realistic water world interior structure and\natmospheric composition model.",

Our analysis points to the crucial role of spatial coherence\nand predicts a set of novel phenomena: noise can enhance the transient\ndiffusivity and diffusion length of sufficiently extended initial states; A\nsmooth Gaussian initial state spreads slower than a localized initial state; A\nstanding or traveling initial state with large momentum spreads faster than a\nlocalized initial state and exhibits a noise-induced peak in the transient\ndiffusivity; The change in the time-dependent diffusivity and diffusion length\nrelative to a localized initial state follows a universal dependence on the\nGaussian width.

This\nis achieved by mathematically solving the partial differential equation of the\nTKE transport using the Green's function method. The developed solution reduces\nto a double integral that can be computed numerically for a wake prescribed by\nany arbitrary velocity profile. It is shown that the solution can be further\nsimplified to a single integral for wakes with Gaussian-like velocity-deficit\nprofiles. Model results are compared and validated against detailed 3D laser\nDoppler anemometry data measured within the wake flow of a model wind turbine\nin a laboratory environment. This shows a remarkably good agreement in both the\nmagnitude and shape of the radial TKE profiles at the turbine hub height. The\nwind-tunnel data also provide insights into the evolution of important\nturbulent flow quantities such as turbulent viscosity, mixing length, and the\nTKE dissipation rate within a wind turbine wake.",

However, these models have not demonstrated improved\nensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and\nclimate simulations. Here we present the first GCM that combines a\ndifferentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with ML components, and show\nthat it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and\nclimate on par with the best ML and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is\ncompetitive with ML models for 1-10 day forecasts, and with the European Centre\nfor Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for 1-15 day forecasts.\nWith prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate\nmetrics such as global mean temperature for multiple decades, and climate\nforecasts with 140 km resolution exhibit emergent phenomena such as realistic\nfrequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones.

While topological features emerge owing to the\nviolation of time reversal symmetry induced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction (DMI), here we consider an anisotropic DMI and ascertain the role\nof the anisotropy parameter on the topological phase transitions. In\nparticular, our phase plot for the ferromagnetic case demonstrates multiple\ntopological phase transitions, that is, from a topological phase to another\ntopological phase, and as well, from a topological phase to a trivial phase. In\nthe former, the topological invariant, namely the Chern number, discontinuously\nchanges from one finite value to another ($-1 \\rightarrow +1$), while it\nvanishes ($1 \\rightarrow 0$) in the latter. Further, an extended trivial region\nis observed where the DMI is non-zero, which is surprising since DMI is the\norigin of the topological gap. The nature of the phases and the phase\ntransitions, therein are characterized by their band structure, presence (or\nabsence) of the chiral edge modes, computation of the topological Hall effect,\netc. In contrast, the antiferromagnetic case presents a more predictable\nscenario, in the sense, it behaves as a trivial insulator in the absence of\nDMI, although demonstrate a topological to trivial phase transition.",

The underlying mechanism is attributed to the modified\nrotation of the effective principal axis of a dense meta-atom array, where the\nstrong coupling among the units gives rise to a generalized linear geometric\nphase modulation on the pump light. Therefore, nonlinear geometric phases\ncarried by the third-harmonic emissions are the natural result of the\nwave-mixing process among the modes excited at the fundamental frequency. This\nmechanism further points out a new strategy to predict the nonlinear geometric\nphases delivered by the nanostructures according to their linear responses. Our\ndesign is simple and efficient, and offers alternatives for the nonlinear\nmeta-devices that are capable of flexible photon generation and manipulation.",

            "summary": "Background: Several approaches are currently trying to understand the\ngeneration of angular momentum in the fission fragments. The microscopic TDDFT\nand statistical FREYA lead to different predictions concerning the opening\nangle distribution formed between the two spins in particular at 0 and 180\ndegrees. Purpose: This letter aims to investigate how the geometry and the\nquantum nature of spins impact the distribution of opening angles to understand\nwhat leads to different model predictions. Method: Various assumptions of K\ndistribution (K=0, isotropic, isotropic with total K=0, and from TDFFT) are\ninvestigated in a quantum approach. These distributions are then compared to\nthe classical limit using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in the limit of\n$\\hbar$ approaches zero. Results: It is shown that in all the schematic\nscenario the quantal distribution of opening angle lead to the expected\nbehavior in the classical limit. The model shows that the quantal nature of the\nspins prevents the population of opening angles close to 0 and 180 degrees. The\ndifference in opening angle in the 2D and isotropic 3D distribution is\ndiscussed and it is shown that the realistic TDFFT opening angle distribution\npresents an intermediate behavior between the two cases. Conclusions: The last\ncomparison reveals two key differences between the two models' predictions: the\nquantal spins' nature in TDDFT and the assumption of zero K values in FREYA.",

            "summary": "Spontaneous speaking style exhibits notable differences from other speaking\nstyles due to various spontaneous phenomena (e.g., filled pauses, prolongation)\nand substantial prosody variation (e.g., diverse pitch and duration variation,\noccasional non-verbal speech like smile), posing challenges to modeling and\nprediction of spontaneous style. Moreover, the limitation of high-quality\nspontaneous data constrains spontaneous speech generation for speakers without\nspontaneous data. To address these problems, we propose SponTTS, a two-stage\napproach based on bottleneck (BN) features to model and transfer spontaneous\nstyle for TTS. In the first stage, we adopt a Conditional Variational\nAutoencoder (CVAE) to capture spontaneous prosody from a BN feature and involve\nthe spontaneous phenomena by the constraint of spontaneous phenomena embedding\nprediction loss. Besides, we introduce a flow-based predictor to predict a\nlatent spontaneous style representation from the text, which enriches the\nprosody and context-specific spontaneous phenomena during inference. In the\nsecond stage, we adopt a VITS-like module to transfer the spontaneous style\nlearned in the first stage to target speakers. Experiments demonstrate that\nSponTTS is effective in modeling spontaneous style and transferring the style\nto the target speakers, generating spontaneous speech with high naturalness,\nexpressiveness, and speaker similarity. The zero-shot spontaneous style TTS\ntest further verifies the generalization and robustness of SponTTS in\ngenerating spontaneous speech for unseen speakers.",

            "summary": "Game solving is a similar, yet more difficult task than mastering a game.\nSolving a game typically means to find the game-theoretic value (outcome given\noptimal play), and optionally a full strategy to follow in order to achieve\nthat outcome. The AlphaZero algorithm has demonstrated super-human level play,\nand its powerful policy and value predictions have also served as heuristics in\ngame solving. However, to solve a game and obtain a full strategy, a winning\nresponse must be found for all possible moves by the losing player. This\nincludes very poor lines of play from the losing side, for which the AlphaZero\nself-play process will not encounter. AlphaZero-based heuristics can be highly\ninaccurate when evaluating these out-of-distribution positions, which occur\nthroughout the entire search. To address this issue, this paper investigates\napplying online fine-tuning while searching and proposes two methods to learn\ntailor-designed heuristics for game solving. Our experiments show that using\nonline fine-tuning can solve a series of challenging 7x7 Killall-Go problems,\nusing only 23.54% of computation time compared to the baseline without online\nfine-tuning. Results suggest that the savings scale with problem size. Our\nmethod can further be extended to any tree search algorithm for problem\nsolving.

System 1 operates automatically and quickly\nwith little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control, while System 2\nfocuses on the demanding mental activities that require it and is slow based on\nrules. Specifically, we seek to study those cognitive processes and information\navailable to students when they face science problems and, therefore, to\nexplore the various heuristic processes that students use when solving physics\nproblems. Our results indicated four intuitive heuristics in students' minds\nwhen they solve problems in Mechanics and especially in the unit projectile\nmotion: associative activation, processing fluency, attribute substitution and\nanchoring effect.

We\nrefer to the data annotation in dataset construction for theory complementing\nand argue that the regression task prediction should not involve the feature\nfrom the camera branch. By following the cutting-edge perspective of 'Detecting\nAs Labeling', we propose a novel paradigm dubbed DAL. With the most classical\nelementary algorithms, a simple predicting pipeline is constructed by imitating\nthe data annotation process. Then we train it in the simplest way to minimize\nits dependency and strengthen its portability. Though simple in construction\nand training, the proposed DAL paradigm not only substantially pushes the\nperformance boundary but also provides a superior trade-off between speed and\naccuracy among all existing methods. With comprehensive superiority, DAL is an\nideal baseline for both future work development and practical deployment.

While\nseveral promising methods for removing attribute bias in neural networks have\nbeen proposed, their limitations remain under-explored. To that end, in this\nwork, we mathematically and empirically reveal the limitation of existing\nattribute bias removal methods in presence of strong bias and propose a new\nmethod that can mitigate this limitation. Specifically, we first derive a\ngeneral non-vacuous information-theoretical upper bound on the performance of\nany attribute bias removal method in terms of the bias strength, revealing that\nthey are effective only when the inherent bias in the dataset is relatively\nweak. Next, we derive a necessary condition for the existence of any method\nthat can remove attribute bias regardless of the bias strength. Inspired by\nthis condition, we then propose a new method using an adversarial objective\nthat directly filters out protected attributes in the input space while\nmaximally preserving all other attributes, without requiring any specific\ntarget label. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\nstrong and moderate bias settings. We provide extensive experiments on\nsynthetic, image, and census datasets, to verify the derived theoretical bound\nand its consequences in practice, and evaluate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method in removing strong attribute bias.",

With the great success of Graph Neural Networks in\nlearning node representations, GNN-based social recommendations have been\nwidely studied to model user-item interactions and user-user social relations\nsimultaneously. Despite their great successes, recent studies have shown that\nthese advanced recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks, in which attackers can inject well-designed fake user profiles to\ndisrupt recommendation performances. While most existing studies mainly focus\non targeted attacks to promote target items on vanilla recommender systems,\nuntargeted attacks to degrade the overall prediction performance are less\nexplored on social recommendations under a black-box scenario. To perform\nuntargeted attacks on social recommender systems, attackers can construct\nmalicious social relationships for fake users to enhance the attack\nperformance. However, the coordination of social relations and item profiles is\nchallenging for attacking black-box social recommendations. To address this\nlimitation, we first conduct several preliminary studies to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of cross-community connections and cold-start items in degrading\nrecommendations performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework\nMultiattack based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate the\ngeneration of cold-start item profiles and cross-community social relations for\nconducting untargeted attacks on black-box social recommendations.\nComprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.",

The flexible brain computation is crucial for\nsurvival and is of great interest in neuroscience. The nematode C. elegans\nmodulates its navigation behavior depending on the association of odor butanone\nwith food (appetitive training) or starvation (aversive training), and will\nthen climb up the butanone gradient or ignore it, respectively. However, the\nexact change in navigation strategy in response to learning is still unknown.\nHere we study the learned odor navigation in worms by combining precise\nexperimental measurement and a novel descriptive model of navigation. Our model\nconsists of two known navigation strategies in worms: biased random walk and\nweathervaning. We infer weights on these strategies by applying the model to\nworm navigation trajectories and the exact odor concentration it experiences.\nCompared to naive worms, appetitive trained worms up-regulate the biased random\nwalk strategy, and aversive trained worms down-regulate the weathervaning\nstrategy. The statistical model provides prediction with $>90 \\%$ accuracy of\nthe past training condition given navigation data, which outperforms the\nclassical chemotaxis metric. We find that the behavioral variability is altered\nby learning, such that worms are less variable after training compared to naive\nones. The model further predicts the learning-dependent response and\nvariability under optogenetic perturbation of the olfactory neuron\nAWC$^\\mathrm{ON}$. Lastly, we investigate neural circuits downstream from\nAWC$^\\mathrm{ON}$ that are differentially recruited for learned odor-guided\nnavigation. Together, we provide a new paradigm to quantify flexible navigation\nalgorithms and pinpoint the underlying neural substrates.",

The framework is multivariate, as\nlabel descriptions allow us to seamlessly integrate additional contextual\ninformation about the labels to improve task performance. On various standard\nclassification benchmarks, with six open-source LM families, we show that\nzero-shot classification with simple contextualization of the data source of\nthe evaluation set consistently outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot\nbaselines while improving robustness to prompt variations.

Specifically, robustness guarantees the worst-case performance when\nthe predictor's information set of the system is inadequate, and UQ\ncharacterizes how confident the predictor is about the predictions. However, it\nis difficult for traditional robust predictors to provide robust UQ because\nthey were designed to robustify the performance of point predictions. In this\npaper, we investigate how to robustify the probabilistic prediction for SDS,\nwhich can inherently provide robust distributional UQ. To characterize the\nperformance of probabilistic predictors, we generalize the concept of\nlikelihood function to likelihood functional, and prove that this metric is a\nproper scoring rule. Based on this metric, we propose a framework to quantify\nwhen the predictor is robust and analyze how the information set affects the\nrobustness. Our framework makes it possible to design robust probabilistic\npredictors by solving functional optimization problems concerning different\ninformation sets. In particular, we design a class of moment-based optimal\nrobust probabilistic predictors and provide a practical Kalman-filter-based\nalgorithm for implementation.

For the IIR variant,\nthe procedure determines the optimal lag (i.e. the passband group delay)\nyielding a recursive low-complexity smoother of low order, with a specified\nbandwidth, and excellent passband phase linearity. The filters are applied to\nthe problem of instantaneous frequency estimation, e.g. for Doppler-shift\nmeasurement, for a complex exponential with polynomial phase progression in\nadditive white noise. For this classical problem, simulations show that the\nincorporation of a prediction filter (with a one-sample lead) reduces the\nincidence of (phase or frequency) angle unwrapping errors, particularly for\nsignals with high rates of angle change, which are known to limit the\nperformance of standard FIR estimators at low SNR. This improvement allows the\ninstantaneous phase of low-frequency signals to be estimated, e.g. for\ntime-delay measurement, and/or the instantaneous frequency of\nfrequency-modulated signals, down to a lower SNR. In the absence of unwrapping\nerrors, the error variance of the IIR estimators (with the optimal phase lag)\nreaches the FIR lower bound, at a significantly lower computational cost.\nGuidelines for configuring and tuning both FIR and IIR filters are provided.",

            "summary": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) with weak supervision has achieved remarkable\nperformance in utilizing video-level labels to discriminate whether a video\nframe is normal or abnormal. However, current approaches are inherently limited\nto a closed-set setting and may struggle in open-world applications where there\ncan be anomaly categories in the test data unseen during training. A few recent\nstudies attempt to tackle a more realistic setting, open-set VAD, which aims to\ndetect unseen anomalies given seen anomalies and normal videos. However, such a\nsetting focuses on predicting frame anomaly scores, having no ability to\nrecognize the specific categories of anomalies, despite the fact that this\nability is essential for building more informed video surveillance systems.\nThis paper takes a step further and explores open-vocabulary video anomaly\ndetection (OVVAD), in which we aim to leverage pre-trained large models to\ndetect and categorize seen and unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose a\nmodel that decouples OVVAD into two mutually complementary tasks --\nclass-agnostic detection and class-specific classification -- and jointly\noptimizes both tasks. Particularly, we devise a semantic knowledge injection\nmodule to introduce semantic knowledge from large language models for the\ndetection task, and design a novel anomaly synthesis module to generate pseudo\nunseen anomaly videos with the help of large vision generation models for the\nclassification task. These semantic knowledge and synthesis anomalies\nsubstantially extend our model's capability in detecting and categorizing a\nvariety of seen and unseen anomalies. Extensive experiments on three\nwidely-used benchmarks demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on OVVAD task.",

            "summary": "Survival prediction plays a crucial role in assisting clinicians with the\ndevelopment of cancer treatment protocols. Recent evidence shows that\nmultimodal data can help in the diagnosis of cancer disease and improve\nsurvival prediction. Currently, deep learning-based approaches have experienced\nincreasing success in survival prediction by integrating pathological images\nand gene expression data. However, most existing approaches overlook the\nintra-modality latent information and the complex inter-modality correlations.\nFurthermore, existing modalities do not fully exploit the immense\nrepresentational capabilities of neural networks for feature aggregation and\ndisregard the importance of relationships between features. Therefore, it is\nhighly recommended to address these issues in order to enhance the prediction\nperformance by proposing a novel deep learning-based method. We propose a novel\nframework named Two-stream Transformer-based Multimodal Fusion Network for\nsurvival prediction (TTMFN), which integrates pathological images and gene\nexpression data. In TTMFN, we present a two-stream multimodal co-attention\ntransformer module to take full advantage of the complex relationships between\ndifferent modalities and the potential connections within the modalities.\nAdditionally, we develop a multi-head attention pooling approach to effectively\naggregate the feature representations of the two modalities. The experiment\nresults on four datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrate that TTMFN\ncan achieve the best performance or competitive results compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods in predicting the overall survival of patients.",

            "summary": "Modern science is dependent on imaging on the nanoscale, often achieved\nthrough processes that detect secondary electrons created by a highly focused\nincident charged particle beam. Scanning electron microscopy is employed in\napplications such as critical-dimension metrology and inspection for\nsemiconductor devices, materials characterization in geology, and examination\nof biological samples. With its applicability to non-conducting materials (not\nrequiring sample coating before imaging), helium ion microscopy (HIM) is\nespecially useful in the high-resolution imaging of biological samples such as\nanimal organs, tumor cells, and viruses. However, multiple types of measurement\nnoise limit the ultimate trade-off between image quality and the incident\nparticle dose, which can preclude useful imaging of dose-sensitive samples.\nExisting methods to improve image quality do not fundamentally mitigate the\nnoise sources. Furthermore, barriers to assigning a physically meaningful scale\nmake these modalities qualitative. Here we introduce ion count-aided microscopy\n(ICAM), which is a quantitative imaging technique that uses statistically\nprincipled estimation of the secondary electron yield. With a readily\nimplemented change in data collection, ICAM nearly eliminates the influence of\nsource shot noise -- the random variation in the number of incident ions in a\nfixed time duration. In HIM, we demonstrate 3x dose reduction; based on a good\nmatch between these empirical results and theoretical performance predictions,\nthe dose reduction factor is larger when the secondary electron yield is\nhigher. ICAM thus facilitates imaging of fragile samples and may make imaging\nwith heavier particles more attractive.",

This paper proposes a systematic, analytical approach\nfor assessing the impacts of extreme summer drought events on the available\ncapacity of hydro, thermal, and renewable energy generators. More specifically,\nthe systematic framework provides plant-level capacity derating models for\nhydroelectric, once-through cooling thermoelectric, recirculating cooling\nthermoelectric, combustion turbine, solar PV, and wind turbine systems.\nApplication of the proposed impact assessment framework to the 2025 generation\nfleet of the real-world power system in the PJM and SERC regions yields\ninsightful results. By examining the daily usable capacity of 6,055 at-risk\ngenerators throughout the study region, we find that in the event of the\nrecurrence of the 2007 southeastern summer drought in the near future, the\nusable capacity of all at-risk power plants may experience a substantial\ndecrease compared to a typical summer, falling within the range of 71% to 81%.\nThe sensitivity analysis reveals that the usable capacity would experience a\nmore pronounced decline under more severe drought conditions.

Yet, it continues to face numerous limitations\nsuch as poor explainability, sample inefficiency of data-driven methods,\ncomplexity of physics-based methods, and limited generalizability and\nscalability of knowledge-based methods. This paper proposes leveraging Digital\nTwins (DTs) to address these challenges and enable automated PMx adoption at\nlarger scales. While we argue that DTs have this transformative potential, they\nhave not yet reached the level of maturity needed to bridge these gaps in a\nstandardized way. Without a standard definition for such evolution, this\ntransformation lacks a solid foundation upon which to base its development.\nThis paper provides a requirement-based roadmap supporting standardized PMx\nautomation using DT technologies. A systematic approach comprising two primary\nstages is presented. First, we methodically identify the Informational\nRequirements (IRs) and Functional Requirements (FRs) for PMx, which serve as a\nfoundation from which any unified framework must emerge. Our approach to\ndefining and using IRs and FRs to form the backbone of any PMx DT is supported\nby the track record of IRs and FRs being successfully used as blueprints in\nother areas, such as for product development within the software industry.\nSecond, we conduct a thorough literature review spanning fields to determine\nthe ways in which these IRs and FRs are currently being used within DTs,\nenabling us to point to the specific areas where further research is warranted\nto support the progress and maturation of requirement-based PMx DTs.",

We have adopted a new projector-based prescription to\ncompute helicity amplitudes in the 't Hooft-Veltman scheme. We also rederived\nthe minimal set of independent Feynman integrals for this problem using the\ndifferential equations method, and we confirmed their intricate analytic\nproperties. By employing modern methods for integral reduction, we provide the\nfinal results in a compact form, which is appropriate for efficient numerical\nevaluation. Beyond QCD, we have computed the two-loop mixed QCD-electroweak\namplitudes for Z+jet production in proton scattering in light-quark-initiated\nchannels, without closed fermion loops. This process provides important insight\ninto the high-precision studies of the Standard Model, as well as into Dark\nMatter searches at the LHC. We have employed a numerical approach based on\nhigh-precision evaluation of Feynman integrals with the modern Auxiliary Mass\nFlow method. The obtained numerical results in all relevant partonic channels\nare evaluated on a two-dimensional grid appropriate for further\nphenomenological applications.",

We address the key issues\nof sequential dependence, infeasibility, and generalization in machine learning\n(ML) to make predictions for optimal solutions to combinatorial problems. The\nsequential nature of the combinatorial optimization problems considered is\ncaptured with recurrent neural networks and a sliding-attention window. We\nintegrate an attention-based encoder-decoder neural network architecture with\nan infeasibility-elimination and generalization framework to learn high-quality\nfeasible solutions to time-dependent optimization problems. In this framework,\nthe required level of predictions is optimized to eliminate the infeasibility\nof the ML predictions. These predictions are then fixed in mixed-integer\nprogramming (MIP) problems to solve them quickly with the aid of a commercial\nsolver. We demonstrate our approach to tackling the two well-known dynamic\nNP-Hard optimization problems: multi-item capacitated lot-sizing (MCLSP) and\nmulti-dimensional knapsack (MSMK). Our results show that models trained on\nshorter and smaller-dimensional instances can be successfully used to predict\nlonger and larger-dimensional problems. The solution time can be reduced by\nthree orders of magnitude with an average optimality gap below 0.1%.

These sensors inherently bear noise that often adversely\naffects performance and reliability of the systems they support. Classic\nfiltering-based approaches introduce strong assumptions on the time or\nfrequency characteristics of sensory measurements, while learning-based\ndenoising approaches typically rely on using ground truth clean data to train a\ndenoising model, which is often challenging or prohibitive to obtain for many\nreal-world applications. We observe that in many scenarios, the relationships\nbetween different sensor measurements (e.g., location and acceleration) are\nanalytically described by laws of physics (e.g., second-order differential\nequation). By incorporating such physics constraints, we can guide the\ndenoising process to improve even in the absence of ground truth data. In light\nof this, we design a physics-informed denoising model that leverages the\ninherent algebraic relationships between different measurements governed by the\nunderlying physics. By obviating the need for ground truth clean data, our\nmethod offers a practical denoising solution for real-world applications. We\nconducted experiments in various domains, including inertial navigation, CO2\nmonitoring, and HVAC control, and achieved state-of-the-art performance\ncompared with existing denoising methods.

In this paper, we investigate the joint formation and communication\nresource allocation optimization for a system comprising two unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) to perform InSAR sensing and to transfer the acquired data to\nthe ground. To this end, we adopt as sensing performance metrics the\ninterferometric coherence, i.e., the local correlation between the two\nco-registered UAV radar images, and the height of ambiguity (HoA), which\ntogether are a measure for the accuracy with which the InSAR system can\nestimate the height of ground objects. In addition, an analytical expression\nfor the coverage of the considered InSAR sensing system is derived. Our\nobjective is to maximize the InSAR coverage while satisfying all relevant\nInSAR-specific sensing and communication performance metrics. To tackle the\nnon-convexity of the formulated optimization problem, we employ alternating\noptimization (AO) techniques combined with successive convex approximation\n(SCA). Our simulation results reveal that the resulting resource allocation\nalgorithm outperforms two benchmark schemes in terms of InSAR coverage while\nsatisfying all sensing and real-time communication requirements.

The observed TbV rates are only weakly\ncorrelated with orbital period within Kepler's <~100 days-period planets.

In contrast, for $p=1$, there is no finite optimum and $\\gamma_{\\rm\nopt} \\to \\infty$ in this case. These analytical results are confirmed by our\nnumerical simulations.",

Under delay, energy and radio resource constraints, we then\noptimize client selection and their local rounds and central processing unit\n(CPU) frequencies to minimize a weighted utility function that facilitates\nRawHFL's convergence in an energy-efficient way.

            "summary": "The framed standard model (FSM), constructed to explain, with some success,\nwhy there should be 3 and apparently only 3 generations of quarks and leptons\nin nature falling into a hierarchical mass and mixing pattern, suggests also,\namong other things, a scalar boson U, with mass around 17 MeV and small\ncouplings to quarks and leptons, which might explain the g-2 anomaly reported\nin experiment. The U arises in FSM initially as a state in the predicted\n`hidden sector' with mass around 17 MeV, which mixes with the standard model\n(SM) Higgs $h_W$, acquiring thereby a coupling to quarks and leptons and a mass\njust below 17 MeV. The initial purpose of the present paper is to check whether\nthis proposal is compatible with experiment on semileptonic decays of Ks and Bs\nwhere the U can also appear. The answer to this we find is affirmative, in that\nthe contribution of U to new physics as calculated in the FSM remains within\nthe experimental bounds, but only if $m_U$ lies within a narrow range just\nbelow the unmixed mass. As a result from this, one has an estimate $m_U \\sim 15\n- 17$ MeV for the mass of $U$, and from some further considerations the\nestimate $\\Gamma_U \\sim 0.02$ eV for its width, both of which may be useful for\nan eventual search for it in experiment. And, if found, it will be, for the\nFSM, not just the discovery of a predicted new particle, but the opening of a\nwindow into a whole ``hidden sector\" containing at least some, perhaps ven the\nbulk, of the dark matter in the universe.",

Its main idea is to completely extinguish the effect of\nthe disturbances in the predictions within a small number of time steps, called\nthe deadbeat horizon. To this end, explicit deadbeat input sequences are\ncalculated for the vertices of the disturbance set. They generalize to a\nnonlinear disturbance feedback policy for all disturbances by means of a\nbarycentric function. Similar to previous approaches, this disturbance feedback\npolicy can be either part of the online optimization (Online DRMPC) or\npre-calculated during the design phase of the controller (Offline DRMPC). The\nmain advantage over all other RMPC approaches is that no Robust Positive\nInvariant (RPI) set has to be calculated, which is often intractable for\nsystems with higher dimensions. Nonetheless, for Online DRMPC and Offline DRMPC\nrecursive feasibility and input-to-state stability can be guaranteed. A small\nnumerical example compares the two versions of DRMPC and demonstrates that the\nperformance of DRMPC is competitive with other state-of-the-art RMPC\napproaches.

Over-parameterized ML models are further capable of zero-loss\ntraining and near-optimal generalization performance. An open research question\nis, how these novel paradigms contribute to solving tasks related to enhancing\nthe renewable energy transition and mitigating climate change. A collection of\nunified ML tasks and datasets from this domain can largely facilitate the\ndevelopment and empirical testing of such models, but is currently missing.\nHere, we introduce the ETT-17 (Energy Transition Tasks-17), a collection of 17\ndatasets from six different application domains related to enhancing renewable\nenergy, including out-of-distribution validation and testing data. We unify all\ntasks and datasets, such that they can be solved using a single multi-tasking\nML model. We further analyse the dimensions of each dataset; investigate what\nthey require for designing over-parameterized models; introduce a set of\ndataset scores that describe important properties of each task and dataset; and\nprovide performance benchmarks.",

Concept-Tuning minimizes the\nnegative impacts of rare features and spuriously correlated features by (1)\nmaximizing the mutual information between examples in the same category with\nregard to a slice of rare features (a patch) and (2) applying front-door\nadjustment via attention neural networks in channels and feature slices\n(patches).

In this paper, we\npresent a method to predict osteoporosis using hand and wrist X-ray images,\nwhich are both widely accessible and affordable, though their link to DXA-based\ndata is not thoroughly explored. Initially, our method segments the ulnar,\nradius, and metacarpal bones using a foundational model for image segmentation.\nThen, we use a self-supervised learning approach to extract meaningful\nrepresentations without the need for explicit labels, and move on to classify\nosteoporosis in a supervised manner. Our method is evaluated on a dataset with\n192 individuals, cross-referencing their verified osteoporosis conditions\nagainst the standard DXA test.

            "summary": "The distribution of fiber diameters plays a crucial role in the transport and\nsound absorbing properties of a three-dimensional random fibrous (3D-RF)\ncomposites. Conventionally, volume-weighted averaging of fiber diameters has\nbeen utilized as an appropriate microstructural descriptor to predict the\nstatic viscous permeability of 3D-RF composites. However, the long wavelength\nacoustical properties of a 3D-RF composites are also sensitive to the smallest\nfibers, this is particularly true in the high-frequency regime. In our recent\nresearch, we demonstrated that an inverse volume-weighted averaging of fiber\ndiameters can effectively serve as a complementary microstructural descriptor\nto capture the high-frequency behavior of polydisperse fibrous media. In the\npresent work, we review the identification of two representative volume\nelements (RVEs) which relies on the reconstruction of 3D-RF composites having\nvolume-weighted and inverse-volume weighted averaged fiber diameters,\nrespectively in the low-frequency and high frequency regimes. We examine the\nimplication of such a weighting procedure on the transport and sound absorbing\nproperties of polydisperse fibrous media, highlighting their potential\nadvantages. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges associated with this\nresearch field. Finally, we provide a brief perspective of the future\ndirections and opportunities for advancing this area of study, aiming to\novercome challenges and extend the benefits of employing polydispersity as a\nnew lever for the optimization of 3D-RF composites in sound-absorbing\nmaterials.",

However, little is known about the\ninfluence of laser beam shaping on the complex melt-pool behaviour, solidified\nmelt-track bead profile and microstructural grain morphology in laser material\nprocessing. A simulation-based approach is utilised in the present work to\nstudy the effects of laser beam intensity profile and angle of incidence on the\nmelt-pool behaviour in conduction-mode laser melting of stainless steel 316L\nplates. The present high-fidelity physics-based computational model accounts\nfor crucial physical phenomena in laser material processing such as complex\nlaser-matter interaction, solidification and melting, heat and fluid flow\ndynamics, and free-surface oscillations. Experiments were carried out using\ndifferent laser beam shapes and the validity of the numerical predictions is\ndemonstrated. The results indicate that for identical processing parameters,\nreshaping the laser beam leads to notable changes in the thermal and fluid flow\nfields in the melt pool, affecting the melt-track bead profile and\nsolidification microstructure. The columnar-to-equiaxed transition is discussed\nfor different laser-intensity profiles.",

Their performance can significantly deteriorate when\nusers' actual viewing patterns and QoE preferences differ considerably from\nthose observed during the training phase, resulting in poor generalization. In\nthis paper, we propose MANSY, a novel streaming system that embraces user\ndiversity to improve generalization. Specifically, to accommodate users'\ndiverse viewing patterns, we design a Transformer-based viewport prediction\nmodel with an efficient multi-viewport trajectory input output architecture\nbased on implicit ensemble learning. Besides, we for the first time combine the\nadvanced representation learning and deep reinforcement learning to train the\nbitrate selection model to maximize diverse QoE objectives, enabling the model\nto generalize across users with diverse preferences.

Such anomalous states,\nknown as quantum many-body scars in the literature, have generated a lot of\ninterest due to their athermal nature. Our starting Hamiltonian is $H =\n\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{kin}} + \\lambda \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{pot}}$, where\n$\\lambda$ is a real-valued coupling, and $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{kin}}$\n($\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{pot}}$) are summed local diagonal (off-diagonal)\noperators in the electric flux basis acting on the elementary plaquette\n$\\square$. The spectrum of the model in its spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ representation\non $L_x \\times L_y$ lattices reveal the existence of sublattice scars, $|\\psi_s\n\\rangle$, which satisfy $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{pot},\\square} |\\psi_s\\rangle =\n|\\psi_s\\rangle$ for all elementary plaquettes on one sublattice and $\n\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{pot},\\square} | \\psi_s \\rangle =0 $ on the other, while\nbeing simultaneous zero modes or nonzero integer-valued eigenstates of\n$\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{kin}}$. We demonstrate a ``triangle relation'' connecting\nthe sublattice scars with nonzero integer eigenvalues of $\n\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{kin}} $ to particular sublattice scars with\n$\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{kin}} = 0$ eigenvalues. A fraction of the sublattice\nscars have a simple description in terms of emergent short singlets, on which\nwe place analytic bounds. We further construct a long-ranged parent Hamiltonian\nfor which all sublattice scars in the null space of $\n\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{kin}} $ become unique ground states and elucidate some of\nthe properties of its spectrum. In particular, zero energy states of this\nparent Hamiltonian turn out to be exact scars of another $U(1)$ quantum link\nmodel with a staggered short-ranged diagonal term.",

            "summary": "Ensuring safety of nonlinear systems under model uncertainty and external\ndisturbances is crucial, especially for real-world control tasks. Predictive\nmethods such as robust model predictive control (RMPC) require solving\nnonconvex optimization problems online, which leads to high computational\nburden and poor scalability. Reinforcement learning (RL) works well with\ncomplex systems, but pays the price of losing rigorous safety guarantee. This\npaper presents a theoretical framework that bridges the advantages of both RMPC\nand RL to synthesize safety filters for nonlinear systems with state- and\naction-dependent uncertainty. We decompose the robust invariant set (RIS) into\ntwo parts: a target set that aligns with terminal region design of RMPC, and a\nreach-avoid set that accounts for the rest of RIS. We propose a policy\niteration approach for robust reach-avoid problems and establish its monotone\nconvergence. This method sets the stage for an adversarial actor-critic deep RL\nalgorithm, which simultaneously synthesizes a reach-avoid policy network, a\ndisturbance policy network, and a reach-avoid value network. The learned\nreach-avoid policy network is utilized to generate nominal trajectories for\nonline verification, which filters potentially unsafe actions that may drive\nthe system into unsafe regions when worst-case disturbances are applied. We\nformulate a second-order cone programming (SOCP) approach for online\nverification using system level synthesis, which optimizes for the worst-case\nreach-avoid value of any possible trajectories. The proposed safety filter\nrequires much lower computational complexity than RMPC and still enjoys\npersistent robust safety guarantee. The effectiveness of our method is\nillustrated through a numerical example.",

            "summary": "The best-worst method (BWM) is one of the widely used multi-criteria\ndecision-making (MCDM) methods in recent times. In BWM, the decision maker\nprovides his/her decisions in terms of pairwise comparisons between\ncriteria/alternatives and then the optimal weights are calculated using some\ndistance function. Among the various models of BWM, this article focuses on\nmultiplicative BWM, which is based on a distance function defined on an Abelian\nlinearly ordered group $(\\mathbb{R_+},\\cdot,\\leq)$. In this paper, we first\ndeveloped an equivalent model of the existing multiplicative BWM, which is\nbased on the optimal modification of pairwise comparison system (PCS). Like the\npresent model, this model is also a non-linear model and thus may lead to\nmultiple optimal solutions. To deal with this problem, we modified this\nequivalent model by introducing a secondary objective function to select the\nbest optimally modified PCS, which leads to a unique optimal weight set. We\nthen developed an analytical framework of this revised model to obtain optimal\nweights with respect to the comparison values. Due to this framework, no\noptimization model needs to be solved to calculate the optimal weights and\ntherefore no software is needed in the implementation of the proposed model.\nThis framework also provides a mathematical foundation for the calculation of\n$\\epsilon_{\\max}$, which is required to measure the accuracy of optimal\nweights. Finally, we illustrate the proposed model with the help of numerical\nexamples.",

            "summary": "We delved into the assembly pathways and environments of compact groups (CGs)\nof galaxies using mock catalogues generated from semi-analytical models (SAMs)\non the Millennium simulation. We investigate the ability of SAMs to replicate\nthe observed CG environments and whether CGs with different assembly histories\ntend to inhabit specific cosmic environments. We also analyse whether the\nenvironment or the assembly history is more important in tailoring CG\nproperties. We find that about half of the CGs in SAMs are non-embedded\nsystems, 40% are inhabiting loose groups or nodes of filaments, while the rest\ndistribute evenly in filaments and voids, in agreement with observations. We\nobserve that early-assembled CGs preferentially inhabit large galaxy systems (~\n60%), while around 30% remain non-embedded. Conversely, lately-formed CGs\nexhibit the opposite trend. We also obtain that lately-formed CGs have lower\nvelocity dispersions and larger crossing times than early-formed CGs, but\nmainly because they are preferentially non-embedded. Those lately-formed CGs\nthat inhabit large systems do not show the same features. Therefore, the\nenvironment plays a strong role in these properties for lately-formed CGs.\nEarly-formed CGs are more evolved, displaying larger velocity dispersions,\nshorter crossing times, and more dominant first-ranked galaxies, regardless of\nthe environment. Finally, the difference in brightness between the two\nbrightest members of CGs is dependent only on the assembly history and not on\nthe environment. CGs residing in diverse environments have undergone varied\nassembly processes, making them suitable for studying their evolution and the\ninterplay of nature and nurture on their traits.",

Several\nfamily members, such as APO-BEC3G, APOBEC3F, and APOBEC3H haplotype II, exhibit\nactivity against viruses such as HIV. These enzymes induce C-to-U mutations in\nthe negative strand of viral genomes, resulting in multiple G-to-A changes,\ncommonly referred to as 'hypermutation.' Mutations catalyzed by these enzymes\nare sequence context-dependent in the HIV genome; for instance, APOBEC3G\npreferen-tially mutates G within GG, TGG, and TGGG contexts, while other\nmembers mutate G within GA, TGA, and TGAA contexts. However, the same sequence\ncontext has not been explored in relation to these enzymes and HBV. In this\nstudy, our objective is to identify the mutational footprint of APOBEC3 enzymes\nin the HBV genome. To achieve this, we employ a multivariable data analytics\ntechnique to investigate motif preferences and potential sequence hierarchies\nof mutation by APOBEC3 enzymes using full genome HBV sequences from a diverse\nrange of naturally infected patients. This approach allows us to distinguish\nbetween normal and hypermutated sequences based on the representation of mono-\nto tetra-nucleotide motifs. Additionally, we aim to identify motifs associated\nwith hypermutation induced by different APOBEC3 enzymes in HBV genomes. Our\nanalyses reveal that either APOBEC3 enzymes are not active against HBV, or the\ninduction of G-to-A mutations by these enzymes is not sequence\ncontext-dependent in the HBV genome.",

Consequently, these predictive\nmethods are burdened by substantial computational demands and prolonged\ncomputing time requirements. The principal challenge stems from the necessity\nimposed on the PSI-BLAST software to load large sequence databases sequentially\nin batches and then search for sequence alignments akin to a given query\nsequence. In the case of batch queries, the runtime scales even linearly. The\npredicament at hand is becoming more challenging as the size of bio-sequence\ndata repositories experiences exponential growth over time and as a\nconsequence, this upward trend exerts a proportional strain on the runtime of\nPSI-BLAST. To address this issue, an eminent resolution lies in leveraging the\nMMseqs2 method, capable of expediting the search process by a magnitude of 100.\nHowever, MMseqs2 cannot be directly employed to generate the final output in\nthe desired format of PSI-BLAST alignments and PSSM profiles. In this research\nwork, I developed a comprehensive pipeline that synergistically integrates both\nMMseqs2 and PSI-BLAST, resulting in the creation of a robust, optimized, and\nhighly efficient hybrid alignment pipeline. Notably, the hybrid tool exhibits a\nsignificant speed improvement, surpassing the runtime performance of PSI-BLAST\nin generating sequence alignment profiles by a factor of two orders of\nmagnitude.

ESIT is an interdisciplinary scientific discipline, which amalgamates\nelectromagnetic theory, signal processing theory, and information theory. ESIT\nis aimed at studying and designing physically consistent communication schemes\nfor the transmission and processing of information in communication networks.\nIn simple terms, ESIT can be defined as physics-aware information theory and\nsignal processing for communications. We consider three relevant problems in\ncontemporary communication theory, and we show how they can be tackled under\nthe lenses of ESIT. Specifically, we focus on (i) the theoretical and practical\nmotivations behind antenna designs based on sub-wavelength radiating elements\nand interdistances; (ii) the modeling and role played by the electromagnetic\nmutual coupling, and the appropriateness of multiport network theory for\nmodeling it; and (iii) the analytical tools for unveiling the performance\nlimits and realizing spatial multiplexing in near field, line-of-sight,\nchannels. To exemplify the role played by ESIT and the need for electromagnetic\nconsistency, we consider case studies related to reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces and holographic surfaces, and we highlight the inconsistencies of\nwidely utilized communication models, as opposed to communication models that\noriginate from first electromagnetic principles.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we address the detection of co-occurring salient objects\n(CoSOD) in an image group using frequency statistics in an unsupervised manner,\nwhich further enable us to develop a semi-supervised method. While previous\nworks have mostly focused on fully supervised CoSOD, less attention has been\nallocated to detecting co-salient objects when limited segmentation annotations\nare available for training. Our simple yet effective unsupervised method\nUS-CoSOD combines the object co-occurrence frequency statistics of unsupervised\nsingle-image semantic segmentations with salient foreground detections using\nself-supervised feature learning. For the first time, we show that a large\nunlabeled dataset e.g. ImageNet-1k can be effectively leveraged to\nsignificantly improve unsupervised CoSOD performance. Our unsupervised model is\na great pre-training initialization for our semi-supervised model SS-CoSOD,\nespecially when very limited labeled data is available for training. To avoid\npropagating erroneous signals from predictions on unlabeled data, we propose a\nconfidence estimation module to guide our semi-supervised training. Extensive\nexperiments on three CoSOD benchmark datasets show that both of our\nunsupervised and semi-supervised models outperform the corresponding\nstate-of-the-art models by a significant margin (e.g., on the Cosal2015\ndataset, our US-CoSOD model has an 8.8% F-measure gain over a SOTA unsupervised\nco-segmentation model and our SS-CoSOD model has an 11.81% F-measure gain over\na SOTA semi-supervised CoSOD model).",

There are four\npossible distributions for the jumps of these processes, depending on the\nlocation of the starting point: in the interior, on the two positive axes of\nthe boundary, and at the origin $(0,0)$.\n  With mild conditions on the positive jumps of the random walk, which can be\nunbounded, a complete analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the Green function\nof the random walk killed at $(0,0)$ is achieved. The main result is that {\\em\neight} regions of the set of parameters determine completely the possible\nlimiting behaviors of Green functions of these Markov chains. These regions are\ndefined by a set of relations for several characteristics of the distributions\nof the jumps.\n  In the transient case, a description of the Martin boundary is obtained and\nin the positive recurrent case, our results give the exact limiting behavior of\nthe invariant distribution of a state whose norm goes to infinity along some\nasymptotic direction in the quadrant. These limit theorems extend results of\nthe literature obtained, up to now, essentially for random walks whose jump\nsizes are either $0$ or $1$ on each coordinate.\n  Our approach relies on a combination of several methods: probabilistic\nrepresentations of solutions of analytical equations, Lyapounov functions,\nconvex analysis, methods of homogeneous random walks, and complex analysis\narguments.",

            "summary": "The lateral density data obtained for different secondaries of an extensive\nair shower (EAS) from an array of detectors are usually described by some\nsuitable lateral density functions (LDFs). Analyzing non-vertical simulated\nEASs generated with the CORSIKA code, it is found that the lateral and polar\ndensity distributions of electrons and muons are asymmetric in the ground\nplane. It means that typical expressions for symmetric lateral density\nfunctions (SLDFs) (\\emph{e.g.} the Nishimura-Kamata-Greisen function) are\ninadequate to reconstruct the lateral and polar dependencies of such asymmetric\nelectron or muon densities accurately. In order to provide a more consistent\nLDF for non-vertical shower reconstruction in the ground plane, the paper\nconsiders the issue of the modification of the SLDF analytically. The asymmetry\narising from additional attenuation and correction of the positional\ncoordinates (radial and polar) of cascade particles causes a gap length between\nthe center of concentric equidensity ellipses and the EAS core. A toy function\nis introduced as a basic LDF to describe the asymmetric lateral and polar\ndensity distributions of electrons or muons of EASs, thereby predicting the gap\nlength parameter. Consequently, the desired LDF describing the asymmetric\ndensity distributions of electrons and muons of EASs has emerged. We compare\nresults from detailed simulations with the predictions of the analytical\nparametrization. The LDF derived in this work is found to be well-suited to\nreconstruct EASs in the ground plane directly.",

In\nthis approach, delay plays the role analogous to reaction time so that a given\nparticle is influenced by the information about the velocity and the position\nof the other particles in its vicinity with some time delay. To get insight\ninto the involved complex flows and the transitions between them we use a\nsimple model allowing, by fine-tuning of its few parameters, the observation\nand analysis of behaviours that are less accessible by experiments or analytic\ncalculations and at the same time make the reproduction of experimental results\npossible. We report for the first time about a transition from an ordered,\npolarized collective motion to disorder as a function of the increasing time\ndelay. For a fixed intermediate value of the delay similar transition (from\norder to disorder) is obtained as the repulsion radius is increased. Our\nsimulations show a transition from total polarization to two kinds of states:\nfully disordered and a kind of state which is a mixture of patches of fully\ndisordered motion in the background of orderly moving other particles. The\ntransition occurs as the delay time is increased and is sharp, indicating that\nthe nature of this order-disorder transition is either of first-order or is\ndescribed by a sharply decreasing linear function. Our model is a simplified\nversion of a practical situation of quickly growing interest because time\ndelays are expected to play an increasingly important role when the traffic of\nmany, densely distributed autonomous drones will move around in a\nquasi-two-dimensional air space.",

            "summary": "There have been significant developments in the period estimation tools and\nmethods for analysing high energy pulsars in the past few decades. However,\nthese tools lack well-standardised methods for calculating uncertainties in\nperiod estimation and other recovered parameters for Poisson--dominated data.\nError estimation is important for assigning confidence intervals to the models\nwe study, but due to their high computational cost, errors in the pulsar\nperiods were largely ignored in the past. Furthermore, existing literature has\noften employed semi-analytical techniques that lack rigorous mathematical\nfoundations or exhibit a predominant emphasis on the analysis of white noise\nand time series data. We present results from our numerical and analytical\nstudy of the error distribution of the recovered parameters of high energy\npulsar data using the $Z_n^2$ method. We comprehensively formalise the measure\nof error for the generic pulsar period with much higher reliability than some\ncommon methods. Our error estimation method becomes more reliable and robust\nwhen observing pulsars for few kilo-seconds, especially for typical pulsars\nwith periods ranging from a few milliseconds to a few seconds. We have verified\nour results with observations of the \\emph{Crab} pulsar, as well as a large set\nof simulated pulsars. Our codes are publicly available for use.",

            "summary": "A fundamental question of cell biology is how cells control the number of\norganelles. The processes of organelle biogenesis, namely de novo synthesis,\nfission, fusion, and decay, are inherently stochastic, producing cell-to-cell\nvariability in organelle abundance. In addition, experiments suggest that the\nsynthesis of some organelles can be bursty. We thus ask how bursty synthesis\nimpacts intracellular organelle number distribution. We develop an organelle\nbiogenesis model with bursty de novo synthesis by considering geometrically\ndistributed burst sizes. We analytically solve the model in biologically\nrelevant limits and provide exact expressions for the steady-state organelle\nnumber distributions and their means and variances. We also present approximate\nsolutions for the whole model, complementing with exact stochastic simulations.\nWe show that bursts generally increase the noise in organelle numbers,\nproducing distinct signatures in noise profiles depending on different\nmechanisms of organelle biogenesis. We also find different shapes of organelle\nnumber distributions, including bimodal distributions in some parameter\nregimes. Notably, bursty synthesis broadens the parameter regime of observing\nbimodality compared to the `non-bursty' case. Together, our framework utilizes\nnumber fluctuations to elucidate the role of bursty synthesis in producing\norganelle number heterogeneity in cells.",

In recent years, the application of artificial\nintelligence (AI) techniques, particularly deep learning (DL), has gained\nconsiderable popularity for evaluating the various aspects of CVDs. Moreover,\nusing fundus images and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to\ndiagnose retinal diseases has been extensively studied. To better understand\nheart function and anticipate changes based on microvascular characteristics\nand function, researchers are currently exploring the integration of AI with\nnon-invasive retinal scanning. Leveraging AI-assisted early detection and\nprediction of cardiovascular diseases on a large scale holds excellent\npotential to mitigate cardiovascular events and alleviate the economic burden\non healthcare systems. Method: A comprehensive search was conducted across\nvarious databases, including PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of\nSciences, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, using specific keywords related\nto cardiovascular diseases and artificial intelligence.

In\nthis paper, we propose a new approach named Graph ODE with factorized\nprototypes (GOAT) to address the problem. The core of GOAT is to incorporate\nfactorized prototypes from contextual knowledge into a continuous graph ODE\nframework. Specifically, GOAT employs representation disentanglement and system\nparameters to extract both object-level and system-level contexts from\nhistorical trajectories, which allows us to explicitly model their independent\ninfluence and thus enhances the generalization capability under system changes.\nThen, we integrate these disentangled latent representations into a graph ODE\nmodel, which determines a combination of various interacting prototypes for\nenhanced model expressivity. The entire model is optimized using an end-to-end\nvariational inference framework to maximize the likelihood. Extensive\nexperiments in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings validate\nthe superiority of GOAT.",

However, the\nmajority of these studies did not integrate information from all three\nmodalities or utilize the spatiotemporal relationships present in the dataset.\nThis study introduces a novel model called the Multimodal Spatiotemporal\nGraph-Transformer (MuST) for predicting hospital readmissions. By employing\nGraph Convolution Networks and temporal transformers, we can effectively\ncapture spatial and temporal dependencies in EHR and chest radiographs. We then\npropose a fusion transformer to combine the spatiotemporal features from the\ntwo modalities mentioned above with the features from clinical notes extracted\nby a pre-trained, domain-specific transformer. We assess the effectiveness of\nour methods using the latest publicly available dataset, MIMIC-IV.

Increased grey seal harvests have been suggested to improve\ncod survival, however, predicting the response of cod to seal abundance changes\nin the sGSL is complicated by a hypothesized triangular food web involving\nseals, cod, and small pelagic fishes, wherein the pelagic fishes are prey for\ncod and grey seals, but may also prey on young cod. Grey seals may therefore\nhave an indirect positive effect on prerecruit cod survival via predation on\npelagic fish. Using a multispecies model of intermediate complexity fitted to\nvarious scientific and fisheries data, we found that seal predation accounted\nfor the majority of recent cod mortality and that cod will likely be extirpated\nwithout a strong and rapid reduction in grey seal abundance. We did not find\nevidence that reducing grey seal abundance will result in large increases to\nherring biomass that could impair cod recovery.",

Stable degrees of freedom\nbehave locally in the reduced dimensional phase space exactly as an analogous\nintegrable system would. Classification of the unstable degrees of freedom is\ndependent upon the degree of chaos present in the dynamics. The techniques for\nderiving the requisite canonical coordinate transformations are developed and\nshown to block diagonalize the stability matrix into irreducible parts. In\ndoing so, it is demonstrated how to reduce the amount of sampling directions\nnecessary in a Monte Carlo simulation.

            "summary": "The double pulsar system, PSR J0737$-$3039A/B, consists of two neutron stars\nbound together in a highly relativistic orbit that is viewed nearly edge-on\nfrom the Earth. This alignment results in brief radio eclipses of the\nfast-rotating pulsar A when it passes behind the toroidal magnetosphere of the\nslow-rotating pulsar B. The morphology of these eclipses is strongly dependent\non the geometric orientation and rotation phase of pulsar B, and their\ntime-evolution can be used to constrain the geodetic precession rate of the\npulsar. We demonstrate a Bayesian inference framework for modelling eclipse\nlight-curves obtained with MeerKAT between 2019-2023. Using a hierarchical\ninference approach, we obtained a precession rate of $\\Omega_{\\rm SO}^{\\rm B} =\n{5.16^{\\circ}}^{+0.32^{\\circ}}_{-0.34^{\\circ}}$ yr$^{-1}$ for pulsar B,\nconsistent with predictions from General Relativity to a relative uncertainty\nof 6.5%. This updated measurement provides a 6.1% test of relativistic\nspin-orbit coupling in the strong-field regime. We show that a simultaneous fit\nto all of our observed eclipses can in principle return a $\\sim$1.5% test of\nspin-orbit coupling. However, systematic effects introduced by the current\ngeometric orientation of pulsar B along with inconsistencies between the\nobserved and predicted eclipse light curves result in difficult to quantify\nuncertainties. Assuming the validity of General Relativity, we definitively\nshow that the spin-axis of pulsar B is misaligned from the total angular\nmomentum vector by $40.6^{\\circ} \\pm 0.1^{\\circ}$ and that the orbit of the\nsystem is inclined by approximately $90.5^{\\circ}$ from the direction of our\nline of sight. Our measured geometry for pulsar B suggests the largely empty\nemission cone contains an elongated horseshoe shaped beam centered on the\nmagnetic axis, and that it may not be re-detected as a radio pulsar until\nearly-2035.",

            "summary": "Control of a dynamical system without the knowledge of dynamics is an\nimportant and challenging task. Modern machine learning approaches, such as\ndeep neural networks (DNNs), allow for the estimation of a dynamics model from\ncontrol inputs and corresponding state observation outputs. Such data-driven\nmodels are often utilized for the derivation of model-based controllers.\nHowever, in general, there are no guarantees that a model represented by DNNs\nwill be controllable according to the formal control-theoretical meaning of\ncontrollability, which is crucial for the design of effective controllers. This\noften precludes the use of DNN-estimated models in applications, where formal\ncontrollability guarantees are required. In this proof-of-the-concept work, we\npropose a control-theoretical method that explicitly enhances models estimated\nfrom data with controllability. That is achieved by augmenting the model\nestimation objective with a controllability constraint, which penalizes models\nwith a low degree of controllability. As a result, the models estimated with\nthe proposed controllability constraint allow for the derivation of more\nefficient controllers, they are interpretable by the control-theoretical\nquantities and have a lower long-term prediction error. The proposed method\nprovides new insights on the connection between the DNN-based estimation of\nunknown dynamics and the control-theoretical guarantees of the solution\nproperties. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in two\nstandard classical control systems with state observation given by low\nresolution high-dimensional images.",

For that, a controller decides whether to pull\nan update at each slot, predicting what is probably occurring at the source and\nhow much effective impact that update could have at the endpoint. Thus,\ntemporal changes in the source evolution could modify the query arrivals so as\nto capture important updates. The amount of impact is determined by a grade of\neffectiveness (GoE) metric, which incorporates both freshness and usefulness\nattributes of the communicated updates. Applying an iterative algorithm, we\nderive query decisions that maximize the long-term average GoE for the\ncommunicated packets, subject to cost constraints.

The\nanalysis of high-resource languages is of interest as studies have shown that\nlow-resource languages perform worse than English in NLP tasks, but no study so\nfar has analysed whether high-resource languages perform as well as English.\nThe analysis of ChatGPT's confidence calibration has not been carried out\nbefore either and is critical to learn about ChatGPT's trustworthiness. In\norder to study these two aspects, five high-resource languages and two NLP\ntasks were chosen. ChatGPT was asked to perform both tasks in the five\nlanguages and to give a numerical confidence value for each answer. The results\nshow that all the selected high-resource languages perform similarly and that\nChatGPT does not have a good confidence calibration, often being overconfident\nand never giving low confidence values.",

A subject of ongoing debate, the capacity\nmarket is viewed by its proponents as a crucial mechanism to ensure system\nreliability, while critics highlight its drawbacks such as market distortion.\nUnder a novel analytical framework, we rigorously evaluate the impact of the\ncapacity market on generators' revenue and system reliability. More\nspecifically, based on market designs at New York Independent System Operator\n(NYISO), we propose market equilibrium-based models to capture salient aspects\nof the capacity market and its interaction with the energy market. We also\ndevelop a leader-follower model to study market power. We show that the\ncapacity market incentivizes the investment of generators with lower net cost\nof new entry. It also facilitates reliability by preventing significant\nphysical withholding when the demand is relatively high. Nevertheless, the\ncapacity market may not provide enough revenue for peaking plants. Moreover, it\nis susceptible to market power, which necessitates tailored market power\nmitigation measures depending on market dynamics.

This promises both a closed-loop- and constraint satisfaction\nperformance equivalent to common Robustified NMPC approaches, while drastically\nreducing the computational complexity. The main idea lies in approximating the\nellipsoidal uncertainty sets propagation over the prediction horizon with the\nsystem dynamics' sensitivities inferred from the last optimal control problem\n(OCP) solution, and similarly for the gradients to robustify the constraints.\nThus, we do not require the decision variables related to the uncertainty\npropagation within the OCP, rendering it computationally tractable. Next, we\nillustrate the real-time control capabilities of our algorithm in handling a\ncomplex, high-dimensional, and highly nonlinear system, namely the trajectory\nfollowing of an autonomous passenger vehicle modeled with a dynamic nonlinear\nsingle-track model. Our experimental findings, alongside a comparative\nassessment against other Robust NMPC approaches, affirm the robustness of our\nmethod in effectively tracking an optimal racetrack trajectory while satisfying\nthe nonlinear constraints. This performance is achieved while fully utilizing\nthe vehicle's interface limits, even at high speeds of up to 37.5m/s, and\nsuccessfully managing state estimation disturbances.

Recent\nstudies show that this will be difficult to do with just one learning model.\nThe problem can be more complex for companies of construction section, due to\nthe dependency of their behavior on more conditions. This study aims to provide\na hybrid model for improving the accuracy of prediction for stock price index\nof companies in construction section. The contribution of this paper can be\nconsidered as follows: First, a combination of several prediction models is\nused to predict stock price, so that learning models can cover each other's\nerror. In this research, an ensemble model based on Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Classification and Regression Tree\n(CART) is presented for predicting stock price index. Second, the optimization\ntechnique is used to determine the effect of each learning model on the\nprediction result. For this purpose, first all three mentioned algorithms\nprocess the data simultaneously and perform the prediction operation. Then,\nusing the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm, the output weight of each algorithm is\ndetermined as a coefficient. Finally, using the ensemble technique, these\nresults are combined and the final output is generated through weighted\naveraging on optimal coefficients. The results showed that using CS\noptimization in the proposed ensemble system is highly effective in reducing\nprediction error. Comparing the evaluation results of the proposed system with\nsimilar algorithms, indicates that our model is more accurate and can be useful\nfor predicting stock price index in real-world scenarios.",

            "summary": "In this study we argue that integrating ChatGPT into the data processing\npipeline of automated sensors in precision agriculture has the potential to\nbring several benefits and enhance various aspects of modern farming practices.\nPolicy makers often face a barrier when they need to get informed about the\nsituation in vast agricultural fields to reach to decisions. They depend on the\nclose collaboration between agricultural experts in the field, data analysts,\nand technology providers to create interdisciplinary teams that cannot always\nbe secured on demand or establish effective communication across these diverse\ndomains to respond in real-time. In this work we argue that the speech\nrecognition input modality of ChatGPT provides a more intuitive and natural way\nfor policy makers to interact with the database of the server of an\nagricultural data processing system to which a large, dispersed network of\nautomated insect traps and sensors probes reports. The large language models\nmap the speech input to text, allowing the user to form its own version of\nunconstrained verbal query, raising the barrier of having to learn and adapt\noneself to a specific data analytics software. The output of the language model\ncan interact through Python code and Pandas with the entire database, visualize\nthe results and use speech synthesis to engage the user in an iterative and\nrefining discussion related to the data. We show three ways of how ChatGPT can\ninteract with the database of the remote server to which a dispersed network of\ndifferent modalities (optical counters, vibration recordings, pictures, and\nvideo), report. We examine the potential and the validity of the response of\nChatGPT in analyzing, and interpreting agricultural data, providing real time\ninsights and recommendations to stakeholders",

            "summary": "Nature has always been our inspiration in the research, design and\ndevelopment of materials and has driven us to gain a deep understanding of the\nmechanisms that characterize anisotropy and inelastic behavior. All this\nknowledge has been accumulated in the principles of thermodynamics. Deduced\nfrom these principles, the multiplicative decomposition combined with pseudo\npotentials are powerful and universal concepts. Simultaneously, the tremendous\nincrease in computational performance enabled us to investigate and rethink our\nhistory-dependent material models to make the most of our predictions. Today,\nwe have reached a point where materials and their models are becoming\nincreasingly sophisticated. This raises the question: How do we find the best\nmodel that includes all inelastic effects to explain our complex data?\nConstitutive Artificial Neural Networks (CANN) may answer this question. Here,\nwe extend the CANNs to inelastic materials (iCANN). Rigorous considerations of\nobjectivity, rigid motion of the reference configuration, multiplicative\ndecomposition and its inherent non-uniqueness, restrictions of energy and\npseudo potential, and consistent evolution guide us towards the architecture of\nthe iCANN satisfying thermodynamics per design. We combine feed-forward\nnetworks of the free energy and pseudo potential with a recurrent neural\nnetwork approach to take time dependencies into account. We demonstrate that\nthe iCANN is capable of autonomously discovering models for artificially\ngenerated data, the response of polymers for cyclic loading and the relaxation\nbehavior of muscle data. As the design of the network is not limited to\nvisco-elasticity, our vision is that the iCANN will reveal to us new ways to\nfind the various inelastic phenomena hidden in the data and to understand their\ninteraction.

This study addresses this gap, focusing on\nthe emulation of corpora using the suite of GPT-Neo large language models. To\nconduct our investigation, we emulated corpora of PubMed abstracts using three\ndifferent parameter sizes of the GPT-Neo model. Our emulation strategy involved\nusing the initial five words of each PubMed abstract as a prompt and\ninstructing the model to expand the content up to the original abstract's\nlength. Our findings indicate that the generated corpora adhere to Heaps' law.\nInterestingly, as the GPT-Neo model size grows, its generated vocabulary\nincreasingly adheres to Heaps' law as as observed in human-authored text.

We consider 6 morphological classes -- point-like, uniform\ncircular disc, crescent, dual disc, crescent with elliptical accretion disc,\nand crescent with double jet lobes -- described by phenomenological parameters.\nUsing simple logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional\nneural network, and random forest models on closure invariants obtained from a\nsparse aperture coverage, we find that all models except logistic regression\nare able to classify the morphology with an $F_1$ score $\\gtrsim 0.8$. The\nclassification accuracy notably improves with greater aperture coverage. We\nalso estimate morphological parameters of uniform circular disc, crescent, and\ndual disc using simple MLP models, and perform a parametric image\nreconstruction.

            "summary": "The thermal freeze-out mechanism in its classical form is tightly connected\nto physics beyond the Standard Model around the electroweak scale, which has\nbeen the target of enormous experimental efforts. In this work we study a dark\nmatter model in which freeze-out is triggered by a strong first-order phase\ntransition in a dark sector, and show that this phase transition must also\nhappen close to the electroweak scale, i.e. in the temperature range relevant\nfor gravitational wave searches with the LISA mission. Specifically, we\nconsider the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)^\\prime$ gauge symmetry through the\nvacuum expectation value of a scalar field, which generates the mass of a\nfermionic dark matter candidate that subsequently annihilates into dark Higgs\nand gauge bosons. In this set-up the peak frequency of the gravitational wave\nbackground is tightly correlated with the dark matter relic abundance, and\nimposing the observed value for the latter implies that the former must lie in\nthe milli-Hertz range. A peculiar feature of our set-up is that the dark sector\nis not necessarily in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model during the\nphase transition, and hence the temperatures of the two sectors evolve\nindependently. Nevertheless, the requirement that the universe does not enter\nan extended period of matter domination after the phase transition, which would\nstrongly dilute any gravitational wave signal, places a lower bound on the\nportal coupling that governs the entropy transfer between the two sectors. As a\nresult, the predictions for the peak frequency of gravitational waves in the\nLISA band are robust, while the amplitude can change depending on the initial\ndark sector temperature.",

The MTH is the simplest Neutral Naturalness solution\nto the little hierarchy problem and predicts the existence of a twin dark\nsector related to the Standard Model (SM) by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is\nonly softly broken by a higher twin Higgs vacuum expectation value. The\nasymmetric reheating cools the twin sector compared to the visible one, thus\nevading cosmological bounds on $\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The addition of\n(twin-)colored scalars allows for the generation of the visible baryon\nasymmetry and, by the virtue of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, also results in\nthe generation of a twin baryon asymmetry. We identify a unique scenario with\ntop-philic couplings for the new scalars that can satisfy all cosmological,\nproton decay and LHC constraints; yield the observed SM baryon asymmetry; and\ngenerate a wide range of possible twin baryon DM fractions, from negligible to\nunity. The viable regime of the theory contains several hints as to the\npossible structure of the Twin Higgs UV completion.

In this study we examine the gas\nthermodynamics, kinematics, and the effects of SMBH feedback on the core of\nPerseus-like galaxy clusters with a new simulation suite: TNG-Cluster. We first\nmake a selection of simulated clusters similar to Perseus based on total mass\nand inner ICM properties, i.e. cool-core nature. We identify 30 Perseus-like\nsystems among the 352 TNG-Cluster halos at $z=0$. Many exhibit thermodynamical\nprofiles and X-ray morphologies with disturbed features such as ripples,\nbubbles and shock fronts that are qualitatively similar to X-ray observations\nof Perseus. To study observable gas motions, we generate XRISM mock X-ray\nobservations and conduct a spectral analysis of the synthetic data. In\nagreement with existing Hitomi measurements, TNG-Cluster predicts subsonic gas\nturbulence in the central regions of Perseus-like clusters, with a typical\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion of 200 km/s. This implies that turbulent\npressure contributes $< 10\\%$ to the dominant thermal pressure. In TNG-Cluster,\nsuch low (inferred) values of ICM velocity dispersion coexist with\nhigh-velocity outflows and bulk motions of relatively small amounts of\nsuper-virial hot gas, moving up to thousands of km/s. However, detecting these\noutflows observationally may prove challenging due to their anisotropic nature\nand projection effects. Driven by SMBH feedback, such outflows are responsible\nfor many morphological disturbances in the X-ray maps of cluster cores. They\nalso increase both the inferred, and intrinsic, ICM velocity dispersion. This\neffect is somewhat stronger when velocity dispersion is measured from\nhigher-energy lines.",

This leads to a natural adaptive\ngeneralization of the path integrated gradients (PIG) method for feature\nattribution, which we call Greedy PIG. We demonstrate the success of Greedy PIG\non a wide variety of tasks, including image feature attribution, graph\ncompression/explanation, and post-hoc feature selection on tabular data. Our\nresults show that introducing adaptivity is a powerful and versatile method for\nmaking attribution methods more powerful.",

            "summary": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has shown great importance in\nnumerous industries. Current state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN)-based\nforecasting methods usually require both graph networks (e.g., GCN) and\ntemporal networks (e.g., LSTM) to capture inter-series (spatial) dynamics and\nintra-series (temporal) dependencies, respectively. However, the uncertain\ncompatibility of the two networks puts an extra burden on handcrafted model\ndesigns. Moreover, the separate spatial and temporal modeling naturally\nviolates the unified spatiotemporal inter-dependencies in real world, which\nlargely hinders the forecasting performance. To overcome these problems, we\nexplore an interesting direction of directly applying graph networks and\nrethink MTS forecasting from a pure graph perspective. We first define a novel\ndata structure, hypervariate graph, which regards each series value (regardless\nof variates or timestamps) as a graph node, and represents sliding windows as\nspace-time fully-connected graphs. This perspective considers spatiotemporal\ndynamics unitedly and reformulates classic MTS forecasting into the predictions\non hypervariate graphs. Then, we propose a novel architecture Fourier Graph\nNeural Network (FourierGNN) by stacking our proposed Fourier Graph Operator\n(FGO) to perform matrix multiplications in Fourier space. FourierGNN\naccommodates adequate expressiveness and achieves much lower complexity, which\ncan effectively and efficiently accomplish the forecasting. Besides, our\ntheoretical analysis reveals FGO's equivalence to graph convolutions in the\ntime domain, which further verifies the validity of FourierGNN. Extensive\nexperiments on seven datasets have demonstrated our superior performance with\nhigher efficiency and fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

            "summary": "This thesis presents a formalization of martingales in arbitrary Banach\nspaces using Isabelle/HOL. We begin by examining formalizations in prominent\nproof repositories and extend the definition of the conditional expectation\noperator from the real numbers to general Banach spaces. The current\nformalization of conditional expectation in the Isabelle library is limited to\nreal-valued functions. To overcome this limitation, we use measure theoretic\narguments to construct the conditional expectation in Banach spaces using\nsuitable limits of simple functions. Subsequently, we define stochastic\nprocesses and introduce the concepts of adapted, progressively measurable and\npredictable processes using suitable locale definitions. We show the relation\n$$\\text{adapted} \\supseteq \\text{progressive} \\supseteq \\text{predictable}$$\nFurthermore, we show that progressive measurability and adaptedness are\nequivalent when the indexing set is discrete. We pay special attention to\npredictable processes in discrete-time, showing that $(X_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$\nis predictable if and only if $(X_{n + 1})_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is adapted.\n  We rigorously define martingales, submartingales, and supermartingales,\npresenting their first consequences and corollaries. Discrete-time martingales\nare given special attention in the formalization. In every step of our\nformalization, we make extensive use of the powerful locale system of Isabelle.\n  The formalization further contributes by generalizing concepts in Bochner\nintegration by extending their application from the real numbers to arbitrary\nBanach spaces equipped with a second-countable topology. Induction schemes for\nintegrable simple functions on Banach spaces are introduced. Additionally, we\nformalize a powerful result called the \"Averaging Theorem\" which allows us to\nshow that densities are unique in Banach spaces.",

The\nmain contribution of MRM is that it checks each tokens with each term based on\nindexing of linguistic categories such as synonym, antonym, formal, lexical\nword order and co-occurrence.

The aim is to aid medical practitioners\ndiagnose and treat the many ailments affecting the heart. Towards this,\nmodelling cardiac electrophysiology is crucial as the heart's electrical\nactivity underlies the contraction mechanism and the resulting pumping action.\nThe governing equations and the constitutive laws describing the electrical\nactivity in the heart are coupled, nonlinear, and involve a fast moving wave\nfront, which is generally solved by the finite element method. The simulation\nof this complex system as part of a virtual heart model is challenging due to\nthe necessity of fine spatial and temporal resolution of the domain. Therefore,\nefficient surrogate models are needed to predict the dynamics under varying\nparameters and inputs. In this work, we develop an adaptive, projection-based\nsurrogate model for cardiac electrophysiology. We introduce an a posteriori\nerror estimator that can accurately and efficiently quantify the accuracy of\nthe surrogate model. Using the error estimator, we systematically update our\nsurrogate model through a greedy search of the parameter space. Furthermore,\nusing the error estimator, the parameter search space is dynamically updated\nsuch that the most relevant samples get chosen at every iteration.

The error norm and the\nproof of improvement are transferred from the original statistical concept to a\ndeterministic one, using sufficient information on physics-based conditions.\nThe proposed strategy is applied to material modeling and illustrated by\nexamples of the identification of a yield function, elasto-plastic steel\nsimulations, the identification of driving forces for quasi-brittle damage and\nrubber experiments. Sufficient physical information is employed, e.g., in the\nform of invariants, parameters of a minimization problem, dimensional analysis,\nisotropy and differentiability. It is proven how intuitive accretion of\ninformation can yield improvement if it is physically sufficient, but also how\ninsufficient or superfluous information can cause impairment. Opportunities for\nthe improvement of artificial neural networks are explored in terms of the\ntraining data set, the networks' structure and output filters.

To\ncircumvent the potential imperfections of these approaches, a quantification of\nthe prediction confidence is crucial to guide decision-making systems that rely\non depth estimation. In this paper, we propose MonoProb, a new unsupervised\nmonocular depth estimation method that returns an interpretable uncertainty,\nwhich means that the uncertainty reflects the expected error of the network in\nits depth predictions. We rethink the stereo or the structure-from-motion\nparadigms used to train unsupervised monocular depth models as a probabilistic\nproblem. Within a single forward pass inference, this model provides a depth\nprediction and a measure of its confidence, without increasing the inference\ntime. We then improve the performance on depth and uncertainty with a novel\nself-distillation loss for which a student is supervised by a pseudo ground\ntruth that is a probability distribution on depth output by a teacher. To\nquantify the performance of our models we design new metrics that, unlike\ntraditional ones, measure the absolute performance of uncertainty predictions.\nOur experiments highlight enhancements achieved by our method on standard depth\nand uncertainty metrics as well as on our tailored metrics.\nhttps://github.com/CEA-LIST/MonoProb",

            "summary": "In the field of intelligent multimedia analysis, ultra-fine-grained visual\ncategorization (Ultra-FGVC) plays a vital role in distinguishing intricate\nsubcategories within broader categories. However, this task is inherently\nchallenging due to the complex granularity of category subdivisions and the\nlimited availability of data for each category. To address these challenges,\nthis work proposes CSDNet, a pioneering framework that effectively explores\ncontrastive learning and self-distillation to learn discriminative\nrepresentations specifically designed for Ultra-FGVC tasks. CSDNet comprises\nthree main modules: Subcategory-Specific Discrepancy Parsing (SSDP), Dynamic\nDiscrepancy Learning (DDL), and Subcategory-Specific Discrepancy Transfer\n(SSDT), which collectively enhance the generalization of deep models across\ninstance, feature, and logit prediction levels. To increase the diversity of\ntraining samples, the SSDP module introduces augmented samples from different\nviewpoints to spotlight subcategory-specific discrepancies. Simultaneously, the\nproposed DDL module stores historical intermediate features by a dynamic memory\nqueue, which optimizes the feature learning space through iterative contrastive\nlearning. Furthermore, the SSDT module is developed by a novel\nself-distillation paradigm at the logit prediction level of raw and augmented\nsamples, which effectively distills more subcategory-specific discrepancies\nknowledge from the inherent structure of limited training data without\nrequiring additional annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDNet\noutperforms current state-of-the-art Ultra-FGVC methods, emphasizing its\npowerful efficacy and adaptability in addressing Ultra-FGVC tasks.",

However, there\nexists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage in the fine-grained user mobility\ntrajectories required by individual-level infection prediction. In this paper,\nwe focus on developing a framework of privacy-preserving individual-level\ninfection prediction based on federated learning (FL) and graph neural networks\n(GNN). We propose Falcon, a Federated grAph Learning method for\nprivacy-preserving individual-level infeCtion predictiON. It utilizes a novel\nhypergraph structure with spatio-temporal hyperedges to describe the complex\ninteractions between individuals and locations in the contagion process. By\norganically combining the FL framework with hypergraph neural networks, the\ninformation propagation process of the graph machine learning is able to be\ndivided into two stages distributed on the server and the clients,\nrespectively, so as to effectively protect user privacy while transmitting\nhigh-level information. Furthermore, it elaborately designs a differential\nprivacy perturbation mechanism as well as a plausible pseudo location\ngeneration approach to preserve user privacy in the graph structure. Besides,\nit introduces a cooperative coupling mechanism between the individual-level\nprediction model and an additional region-level model to mitigate the\ndetrimental impacts caused by the injected obfuscation mechanisms.

Yet, conventional optimization techniques usually consider\neither parameters or the shape separately. This work addresses this problem by\nproposing a simple yet powerful approach to combine parameter and shape\noptimization in a framework using Isogeometric Analysis (IGA). The optimization\nemploys sensitivity analysis by determining the gradients of an objective\nfunction with respect to parameters and control points that represent the\ngeometry. The gradients with respect to the control points are calculated in an\nanalytical way using the adjoint method, which enables straightforward shape\noptimization by altering of these control points. Given that a change in a\nsingle geometry parameter corresponds to modifications in multiple control\npoints, the chain rule is employed to obtain the gradient with respect to the\nparameters in an efficient semi-analytical way. The presented method is\nexemplarily applied to nonlinear 2D magnetostatic simulations featuring a\npermanent magnet synchronous motor and compared to designs, which were\noptimized using parameter and shape optimization separately. It is numerically\nshown that the permanent magnet mass can be reduced and the torque ripple can\nbe eliminated almost completely by simultaneously adjusting rotor parameters\nand shape. The approach allows for novel designs to be created with the\npotential to reduce the optimization time substantially.",

The method can work\nwith segment duration of several days, thanks to a double stage procedure in\nwhich an initial rough correction of the Doppler and spin-down is followed by a\nrefined step in which the residual variations are removed. This method can be\nefficiently applied for directed searches, where the source position is known\nto a good level of accuracy, and in the candidate follow-up stage of\nwide-parameter space searches.",

The usual goal is to improve the predictive power\nvia neural networks while building upon the generalized linear model, which is\nthe current industry standard. Our paper contributes to this current journey\nvia novel methods to enhance actuarial non-life models with transformer models\nfor tabular data. We build here upon the foundation laid out by the combined\nactuarial neural network as well as the localGLMnet and enhance those models\nvia the feature tokenizer transformer. The manuscript demonstrates the\nperformance of the proposed methods on a real-world claim frequency dataset and\ncompares them with several benchmark models such as generalized linear models,\nfeed-forward neural networks, combined actuarial neural networks, LocalGLMnet,\nand pure feature tokenizer transformer. The paper shows that the new methods\ncan achieve better results than the benchmark models while preserving certain\ngeneralized linear model advantages. The paper also discusses the practical\nimplications and challenges of applying transformer models in actuarial\nsettings.",

Considering the importance of the charged\nmeson production, we present a complete expression for the interference term of\nthe cross section which is experimentally accessible thanks to its charge\nconjugation specific property. We adopt two types of models for leading twist\n$\\pi \\pi$ GDAs to estimate the size of the interference term in the process\n$e^- e^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\gamma$ numerically, namely a model extracted from\nprevious experimental results on $\\gamma^* \\gamma \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0$ at Belle and\nthe asymptotic form predicted by QCD evolution equations. We include in the\ncalculation the kinematical higher-twist corrections up to twist 4 for the\nhelicity amplitudes. Both models of GDAs indicate that the kinematical\ncorrections are not negligible for the interference term of the cross section\nmeasured at BESIII, thus it is necessary to include them if we try to extract\nthe GDAs precisely. On the other side, the kinematical corrections are very\ntiny for the measurements at Belle II, and the leading twist-2 formula of the\ninterference term will be good enough to describe the charge conjugation odd\npart of the differential cross section.",

Rising liver problems are considered a fatal disease in many\ncountries, such as Egypt, Molda, etc. The objective of this study is to\nconstruct a predictive model for liver illness using Basic Formal Ontology\n(BFO) and detection rules derived from a decision tree algorithm. Based on\nthese rules, events are detected through batch processing using the Apache Jena\nframework. Based on the event detected, queries can be directly processed using\nSPARQL. To make the ontology operational, these Decision Tree (DT) rules are\nconverted into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). Using this SWRL in the\nontology for predicting different types of liver disease with the help of the\nPellet and Drool inference engines in Protege Tools, a total of 615 records are\ntaken from different liver diseases. After inferring the rules, the result can\nbe generated for the patient according to the DT rules, and other\npatient-related details along with different precautionary suggestions can be\nobtained based on these results. Combining query results of batch processing\nand ontology-generated results can give more accurate suggestions for disease\nprevention and detection. This work aims to provide a comprehensive approach\nthat is applicable for liver disease prediction, rich knowledge graph\nrepresentation, and smart querying capabilities. The results show that\ncombining RDF data, SWRL rules, and SPARQL queries for analysing and predicting\nliver disease can help medical professionals to learn more about liver diseases\nand make a Decision Support System (DSS) for health care.",

Capabilities in forecasting the spatio-temporal\nevolution of plasma rapidly and accurately allow us to quickly iterate over\ndesign and control strategies on current Tokamak devices and future reactors.\nModelling plasma evolution using numerical solvers is often expensive,\nconsuming many hours on supercomputers, and hence, we need alternative\ninexpensive surrogate models. We demonstrate accurate predictions of plasma\nevolution both in simulation and experimental domains using deep learning-based\nsurrogate modelling tools, viz., Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). We show that\nFNO has a speedup of six orders of magnitude over traditional solvers in\npredicting the plasma dynamics simulated from magnetohydrodynamic models, while\nmaintaining a high accuracy (MSE $\\approx$ $10^{-5}$). Our modified version of\nthe FNO is capable of solving multi-variable Partial Differential Equations\n(PDE), and can capture the dependence among the different variables in a single\nmodel. FNOs can also predict plasma evolution on real-world experimental data\nobserved by the cameras positioned within the MAST Tokamak, i.e., cameras\nlooking across the central solenoid and the divertor in the Tokamak. We show\nthat FNOs are able to accurately forecast the evolution of plasma and have the\npotential to be deployed for real-time monitoring. We also illustrate their\ncapability in forecasting the plasma shape, the locations of interactions of\nthe plasma with the central solenoid and the divertor for the full duration of\nthe plasma shot within MAST. The FNO offers a viable alternative for surrogate\nmodelling as it is quick to train and infer, and requires fewer data points,\nwhile being able to do zero-shot super-resolution and getting high-fidelity\nsolutions.",

Our method\ndiffers from typical multi-view shape estimation approaches in two key ways.\nFirst, our surface is represented not as a volume but as a neural heightmap\nwhere heights of points on a surface are computed by a deep neural network.\nSecond, instead of predicting an average intensity as PS-NeRF or introducing\nlambertian material assumptions as Guo et al., we use a learnt BRDF and perform\nnear-field per point intensity rendering.\n  Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DiLiGenT-MV\ndataset adapted to binocular stereo setup as well as a new binocular\nphotometric stereo dataset - LUCES-ST.",

In this paper,\nwe introduce the wrapped Gaussian spatial process (WGSP), as well as the\nprojected Gaussian spatial process (PGSP) custom-tailored for South Africa's\nintricate wind behaviour. Unlike conventional models struggling with the\ncircular nature of wind direction, the WGSP and PGSP adeptly incorporate\ncircular statistics to address this challenge. Leveraging historical data\nsourced from meteorological stations throughout South Africa, the WGSP and PGSP\nsignificantly increase predictive accuracy while capturing the nuanced spatial\ndependencies inherent to wind patterns. The superiority of the PGSP model in\ncapturing the structural characteristics of the South African wind data is\nevident. As opposed to the PGSP, the WGSP model is computationally less\ndemanding, allows for the use of less informative priors, and its parameters\nare more easily interpretable. The implications of this study are far-reaching,\noffering potential benefits ranging from the optimisation of renewable energy\nsystems to the informed decision-making in agriculture and climate adaptation\nstrategies. The WGSP and PGSP emerge as robust and invaluable tools,\nfacilitating precise modelling of wind patterns within the dynamic context of\nSouth Africa.",

They can be used for many code-related tasks such\nas code clone detection, code-to-code search, and method name prediction.\nHowever, these large-scale language models based on each code token have\nseveral drawbacks: They are usually large in scale, heavily dependent on\nlabels, and require a lot of computing power and time to fine-tune new\ndatasets.Furthermore, code embedding should be performed on the entire code\nsnippet rather than encoding each code token. The main reason for this is that\nencoding each code token would cause model parameter inflation, resulting in a\nlot of parameters storing information that we are not very concerned about. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, called TransformCode, that learns\nabout code embeddings in a contrastive learning manner. The framework uses the\nTransformer encoder as an integral part of the model. We also introduce a novel\ndata augmentation technique called abstract syntax tree transformation: This\ntechnique applies syntactic and semantic transformations to the original code\nsnippets to generate more diverse and robust anchor samples. Our proposed\nframework is both flexible and adaptable: It can be easily extended to other\ndownstream tasks that require code representation such as code clone detection\nand classification. The framework is also very efficient and scalable: It does\nnot require a large model or a large amount of training data, and can support\nany programming language.Finally, our framework is not limited to unsupervised\nlearning, but can also be applied to some supervised learning tasks by\nincorporating task-specific labels or objectives. To explore the effectiveness\nof our framework, we conducted extensive experiments on different software\nengineering tasks using different programming languages and multiple datasets.",

To address this gap, we introduce a novel learning-augmented\npolicy. This policy employs a dynamic robustness budget, which is adapted in\nreal-time based on the reinforcement learning policy's performance.\nSpecifically, it leverages the temporal difference (TD) error, a measure of the\nlearning policy's prediction accuracy, to assess the trustworthiness of the\nmachine-learned policy. This method allows for a more effective balance between\nconsistency and robustness in EV charging schedules, significantly enhancing\nadaptability and efficiency in real-world, unpredictable environments.

The literature has developed\nmean-subsequence-reduced (MSR) algorithms for the MAS with F adversarial\nattacks and has shown that the consensus is achieved for the normal agents when\nthe communication network is at least (2F+1)-robust. However, such a stringent\nrequirement on the communication network needs to be relaxed to enable more\npractical applications. Our objective is, for the first time, to achieve less\nstringent conditions on the network, while ensuring the resilient consensus for\nthe general linear MAS subject to control input constraints. In this work, we\npropose a distributed resilient consensus framework, consisting of a\npre-designed consensus protocol and distributed model predictive control (DMPC)\noptimization, which can help significantly reduce the requirement on the\nnetwork robustness and effectively handle the general linear constrained MAS\nunder adversarial attacks. By employing a novel distributed adversarial attack\ndetection mechanism based on the history information broadcast by neighbors and\na convex set (i.e., resilience set), we can evaluate the reliability of\ncommunication links. Moreover, we show that the recursive feasibility of the\nassociated DMPC optimization problem can be guaranteed. The proposed consensus\nprotocol features the following properties: 1) by minimizing a group of control\nvariables, the consensus performance is optimized; 2) the resilient consensus\nof the general linear constrained MAS subject to F-locally adversarial attacks\nis achieved when the communication network is (F+1)-robust.

            "summary": "The decarbonization of energy systems worldwide requires a transformation of\ntheir design and operation across all sectors, that is, the residential and\ncommercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. Energy system models are\nfrequently employed for assessing these changes, providing scenarios on\npotential future system design and on how new technologies and a modified\ninfrastructure will meet future energy demands. Thus, they support investment\ndecisions and policy-making. The Python-based Framework for Integrated Energy\nSystem Assessment (ETHOS.FINE) is a software package that provides a toolbox\nfor modeling, analyting and evaluating such energy systems using mathematical\noptimization. ETHOS.FINE is part of the Energy Transformation paTHway\nOptimization Suite (ETHOS) , a collection of modeling tools developed by the\nInstitute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-Economic System Analysis\n(IEK-3) at Forschungszentrum J\\\"ulich. ETHOS offers a holistic view on energy\nsystems at arbitrary scales providing tools for geospatial renewable potential\nanalyses, time series simulation tools for residential and industrial sector,\ndiscrete choice models for the transportation sector, modeling of global energy\nsupply routes, and local infrastructure assessments, among others. The ETHOS\nmodel suite is, e.g., used for analyzing the energy transition of Germany\n(Stolten et al., 2022).",

            "summary": "Hero drafting for multiplayer online arena (MOBA) games is crucial because\ndrafting directly affects the outcome of a match. Both sides take turns to\n\"ban\"/\"pick\" a hero from a roster of approximately 100 heroes to assemble their\ndrafting. In professional tournaments, the process becomes more complex as\nteams are not allowed to pick heroes used in the previous rounds with the\n\"best-of-N\" rule. Additionally, human factors including the team's familiarity\nwith drafting and play styles are overlooked by previous studies. Meanwhile,\nthe huge impact of patch iteration on drafting strengths in the professional\ntournament is of concern. To this end, we propose a visual analytics system,\nBPCoach, to facilitate hero drafting planning by comparing various drafting\nthrough recommendations and predictions and distilling relevant human and\nin-game factors. Two case studies, expert feedback, and a user study suggest\nthat BPCoach helps determine hero drafting in a rounded and efficient manner.",

            "summary": "A promising approach for improving the performance of vision-language models\nlike CLIP for image classification is to extend the class descriptions (i.e.,\nprompts) with related attributes, e.g., using brown sparrow instead of sparrow.\nHowever, current zero-shot methods select a subset of attributes regardless of\ncommonalities between the target classes, potentially providing no useful\ninformation that would have helped to distinguish between them. For instance,\nthey may use color instead of bill shape to distinguish between sparrows and\nwrens, which are both brown. We propose Follow-up Differential Descriptions\n(FuDD), a zero-shot approach that tailors the class descriptions to each\ndataset and leads to additional attributes that better differentiate the target\nclasses. FuDD first identifies the ambiguous classes for each image, and then\nuses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate new class descriptions that\ndifferentiate between them. The new class descriptions resolve the initial\nambiguity and help predict the correct label. In our experiments, FuDD\nconsistently outperforms generic description ensembles and naive LLM-generated\ndescriptions on 12 datasets. We show that differential descriptions are an\neffective tool to resolve class ambiguities, which otherwise significantly\ndegrade the performance. We also show that high quality natural language class\ndescriptions produced by FuDD result in comparable performance to few-shot\nadaptation methods.",

A particularly significant issue is that generic QML\nmodels suffer from so-called barren plateaus in their training landscapes --\nlarge regions where cost function gradients vanish exponentially in the number\nof qubits employed, rendering large models effectively untrainable. A leading\nstrategy for combating this effect is to build problem-specific models which\ntake into account the symmetries of their data in order to focus on a smaller,\nrelevant subset of Hilbert space. In this work, we introduce a family of\nrotationally equivariant QML models built upon the quantum Fourier transform,\nand leverage recent insights from the Lie-algebraic study of QML models to\nprove that (a subset of) our models do not exhibit barren plateaus. In addition\nto our analytical results we numerically test our rotationally equivariant\nmodels on a dataset of simulated scanning tunnelling microscope images of\nphosphorus impurities in silicon, where rotational symmetry naturally arises,\nand find that they dramatically outperform their generic counterparts in\npractice.",

To strengthen generalization, most state-of-the-art techniques inject\nknowledge of the data distribution shifts by enforcing constraints on learned\nfeatures or regularizing parameters. We offer an alternative approach: Learning\nfrom Privileged Medical Imaging Information (LPMII). We show that using some\nprivileged information such as tumor shape or location leads to stronger domain\ngeneralization ability than current state-of-the-art techniques. This paper\ndemonstrates that by using privileged information to predict the severity of\nintra-layer retinal fluid in optical coherence tomography scans, the\nclassification accuracy of a deep learning model operating on\nout-of-distribution data improves from $0.911$ to $0.934$.

            "summary": "Theoretical models struggle to reproduce dynamically cold disks with\nsignificant rotation-to-dispersion support($V_{\\rm{rot}}/\\sigma$) observed in\nstar-forming galaxies in the early Universe, at redshift $z>4$. We aim to\nexplore the possible emergence of dynamically cold disks in cosmological\nsimulations and to understand if different kinematic tracers can help reconcile\nthe tension between theory and observations. We use 3218 galaxies from the\nSERRA suite of zoom-in simulations, with $8<\\log(M_*/M_{\\odot})<10.3$ and\nSFR$<128\\,M_{\\odot}{yr}^{-1}$, within $4<z<9$ range. We generate hyper-spectral\ndata cubes for 6436 synthetic observations of H$\\alpha$ and [CII]. We find that\nthe choice of kinematic tracer strongly influences gas velocity dispersion\nestimates. When using H$\\alpha$ ([CII]) synthetic observations, we observe a\nstrong (mild) correlation between $\\sigma$ and $M_*$. Such a difference arises\nmostly for $M_*>10^9\\,M_{\\odot}$ galaxies, for which\n$\\sigma_{H\\alpha}>2\\sigma_{CII}$ for a significant fraction of the sample.\nRegardless of the tracer, our predictions suggest the existence of massive\n($M_*>10^{10}M_{\\odot}$) galaxies with $V_{rot}/\\sigma>10$ at $z>4$,\nmaintaining cold disks for >10 orbital periods (200Myr). Furthermore, we do not\nfind any significant redshift dependence for $V_{rot}/\\sigma$ ratio in our\nsample. Our simulations predict the existence of dynamically cold disks in the\nearly Universe. However, different tracers are sensitive to different kinematic\nproperties. While [CII] effectively traces the thin, gaseous disk of galaxies,\nH$\\alpha$ includes the contribution from ionized gas beyond the disk,\ncharacterized by prevalent vertical or radial motions that may be associated\nwith outflows. The presence of H$\\alpha$ halos could be a signature of such\ngalactic outflows. This emphasizes the importance of combining ALMA and\nJWST/NIRspec studies of high-z galaxies.",

            "summary": "It is usually infeasible to fit and train an entire large deep neural network\n(DNN) model using a single edge device due to the limited resources. To\nfacilitate intelligent applications across edge devices, researchers have\nproposed partitioning a large model into several sub-models, and deploying each\nof them to a different edge device to collaboratively train a DNN model.\nHowever, the communication overhead caused by the large amount of data\ntransmitted from one device to another during training, as well as the\nsub-optimal partition point due to the inaccurate latency prediction of\ncomputation at each edge device can significantly slow down training. In this\npaper, we propose AccEPT, an acceleration scheme for accelerating the edge\ncollaborative pipeline-parallel training. In particular, we propose a\nlight-weight adaptive latency predictor to accurately estimate the computation\nlatency of each layer at different devices, which also adapts to unseen devices\nthrough continuous learning. Therefore, the proposed latency predictor leads to\nbetter model partitioning which balances the computation loads across\nparticipating devices. Moreover, we propose a bit-level computation-efficient\ndata compression scheme to compress the data to be transmitted between devices\nduring training. Our numerical results demonstrate that our proposed\nacceleration approach is able to significantly speed up edge pipeline parallel\ntraining up to 3 times faster in the considered experimental settings.",

            "summary": "This paper investigates non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decays in the\nminimal extension of the canonical type-I seesaw model, where a complex singlet\nscalar $\\phi$ is introduced to generate the Majorana masses of right-handed\nneutrinos (RHNs) and to play the role of inflaton. First, we systematically\nstudy non-thermal leptogenesis with the least model dependence. We give a\ngeneral classification of the parameter space and find four characteristic\nlimits by carefully examining the interplay between inflaton decay into RHNs\nand the decay of RHNs into the standard-model particles. Three of the four\nlimits are truly non-thermal, with a final efficiency larger than that of\nthermal leptogenesis. Two analytic estimates for these three limits are\nprovided with working conditions to examine the validity. In particular, we\nfind that the {\\it strongly non-thermal RHNs} scenario occupies a large\nparameter space, including the oscillation-preferred $K$ range, and works well\nfor a relatively-low reheating temperature $T^{}_{\\rm RH} \\geq 10^3~{\\rm GeV}$,\nextending the lower bound on the RHN mass to $2\\times 10^{7}~{\\rm GeV}$. The\nlepton flavor effects are discussed. Second, we demonstrate that such a unified\npicture for inflation, neutrino masses, and baryon number asymmetry can be\nrealized by either a Coleman-Weinberg potential (for the real part of $\\phi$)\nor a natural inflation potential (for the imaginary part of $\\phi$). The\nallowed parameter ranges for successful inflation and non-thermal leptogenesis\nare much more constrained than those without inflationary observations. We find\nthat non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay offers a testable framework\nfor the early Universe. It can be further tested with upcoming cosmological and\nneutrino data. The model-independent investigation of non-thermal leptogenesis\nshould be useful in exploring this direction.",

            "summary": "Several theoretical methods have been developed to approximate prevalence and\nthreshold of epidemics on networks. Among them, the recurrent dynamic\nmessage-passing (rDMP) theory offers a state-of-the-art performance by\npreventing the echo chamber effect in network edges. However, the rDMP theory\nwas derived in an intuitive ad-hoc way, lacking a solid theoretical foundation\nand resulting in a probabilistic inconsistency flaw. Furthermore, real-world\nnetworks are clustered and full of local loops like triangles, whereas rDMP is\nbased on the assumption of a locally tree-like network structure, which makes\nrDMP potentially inefficient on real applications. In this work, for the\nrecurrent-state epidemics, we first demonstrate that the echo chamber effect\nexits not only in edges but also in local loops, which rDMP-like method can not\navoid. We then correct the deficiency of rDMP in a principled manner, leading\nto the natural introduction of new higher-order dynamic messages, extending\nrDMP to handle local loops. By linearizing the extended message-passing\nequations, a new epidemic threshold estimation is given by the inverse of the\nleading eigenvalue of a matrix named triangular non-backtracking matrix.\nNumerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world networks to\nevaluate our method, the efficacy of which is validated in epidemic prevalence\nand threshold prediction tasks. In addition, our method has the potential to\nspeed up the solution of the immunization, influence maximization, and\nrobustness optimization problems in the networks.",

            "summary": "Dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and\nsurface normal prediction, can be easily formulated as per-pixel classification\n(discrete outputs) or regression (continuous outputs). This per-pixel\nprediction paradigm has remained popular due to the prevalence of fully\nconvolutional networks. However, on the recent frontier of segmentation task,\nthe community has been witnessing a shift of paradigm from per-pixel prediction\nto cluster-prediction with the emergence of transformer architectures,\nparticularly the mask transformers, which directly predicts a label for a mask\ninstead of a pixel. Despite this shift, methods based on the per-pixel\nprediction paradigm still dominate the benchmarks on the other dense prediction\ntasks that require continuous outputs, such as depth estimation and surface\nnormal prediction. Motivated by the success of DORN and AdaBins in depth\nestimation, achieved by discretizing the continuous output space, we propose to\ngeneralize the cluster-prediction based method to general dense prediction\ntasks. This allows us to unify dense prediction tasks with the mask transformer\nframework. Remarkably, the resulting model PolyMaX demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks of NYUD-v2 dataset. We hope\nour simple yet effective design can inspire more research on exploiting mask\ntransformers for more dense prediction tasks. Code and model will be made\navailable.",

            "summary": "Collisionless shock waves have long been considered amongst the most prolific\nparticle accelerators in the universe. Shocks alter the plasma they propagate\nthrough and often exhibit complex evolution across multiple scales.\nInterplanetary (IP) traveling shocks have been recorded in-situ for over half a\ncentury and act as a natural laboratory for experimentally verifying various\naspects of large-scale collisionless shocks. A fundamentally interesting\nproblem in both helio and astrophysics is the acceleration of electrons to\nrelativistic energies (more than 300 keV) by traveling shocks. This letter\npresents first observations of field-aligned beams of relativistic electrons\nupstream of an IP shock observed thanks to the instrumental capabilities of\nSolar Orbiter. This study aims to present the characteristics of the electron\nbeams close to the source and contribute towards understanding their\nacceleration mechanism. On 25 July 2022, Solar Orbiter encountered an IP shock\nat 0.98 AU. The shock was associated with an energetic storm particle event\nwhich also featured upstream field-aligned relativistic electron beams observed\n14 minutes prior to the actual shock crossing. The distance of the beam's\norigin was investigated using a velocity dispersion analysis (VDA).\nPeak-intensity energy spectra were anaylzed and compared with those obtained\nfrom a semi-analytical fast-Fermi acceleration model. By leveraging Solar\nOrbiter's high-time resolution Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), we have\nsuccessfully showcased an IP shock's ability to accelerate relativistic\nelectron beams. Our proposed acceleration mechanism offers an explanation for\nthe observed electron beam and its characteristics, while we also explore the\npotential contributions of more complex mechanisms.",

Using (i) numerical\nsimulations based on lattice-Boltzmann method, and (ii) analytical expressions\nusing far-field hydrodynamic approximations and method of images we\nsystematically investigate the role of the strength and finite-size of the\nsquirmer, confinement dimensions, and initial conditions in determining the\nthree dimensional trajectories of microswimmers. Our results indicate that the\nhydrodynamic interactions with the confining walls of the channel significantly\naffect the swimming speed and trajectory of the model microswimmer.\nSpecifically, pullers always display sliding motion inside the channel: weak\npullers slide through the channel centerline, while strong pullers slide\nthrough a path close to any of the walls. Pushers generally follow helical\nmotion in a square channel. Unlike pullers and pushers, the trajectories of\nneutral swimmers are not easy to generalize, and are sensitive to the initial\nconditions. Despite this diversity in the trajectories, the far-field\nexpressions capture the essential features of channel-confined swimmers.\nFinally, we propose a method based on the principle of superposition to\nunderstand the origin of the three-dimensional trajectories of channel confined\nswimmers. Such construction allows us to predict and justify the origin of\napparently complex 3D trajectories generated by different types of swimmers in\nchannels with square and rectangular cross sections.",

NLLF is generated by a small transformer language model (e.g., BERT)\nthat has been trained in a Natural Language Inference (NLI) fashion, using weak\nlabels automatically obtained from a Large Language Model (LLM). We show that\nthe LLM normally struggles for the main task using in-context learning, but can\nhandle these easiest subtasks and produce useful weak labels to train a BERT.\nThe NLI-like training of the BERT allows for tackling zero-shot inference with\nany binary question, and not necessarily the ones seen during the training. We\nshow that this NLLF vector not only helps to reach better performances by\nenhancing any classifier, but that it can be used as input of an\neasy-to-interpret machine learning model like a decision tree. This decision\ntree is interpretable but also reaches high performances, surpassing those of a\npre-trained transformer in some cases.We have successfully applied this method\nto two completely different tasks: detecting incoherence in students' answers\nto open-ended mathematics exam questions, and screening abstracts for a\nsystematic literature review of scientific papers on climate change and\nagroecology.",

First, a Feasibility Test\n(FT) algorithm that quickly desaturates overloaded cut-sets to prevent\ncascading line outages is integrated with the OPF problem. Then, the resulting\nformulation is combined with a data-driven transient stability analyzer that\npredicts the correction factors for eliminating dynamic insecurities.

Accelerators employ a large number of sensors to monitor\nbeam loss.

            "summary": "We investigate the signature of magnetic surface anisotropy in nanoparticles\nin their spin-flip neutron scattering cross section. Taking into account the\nisotropic exchange interaction, an external magnetic field, a uniaxial or cubic\nmagnetic anisotropy for the particle's core, and several models for the surface\nanisotropy (N\\'eel, conventional, random), we compute the spin-flip small-angle\nneutron scattering (SANS) cross section from the equilibrium spin structures\nobtained using the Landau-Lifshitz equation. The sign of the surface anisotropy\nconstant, which is related to the appearance of tangential- or radial-like spin\ntextures, can be distinguished from the momentum-transfer dependence of the\nspin-flip signal. The data cannot be described by the well-known and often-used\nanalytical expressions for uniformly magnetized spherical or core-shell\nparticles, in particular at remanence or at the coercive field. Based on a\nsecond-order polynomial expansion for the magnetization vector field, we\ndevelop a novel minimal model for the azimuthally-averaged magnetic SANS cross\nsection. The theoretical expression considers a general magnetization\ninhomogeneity and is not restricted to the presence of surface anisotropy. It\nis shown that the model describes very well our simulation data as well as more\ncomplex spin patterns such as vortex-like structures. Only seven expansion\ncoefficients and some basis functions are sufficient to describe the scattering\nbehavior of a very large number of atomic spins.",

            "summary": "Massive stars can explode in powerful supernovae (SNe) forming neutron stars\nbut they may also collapse directly into black holes (BHs). Understanding and\npredicting their final fate is increasingly important, e.g, in the context of\ngravitational-wave astronomy. The interior mixing of stars in general and\nconvective boundary mixing remain some of the largest uncertainties in their\nevolution. Here, we investigate the influence of convective boundary mixing on\nthe pre-SN structure and explosion properties of massive stars. Using the 1D\nstellar evolution code Mesa, we model single, non-rotating stars of solar\nmetallicity with initial masses of $5-70\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and convective core\nstep-overshooting of $0.05-0.50H_\\mathrm{P}$. Stars are evolved until the onset\nof iron core collapse, and the pre-SN models are exploded using a parametric,\nsemi-analytic SN code. We use the compactness parameter to describe the\ninterior structure of stars at core collapse. Larger convective core\novershooting shifts the location of the compactness peak by\n$1-2\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ to higher $M_\\mathrm{CO}$. As the luminosity of the\npre-SN progenitor is determined by $M_\\mathrm{CO}$, we predict BH formation for\nprogenitors with luminosities $5.35<\\log(L/\\mathrm{L_\\odot})<5.50$ and\n$\\log(L/\\mathrm{L_\\odot})>5.80$. The luminosity range of BH formation agrees\nwell with the observed luminosity of the red supergiant star N6946BH1 that\ndisappeared without a bright SN and likely collapsed into a BH. While some of\nour models in the luminosity range $\\log(L/\\mathrm{L_\\odot})=5.1-5.5$ indeed\ncollapse to form BHs, this does not fully explain the lack of observed SN~IIP\nprogenitors at these luminosities, ie the missing red-supergiant problem.\nConvective core overshooting affects the BH masses, the pre-SN location of\nstars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the plateau luminosity and duration\nof SN~IIP lightcurves.[Abridged]",

The utilization of SiC-based ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) instead\nof superalloys in components like engine shrouds, combustors, and nozzles\noffers notable advantages, including a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency, over\n10% enhanced thrust, and the capability to withstand up to 500$^{\\circ}$C\nhigher operating temperatures. Employing a CALPHAD-reinforced multi-phase-field\nmodel, our study delves into the evolution of the SiC layer under isothermal\nsolidification conditions. By modeling the growth of SiC between liquid Si and\nsolid C at 1450$^{\\circ}$C, we compared results with experimental\nmicrostructures and quantitatively examined the evolution of SiC thickness over\ntime. Efficient sampling across the entire model space mitigated uncertainty in\nhigh-temperature kinetic parameters, allowing us to predict a range of growth\nrates and morphologies for the SiC layer. The model accounts for parameter\nuncertainty stemming from limited experimental knowledge and successfully\npredicts relevant morphologies for the system. Experimental results validated\nthe kinetic parameters of the simulations, offering valuable insights and\npotential constraints on the reaction kinetics. We further explored the\nsignificance of multi-phase-field model parameters on two key outputs, and\nfound that the diffusion coefficient of liquid Si emerges as the most crucial\nparameter significantly impacting the SiC average layer thickness and grain\ncount over time. This study provides valuable insights into the microstructure\nevolution of the Si-C binary system, offering pertinent information for the\nengineering of CMCs in industrial applications.",

Motivated by analyses of cool material in hydrodynamical simulations\nof turbulent, multiphase media, we model individual cool gas structures as\nassemblies of cloudlets with a power-law distribution of cloudlet mass $\\propto\nm_{\\rm cl}^{-\\alpha}$ and relative velocities drawn from a turbulent velocity\nfield. The user may specify $\\alpha$, the lower limit of the cloudlet mass\ndistribution ($m_{\\rm cl,min}$), and several other parameters that set the\ntotal mass, size, and velocity distribution of the complex. We then calculate\nthe MgII 2796 absorption profiles induced by the cloudlets along pencil-beam\nlines of sight. We demonstrate that at fixed metallicity, the covering fraction\nof sightlines with equivalent widths $W_{2796} < 0.3$ Ang increases\nsignificantly with decreasing $m_{\\rm cl,min}$, cool cloudlet number density\n($n_{\\rm cl}$), and cloudlet complex size. We then present a first application,\nusing this framework to predict the projected $W_{2796}$ distribution around\n${\\sim}L^*$ galaxies. We show that the observed incidences of $W_{2796}>0.3$\nAng sightlines within 10 kpc < $R_{\\perp}$ < 50 kpc are consistent with our\nmodel over much of parameter space.

We investigate in detail the\nefficacy of resurgent extrapolations starting from just a finite number of\nterms in the weak-field expansions of the 1-loop and 2-loop scalar quantum\nelectrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. While we re-derive some of the\nwell-known 1-loop and 2-loop contributions in representations suitable for\nPad\\'{e}-Borel analyses, other contributions have been derived for the first\ntime. For instance, we find a closed analytic form for the one-particle\nreducible contribution at 2-loop, which until recently was thought to be\nunimportant. It is pointed out that there could be an interesting interplay\nbetween the one-particle irreducible and one-particle reducible terms in the\nstrong-field limit. For the 1-loop contribution, the resurgent analysis may be\nmapped effectively into two copies of the spinor quantum electrodynamics\nweak-field expansions, differing only in their prefactors and masses. This\nsimple mapping is no longer true at 2-loops. The singularity structures in the\nPad\\'{e}-Borel transforms at 1-loop and 2-loop are examined in some detail.\nAnalytic continuation to the electric field case and the generation of an\nimaginary part is also studied. We compare the Pad\\'{e}-Borel reconstructions\nto closed analytic forms or to numerically computed values in the full theory.\nIt is seen that Pad\\'{e}-Borel resummations based on even a small number of\nterms from the weak-field expansions can accurately approximate the\nstrong-field behaviour.",

As a concrete example,\nwe propose a grand unified embedding of the tri-hypercharge model $U(1)_Y^3$\nbased on an $SU(5)^{3}$ framework with cyclic symmetry.

            "summary": "Jellyfish galaxies are promising laboratories for studying radiative cooling\nand magnetic fields in multiphase gas flows. Their long, dense tails are\nobserved to be magnetised, and they extend up to 100 kpc into the intracluster\nmedium (ICM), suggesting that their gas is thermally unstable so that the cold\ngas mass grows with time rather than being fully dissolved in the hot wind as a\nresult of hydrodynamical interface instabilities. In this paper we use the\nAREPO code to perform magnetohydrodynamical windtunnel simulations of a\njellyfish galaxy experiencing ram-pressure stripping by interacting with an ICM\nwind. The ICM density, temperature and velocity that the galaxy encounters are\ntime-dependent and comparable to what a real jellyfish galaxy experiences while\norbiting the ICM. In simulations with a turbulent magnetised wind we reproduce\nobservations, which show that the magnetic field is aligned with the jellyfish\ntails. During the galaxy infall into the cluster with a near edge-on geometry,\nthe gas flow in the tail is fountain-like, implying preferential stripping of\ngas where the rotational velocity vectors add up with the ram pressure while\nfall-back occurs in the opposite case. Hence, the tail velocity shows a memory\nof the rotation pattern of the disc. At the time of the nearest cluster\npassage, ram-pressure stripping is so strong that the fountain flow is\ndestroyed and instead the tail is dominated by removal of gas. We show that gas\nin the tail is very fragmentative, which is a prediction of shattering due to\nradiative cooling.",

            "summary": "We explore the impact of a magnetar giant flare (GF) on the neutron star (NS)\ncrust, and the associated potential baryon mass ejection. We consider that\nsudden magnetic energy dissipation creates a thin high-pressure shell above a\nportion of the NS surface, which drives a relativistic shockwave into the\ncrust, heating a fraction of these layers to sufficiently high energies to\nbecome unbound along directions unconfined by the magnetic field. We explore\nthis process by means of spherically-symmetric relativistic hydrodynamical\nsimulations. For an initial shell pressure $P_{\\rm GF}$ we find that the total\nunbound ejecta mass roughly obeys the relation $M_{\\rm ej}\\sim4-9\\times\n10^{24}$ g $(P_{\\rm GF}/10^{30}$ ergs cm$^{-3})^{1.43}$. For $P_{\\rm\nGF}\\sim10^{30}-10^{31}$ ergs cm$^{-3}$ corresponding to the dissipation of a\nmagnetic field of strength $\\sim10^{15.5}-10^{16}$ G, we find $M_{\\rm\nej}\\sim10^{25}-10^{26}$ g with asymptotic velocities $v_{\\rm ej}/c\\sim 0.3-0.6$\ncompatible with the ejecta properties inferred from the radio afterglow of the\nGF from SGR 1806-20. Because the flare excavates crustal material to a depth\ncharacterized by an electron fraction $Y_e \\approx 0.40-0.46$, and is ejected\nwith high entropy and rapid expansion timescale, the conditions are met for\nheavy element $r$-process nucleosynthesis via the alpha-rich freeze-out\nmechanism. Given an energetic GF rate of roughly once per century in the Milky\nWay, we find that GFs could contribute an appreciable heavy $r$-process source\nthat tracks star formation. We predict that GFs are accompanied by short\nminutes long, luminous $\\sim 10^{39}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ optical transients powered\nby $r$-process decay (\"nova brevis\"), akin to scaled-down kilonovae. Our\nfindings also have implications for FRBs from repeating magnetar flares,\nparticularly the high rotation measures of the synchrotron nebulae surrounding\nthese sources.",

            "summary": "Semi-analytic modeling furnishes an efficient avenue for characterizing the\nproperties of dark matter halos associated with satellites of Milky Way-like\nsystems, as it easily accounts for uncertainties arising from halo-to-halo\nvariance, the orbital disruption of satellites, baryonic feedback, and the\nstellar-to-halo mass (SMHM) relation. We use the SatGen semi-analytic satellite\ngenerator -- which incorporates both empirical models of the galaxy-halo\nconnection in the field as well as analytic prescriptions for the orbital\nevolution of these satellites after they enter a host galaxy -- to create large\nsamples of Milky Way-like systems and their satellites. By selecting satellites\nin the sample that match the observed properties of a particular dwarf galaxy,\nwe can then infer arbitrary properties of the satellite galaxy within the Cold\nDark Matter paradigm. For the Milky Way's classical dwarfs, we provide inferred\nvalues (with associated uncertainties) for the maximum circular velocity\n$v_{max}$ and the radius $r_{max}$ at which it occurs, varying over two choices\nof feedback model and two prescriptions for the SMHM relation that populate\ndark matter halos with physically distinct galaxies. While simple empirical\nscaling relations can recover the median inferred value for $v_{max}$ and\n$r_{max}$, this approach provides realistic correlated uncertainties and aids\ninterpretability through variation of the model. For these different models, we\nalso demonstrate how the internal properties of a satellite's dark matter\nprofile correlate with its orbit, and we show that it is difficult to reproduce\nobservations of the Fornax dwarf without strong baryonic feedback. The\ntechnique developed in this work is flexible in its application of\nobservational data and can leverage arbitrary information about the satellite\ngalaxies to make inferences about their dark matter halos and population\nstatistics.",

            "summary": "We study how structural properties of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies\nare linked to their orbits in the Milky Way halo. From the inner to the outer\nhalo, orbital energy increases and stellar-systems gradually move out of\ninternal equilibrium: in the inner halo, high-surface brightness globular\nclusters are at pseudo-equilibrium, while further away, low-surface brightness\nclusters and dwarfs appear more tidally disturbed. Dwarf galaxies are the\nlatest to arrive into the halo as indicated by their large orbital energies and\npericenters, and have no time for more than one orbit. Their (gas-rich)\nprogenitors likely lost their gas during their recent arrival in the Galactic\nhalo. If dwarfs are at equilibrium with their dark matter (DM) content, the DM\ndensity should anti-correlate with pericenter. However, the transformation of\nDM dominated dwarfs from gas-rich rotation-supported into gas-poor\ndispersion-supported systems is unlikely accomplished during a single orbit. We\nsuggest instead that the above anti-correlation is brought by the combination\nof ram-pressure stripping and of Galactic tidal shocks. Recent gas removal\nleads to an expansion of their stellar content caused by the associated gravity\nloss, making them sufficiently fragile to be transformed near pericenter\npassage. Out of equilibrium dwarfs would explain the observed anti-correlation\nof kinematics-based DM density with pericenter without invoking DM density\nitself, questioning its previous estimates. Ram-pressure stripping and tidal\nshocks may contribute to the dwarf velocity dispersion excess. It predicts the\npresence of numerous stars in their outskirts and a few young stars in their\ncores.",

This allows us to show\nthat this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially\nasymptotically in time, depending on whether the spin model displays a\nferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example\nof the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing\na rich phase behaviour, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time with\n$N$.

We\nsimulate novel 1D merger models of binaries consisting of supergiants with\nhydrogen-free cores (primaries) and main-sequence companions (secondaries) and\nconsider the effects of interaction of the secondary with the core of the\nprimary. We follow the evolution of the new-born $16-40$ M$_{\\odot}$ stars\nuntil core-carbon depletion, close to their final pre-explosion structure.\nUnlike stars which are born alone, stars born from such stellar mergers are\nblue throughout their core helium-burning phase and reproduce the surface\ngravities and Hertzsprung-Russel diagram positions of most of our sample. This\nindicates that the observed blue supergiants are structurally similar to\nmerger-born stars. Moreover, the large nitrogen-to-carbon and oxygen ratios,\nand helium enhancements exhibited by at least half our data sample are uniquely\nconsistent with our model predictions, leading us to conclude that a large\nfraction of blue supergiants are indeed products of binary mergers.",

Among all DFT functionals tested in\nthis study, in particular, the PBE was the one that showed the best agreement\nwith the experimental data available in the literature. Our results also reveal\nthat the [PbO$_5$] clusters are formed with three different Pb--O bond lengths,\nwith values of about 2.32, 2.59 and 2.84\\AA, respectively, and the [SO$_4$]\nclusters have the same S--O bond length of 1.57\\AA. We then performed a\ncomplete topological analysis of this system to better understand these\nstructural differences. Additionally, the PSO structure has an indirect band\ngap energy of 2.9 eV and an effective mass ratio of about 0.415 (using PBE\ncalculations) which may, in principle, indicate a low recombination of\nelectro-hole pairs in the lanarkite structure.

To address these experimental puzzles we study an\ninteracting model of electrons in this geometry, first within the\nself-consistent Hartree-Fock (SCHF) approximation. We find an isolated Chern\nband with Chern number $|C|=1$, that moreover is relatively flat and shows good\nquantum geometry. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization\ngroup methods at fractional filling establish the presence of fractional\nquantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states. The $|C|=1$ band in SCHF is remarkably\nrobust to varying microscopic parameters, and is also found in the $N_L=4$ and\n$N_L=6$ layer systems. Remarkably, it appears stable even to switching off the\nmoir\\'e potential, pointing to spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry. We\nterm this topological crystalline state the ``anomalous Hall crystal\" (AHC),\nand argue that it constitutes a general mechanism for creating stable Chern\nbands in rhombohedral graphene. Our work elucidates the physics behind the\nrecent rhombohedral pentalayer graphene observations, predicts the appearance\nof the same phase in other systems, and opens the door to studying the\ninterplay between electronic topology and spontaneous translation symmetry\nbreaking.",

Additionally, the paper describes the practical deployment\nof the DCAN-based anomaly detection model for bearing fault detection,\nutilizing data from the ball mill bearings of Wuhan Iron & Steel Resources\nGroup and fault data from NASA's bearing vibration dataset. Experimental\nresults validate the DCAN model's reliability in recognizing fault vibration\npatterns. This method holds promise for enhancing bearing fault detection\nefficiency, reducing production interruptions, and lowering maintenance costs.",

Although topography, land-use, and\nother static parameters are well-resolved, models have to be evaluated, because\nit cannot be assumed that higher horizontal resolution automatically yields\nbetter model performance. In this study, we perform limited-area simulations\nwith the ICON model across horizontal grid spacings (1 km, 500 m, 250 m, 125 m)\nin the Inn Valley, Austria. Simulations are ran with two turbulence schemes - a\n1D parameterization and a 3D Smagorinsky-type scheme. We evaluate the model\nacross scales with observations of the valley boundary layer from the CROSSINN\nmeasurement campaign. This allows us to investigate whether increasing the\nhorizontal resolution automatically improves the representation of the\nthermally-induced circulation, surface exchange, and other mountain boundary\nlayer processes. The two turbulence schemes produce quite similar results\nacross grid spacings, while differences are mostly found in the representation\nof the thermal structure of the valley atmosphere. The model keeps facing\nchallenges for the correct simulation of scale interactions, and the 3D\nSmagorinsky scheme simulates a delayed evening transition of the up-valley\nflow. It is argued that the major difference between schemes actually emerges\nfrom the different surface transfer schemes, and the choice of boundary layer\nparameterization is secondary.",

The approaches have been tested in the first excited states of H2,\nHeH+, LiH and Li2, showing good results compared with the full configuration\ninteraction (FCI) method. As expected, an increase in accuracy is observed when\ngoing from ERPA0 to ERPA1 and ERPA2. We have also studied the effect of\nelectron correlation included by PNOF5, PNOF7 and the recently proposed global\nNOF (GNOF) on the predicted excited states. PNOF5 appears to be good and may\neven provide better results in very small systems, but including more electron\ncorrelation becomes important as the system size increases, where PNOF7 and\nGNOF provide better results. This effect can already be seen in the excitation\nenergies of the neon atom, where GNOF provides more accurate values than PNOF5\nand PNOF7. Overall, the extension of PNOF to excited states has been\nsuccessful, making the PNOF-ERPA method promising for further applications.",

However, there\nare so many degradation mechanisms in LIBs that any truly comprehensive model\nwill have at least four fitting parameters, casting doubts on models validated\nagainst only one or two metrics. Here we highlight the importance of\nconsidering degradation modes, which breaks down the degradation into loss of\nlithium inventory, loss of active material (one in each electrode) and\nimpedance change, as the extra metrics. We show that three models with\ndifferent levels of complexity can all fit well the remaining capacity and\nresistance of cells cycled at 70%~85% state of charge at three different\ntemperatures, but only the two models with mechanisms to induce loss of active\nmaterial (LAM) can fit LAM of both electrodes.

            "summary": "Virtual networks are an innovative abstraction that extends cloud computing\nconcepts to the network: by supporting bandwidth reservations between compute\nnodes (e.g., virtual machines), virtual networks can provide a predictable\nperformance to distributed and communication-intensive cloud applications.\nHowever, in order to make the most efficient use of the shared resources, the\nVirtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem has to be solved: a virtual network\nshould be mapped onto the given physical network so that resource reservations\nare minimized. The problem has been studied intensively already and is known to\nbe NP-hard in general. In this paper, we revisit this problem and consider it\non specific topologies, as they often arise in practice. To be more precise, we\nstudy the weighted version of the VNE problem: we consider a virtual weighted\nnetwork of a specific topology which we want to embed onto a weighted network\nwith capacities and specific topology. As for topologies, we consider most\nfundamental and commonly used ones: line, star, $2$-tiered star, oversubscribed\n$2$-tiered star, and tree, in addition to also considering arbitrary\ntopologies. We show that typically the VNE problem is NP-hard even in more\nspecialized cases, however, sometimes there exists a polynomial algorithm: for\nexample, an embedding of the oversubscribed $2$-tiered star onto the tree is\npolynomial while an embedding of an arbitrary $2$-tiered star is not.",

We began by empirically evaluating 6 modern machine learning-based\noutlier detection algorithms on the task of identifying irregular data in 838\ndatasets from 7 real-world MCRCTs with a total of 77,001 patients from over 44\ncountries. Our results reinforce key findings from prior work in the outlier\ndetection literature on data from other domains. Existing algorithms often\nsucceed at identifying irregularities without any supervision, with at least\none algorithm exhibiting positive performance 70.6% of the time. However,\nperformance across datasets varies substantially with no single algorithm\nperforming consistently well, motivating new techniques for unsupervised model\nselection or other means of aggregating potentially discordant predictions from\nmultiple candidate models. We propose the Meta-learned Probabilistic Ensemble\n(MePE), a simple algorithm for aggregating the predictions of multiple\nunsupervised models, and show that it performs favourably compared to recent\nmeta-learning approaches for outlier detection model selection. While\nmeta-learning shows promise, small ensembles outperform all forms of\nmeta-learning on average, a negative result that may guide the application of\ncurrent outlier detection approaches in healthcare and other real-world\ndomains.",

Static order is destroyed\nin any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets.

Lithium-ion\nelectrolytes are essential to battery operation and normally contain at least\ntwo solvents to satisfy performance requirements. The widely used\nDoyle-Fuller-Newman battery model assumes that the electrolyte comprises a salt\ndissolved in a single effective solvent, however. This single-solvent\napproximation has been disproved experimentally and may hinder accurate battery\nmodelling. Here, we present a two-solvent model that resolves the transport of\nethylene carbonate (EC) and lithium salt in a background linear carbonate. EC\nconcentration polarization opposes that of Li+ during cycling, affecting local\nelectrolyte properties and cell-level overpotentials. Concentration gradients\nof Li+ can be affected by cross-diffusion, whereby EC gradients enhance or\nimpede salt flux. A rationally parametrized model that includes EC transport\npredicts 6% more power loss at 4.5C discharge and ~0.32% more capacity loss\nafter a thousand 1C cycles than its single-solvent equivalent. This work\nprovides a tool to model more transport behaviour in the electrolyte that may\naffect degradation and enables the transfer of microscopic knowledge about\nsolvation structure-dependent performance to the macroscale.",

Approximate local balance equations\nare analyzed to determine key parameters in the solution, which are shown to be\nrather close to the empirically-measured values from numerical solution of the\nWilcox k-{\\omega} model, hence the analytic construction is fully validated.\nFurthermore, the predictions of three critical locations in the model's three\ntransition functions are validated, which enables an in-depth understanding of\nthe parameter setting of the model. These results provide clear evidence that\nthe k-{\\omega} model sets in it a multi-layer structure, which is similar to\nbut different, in some insignificant details, from the Navier-Stokes\nturbulence. This finding explains why the k-{\\omega} model is so popular,\nespecially in computing the near-wall flow. Finally, the analysis is extended\nto a newly-refined k-{\\omega} model called SED k-{\\omega}, showing that the SED\nk-{\\omega} model has improved the multi-layer structure in the outer flow but\npreserved the setting of the k-{\\omega} model in the inner region.",

As a result, spacecraft collision avoidance\nprocedures have become an essential part of satellite operations. To ensure\nsafe and effective space activities, satellite owners and operators rely on\nconstantly updated estimates of encounters. These estimates include the\nuncertainty associated with the position of each object at the expected TCA.\nThese estimates are crucial in planning risk mitigation measures, such as\ncollision avoidance manoeuvres. As the TCA approaches, the accuracy of these\nestimates improves, as both objects' orbit determination and propagation\nprocedures are made for increasingly shorter time intervals. However, this\nimprovement comes at the cost of taking place close to the critical decision\nmoment. This means that safe avoidance manoeuvres might not be possible or\ncould incur significant costs. Therefore, knowing the evolution of this\nvariable in advance can be crucial for operators. This work proposes a machine\nlearning model based on diffusion models to forecast the position uncertainty\nof objects involved in a close encounter, particularly for the secondary object\n(usually debris), which tends to be more unpredictable.

            "summary": "Ferroelectric materials are of practical interest for non-volatile data\nstorage due to their reorientable, crystallographically defined polarization\nstates, yet efforts to integrate perovskite-based materials into ultrathin\nnon-volatile memories have been frustrated by film-thickness scaling\nconstraints, which limit ferroelectric switching under low voltage. Wurtzite\nmaterials, including magnesium-substituted zinc oxide [(Zn,Mg)O], have recently\nbeen shown to exhibit scalable ferroelectricity as thin films. While accurate\nfirst-principles calculations predict that a biaxial tension of a few percent\nmay promote ferroelectricity in wurtzites, biaxial strains are found not to\nexceed 0.3% in (Zn,Mg)O thin films at the solubility limit of Mg in ZnO. In\nthis work, this major discrepancy is resolved and the observations of\nferroelectricity in (Zn,Mg)O are explained by examining the influence of Mg\nsubstitution on interatomic bonding and ferroelectric switching. Large strain\nfluctuations emerge locally around individual Zn and Mg cations in (Zn,Mg)O,\ncausing a reduction of up to 45% in the local coercive fields via a sequential\nmechanism of polarization reversal. This work provides direct quantitative\nevidence that strain fluctuations can mediate polarization reversal in\nwurtzites, opening up an avenue to develop scalable ferroelectric materials for\nultrathin microelectronics.",

            "summary": "A dataset of 3D-GRE and 3D-TSE brain 3T post contrast T1-weighted images as\npart of a quality improvement project were collected and shown to five\nneuro-radiologists who evaluated each sequence for both image quality and\nimaging artifacts. The same scans were processed using the MRQy tool for\nobjective, quantitative image quality metrics. Using the combined radiologist\nand quantitative metrics dataset, a decision tree classifier with a bagging\nensemble approach was trained to predict radiologist assessment using the\nquantitative metrics. A machine learning model was developed for the following\nthree tasks: (1) determine the best model / performance for each MRI sequence\nand evaluation metric, (2) determine the best model / performance across all\nMRI sequences for each evaluation metric, and (3) determine the best general\nmodel / performance across all MRI sequences and evaluations. Model performance\nfor imaging artifact was slightly higher than image quality, for example, the\nfinal generalized model AUROC for image quality was 0.77 (0.41 - 0.84, 95% CI)\nwhile imaging artifact was 0.78 (0.60 - 0.93, 95% CI). Further, it was noted\nthat the generalized model performed slightly better than the individual models\n(AUROC 0.69 for 3D-GRE image quality, for example), indicating the value in\ncomprehensive training data for these applications. These models could be\ndeployed in the clinic as automatic checks for real-time image acquisition to\nprevent patient re-scanning requiring another appointment after retrospective\nradiologist analysis or improve reader confidence in the study. Further work\nneeds to be done to validate the model described here on an external dataset.\nThe results presented here suggest that MRQy could be used as a foundation for\nquantitative metrics as a surrogate for radiologist assessment.",

Specifically, generative models can\nswiftly propose promising materials for targeted applications. However, the\npredicted properties of materials through the generative models often do not\nmatch with calculated properties through ab initio calculations. This\ndiscrepancy can arise because the generated coordinates are not fully relaxed,\nwhereas the many properties are derived from relaxed structures. Neural\nnetwork-based potentials (NNPs) can expedite the process by providing relaxed\nstructures from the initially generated ones. Nevertheless, acquiring data to\ntrain NNPs for this purpose can be extremely challenging as it needs to\nencompass previously unknown structures. This study utilized extended ensemble\nmolecular dynamics (MD) to secure a broad range of liquid- and solid-phase\nconfigurations in one of the metallic systems, nickel. Then, we could\nsignificantly reduce them through active learning without losing much accuracy.\nWe found that the NNP trained from the distilled data could predict different\nenergy-minimized closed-pack crystal structures even though those structures\nwere not explicitly part of the initial data. Furthermore, the data can be\ntranslated to other metallic systems (aluminum and niobium), without repeating\nthe sampling and distillation processes. Our approach to data acquisition and\ndistillation has demonstrated the potential to expedite NNP development and\nenhance materials design and discovery by integrating generative models.",

In this work, we leverage\nthis flexibility to react to consumption requests related to maximizing\nself-consumption and reducing peak loads. We present a general characterization\nof consumption flexibility in the form of flexibility envelopes and discuss a\ndata-driven battery model formulation for modeling individual buildings. These\nmodels are used to predict the available consumption flexibility while\nincorporating a description of uncertainty and being risk-aware with a\npre-defined risk level. A Mixed-integer Linear Program (MILP) is formulated to\nschedule the activation of the buildings in order to best respond to an\nexternal consumption request. An aggregated consumption request is dispatched\nto the active individual buildings by an algorithm, based on the previously\ndetermined schedule. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by\ncoordinating up to 500 simulated buildings using the Energym Python library and\nobserving about 1.5 times peak power reduction in comparison with a baseline\napproach while maintaining comfort more robustly. We demonstrate the\nscalability of the approach, with solving times being approximately linear in\nthe number of considered assets in the scheduling problem.",

Arteries appear at many scales and\nlevels of tortuosity, and determining their exact orientation is challenging.\nRecent works have used 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this\npurpose, but CNNs are sensitive to varying vessel sizes and orientations. We\npresent SIRE: a scale-invariant, rotation-equivariant estimator for local\nvessel orientation. SIRE is modular and can generalise due to symmetry\npreservation.\n  SIRE consists of a gauge equivariant mesh CNN (GEM-CNN) operating on multiple\nnested spherical meshes with different sizes in parallel. The features on each\nmesh are a projection of image intensities within the corresponding sphere.\nThese features are intrinsic to the sphere and, in combination with the\nGEM-CNN, lead to SO(3)-equivariance. Approximate scale invariance is achieved\nby weight sharing and use of a symmetric maximum function to combine\nmulti-scale predictions. Hence, SIRE can be trained with arbitrarily oriented\nvessels with varying radii to generalise to vessels with a wide range of\ncalibres and tortuosity.\n  We demonstrate the efficacy of SIRE using three datasets containing vessels\nof varying scales: the vascular model repository (VMR), the ASOCA coronary\nartery set, and a set of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). We embed SIRE in a\ncenterline tracker which accurately tracks AAAs, regardless of the data SIRE is\ntrained with. Moreover, SIRE can be used to track coronary arteries, even when\ntrained only with AAAs.\n  In conclusion, by incorporating SO(3) and scale symmetries, SIRE can\ndetermine the orientations of vessels outside of the training domain, forming a\nrobust and data-efficient solution to geometric analysis of blood vessels in 3D\nmedical images.",

P1 centers serve as a polarization\nsource for DNP quantum sensing and play a significant role in the relaxation of\nNV centers. Additionally, the distribution of NV centers correlates with the\ndistribution of P1 centers, as NV centers are formed through the conversion of\nP1 centers. We utilized dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and pulsed electron\nparamagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques that revealed strong clustering of a\nsignificant population of P1 centers that exhibit exchange coupling and produce\nasymmetric lineshapes. The $^{13}$C DNP frequency profile at high magnetic\nfield revealed a pattern that requires an asymmetric EPR lineshape of the P1\nclusters with electron-electron (e-e) coupling strengths exceeding the $^{13}$C\nnuclear Larmor frequency. EPR and DNP characterization at high magnetic fields\nwas necessary to resolve energy contributions from different e-e couplings. We\nemployed a two-frequency pump-probe pulsed Electron Double Resonance (ELDOR)\ntechnique to show crosstalk between the isolated and clustered P1 centers. This\nfinding implies that the clustered P1 centers affect all P1 populations. Direct\nobservation of clustered P1 centers and their asymmetric lineshape is a novel\nand crucial insight into understanding magnetic noise sources for quantum\ninformation applications of diamonds and for designing diamond-based polarizing\nagents with optimized DNP efficiency for $^{13}$C and other nuclear spins of\nanalytes.

In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution\nof Population III star clusters, including models with a primordial binary\nfraction of $f_{\\rm b}=0$ and 1, using the $N$-body simulation code\n\\textsc{petar}. We comprehensively examine the phenomenon of hierarchical\ntriple black holes in the clusters, specifically focusing on the merging of\ntheir inner binary black holes (BBHs), with post-Newtonian correction, by using\nthe \\textsc{tsunami} code. Our findings suggest a high likelihood of the inner\nBBHs containing IMBHs with masses on the order of $\\mathcal{O}(100)M_{\\odot}$,\nand as a result, their merger rate could be up to $0.1{\\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\\rm\nyr}^{-3}$. In the model with $f_{\\rm b}=0$, the evolution of these merging\ninner BBHs is predominantly driven by their gravitational wave radiation at an\nearly time, but their evolutionary dynamics are dominated by the interaction\nbetween them and tertiary BHs in the case with $f_{\\rm b}=1$. The orbital\neccentricities of some merging inner BBHs oscillate over time periodically,\nknown as the Kozai-Lidov oscillation, due to dynamical perturbations.\nFurthermore, the merging inner BBHs tend to have highly eccentric orbits at low\nfrequency range, some of them with low redshift would be detected by\nLISA/TianQin. In the higher frequency range, the merging inner BBHs across a\nwider redshift range would be detected by DECIGO/ET/CE/LIGO/KAGRA.",

            "summary": "Recent BESIII data on radiative $J/\\psi$ decays from $\\sim 10^{10}$ $J/\\psi$\nsamples should significantly advance our understanding of the controversial\nnature of $\\eta(1405/1475)$. This motivates us to develop a three-body unitary\ncoupled-channel model for radiative $J/\\psi$ decays to three-meson final states\nof any partial wave ($J^{PC}$). Basic building blocks of the model are bare\nresonance states such as $\\eta(1405/1475)$ and $f_1(1420)$, and $\\pi K$,\n$K\\bar{K}$, and $\\pi\\eta$ two-body interactions that generate resonances such\nas $K^*(892)$, $K^*_0(700)$, and $a_0(980)$. This model reasonably fits\n$K_SK_S\\pi^0$ Dalitz plot pseudo data generated from the BESIII's\n$J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ amplitude for $J/\\psi\\to\\gamma K_SK_S\\pi^0$. The experimental\nbranching ratios of $\\eta(1405/1475)\\to\\eta\\pi\\pi$ and\n$\\eta(1405/1475)\\to\\gamma\\rho$ relative to that of $\\eta(1405/1475)\\to\nK\\bar{K}\\pi$ are simultaneously fitted. Our $0^{-+}$ amplitude is analytically\ncontinued to find three poles, two of which correspond to $\\eta(1405)$ on\ndifferent Riemann sheet of the $K^*\\bar{K}$ channel, and the third one for\n$\\eta(1475)$. This is the first pole determination of $\\eta(1405/1475)$ and,\nfurthermore, the first-ever pole determination from analyzing experimental\nDalitz plot distributions with a manifestly three-body unitary coupled-channel\nframework. Process-dependent $\\eta\\pi\\pi$, $\\gamma\\pi^+\\pi^-$, and $\\pi\\pi\\pi$\nlineshapes of $J/\\psi\\to\\gamma(0^{-+})\\to \\gamma(\\eta\\pi\\pi)$,\n$\\gamma(\\gamma\\rho)$, and $\\gamma(\\pi\\pi\\pi)$ are predicted, and are in\nreasonable agreement with data. A triangle singularity is shown to play a\ncrucial role to cause the large isospin violation of\n$J/\\psi\\to\\gamma(\\pi\\pi\\pi)$.",

The scope of this paper is to reveal the structure of the\nproblem, rather than giving a quantitative solution. We identify three\nimportant steps that can lead us to the discovery. The steps are the formation,\nthe orbital dynamics and long-term stability, and the observability of a given\nexomoon in a given system. This way, the question will be closely related to\nquestions of star formation, planet formation, 5 possible pathways of moon\nformation; long-term dynamics of evolved planet systems involving stellar and\nplanetary rotation and internal structure; and the proper evaluation of the\nobserved data, taken the correlated noise of stellar and instrumental origin\nand the sampling function also into account.

Combining the Coulomb gas method\nwith numerical simulations using a matrix variant of the Wang-Landau algorithm,\nwe found that, in the limit of $N\\to \\infty$, the rate function of\n$\\mathcal{P}(A,m)$ exhibits phase transitions of different characters. The\nphase diagram of the system on the $(A,m)$ plane is surprisingly rich, as it\nincludes three regions: (i) a region with a single-interval support of the\noptimal spectrum of eigenvalues, (ii) a region emerging for $m<2$ where the\noptimal spectrum splits into two separate intervals, and (iii) a region\nemerging for $m>2$ where the maximum or minimum eigenvalue ``evaporates\" from\nthe rest of eigenvalues and dominates the statistics of $A$. The phase\ntransition between regions (i) and (iii) is of second order. Analytical\narguments and numerical simulations strongly suggest that the phase transition\nbetween regions (i) and (ii) is of (in general) fractional order $p=1+1/|m-1|$,\nwhere $0<m<2$. The transition becomes of infinite order in the special case of\n$m=1$, where we provide a more complete analytical and numerical description.\nRemarkably, the transition between regions (i) and (ii) for $m\\leq 1$ and the\ntransition between regions (i) and (iii) for $m>2$ occur at the ground state of\nthe Coulomb gas which corresponds to the Wigner's semicircular distribution.",

A common scenario involves using a fixed training set\nto train models, with the goal of designing new samples that outperform those\npresent in the training data. A major challenge in this setting is distribution\nshift, where the distributions of training and design samples are different.\nWhile some shift is expected, as the goal is to create better designs, this\nchange can negatively affect model accuracy and subsequently, design quality.\nDespite the widespread nature of this problem, addressing it demands deep\ndomain knowledge and artful application. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nstraightforward method for design practitioners that detects distribution\nshifts. This method trains a binary classifier using knowledge of the unlabeled\ndesign distribution to separate the training data from the design data. The\nclassifier's logit scores are then used as a proxy measure of distribution\nshift. We validate our method in a real-world application by running offline\nMBO and evaluate the effect of distribution shift on design quality. We find\nthat the intensity of the shift in the design distribution varies based on the\nnumber of steps taken by the optimization algorithm, and our simple approach\ncan identify these shifts. This enables users to constrain their search to\nregions where the model's predictions are reliable, thereby increasing the\nquality of designs.",

            "summary": "The objective of this work is to enable manipulation tasks with respect to\nthe 6D pose of a dynamically moving object using a camera mounted on a robot.\nExamples include maintaining a constant relative 6D pose of the robot arm with\nrespect to the object, grasping the dynamically moving object, or\nco-manipulating the object together with a human. Fast and accurate 6D pose\nestimation is crucial to achieve smooth and stable robot control in such\nsituations. The contributions of this work are three fold. First, we propose a\nnew visual perception module that asynchronously combines accurate\nlearning-based 6D object pose localizer and a high-rate model-based 6D pose\ntracker. The outcome is a low-latency accurate and temporally consistent 6D\nobject pose estimation from the input video stream at up to 120 Hz. Second, we\ndevelop a visually guided robot arm controller that combines the new visual\nperception module with a torque-based model predictive control algorithm.\nAsynchronous combination of the visual and robot proprioception signals at\ntheir corresponding frequencies results in stable and robust 6D object pose\nguided robot arm control. Third, we experimentally validate the proposed\napproach on a challenging 6D pose estimation benchmark and demonstrate 6D\nobject pose-guided control with dynamically moving objects on a real 7 DoF\nFranka Emika Panda robot.",

The NSI algorithm allows for the existence of both sparse and non-sparse\nstructures and estimates them simultaneously and accurately. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees that the proposed algorithm converges to the oracle\nsolution and achieves the optimal rate for the upper bound of the $l_2$-norm\nerror.

However, these techniques still\nface limitations when confronted with challenging scenarios, including\nocclusion, diverse appearances, variations in illumination, and overlap. To\ncope with such drawbacks, we present the Spatial Attention-based Distribution\nIntegration Network (SADI-NET) to improve the accuracy of localization in such\nsituations. Our network consists of three efficient models: the receptive\nfortified module (RFM), spatial fusion module (SFM), and distribution learning\nmodule (DLM). Building upon the classic HourglassNet architecture, we replace\nthe basic block with our proposed RFM. The RFM incorporates a dilated residual\nblock and attention mechanism to expand receptive fields while enhancing\nsensitivity to spatial information. In addition, the SFM incorporates\nmulti-scale characteristics by employing both global and local attention\nmechanisms. Furthermore, the DLM, inspired by residual log-likelihood\nestimation (RLE), reconfigures a predicted heatmap using a trainable\ndistribution weight. For the purpose of determining the efficacy of our model,\nwe conducted extensive experiments on the MPII and LSP benchmarks.\nParticularly, our model obtained a remarkable $92.10\\%$ percent accuracy on the\nMPII test dataset, demonstrating significant improvements over existing models\nand establishing state-of-the-art performance.",

In this paper, we emphasize the crucial role of temporal\ncues by integrating them alongside these modalities to address this challenge.\nWe propose a novel approach for bird's eye view semantic grid segmentation,\nthat leverages sequential sensor data to achieve robustness against occlusions.\nOur model extracts information from the sensor readings using attention\noperations and aggregates this information into a lower-dimensional latent\nrepresentation, enabling thus the processing of multi-step inputs at each\nprediction step.

In this work we define a\nstatic triadic closure (STC) model for clustered networks, whereby starting\nfrom an arbitrary fixed backbone network, each triad is closed independently\nwith a given probability. Assuming a locally treelike backbone we derive exact\nexpressions for the expected number of various small, loopy motifs (triangles,\nfour-loops, diamonds and four-cliques) as a function of moments of the backbone\ndegree distribution. In this way we determine how transitivity and its suitably\ndefined generalizations for higher-order motifs depend on the heterogeneity of\nthe original network, revealing the existence of transitions due to the\ninterplay between topologically inequivalent triads in the network.\nFurthermore, under reasonable assumptions for the moments of the backbone\nnetwork, we establish approximate relationships between motif densities, which\nwe test in a large dataset of real-world networks. We find a good agreement,\nindicating that STC is a realistic mechanism for the generation of clustered\nnetworks, while remaining simple enough to be amenable to analytical treatment.",

Since it is\nimpractical to compute the expected risk exactly over all possible hypotheses,\ntwo approximations are commonly used in MBR. First, it integrates over a\nsampled set of hypotheses rather than over all possible hypotheses. Second, it\nestimates the probability of each hypothesis using a Monte Carlo estimator.\nWhile the first approximation is necessary to make it computationally feasible,\nthe second is not essential since we typically have access to the model\nprobability at inference time. We propose Model-Based MBR (MBMBR), a variant of\nMBR that uses the model probability itself as the estimate of the probability\ndistribution instead of the Monte Carlo estimate.

            "summary": "Simulating dynamic physical interactions is a critical challenge across\nmultiple scientific domains, with applications ranging from robotics to\nmaterial science. For mesh-based simulations, Graph Network Simulators (GNSs)\npose an efficient alternative to traditional physics-based simulators. Their\ninherent differentiability and speed make them particularly well-suited for\ninverse design problems. Yet, adapting to new tasks from limited available data\nis an important aspect for real-world applications that current methods\nstruggle with. We frame mesh-based simulation as a meta-learning problem and\nuse a recent Bayesian meta-learning method to improve GNSs adaptability to new\nscenarios by leveraging context data and handling uncertainties. Our approach,\nlatent task-specific graph network simulator, uses non-amortized task posterior\napproximations to sample latent descriptions of unknown system properties.\nAdditionally, we leverage movement primitives for efficient full trajectory\nprediction, effectively addressing the issue of accumulating errors encountered\nby previous auto-regressive methods. We validate the effectiveness of our\napproach through various experiments, performing on par with or better than\nestablished baseline methods. Movement primitives further allow us to\naccommodate various types of context data, as demonstrated through the\nutilization of point clouds during inference. By combining GNSs with\nmeta-learning, we bring them closer to real-world applicability, particularly\nin scenarios with smaller datasets.",

Analytic progress can be made in the concentrated limit\n(when the solvent-to-total-viscosity ratio $\\beta \\rightarrow 0$), illustrating\nthe boundary layer structure of PDI, and allowing the prediction of its\neigenvalues for both plane Couette and channel flow. We draw connections\nbetween PDI and the polymer melt `sharkskin' instability, both of which are\nshort wavelength instabilities localised to the extrudate surface. Inertia is\nshown to have a destabilising effect, reducing the smallest Weissenberg number\n($W$) where PDI exists in a concentrated fluid from $W\\sim 8$ in inertialess\nflows, to $W \\sim 2$ when inertia is significant.",

Our theoretical study is based on\na functional that is built using quantum Monte Carlo results of the bulk phase\nand incorporates finite-range effects. A characteristic feature of these drops\nis the existence of a critical atom number, that is the minimum number of\nparticles to have a many-body bound state. We report results on the critical\natom numbers for different magnetic fields and applying confinement strengths\ntowards a quasi-two-dimensional setup. In the regime where the local density\napproximation is expected to be valid, we find that the critical atom number\ndecreases linearly with the harmonic oscillator length of the confining\npotential. With the largest squeezing explored in our work, we predict stable\ndrops at the level of one thousand atoms. Our functional reduces the critical\nnumbers for any confinement and applied magnetic field with respect to the\nestimations based on the Lee-Huang-Yang model. We observe saturated drops when\nthe number of atoms in the drop is much larger than the critical value, their\ncentral density being higher for the quantum Monte Carlo functional than for\nthe Lee-Huang-Yang one.",

In the DFMM design,\nthis asset was not tradaeble; however, in this work, we explore the\ncharacteristics of this asset, if it were to be made tradeable. Named the\nIntermediating DFMM Asset (IDA), this asset serves as a unit of account in\ncross-chain finance, functioning as an intermediating asset for predictable\nbudgeting, and efficient multichain transfers and settlements. Harnessing its\nrobust liquidity as the key counterpart asset in DFMM, it achieves capital\nefficiency through the strategic repurposing of its asset base, while\nsimultaneously mitigating risk via the dynamic optimisation of its\nmulticollateral foundation. We outline key characteristics of the proposed\nasset, unique risk mitigation aspects enabled by the adopting AMM (DFMM), and\ncontrol levers enabling the protocol's tactical asset and liability management\ntoolkit to harmonise the asset's objectives with its real-world realisation,\nthrough a novel prudential market operation to incentivise productive use of a\nfinite asset and dynamic AMM fee to ensure alignment of behaviours.

            "summary": "Control related data, such as system states and inputs or controller\nspecifications, is often sensitive. Meanwhile, the increasing connectivity of\ncloud-based or networked control results in vast amounts of such data, which\nposes a privacy threat, especially when evaluation on external platforms is\nconsidered. In this context, a cipher based on a random affine transformation\ngained attention, which is supposed to enable privacy-preserving evaluations of\nquadratic programs (QPs) with little computational overhead compared to other\nmethods.\n  This paper deals with the security of such randomly transformed QPs in the\ncontext of model predictive control (MPC). In particular, we show how to\nconstruct attacks against this cipher and thereby underpin concerns regarding\nits security in a practical setting. To this end, we exploit invariants under\nthe transformations and common specifications of MPC-related QPs. Our numerical\nexamples then illustrate that these two ingredients suffice to extract\ninformation from ciphertexts.",

            "summary": "In the reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, the ability to predict receiving\nreward in the near or more distant future means the ability to evaluate the\ncurrent state as more or less close to the target state (labelled by the reward\nsignal). In the present work, we utilize a spiking neural network (SNN) to\npredict time to the next target event (reward - in case of RL). In the context\nof SNNs, events are represented as spikes emitted by network neurons or input\nnodes. It is assumed that target events are indicated by spikes emitted by a\nspecial network input node. Using description of the current state encoded in\nthe form of spikes from the other input nodes, the network should predict\napproximate time of the next target event. This research paper presents a novel\napproach to learning the corresponding predictive model by an SNN consisting of\nleaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. The proposed method leverages specially\ndesigned local synaptic plasticity rules and a novel columnar-layered SNN\narchitecture. Similar to our previous works, this study places a strong\nemphasis on the hardware-friendliness of the proposed models, ensuring their\nefficient implementation on modern and future neuroprocessors. The approach\nproposed was tested on a simple reward prediction task in the context of one of\nthe RL benchmark ATARI games, ping-pong. It was demonstrated that the SNN\ndescribed in this paper gives superior prediction accuracy in comparison with\nprecise machine learning techniques, such as decision tree algorithms and\nconvolutional neural networks.",

Our study revealed presence of the strong dielectric anomaly both in\nthe real and imaginary parts of high-frequency dielectric permittivity for Na\nand K compounds approx. 100 and 26~K, correspondingly, presumably related to\nantiferroelectric ordering. Additionally, much weaker anomalies were observed\nat approx. 5~K indicating possible interplay of magnetic and lattice degrees of\nfreedom. We discuss possible relation between the structure rearrangements\naccompanying dielectric anomalies and a delayed magnetic ordering in the\nnabokoite family compounds.",

            "summary": "The increasing reliance on Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography for\nPulmonary Embolism (PE) diagnosis presents challenges and a pressing need for\nimproved diagnostic solutions. The primary objective of this study is to\nleverage deep learning techniques to enhance the Computer Assisted Diagnosis of\nPE. In this study, we propose a classifier-guided detection approach that\neffectively leverages the classifier's probabilistic inference to direct the\ndetection predictions, marking a novel contribution in the domain of automated\nPE diagnosis. Our end-to-end classification framework introduces an\nAttention-Guided Convolutional Neural Network (AG-CNN) that leverages local\ncontext by utilizing an attention mechanism. This approach emulates the\nattention of a human expert by looking at both global appearances and local\nlesion regions before forming a conclusive decision. The classifier achieves a\nnotable AUROC, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score of 0.927, 0.862, 0.879 and\n0.805 respectively on the FUMPE dataset with Inception-v3 backbone\narchitecture. Moreover, AG-CNN outperforms the baseline DenseNet-121 model,\nachieving an 8.1% AUROC gain. While prior studies have primarily focused on PE\ndetection in main arteries, our utilization of state-of-the-art object\ndetection models and ensembling techniques significantly enhances detection\naccuracy for small embolisms in the peripheral arteries. Finally, our proposed\nclassifier-guided detection approach further refines the detection metrics\ncontributing new state-of-the-art to the community: mAP$_{50}$, sensitivity and\nF1-score of 0.846, 0.901 and 0.779 respectively outperforming the former\nbenchmark with a significant 3.7% improvement in mAP$_{50}$. Our research aims\nto elevate PE patient care by integrating AI solutions into clinical workflows,\nhighlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in medical diagnostics.",

The integration of\ninformation from multi-view mammograms enhances radiologists' confidence and\ndiminishes false-positive rates since they can examine on dual-view of the same\nbreast to cross-reference the existence and location of the lesion. Inspired by\nthis, we present TransReg, a Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system designed to\nexploit the relationship between craniocaudal (CC), and mediolateral oblique\n(MLO) views. The system includes cross-transformer to model the relationship\nbetween the region of interest (RoIs) extracted by siamese Faster RCNN network\nfor mass detection problems. Our work is the first time cross-transformer has\nbeen integrated into an object detection framework to model the relation\nbetween ipsilateral views. Our experimental evaluation on DDSM and VinDr-Mammo\ndatasets shows that our TransReg, equipped with SwinT as a feature extractor\nachieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, at the false positive rate\nper image at 0.5, TransReg using SwinT gets a recall at 83.3% for DDSM dataset\nand 79.7% for VinDr-Mammo dataset. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis to demonstrate that cross-transformer can function as an\nauto-registration module, aligning the masses in dual-view and utilizing this\ninformation to inform final predictions.

This is\nmainly due to the lack of large-scale audio-visual ODV datasets and\ncorresponding analysis. Thus, in this paper, we first establish the largest\naudio-visual saliency dataset for omnidirectional videos (AVS-ODV), which\ncomprises the omnidirectional videos, audios, and corresponding captured\neye-tracking data for three video sound modalities including mute, mono, and\nambisonics. Then we analyze the visual attention behavior of the observers\nunder various omnidirectional audio modalities and visual scenes based on the\nAVS-ODV dataset. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several\nstate-of-the-art saliency prediction models on the AVS-ODV dataset and\nconstruct a new benchmark.

We\npropose to decouple the two modalities by mixture of weak and strong experts\n(Mowst), where the weak expert is a light-weight Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP),\nand the strong expert is an off-the-shelf Graph Neural Network (GNN). To adapt\nthe experts' collaboration to different target nodes, we propose a \"confidence\"\nmechanism based on the dispersion of the weak expert's prediction logits. The\nstrong expert is conditionally activated when either the node's classification\nrelies on neighborhood information, or the weak expert has low model quality.\nWe reveal interesting training dynamics by analyzing the influence of the\nconfidence function on loss: our training algorithm encourages the\nspecialization of each expert by effectively generating soft splitting of the\ngraph. In addition, our \"confidence\" design imposes a desirable bias toward the\nstrong expert to benefit from GNN's better generalization capability. Mowst is\neasy to optimize and achieves strong expressive power, with a computation cost\ncomparable to a single GNN. Empirically, Mowst shows significant accuracy\nimprovement on 6 standard node classification benchmarks (including both\nhomophilous and heterophilous graphs).",

Domain-wall skyrmions are skyrmions trapped\ninside a domain wall, they are present in the ferromagnetic (FM) phase of a\nchiral magnet with an out-of-plane easy-axis anisotropy. In this paper, we\nexplore the stability of domain-wall skyrmions in the FM phase and in a chiral\nsoliton lattice (CSL) or spiral phase, which is a periodic array of domain\nwalls and anti-domain walls arranged in an alternating manner. In the FM phase,\nthe worldline of a domain-wall skyrmion is bent to form a cusp at the position\nof the skyrmion. We describe such a cusp using both an analytic method and\nnumerical solutions, and find a good agreement between them for small DM\ninteractions. We show that the cusp grows toward the phase boundary with the\nCSL, and eventually diverges at the boundary. Second, if we put one skyrmion\ntrapped inside a domain wall in a CSL, it decays into a pair of merons by a\nreconnection of the domain wall and its adjacent anti-domain wall. Third, if we\nput skyrmions and anti-skyrmions alternately in domain walls and anti-domain\nwalls, respectively such a chain is stable.",

However, video-based fire detection models heavily rely on\nlabeled data, and the process of data labeling is particularly costly and\ntime-consuming, especially when dealing with videos. Considering the limited\nquantity of labeled video data, we propose a semi-supervised fire detection\nmodel called FireMatch, which is based on consistency regularization and\nadversarial distribution alignment. Specifically, we first combine consistency\nregularization with pseudo-label. For unlabeled data, we design video data\naugmentation to obtain corresponding weakly augmented and strongly augmented\nsamples. The proposed model predicts weakly augmented samples and retains\npseudo-label above a threshold, while training on strongly augmented samples to\npredict these pseudo-labels for learning more robust feature representations.\nSecondly, we generate video cross-set augmented samples by adversarial\ndistribution alignment to expand the training data and alleviate the decline in\nclassification performance caused by insufficient labeled data. Finally, we\nintroduce a fairness loss to help the model produce diverse predictions for\ninput samples, thereby addressing the issue of high confidence with the\nnon-fire class in fire classification scenarios. The FireMatch achieved an\naccuracy of 76.92% and 91.81% on two real-world fire datasets, respectively.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the\ncurrent state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification methods.",

            "summary": "A fundamental goal of modern-day astrophysics is to understand the connection\nbetween supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and galaxy evolution. Merging\ngalaxies offer one of the most dramatic channels for galaxy evolution known,\ncapable of driving inflows of gas into galactic nuclei, potentially fueling\nboth star formation and central SMBH activity. Dual active galactic nuclei\n(dual AGNs) in late-stage mergers with nuclear pair separations $<10$ kpc are\nthus ideal candidates to study SMBH growth along the merger sequence since they\ncoincide with the most transformative period for galaxies. However, dual AGNs\ncan be extremely difficult to confirm and study. Hard X-ray ($>10$ keV) studies\noffer a relatively contamination-free tool for probing the dense obscuring\nenvironments predicted to surround the majority of dual AGN in late-stage\nmergers. To date, only a handful of the brightest and closest systems have been\nstudied at these energies due to the demanding instrumental requirements\ninvolved. We demonstrate the unique capabilities of HEX-P to spatially resolve\nthe soft and - for the first time - hard X-ray counterparts of\nclosely-separated ($\\sim2''-5''$) dual AGNs in the local Universe. By\nincorporating state-of-the-art physical torus models, we reproduce realistic\nbroadband X-ray spectra expected for deeply embedded accreting SMBHs. Hard\nX-ray spatially resolved observations of dual AGNs - accessible only to HEX-P -\nwill hence transform our understanding of dual AGN in the nearby Universe.",

            "summary": "CNNs and Self attention have achieved great success in multimedia\napplications for dynamic association learning of self-attention and convolution\nin image restoration. However, CNNs have at least two shortcomings: 1) limited\nreceptive field; 2) static weight of sliding window at inference, unable to\ncope with the content diversity.In view of the advantages and disadvantages of\nCNNs and Self attention, this paper proposes an association learning method to\nutilize the advantages and suppress their shortcomings, so as to achieve\nhigh-quality and efficient inpainting. We regard rain distribution reflects the\ndegradation location and degree, in addition to the rain distribution\nprediction. Thus, we propose to refine background textures with the predicted\ndegradation prior in an association learning manner. As a result, we accomplish\nimage deraining by associating rain streak removal and background recovery,\nwhere an image deraining network and a background recovery network are designed\nfor two subtasks. The key part of association learning is a novel multi-input\nattention module. It generates the degradation prior and produces the\ndegradation mask according to the predicted rainy distribution. Benefited from\nthe global correlation calculation of SA, MAM can extract the informative\ncomplementary components from the rainy input with the degradation mask, and\nthen help accurate texture restoration. Meanwhile, SA tends to aggregate\nfeature maps with self-attention importance, but convolution diversifies them\nto focus on the local textures. A hybrid fusion network involves one residual\nTransformer branch and one encoder-decoder branch. The former takes a few\nlearnable tokens as input and stacks multi-head attention and feed-forward\nnetworks to encode global features of the image. The latter, conversely,\nleverages the multi-scale encoder-decoder to represent contexture knowledge.",

            "summary": "There has been considerable progress in implicit neural representation to\nupscale an image to any arbitrary resolution. However, existing methods are\nbased on defining a function to predict the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) value\nfrom just four specific loci. Relying on just four loci is insufficient as it\nleads to losing fine details from the neighboring region(s). We show that by\ntaking into account the semi-local region leads to an improvement in\nperformance. In this paper, we propose applying a new technique called\nOverlapping Windows on Semi-Local Region (OW-SLR) to an image to obtain any\narbitrary resolution by taking the coordinates of the semi-local region around\na point in the latent space. This extracted detail is used to predict the RGB\nvalue of a point. We illustrate the technique by applying the algorithm to the\nOptical Coherence Tomography-Angiography (OCT-A) images and show that it can\nupscale them to random resolution. This technique outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art methods when applied to the OCT500 dataset. OW-SLR provides\nbetter results for classifying healthy and diseased retinal images such as\ndiabetic retinopathy and normals from the given set of OCT-A images.

By\nconstructing adversarial samples under the guidance of saliency map, SCAAT\neffectively eliminates most noise and makes saliency maps sparser and more\nfaithful without any modification to the model architecture. We apply SCAAT to\nmultiple DNNs and evaluate the quality of the generated saliency maps on\nvarious natural and pathological image datasets.

The solution is encoded as the set of tight\nconstraints corresponding to the constrained minimum-cost trajectory and the\noptimal final time of landing. By leveraging the attention mechanism of\ntransformer neural networks, large sequences of time series data can be\naccurately predicted when given only the spacecraft state and landing site\nparameters. When applied to the real problem of Mars powered descent guidance,\nT-PDG reduces the time for computing the 3 degree of freedom fuel-optimal\ntrajectory, when compared to lossless convexification, from an order of 1-8\nseconds to less than 500 milliseconds.

While the geometry of the Wasserstein\nmetric is quite well understood, and has led to important advances, very little\nis known about the geometry and metric properties of the sliced Wasserstein\n(SW) metric. Here we show that when the measures considered are ``nice'' (e.g.\nwithin a positive multiples of the Lebesgue measure) then the SW metric is\ncomparable to the (homogeneous) negative Sobolev norm $\\dot H^{-(d+1)/2}$. On\nthe other hand when the measures considered close in the infinity\ntransportation metric to a discrete measure, then the SW metric between them is\nclose to a multiple of the Wasserstein metric. We characterize the tangent\nspace of the SW space, show that the speed of curves in the space can be\ndescribed by a quadratic form, but that the SW space is not a length space. We\nestablish a number of properties of the metric given by the minimal length of\ncurves between measures -- the SW length.

            "summary": "Automatic polyp segmentation models play a pivotal role in the clinical\ndiagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. In previous studies, most methods\nrelied on fully supervised approaches, necessitating pixel-level annotations\nfor model training. However, the creation of pixel-level annotations is both\nexpensive and time-consuming, impeding the development of model generalization.\nIn response to this challenge, we introduce ScribblePolyp, a novel\nscribble-supervised polyp segmentation framework. Unlike fully-supervised\nmodels, ScribblePolyp only requires the annotation of two lines (scribble\nlabels) for each image, significantly reducing the labeling cost. Despite the\ncoarse nature of scribble labels, which leave a substantial portion of pixels\nunlabeled, we propose a two-branch consistency alignment approach to provide\nsupervision for these unlabeled pixels. The first branch employs transformation\nconsistency alignment to narrow the gap between predictions under different\ntransformations of the same input image. The second branch leverages affinity\npropagation to refine predictions into a soft version, extending additional\nsupervision to unlabeled pixels. In summary, ScribblePolyp is an efficient\nmodel that does not rely on teacher models or moving average pseudo labels\nduring training. Extensive experiments on the SUN-SEG dataset underscore the\neffectiveness of ScribblePolyp, achieving a Dice score of 0.8155, with the\npotential for a 1.8% improvement in the Dice score through a straightforward\nself-training strategy.",

            "summary": "For approximate inference in high-dimensional generalized linear models\n(GLMs), the performance of an estimator may significantly degrade when mismatch\nexists between the postulated model and the ground truth. In mismatched GLMs\nwith rotation-invariant measurement matrices, Kabashima et al. proved vector\napproximate message passing (VAMP) computes exactly the optimal estimator if\nthe replica symmetry (RS) ansatz is valid, but it becomes inappropriate if RS\nbreaking (RSB) appears. Although the one-step RSB (1RSB) saddle point equations\nwere given for the optimal estimator, the question remains: how to achieve the\n1RSB prediction? This paper answers the question by proposing a new algorithm,\nvector approximate survey propagation (VASP). VASP derives from a reformulation\nof Kabashima's extremum conditions, which later links the theoretical equations\nto survey propagation in vector form and finally the algorithm. VASP has a\ncomplexity as low as VAMP, while embracing VAMP as a special case. The SE\nderived for VASP can capture precisely the per-iteration behavior of the\nsimulated algorithm, and the SE's fixed point equations perfectly match\nKabashima's 1RSB prediction, which indicates VASP can achieve the optimal\nperformance even in a model-mismatched setting with 1RSB.

            "summary": "Over the past decade, climate change has become an increasing problem with\none of the major contributing factors being carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions;\nalmost 51% of total US carbon emissions are from factories. Current materials\nused in CO2 capture are lacking either in efficiency, sustainability, or cost.\n  Electrocatalysis of CO2 is a new approach where CO2 can be reduced and the\ncomponents used industrially as fuel, saving transportation costs, creating\nfinancial incentives. Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are crystals made of\norgano-metals that adsorb, filter, and electrocatalyze CO2. The current\navailable MOFs for capture & electrocatalysis are expensive to manufacture and\ninefficient at capture. The goal therefore is to computationally design a MOF\nthat can adsorb CO2 and catalyze carbon monoxide & oxygen with low cost.\n  A novel active transfer learning neural network was developed, utilizing\ntransfer learning due to limited available data on 15 MOFs. Using the Cambridge\nStructural Database with 10,000 MOFs, the model used incremental mutations to\nfit a trained fitness hyper-heuristic function. Eventually, a Selenium MOF\n(C18MgO25Se11Sn20Zn5) was converged on. Through analysis of predictions &\nliterature, the converged MOF was shown to be more effective & more\nsynthetically accessible than existing MOFs, showing the model had an\nunderstanding of effective electrocatalytic structures in the material space.\nThis novel network can be implemented for other gas separations and catalysis\napplications that have limited training accessible datasets.",

As such, it\nis characterized by long-tail labels, i.e., most labels have very few positive\ninstances. With standard performance measures such as precision@k, a classifier\ncan ignore tail labels and still report good performance. However, it is often\nargued that correct predictions in the tail are more interesting or rewarding,\nbut the community has not yet settled on a metric capturing this intuitive\nconcept. The existing propensity-scored metrics fall short on this goal by\nconfounding the problems of long-tail and missing labels. In this paper, we\nanalyze generalized metrics budgeted \"at k\" as an alternative solution. To\ntackle the challenging problem of optimizing these metrics, we formulate it in\nthe expected test utility (ETU) framework, which aims at optimizing the\nexpected performance on a fixed test set.

However, ultra-sparse\ntraining data, often due to vast vocabularies and low-frequency words, hinders\nthe analysis accuracy. Multi-labeling and Co-occurrences of symptoms may also\nblur the boundaries in distinguishing similar/co-related disorders. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel semantic feature preprocessing technique with\na three-folded structure: 1) mitigating the feature sparsity with a weak\nclassifier, 2) adaptive feature dimension with modulus loops, and 3)\ndeep-mining and extending features among the contexts. With enhanced semantic\nfeatures, we train a machine learning model to predict and classify mental\ndisorders. We utilize the Reddit Mental Health Dataset 2022 to examine\nconditions such as Anxiety, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and\nBipolar-Disorder (BD) and present solutions to the data sparsity challenge,\nhighlighted by 99.81% non-zero elements. After applying our preprocessing\ntechnique, the feature sparsity decreases to 85.4%. Overall, our methods, when\ncompared to seven benchmark models, demonstrate significant performance\nimprovements: 8.0% in accuracy, 0.069 in precision, 0.093 in recall, 0.102 in\nF1 score, and 0.059 in AUC.

A thorough characterisation of the effects of a flight stream on the\nturbulent field was recently performed by Maia et al.

The Kelvin-Helmholtz, Orr and lift-up mecahnisms were\nall shown to be weakened by the flight stream. Here we expand upon that study\nand model the changes in the dynamics of jets in flight using global resolvent\nanalysis. The resolvent model is found to correctly capture the main effects of\nthe flight stream on the dynamics of coherent structures, which are educed from\na large-eddy simulation database using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition\n(SPOD). Three modifications of note are: the damping of low-frequency\nstreaky/Orr structures that carry most of the fluctuation energy; a degradation\nof the low-rank behaviour of the jet in frequencies where modal instability\nmechanisms are dominant; and a rank decrease at very low Strouhal numbers. The\nlatter effect is underpinned by larger gain separations predicted by the\nresolvent analysis, due to a reduction in the wavelength of associated flow\nstructures. This leads to a clearer relative dominance of streaky structures\ngenerated by the lift-up mechanism, despite the fact that the lift-up mechanism\nhas been weakened with respect to the static jet.",

The boundary of each anomaly\nis defined implicitly as the 0-level surface of a scalar field (called the\nlevel-set function), so that by modifying this field the shape and location of\nthe anomaly are varied. The gravitational potential associated with a density\ndistribution is here computed via a line-integral polyhedron method, yielding\nthe coefficients of its spherical harmonics expansion. The density distribution\nis then adjusted via an iterative least-squares approach with Tikhonov\nregularization, estimating at every iteration corrections to the level-set\nfunction, the density contrast of each anomaly, and the background density, in\norder to minimize the residuals between the predicted gravity coefficients and\nthose measured. Given the non-convexity of the problem and the lack of prior\nknowledge assumed (save for the shape of the body), the estimation process is\nrepeated for several random initial distributions, and the resulting solutions\nare clustered based on global properties independent of the input measurements.\nThis provides families of candidate interior models in agreement with the data,\nand the spread of the local density values across each family is used to assess\nthe uncertainties associated with the estimated distributions.",

Herein, two low-range compact vehicles were\nchosen and compared: one powered by combustion of gasoline, and the other by\nelectric energy stored in batteries.

The developed\nmodel may help on the adequate selection of a new vehicle, according to the\nuser's needs. A good choice depends strongly on the usage and traffic\nconditions, the electric vehicle being suitable for large weekly travel\ndistances and heavy traffic, whereas the gasoline vehicles is preferred for\nshort distances and light traffic. The expenses of the vehicles are compared\nthrough time, with different scenarios envisaged according to the user's\nresolution to keep the vehicle for the entire lifespan or to sell it quickly.",

Motivated by this, herein, we\ndevelop a fundamental understanding of such complex materials using the example\nof paramagnetic YNiO3, which is experimentally known to exhibit\nmetal-to-insulator phase transition. We show that this material has a\ntemperature-dependent distribution of local structural and spin motifs. Thus,\nwhile at low temperatures, YNiO3 has distinct structural disproportionation\nwith the formation of large and small octahedra, as the temperature increases,\nthis disproportionation is suppressed. We also explain the paramagnetic\nmonoclinic to paramagnetic orthorhombic phase transition within the double-well\nto single-well energy profile, predicting the variation of the corresponding\nenergy profile as a function of octahedral size distribution. In this way, we\ndemonstrate a fundamental understanding of structural phase transitions in\nquantum materials, giving insight into how it can be used for different\napplications and what minimum level of theory is needed to describe such types\nof complex materials correctly.",

Traditionally,\nstorage and managing of the logged data are generally kept as a part of one\nentity together with the main logic components. In systems that implement\nnetwork connections, this activity is usually handled over a remote device.\nHowever, enabling remote connection is still considered a limiting factor for\nmany embedded devices due to the demanding production cost. A significant\nchallenge is presented to vendors who need to decide how the data will be\nextracted and handled for an embedded platform during the design concept phase.\nIt is generally desirable that logging memory modules are able to be addressed\nas separate units. These devices need to be appropriately secured and\nverifiable on a different system since data compromise can lead to enormous\nprivacy and even financial losses. In this paper, we present two patterns.\nFirst, a pattern that allows flexible logging operation design in terms of\nmodule and interface responsibility separation. Second, a pattern for the\ndesign of secure logging processes during the utilization of constrained\nembedded devices. The introduced patterns fulfil the following conditions: (i)\nflexibility, design is independent of the chip vendors making the logging\nmemory modules easily replaceable, (ii) self-sufficiency, every logging\ncontroller is maintained as a separate entity in a decentralized topology,\n(iii) security, through providing authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity\nby means of using a dedicated security module.",

The developed coupling model is general and\napplicable to arrays with arbitrary distribution of any type of antennas with\narbitrary structure, physical size and radiation power pattern. In particular,\nit reduces to a neat analytical expression for arbitrarily deployed isotropic\nantenna arrays. We then discuss the beamforming design for holographic\nsurfaces, and in particular provide analytical beamforming characterizations\nfor arrays with two arbitrarily spaced isotropic antennas. Numerical results\nindicate that, by accounting for the mutual coupling effect between antennas,\nthe array densification by packing more antennas in a given surface aperture\ncan significantly enhance both the beamforming gain and spatial resolution of\nthe system. The beamforming gain enhancement and beamwidth reduction can be\nseveral dBs higher than, and more than half of, those achieved by the\nconventional half-wavelength spaced antenna arrays in the same surface\naperture. The gains of densification become saturated when the antenna spacing\nis below a critical value, and the saturated gain reduces as the surface\naperture increases.",

            "summary": "Pretrained language models (PLMs) have made significant strides in various\nnatural language processing tasks. However, the lack of interpretability due to\ntheir ``black-box'' nature poses challenges for responsible implementation.\nAlthough previous studies have attempted to improve interpretability by using,\ne.g., attention weights in self-attention layers, these weights often lack\nclarity, readability, and intuitiveness. In this research, we propose a novel\napproach to interpreting PLMs by employing high-level, meaningful concepts that\nare easily understandable for humans. For example, we learn the concept of\n``Food'' and investigate how it influences the prediction of a model's\nsentiment towards a restaurant review. We introduce C$^3$M, which combines\nhuman-annotated and machine-generated concepts to extract hidden neurons\ndesigned to encapsulate semantically meaningful and task-specific concepts.\nThrough empirical evaluations on real-world datasets, we manifest that our\napproach offers valuable insights to interpret PLM behavior, helps diagnose\nmodel failures, and enhances model robustness amidst noisy concept labels.",

In this model, agents of three species S, I, and R on a lattice react\nas follows: $S+I\\rightarrow I+I$ with probability $\\lambda$, $I\\rightarrow R$\nafter infection time $\\tau_I$ and $R\\rightarrow I$ after recovery time\n$\\tau_R$. Depending on the value of the parameter $\\tau_R$, the SIRS model can\nbe reduced to the following two well-known special cases. On the one hand, when\n$\\tau_R \\rightarrow 0$, the SIRS model reduces to the SIS model. On the other\nhand, when $\\tau_R \\rightarrow \\infty$ the model reduces to SIR model. It is\nknown that, whereas the SIS model belongs to the DP universality class, the SIR\nmodel belongs to the DyP universality class. We can deduce from the model\ndynamics that, SIRS will behave as an SIS model for any finite values of\n$\\tau_R$. SIRS will behave as SIR only when $\\tau_R=\\infty$. Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations we show that as far as the $\\tau_R$ is finite the SIRS belongs to\nthe DP university class. We also study the phase diagram and analyze the\nscaling behavior of this model along the critical line. By numerical simulation\nand analytical argument, we find that the crossover from DyP to DP is described\nby the crossover exponent $1/\\phi=0.67(2)$.",

High-energy, self-collimated structures of\nfinal-state particles also created in HIC, called jets, probe the QGP, piercing\nthrough it on their way to the particle detector. Quantum field theory at\nfinite temperature or thermal field theory, is then an extremely powerful tool,\ncapable of analytically quantifying how such a high-energy object interacts\nwith a weakly coupled thermal bath. In this thesis, we work towards the\ncomputation of corrections to two quantities, which dictate how jets are\nquenched by the QGP. The first being the transverse momentum broadening\ncoefficient, which describes how the jet diffuses in transverse momentum space\nthrough its interaction with the medium. We focus on the computation of\nlogarithmically enhanced corrections, carefully showing how the thermal scale\naffects the logarithmic phase space. The second is the asymptotic mass, which\ncan be thought of as a shift in the jet dispersion relation as it undergoes\nforward scattering with the medium. We complete a matching calculation, which\nrids the mass' classical corrections of any unphysical divergences, while also\nbeginning the completion of its full two-loop, quantum corrections.",

It is already known that a\nstrong dichotomy exists in the gas content and star formation properties of\nfield dwarf galaxies versus satellite dwarfs of larger galaxies. In this work,\nwe study the more subtle differences that may be detectable in galaxies as a\nfunction of distance from a massive galaxy, such as the Milky Way. We compare\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of dwarf galaxies formed in a Local\nVolume-like environment (several Mpc away from a massive galaxy) to those\nformed nearer to Milky Way-mass halos. We find that the impact of environment\non dwarf galaxies extends even beyond the immediate region surrounding Milky\nWay-mass halos. Even before being accreted as satellites, dwarf galaxies near a\nMilky Way-mass halo tend to have higher stellar masses for their halo mass than\nmore isolated galaxies. Dwarf galaxies in high-density environments also tend\nto grow faster and form their stars earlier. We show observational predictions\nthat demonstrate how these trends manifest in lower quenching rates, higher HI\nfractions, and bluer colors for more isolated dwarf galaxies.",

Here, we study the connections between the trainability and\nexpressibility of quantum tangent kernel models. In particular, for global loss\nfunctions, we rigorously prove that high expressibility of both the global and\nlocal quantum encodings can lead to exponential concentration of quantum\ntangent kernel values to zero. Whereas for local loss functions, such issue of\nexponential concentration persists owing to the high expressibility, but can be\npartially mitigated.

In this work, we provide a test and investigation of the\nCCMD model by studying the colour and luminosity distribution of galaxies in\ngalaxy groups. An apples-to-apples comparison of group galaxies is achieved by\napplying the same galaxy group finder to identify groups from the CCMD galaxy\nmocks and from the SDSS data, avoiding any systematic effect of group finding\nand mass assignment on the comparison. We find an overall nice agreement in the\nconditional luminosity function (CLF), the conditional colour function (CCF),\nand the CCMD of galaxies in galaxy groups inferred from CCMD mock and SDSS\ndata. We also discuss the subtle differences revealed by the comparison. In\naddition, using two external catalogues constructed to only include central\ngalaxies with halo mass measured through weak lensing, we find that their\ncolour-magnitude distribution shows two distinct and orthogonal components, in\nline with the prediction of the CCMD model. Our results suggest that the CCMD\nmodel provides a good description of halo mass dependent galaxy colour and\nluminosity distribution.

            "summary": "Recent experiments observed fractional Chern insulators (FCI) in twisted\nbilayer MoTe$_2$ at zero magnetic field, yet even the single-particle model of\nthis material is controversial, leading to unreliable predictions of the\nexperimental phase diagram as discussed in [Yu et al., 2023]. In this light, we\nrevisit the single-particle model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. Utilizing\nlarge-scale density functional theory, we calculate the band structure of\ntwisted AA-stacked bilayer MoTe$_2$ at various twist angles relevant to\nexperiment. We find that a band inversion occurs near $4.41^\\circ$ between the\nsecond and third bands. Our ab initio band structure is in qualitative\nagreement with [Wang et al., 2023], but shows important differences in the\nremote bands and in the $\\Gamma$ valley. We incorporate two higher harmonic\nterms into the continuum model to capture the highest 3 valence bands per\nvalley. We confirm that the two highest valence bands per valley have opposite\nChern numbers with $|C|=1$ for small angles, and also use our model to predict\na variety of Chern states in the remote bands accessible by displacement field.\nFinally, we perform DFT calculations and build models for the AB stacking\nconfiguration. Our work serves as a foundation for accurate determination of\nthe correlated phases in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$.",

However, the physics of how\nwhite dwarfs (WDs) explode and lead to SNe Ia is still poorly understood. The\ninitiation of the detonation front which rapidly disrupts the WD is a crucial\nelement of the puzzle, and global 3D simulations of SNe Ia cannot resolve the\nrequisite length scales to capture detonation initiation. In this work, we\nelucidate a theoretical criterion for detonation initiation in the distributed\nburning regime. We test this criterion against local 3D driven turbulent\nhydrodynamical simulations within electron-degenerate WD matter consisting\ninitially of pure helium. We demonstrate a novel pathway for detonation, in\nwhich strong turbulent dissipation rapidly heats the helium, and forms carbon\nnuclei sufficient to lead to a detonation through accelerated burning via\n$\\alpha$ captures. Simulations of strongly-driven turbulent conditions lead to\ndetonations at a mean density of $10^6$ g cm$^{-3}$ and mean temperature of\n$1.4 - 1.8 \\times 10^9$ K, but fail to detonate at a lower density of $10^5$ g\ncm$^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.",

Yet linguistic knowledge\nalso encodes relationships between contexts, allowing inferences between word\ndistributions. We investigate the degree to which pre-trained Transformer-based\nlarge language models (LLMs) represent such relationships, focusing on the\ndomain of argument structure. We find that LLMs perform well in generalizing\nthe distribution of a novel noun argument between related contexts that were\nseen during pre-training (e.g., the active object and passive subject of the\nverb spray), succeeding by making use of the semantically-organized structure\nof the embedding space for word embeddings. However, LLMs fail at\ngeneralizations between related contexts that have not been observed during\npre-training, but which instantiate more abstract, but well-attested structural\ngeneralizations (e.g., between the active object and passive subject of an\narbitrary verb). Instead, in this case, LLMs show a bias to generalize based on\nlinear order. This finding points to a limitation with current models and\npoints to a reason for which their training is data-intensive.s reported here\nare available at https://github.com/clay-lab/structural-alternations.",

            "summary": "Many recent prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs) query the\nmodel multiple times sequentially -- first to produce intermediate results and\nthen the final answer. However, using these methods, both decoder and model are\nunaware of potential follow-up prompts, leading to disconnected and undesirably\nwordy intermediate responses. In this work, we address this issue by proposing\nprompt sketching, a new prompting paradigm in which an LLM does not only\nrespond by completing a prompt, but by predicting values for multiple variables\nin a template. This way, sketching grants users more control over the\ngeneration process, e.g., by providing a reasoning framework via intermediate\ninstructions, leading to better overall results. The key idea enabling\nsketching with existing, autoregressive models is to adapt the decoding\nprocedure to also score follow-up instructions during text generation, thus\noptimizing overall template likelihood in inference. Our experiments show that\nin a zero-shot setting, prompt sketching outperforms existing, sequential\nprompting schemes such as direct asking or chain-of-thought on 7 out of 8 LLM\nbenchmarking tasks, including state tracking, arithmetic reasoning, and general\nquestion answering. To facilitate future use, we release a number of generic,\nyet effective sketches applicable to many tasks, and an open source library\ncalled dclib, powering our sketch-aware decoders.",

The calculations are extended to\nestimate the number of burst repeaters, including kink emissions and kink-kink\ncollisions. Our findings indicate that despite the potentially large number of\nkinks, we anticipate observing a higher number of burst repeaters from cusps\nfor both LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We also\nconduct calculations using the second main loop distribution model in the\ncurrent literature. We find that this model predicts a notably higher number of\nrepeaters, which provides a reason to include it in future data analysis. These\nresults offer insights into the potential observability of different loop\nfeatures for future detectors, such as the space-based laser interferometers\nTaiji and TianQin.",

This study analyses\nwhether historical knowledge, which includes viral mutations detected in all\ngenotypic tests before therapy, their temporal occurrence, and concomitant\nviral load measurements, can bring improvements. We introduce a method to weigh\nmutations, considering the previously enumerated factors and the reference\nmutation-drug Stanford resistance tables. We compare a model encompassing\nhistory (H) with one not using it (NH). Results: The H-model demonstrates\nsuperior discriminative ability, with a higher ROC-AUC score (76.34%) than the\nNH-model (74.98%). Significant Wilcoxon test results confirm that incorporating\nhistorical information improves consistently predictive accuracy for treatment\noutcomes. The better performance of the H-model might be attributed to its\nconsideration of latent HIV reservoirs, probably obtained when leveraging\nhistorical information. The findings emphasize the importance of temporal\ndynamics in mutations, offering insights into HIV infection complexities.\nHowever, our result also shows that prediction accuracy remains relatively high\neven when no historical information is available.

We demonstrate that the latent variables in this generative model can be\nexplicitly identified into semantic-relevant (SR) and semantic-irrelevant (SI)\ncomponents, which contributes to better OOD generalization by involving minimal\nchange properties of causal mechanisms. Specifically, we first formulate the\ndata generation process from the atom level to the molecular level, where the\nlatent space is split into SI substructures, SR substructures, and SR atom\nvariables. Sequentially, to reduce misidentification, we restrict the minimal\nchanges of the SR atom variables and add a semantic latent substructure\nregularization to mitigate the variance of the SR substructure under augmented\ndomain changes. Under mild assumptions, we prove the block-wise identifiability\nof the SR substructure and the comment-wise identifiability of SR atom\nvariables. Experimental studies achieve state-of-the-art performance and show\ngeneral improvement on 21 datasets in 3 mainstream benchmarks.

In addressing the issue of the crowd's persistent\ndynamism, this paper explored the macroscopic and microscopic features of\npedestrians crossing in static and dynamic contexts, employing a series of\nsystematic experiments. Firstly, empirical evidence has confirmed the existence\nof crowd's persistent dynamism. Subsequently, the research delves into two\naspects, qualitative and quantitative, to address the following questions:(1)\nCross pedestrians tend to avoid high-density areas when crossing static crowds\nand particularly evade pedestrians in front to avoid deceleration, thus\ninducing the formation of cross-channels, a self-organization phenomenon.(2) In\ndynamic crowds, when pedestrian suffers spatial constrained, two patterns\nemerge: decelerate or detour. Research results indicate the differences in\npedestrian crossing behaviors between static and dynamic crowds, such as the\nformation of crossing channels, backward detours, and spiral turning. However,\nthe strategy of pedestrian crossing remains consistent: utilizing detours to\novercome spatial constraints. Finally, the empirical results of this study\naddress the final question: pedestrians detouring causes crowds' persistent\ncollective dynamism. These findings contribute to an enhanced understanding of\npedestrian dynamics in extreme conditions and provide empirical support for\nresearch on individual movement patterns and crowd behavior prediction.",

While a relation (i.e., table) models a set of\ntuples, a bilevel relation is a dictionary that explicitly models a set of\ntables, where each ``value'' table is identified by a ``key'' of a (region,\nfeatures) pair, where region specifies key attributes of the table, and\nfeatures specify columns of the table. Bilevel relational operators are\nBilevelRelation-to-BilevelRelation transformations and directly analyze a set\nof tables. Bilevel relations and operators provide higher level abstractions\nfor creating and manipulating a set of tables, and are compatible with the\nclassic relational algebra. Together, they allow us to construct bilevel\nqueries, which can express succinctly a range of insight-analytical questions\nwith ``search+eval'' character. We have implemented and deployed a query engine\nfor bilevel queries as a service, which is a first of its kind. Bilevel queries\npose a rich algorithm and system design space, such as query optimization and\ndata format, in order to evaluate them efficiently.

In particular,\nwe split the Friedmann equation in order to construct a system for the three\nunknowns, corresponding to the Hubble parameter $H$, the scalar field $\\phi$\nand its self-interaction potential $V$, as functions of the redshift. In the\nresulting picture, the vacuum energy density is provided by a constant term in\nthe potential $V(\\phi)$, while the corresponding small kinetic term is\nresponsible for reproducing the apparent variation of the Hubble constant $H_0$\nwith the redshift. The emerging solution depends on two free parameters, one of\nwhich is fixed to account for the discrepancy between the values of $H_0$ as\nmeasured by the Super Nova Ia Pantheon sample and the Planck satellite data,\nrespectively. The other parameter is instead determined by a fitting procedure\nof the apparent Hubble constant variation across the data corresponding to a 40\nbin analysis of the Super Nova Pantheon sample, in each of which $H_0$ has been\nindependently determined. The fundamental result of the present analysis is the\nemerging Hubble parameter as function of the redshift, which correctly takes\nthe Super Nova Ia prediction at $z=0$ and naturally approaches the profile\npredicted by a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model corresponding to the cosmological\nparameters detected by Planck. It is remarkable that this achievement is\nreached without reducing the Super Nova Ia data to a single point for\ndetermining $H(z=0)$, but accounting for the distribution over their redshift\ninterval of observation, via the binned analysis.",

The superfluid analogy of a\nclassical multi-phase fluid can be realised in a system of two or more\nimmiscible Bose-Einstein condensates. These superfluid mixtures have been shown\nto display a wider variety of exotic dynamics than their single component\ncounterparts. Here we systematically study the dynamics of a binary immiscible\nBose-Einstein Condensate in two dimensions, where a small bubble of the second\ncomponent is used to \"stir\" the first component. We begin by rigorously mapping\nout the critical velocity for vortex shedding as a function of the size of the\nbubble, in analogy to the critical velocity of a laser spoon. Observing that\nthe dynamics of the system depend on the initial size and velocity of the\nbubble, we then show that a dimensionless parameter with the same form as the\nWeber number accurately predicts the resulting bubble fragmentation.",

Therefore, we propose a new\nlearning setting \\textit{Decentralized Personalized Online Federated Learning}\nthat considers all the three aspects at the same time.\n  In this new setting for learning, the first technical challenge is how to\naggregate the shared model parameters from neighboring clients to obtain a\npersonalized local model with good performance on each client. We propose to\ndirectly learn an aggregation by optimizing the performance of the local model\nwith respect to the aggregation weights. This not only improves personalization\nof each local model but also helps the local model adapting to potential data\nshift by intelligently incorporating the right amount of information from its\nneighbors. The second challenge is how to select the neighbors for each client.\nWe propose a peer selection method based on the learned aggregation weights\nenabling each client to select the most helpful neighbors and reduce\ncommunication cost at the same time.

            "summary": "Deep learning based object detectors struggle generalizing to a new target\ndomain bearing significant variations in object and background. Most current\nmethods align domains by using image or instance-level adversarial feature\nalignment. This often suffers due to unwanted background and lacks\nclass-specific alignment. A straightforward approach to promote class-level\nalignment is to use high confidence predictions on unlabeled domain as\npseudo-labels. These predictions are often noisy since model is poorly\ncalibrated under domain shift. In this paper, we propose to leverage model's\npredictive uncertainty to strike the right balance between adversarial feature\nalignment and class-level alignment. We develop a technique to quantify\npredictive uncertainty on class assignments and bounding-box predictions. Model\npredictions with low uncertainty are used to generate pseudo-labels for\nself-training, whereas the ones with higher uncertainty are used to generate\ntiles for adversarial feature alignment. This synergy between tiling around\nuncertain object regions and generating pseudo-labels from highly certain\nobject regions allows capturing both image and instance-level context during\nthe model adaptation. We report thorough ablation study to reveal the impact of\ndifferent components in our approach. Results on five diverse and challenging\nadaptation scenarios show that our approach outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods with noticeable margins.",

The basic Fay-Herriot model\n(Fay & Herriot, 1979) tackles this problem by incorporating auxiliary\ninformation, which is generally available from administrative or census\nrecords. The Fay-Herriot model with spatially correlated random area effects,\nin addition to auxiliary information, incorporates geographic information about\nthe areas, such as latitude and longitude. This permits modeling spatial\nautocorrelations, which are not unusual in socioeconomic and health surveys.

We observe peculiar breakdowns in performance when the\nnumber of processes is prime. Investigating this effect, we create\nfirst-principles data traffic models for each of the stencil-like hotspot\nloops. With application measurements and microbenchmarks to study memory data\ntraffic behavior, we can connect the breakdowns to SpecI2M, a new\nwrite-allocate evasion feature in current Intel CPUs. We identify conditions\nunder which SpecI2M works as intended and where it fails to avoid\nwrite-allocate transfers. Write-allocate evasion works best if large arrays are\nwritten consecutively; in the CloverLeaf code, non-temporal stores can be\nemployed on top for best results. For serial and full-node cases we are able to\npredict the memory data volume analytically with an error of a few percent. We\nfind that if the number of processes is prime, SpecI2M fails to work properly,\nwhich we can attribute to short inner loops emerging from the one-dimensional\ndomain decomposition in this case. We can also rule out other possible causes\nof the prime number effect, such as breaking layer conditions, MPI\ncommunication overhead, and load imbalance.",

Nonetheless,\nthis occurs at the expense of vanishing extracted electrical power density.\nConversely, a spectrally broadband radiative heat exchange between the emitter\nand the cell yields maximal TPV power density at the expense of low efficiency.\nBy leveraging hot-carriers as a means to mitigate thermalization losses within\nthe cell, we demonstrate that one can alleviate this trade-off between power\ndensity and efficiency.

Autonomous driving represents one of the key areas\nwhere computer vision algorithms are applied. The task of road surface\nsegmentation is crucial in self-driving systems, but it requires a\nlabor-intensive annotation process in several data domains. The work described\nin this paper aims to improve the efficiency of image segmentation using a\nconvolutional neural network in a multi-sensor setup. This approach leverages\nlidar (Light Detection and Ranging) annotations to directly train image\nsegmentation models on RGB images. Lidar supplements the images by emitting\nlaser pulses and measuring reflections to provide depth information. However,\nlidar's sparse point clouds often create difficulties for accurate object\nsegmentation. Segmentation of point clouds requires time-consuming preliminary\ndata preparation and a large amount of computational resources. The key\ninnovation of our approach is the masked loss, addressing sparse ground-truth\nmasks from point clouds. By calculating loss exclusively where lidar points\nexist, the model learns road segmentation on images by using lidar points as\nground truth. This approach allows for blending of different ground-truth data\ntypes during model training. Experimental validation of the approach on\nbenchmark datasets shows comparable performance to a high-quality image\nsegmentation model. Incorporating lidar reduces the load on annotations and\nenables training of image-segmentation models without loss of segmentation\nquality. The methodology is tested on diverse datasets, both publicly available\nand proprietary. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method are also\ndiscussed in the paper.",

            "summary": "In this paper, we present the superposition of chirp waveforms for\nsimultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) applications.\nExploiting the chirp waveform characteristics enables us to superimpose\nmultiple chirps, thereby allowing transmission of the same number of waveforms\nover less bandwidth. This enables us to perform subband selection when\noperating over set of orthogonal subbands. Furthermore, we consider a user\nequipped with a diplexer-based integrated receiver (DIR), which enables to\nextract radio frequency power and decode information from the same signal\nwithout splitting. Thereby, incorporating chirp superposition and subband\nselection, a transmission scheme is proposed to exploit both the diode's\nnonlinearity and frequency diversity. We derive novel closed-form analytical\nexpressions of the average harvested energy (HE) via transmission of\nsuperimposed chirp over selected subbands based on tools from order statistics.\nWe also analyze the downlink information rate achieved at the user. Through our\nanalytical and numerical results, for the considered system setup, we show that\nsuperimposed chirp-based SWIPT provides an improvement of 30$\\%$ in average HE\nperformance as compared to multisine waveforms consisting of a set of\nfixed-frequency cosine signals, improves the minimum level of HE in a multiuser\nnetwork, and extends the operating range of energy transfer as compared to\nfixed-frequency waveforms. Furthermore, we illustrate that the inclusion of DIR\nat the receiver for SWIPT enlarges the energy-information transfer region when\ncompared to the widely considered power splitting receiver.",

This paper uses state-of-the-art\ndeep learning (DL) architectures to introduce a multi-step forecasting system\nto predict vital signs indicative of septic shock progression in Intensive Care\nUnits (ICUs). Our approach utilizes a short window of historical vital sign\ndata to forecast future physiological conditions. We introduce a DL-based vital\nsign forecasting system that predicts up to 3 hours of future vital signs from\n6 hours of past data. We further adopt the DILATE loss function to capture\nbetter the shape and temporal dynamics of vital signs, which are critical for\nclinical decision-making. We compare three DL models, N-BEATS, N-HiTS, and\nTemporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), using the publicly available eICU\nCollaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), highlighting their forecasting\ncapabilities in a critical care setting. We evaluate the performance of our\nmodels using mean squared error (MSE) and dynamic time warping (DTW) metrics.\nOur findings show that while TFT excels in capturing overall trends, N-HiTS is\nsuperior in retaining short-term fluctuations within a predefined range.

            "summary": "Background: Ovarian cancer is among the three most frequent gynecologic\ncancers globally. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common\nand aggressive histological type. Guided treatment for HGSOC typically involves\nplatinum-based combination chemotherapy, necessitating an assessment of whether\nthe patient is platinum-resistant. The purpose of this study is to propose a\ndeep learning-based method to determine whether a patient is platinum-resistant\nusing multimodal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)\nimages. Methods: 289 patients with HGSOC were included in this study. An\nend-to-end SE-SPP-DenseNet model was built by adding Squeeze-Excitation Block\n(SE Block) and Spatial Pyramid Pooling Layer (SPPLayer) to Dense Convolutional\nNetwork (DenseNet). Multimodal data from PET/CT images of the regions of\ninterest (ROI) were used to predict platinum resistance in patients. Results:\nThrough five-fold cross-validation, SE-SPP-DenseNet achieved a high accuracy\nrate and an area under the curve (AUC) in predicting platinum resistance in\npatients, which were 92.6% and 0.93, respectively. The importance of\nincorporating SE Block and SPPLayer into the deep learning model, and\nconsidering multimodal data was substantiated by carrying out ablation studies\nand experiments with single modality data. Conclusions: The obtained\nclassification results indicate that our proposed deep learning framework\nperforms better in predicting platinum resistance in patients, which can help\ngynecologists make better treatment decisions.

Owing to the expected connection between SMBH spin\nparameter evolution and the accretion and merger history of individual black\nholes, population spin measurements offer a rare observational window into the\nSMBH cosmic growth. As of today, the most common method for estimating SMBH\nspin relies on modeling the relativistically broaden atomic profiles in the\nreflection spectrum observed in X-rays. In this paper, we study the\nobservational requirements needed to confidently distinguish between the\nprimary SMBH growth channels, based on their distinct spin-mass distributions\npredicted by the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation.

Against this background, we explore the relationship between the\nsensitivity of mechanical systems to external forces and the properties of the\nquantum states they are prepared in. We establish that the main determinant of\nthe force sensitivity in pure quantum states is their spatial delocalisation\nand we link the force sensitivity to the rate at which two mechanical systems\nbecome entangled under a quantum force. We exemplify this at the hand of two\ncommonly considered configurations. One that involves gravitationally\ninteracting objects prepared in non-Gaussian states such as Schr\\\"odinger-cat\nstates, where the generation of entanglement is typically ascribed to the\naccumulation of a dynamical phase between components in superposition. The\nother prepares particles in Gaussian states that are strongly squeezed in\nmomentum and delocalised in position where entanglement generation is\nattributed to accelerations. We offer a unified description of these two\narrangements using the phase-space representation and link their entangling\nrate to their force sensitivity, showing that both configurations get entangled\nat the same rate provided that they are equally delocalised in space. Our\ndescription in phase space and the established relation between force\nsensitivity and entanglement sheds light on the intricacies of why the\nequivalence between these two configurations holds, something that is not\nalways evident in the literature, due to the distinct physical and analytical\nmethods employed to study each of them.

The effect of phonons on quantum emitters is twofold: polaron\nformation is described by ultrafast non-markovian dynamics, while slower\ndephasing is well described by exponential decay. Both temperature-dependent\nprocesses will affect collective emission and entanglement, but they are\nusually not modeled, probably due to a lack of efficient methods especially for\nmore than two emitters. So here we propose and compare two methods: the first\nmethod concatenates the fast and slow phonon dynamics, and the second is the\npolaron method. For a single quantum emitter, we show that the dynamical\nequations are identical in both methods, while predictions for two or more\nemitters also agree very well. Both of our methods incorporate non-markovian\ndynamics due to phonons demonstrating the temperature sensitivity of the\ncollective photon emission. Utilizing a simplified markovian model instead may\nnot be accurate enough especially for quantum information applications: for\nexample, we show how the markovian model may considerably overestimate the\ntwo-emitter concurrence, except at very low temperatures. Our concatenation and\npolaron methods can be applied to an arbitrary number and type of quantum\nemitters, and beyond the bulk GaAs environment that we consider here.\nEspecially the concatenation method can take phonon effects into account at the\nsame computational cost as modelling the emitter-photon interaction alone.\nFinally, we present approximate analytical expressions for the collective\nemission spectrum for N emitters on a one-dimensional chain.",

The theoretical prediction that the microsphere and the annular\nlaser focal spot should have comparable sizes is confirmed experimentally by\ntaking different values for the topological charge of the vortex beam.\nSpherical aberration introduced by refraction at the interface between the\nglass slide and the sample is taken into account and allows to fine tune\nbetween axial, bistable and orbital states as the sample is shifted with\nrespect to the objective focal plane.

            "summary": "Till today, although the Standard Model (SM) is the most celebrated theory\nthat explains nature almost completely, there are still some phenomena observed\nin nature that the SM cannot explain. That is why it is needed to look for\ntheories beyond the Standard Model (BSM). While the ATLAS/CMS experiments\ndiscovered a Standard Model-like Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC), no compelling new physics signal has been seen yet. Several searches\nhave been performed at the LHC to look for new physics signal. One such novel\nsignal is the same-sign diboson (SSdB) + ${E\\!\\!/}_{T}$ which is a rather clean\nsignal with negligibly small SM background. Such a unique signature can be\nobserved in more than one well-motivated BSM scenarios, namely: (i) natural\nSUSY models, (ii) type-III seesaw model and (iii) type-II\nseesaw/Georgi-Machacek model. In the first part of this poster I present the\ndiscovery prospects of this signal that has been analyzed in these BSM models\nin current and future runs of the LHC beside providing ways to distinguish\namong these different BSM models. Furthermore, the LHC, being a \"top quark\nfactory\", helps in precise measurement of various properties of the top quark.\nDeviation from the SM prediction in measuring these properties of the top quark\ncan, very efficiently, shed light on new physics signal. In the second part of\nthis poster I present a work in progress where we aim to show how precise\nmeasurement of quantities related to top quark features can indicate towards a\nnew physics signal.",

We find that mechanical\ndeformation can close the monolayer's topological gap, while the bilayer\nexhibits richer phase diagram, including both topological insulating, trivial\nmetallic and insulating phases. The bilayer is predicted to be on the\ntopological phase boundary. We also address the preparation of monolayers,\nusing \\emph{ab initio} simulations and experimental scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy measurements.

            "summary": "Collective migration, or the coordinated movement of many individuals, is an\nimportant component of many biological processes, including wound healing,\ntumorigenesis, and embryo development. Spatial agent-based models (ABMs) are\noften used to model collective migration, but it is challenging to thoroughly\nstudy these models' behavior due to their random and computational nature.\nModelers often overcome these obstacles by coarse-graining discrete ABM rules\ninto continuous mean-field partial differential equation (PDE) models. These\nmodels are advantageous because they are fast to simulate; unfortunately, these\nPDE models can poorly predict ABM behavior (or even be ill-posed) at certain\nparameter values. In this work, we describe how biologically-informed neural\nnetworks (BINNs) can be used to learn BINN-guided PDE models that are capable\nof accurately predicting ABM behavior. In particular, we show that BINN-guided\nPDE simulations can forecast future ABM data not seen during model training.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate how to predict ABM data at previously-unexplored\nparameter values by combining BINN-guided PDE simulations with multivariate\ninterpolation. We highlight these results using three separate ABMs that\nconsist of rules on agent pulling and/or adhesion. Surprisingly, BINN-guided\nPDEs can accurately forecast and predict ABM data with a one-compartment PDE\nwhen the mean-field PDE is ill-posed or requires two compartments. While we\nfocus our presentation on the biological applications, this work is broadly\napplicable to studying many systems that exhibit the collective migration of\nindividuals.",

In particular, the superflavor symmetry, or also called the\nheavy quark anti-diquark symmetry is one of the interesting symmetries, which\nlinks a quark $Q$ to an anti-diquark $\\bar{Q}\\bar{Q}$ having the same color\nrepresentation as $Q$. In this paper, we study a $\\bar{D}\\Xi_{cc}$ molecular\nstate as a superflavor partner of the doubly charm tetraquark $T_{cc}$ reported\nby LHCb recently. $T_{cc}$ locating slightly below the $DD^*$ threshold is a\ncandidate of the hadronic molecule. Thus by replacing the singly charm meson\n$D^{(*)}$ with the doubly charm baryon $\\Xi_{cc}^{(*)}$, superflavor symmetry\npredicts the existence of the $\\bar{D}^{(*)}\\Xi_{cc}^{(*)}$ bound state. We\nemploy the one boson exchange model respecting with the heavy quark spin\nsymmetry where the parameter is obtained to reproduce the $T_{cc}$ binding\nenergy. We apply this model with superflavor symmetry to the\n$\\bar{D}^{(*)}\\Xi_{cc}^{(*)}$ molecule and predict a bound state with $I(J^P) =\n0(\\frac{1}{2}^-)$. If the pentaquark state corresponding to $\\bar{D}^{(*)}\n\\Xi_{cc}^{(*)}$ molecular state is observed in future experiments as predicted\nin this work, it is more likely that $T_{cc}$ is a $DD^*$ molecular state.",

Its position at the runaway\ngreenhouse limit makes it a natural laboratory to study the climate evolution\nof hot rocky planets. We present the first 3D-GCM exo-Venus model for a modern\nVenus-like atmosphere (92 bar surface pressure, realistic composition,\nH$_2$SO$_4$ radiatively-active clouds), applied to the tidally-locked LP 890-9c\nto inform observations by JWST and future instruments. If LP 890-9 c has\ndeveloped into a modern exo-Venus, then the modelled temperatures suggest that\nH$_2$SO$_4$ clouds are possible even in the substellar region. Like on modern\nVenus, clouds on LP 890-9 c would create a flat spectrum. The strongest CO$_2$\nbands in transmission predicted by our model for LP 890-9 c are about 10 ppm,\nchallenging detection, given JWST estimated noise floor. Estimated phase curve\namplitudes are 0.9 and 2.4 ppm for continuum and CO$_2$ bands, respectively.\nWhile pointing out the challenge to characterise modern exo-Venus analogues,\nthese results provide new insights for JWST proposals and highlight the\ninfluence of clouds in the spectrum of hot rocky exoplanet spectra.",

We\ninvestigate this question via a direct approach, in which we eliminate\ninformation related to specific low-level stimulus features (textual, speech,\nand visual) in the language model representations, and observe how this\nintervention affects the alignment with fMRI brain recordings acquired while\nparticipants read versus listened to the same naturalistic stories. We further\ncontrast our findings with speech-based language models, which would be\nexpected to predict speech-evoked brain activity better, provided they model\nlanguage processing in the brain well. Using our direct approach, we find that\nboth text-based and speech-based language models align well with early sensory\nregions due to shared low-level features. Text-based models continue to align\nwell with later language regions even after removing these features, while,\nsurprisingly, speech-based models lose most of their alignment.

This approach can be\nhelpful for tasks like logic formalization and surface-form quantitative\nreasoning (Gordon and Schubert, 2010; Roy et al., 2015). However, it remains\nunclear if recent foundation models possess this ability, as they lack direct\ntraining signals. To explore this, we introduce QuRe, a crowd-sourced dataset\nof human-annotated generalized quantifiers in Wikipedia sentences featuring\npercentage-equipped predicates. We explore quantifier comprehension in language\nmodels using PRESQUE, a framework that combines natural language inference and\nthe Rational Speech Acts framework.

            "summary": "Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction plays an essential role in recommender\nsystems and online advertising. It is crucial to effectively model feature\ninteractions to improve the prediction performance of CTR models. However,\nexisting methods face three significant challenges. First, while most methods\ncan automatically capture high-order feature interactions, their performance\ntends to diminish as the order of feature interactions increases. Second,\nexisting methods lack the ability to provide convincing interpretations of the\nprediction results, especially for high-order feature interactions, which\nlimits the trustworthiness of their predictions. Third, many methods suffer\nfrom the presence of redundant parameters, particularly in the embedding layer.\nThis paper proposes a novel method called Gated Deep Cross Network (GDCN) and a\nField-level Dimension Optimization (FDO) approach to address these challenges.\nAs the core structure of GDCN, Gated Cross Network (GCN) captures explicit\nhigh-order feature interactions and dynamically filters important interactions\nwith an information gate in each order. Additionally, we use the FDO approach\nto learn condensed dimensions for each field based on their importance.\nComprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness,\nsuperiority and interpretability of GDCN. Moreover, we verify the effectiveness\nof FDO in learning various dimensions and reducing model parameters. The code\nis available on \\url{https://github.com/anonctr/GDCN}.",

            "summary": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is widely used in academia and industry.\nMost CTR tasks fall into a feature embedding \\& feature interaction paradigm,\nwhere the accuracy of CTR prediction is mainly improved by designing practical\nfeature interaction structures. However, recent studies have argued that the\nfixed feature embedding learned only through the embedding layer limits the\nperformance of existing CTR models. Some works apply extra modules on top of\nthe embedding layer to dynamically refine feature representations in different\ninstances, making it effective and easy to integrate with existing CTR methods.\nDespite the promising results, there is a lack of a systematic review and\nsummarization of this new promising direction on the CTR task. To fill this\ngap, we comprehensively summarize and define a new module, namely\n\\textbf{feature refinement} (FR) module, that can be applied between feature\nembedding and interaction layers. We extract 14 FR modules from previous works,\nincluding instances where the FR module was proposed but not clearly defined or\nexplained. We fully assess the effectiveness and compatibility of existing FR\nmodules through comprehensive and extensive experiments with over 200 augmented\nmodels and over 4,000 runs for more than 15,000 GPU hours. The results offer\ninsightful guidelines for researchers, and all benchmarking code and\nexperimental results are open-sourced. In addition, we present a new\narchitecture of assigning independent FR modules to separate sub-networks for\nparallel CTR models, as opposed to the conventional method of inserting a\nshared FR module on top of the embedding layer. Our approach is also supported\nby comprehensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness.",

We\nalso calculate the entanglement change caused by the anti-Unruh effect and\nfound that the lost entanglement could just be recovered part by the anti-Unruh\neffect, and the anti-Unruh effect could only appear for a finite range of\nacceleration when interaction time scale is approximately shorter than the\nreciprocal of the energy gap in two dimensional spacetime. The limit case of\nzero acceleration is also investigated, which gives an analytical\ninterpretation for the increase or recovery of entanglement.",

We consider the validity range in\nterms of three different diagnostics: 1) the goodness of fit; 2) a\nfigure-of-bias quantifying the error in recovering the fiducial value of a\ncosmological parameter; 3) an internal consistency check of the theoretical\nmodel quantifying the running of the model parameters with the scale cut. We\nconsider different sets of measurements corresponding to an increasing\ncumulative simulation volume in redshift space. For each volume we define a\nmedian value and the associated scatter for the largest wavenumber where the\nmodel is valid (the $k$-reach of the model). We find, as a rather general\nresult, that the median value of the reach decreases with the simulation\nvolume, as expected since the smaller statistical errors provide a more\nstringent test for the model. This is true for all the three definitions\nconsidered, with the one given in terms of the figure-of-bias providing the\nmost stringent scale cut. More interestingly, we find as well that the error\nassociated with the $k$-reach value is quite large, with a significant\nprobability of being as low as 0.1$\\, h \\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ (or, more generally,\nup to 40% smaller than the median) for all the simulation volumes considered.\nWe explore as well the additional information on the growth rate parameter\nencoded in the power spectrum hexadecapole, compared to the analysis of\nmonopole and quadrupole, as a function of simulation volume.

In contrast, event cameras offer a robust solution for navigating these\nchallenging contexts. Predominant methodologies incorporate event cameras into\nlearning frameworks by accumulating events into event frames. However, such\nmethods tend to marginalize the intrinsic asynchronous and high temporal\nresolution characteristics of events. This disregard leads to a loss in\nessential temporal dimension data, crucial for discerning distinct actions. To\naddress this issue and to unlock the 3D potential of event information, we\nintroduce two 3D event representations: the Rasterized Event Point Cloud\n(RasEPC) and the Decoupled Event Voxel (DEV). The RasEPC collates events within\nconcise temporal slices at identical positions, preserving 3D attributes with\nstatistical cues and markedly mitigating memory and computational demands.\nMeanwhile, the DEV representation discretizes events into voxels and projects\nthem across three orthogonal planes, utilizing decoupled event attention to\nretrieve 3D cues from the 2D planes. Furthermore, we develop and release\nEV-3DPW, a synthetic event-based dataset crafted to facilitate training and\nquantitative analysis in outdoor scenes. On the public real-world DHP19\ndataset, our event point cloud technique excels in real-time mobile\npredictions, while the decoupled event voxel method achieves the highest\naccuracy. Experiments on EV-3DPW demonstrate that the robustness of our\nproposed 3D representation methods compared to traditional RGB images and event\nframe techniques under the same backbones.

            "summary": "Despite Multi-modal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have made exciting\nstrides recently, they are still struggling to efficiently model the\ninteractions among multi-modal inputs and the generation in non-textual\nmodalities. In this work, we propose TEAL (Tokenize and Embed ALl)}, an\napproach to treat the input from any modality as a token sequence and learn a\njoint embedding space for all modalities. Specifically, for the input from any\nmodality, TEAL first discretizes it into a token sequence with the\noff-the-shelf tokenizer and embeds the token sequence into a joint embedding\nspace with a learnable embedding matrix. MM-LLMs just need to predict the\nmulti-modal tokens autoregressively as the textual LLMs do. Finally, the\ncorresponding de-tokenizer is applied to generate the output in each modality\nbased on the predicted token sequence. With the joint embedding space, TEAL\nenables the frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks\ninvolving non-textual modalities, such as image and audio. Thus, the textual\nLLM can just work as an interface and maintain its high performance in textual\nunderstanding and generation. Experiments show that TEAL achieves substantial\nimprovements in multi-modal understanding, and implements a simple scheme for\nmulti-modal generations.",

This paper details\nthe combination of zoRO with the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme and presents\nan efficient open-source implementation in acados, utilizing BLASFEO for the\nlinear algebra operations. In addition to the scaling advantages posed by the\nzoRO algorithm, the efficient implementation drastically reduces the\ncomputational overhead, and, combined with an RTI scheme, enables the use of\ntube-based MPC for a wider range of applications. The flexibility, usability\nand effectiveness of the proposed implementation is demonstrated on two\nexamples.

In this paper, we investigate a novel\nregression problem called regression with cost-based rejection, where the model\ncan reject to make predictions on some examples given certain rejection costs.\nTo solve this problem, we first formulate the expected risk for this problem\nand then derive the Bayes optimal solution, which shows that the optimal model\nshould reject to make predictions on the examples whose variance is larger than\nthe rejection cost when the mean squared error is used as the evaluation\nmetric. Furthermore, we propose to train the model by a surrogate loss function\nthat considers rejection as binary classification and we provide conditions for\nthe model consistency, which implies that the Bayes optimal solution can be\nrecovered by our proposed surrogate loss.

In this paper,\nwe decompose recommendation models into three layers, i.e., the input layer,\nthe intermediate layer, and the output layer, and address deficiencies layer by\nlayer. First, previous methods focus only on two layers, neglecting the input\nlayer. Second, in the intermediate layer, existing methods ignore the\ninconsistency of user preferences induced by the projectors. Third, in the\noutput layer, existing methods use only hard labels rather than soft labels\nfrom the teacher. To address these deficiencies, we propose\n\\textbf{M}ulti-layer \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation (MKD), which\nconsists of three components: 1) Distillation with Neighbor-based Knowledge\n(NKD) utilizes the teacher's knowledge about entities with similar\ncharacteristics in the input layer to enable the student to learn robust\nrepresentations. 2) Distillation with Consistent Preference (CPD) reduces the\ninconsistency of user preferences caused by projectors in the intermediate\nlayer by two regularization terms. 3) Distillation with Soft Labels (SLD)\nconstructs soft labels in the output layer by considering the predictions of\nboth the teacher and the student.

We address\nthis gap by training a series of GPT-like language models of different sizes on\nthe strict version of the BabyLM pretraining corpus, evaluating on the\nchallenge tasks (BLiMP, GLUE, MSGS) and an additional reading time prediction\ntask. We find a positive correlation between LM size and performance on all\nthree challenge tasks, with different preferences for model width and depth in\neach of the tasks. In contrast, a negative correlation was found between LM\nsize and reading time fit of linear mixed-effects models using LM surprisal as\na predictor, with the second-smallest LM achieving the largest log-likelihood\nreduction over a baseline model without surprisal.

            "summary": "This paper is focused on multiuser load modulation arrays (MU-LMAs) which are\nattractive due to their low system complexity and reduced cost for millimeter\nwave (mmWave) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. The existing precoding\nalgorithm for downlink MU-LMA relies on a sub-array structured (SAS)\ntransmitter which may suffer from decreased degrees of freedom and complex\nsystem configuration. Furthermore, a conventional LMA codebook with codewords\nuniformly distributed on a hypersphere may not be channel-adaptive and may lead\nto increased signal detection complexity. In this paper, we conceive an MU-LMA\nsystem employing a full-array structured (FAS) transmitter and propose two\nalgorithms accordingly. The proposed FAS-based system addresses the SAS\nstructural problems and can support larger numbers of users. For LMA-imposed\nconstant-power downlink precoding, we propose an FAS-based normalized block\ndiagonalization (FAS-NBD) algorithm. However, the forced normalization may\nresult in performance degradation. This degradation, together with the\naforementioned codebook design problems, is difficult to solve analytically.\nThis motivates us to propose a Deep Learning-enhanced (FAS-DL-NBD) algorithm\nfor adaptive codebook design and codebook-independent decoding. It is shown\nthat the proposed algorithms are robust to imperfect knowledge of channel state\ninformation and yield excellent error performance. Moreover, the FAS-DL-NBD\nalgorithm enables signal detection with low complexity as the number of bits\nper codeword increases.",

            "summary": "Satellite observations of acoustic-gravity waves in the polar regions of the\natmosphere indicate a close connection of these waves with wind flows. The\npaper investigates the peculiarities of the propagation of AGWs in spatially\ninhomogeneous flows, where the wind speed slowly changes in the horizontal\ndirection. A system of hydrodynamic equations is used for the analysis, which\ntakes into account the wind flow with spatial inhomogeneity. Unlike the system\nof equations written for a stationary medium (or a medium moving at a uniform\nspeed), the resulting system contains components that describe the interaction\nof the waves with the medium. It is shown that the influence of inhomogeneous\nbackground parameters of the medium can be separated from the effects of\ninertial forces by means of the special variable substitution. The analytical\nexpression is obtained that describes the changes in the wave amplitude in a\nmedium moving with a non-uniform speed. This expression contains two functional\ndependencies: 1) the linear part caused by changes in the background parameters\nof the medium, it does not depend on the direction of the wave propagation\nrelative to the flow; 2) the exponential part associated with the inertia\nforces, which determines the dependence of the amplitudes of AGWs on the\ndirection of their propagation. The exponential part shows an increase in the\namplitudes of the waves in the headwind and a decrease in their amplitudes in\nthe downwind. The obtained theoretical dependence of the amplitudes of AGWs on\nthe wind speed is in good agreement with the data of satellite observations of\nthese waves in the polar thermosphere.",

            "summary": "Online learning to rank (ONL2R) is a foundational problem for recommender\nsystems and has received increasing attention in recent years. Among the\nexisting approaches for ONL2R, a natural modeling architecture is the\nmulti-armed bandit framework coupled with the position-based click model.\nHowever, developing efficient online learning policies for MAB-based ONL2R with\nposition-based click models is highly challenging due to the combinatorial\nnature of the problem, and partial observability in the position-based click\nmodel. To date, results in MAB-based ONL2R with position-based click models\nremain rather limited, which motivates us to fill this gap in this work. Our\nmain contributions in this work are threefold: i) We propose the first general\nMAB framework that captures all key ingredients of ONL2R with position-based\nclick models. Our model considers personalized and equal treatments in ONL2R\nranking recommendations, both of which are widely used in practice; ii) Based\non the above analytical framework, we develop two unified greed- and UCB-based\npolicies called GreedyRank and UCBRank, each of which can be applied to\npersonalized and equal ranking treatments; and iii) We show that both\nGreedyRank and UCBRank enjoy $O(\\sqrt{t}\\ln t)$ and $O(\\sqrt{t\\ln t})$ anytime\nsublinear regret for personalized and equal treatment, respectively. For the\nfundamentally hard equal ranking treatment, we identify classes of collective\nutility functions and their associated sufficient conditions under which\n$O(\\sqrt{t}\\ln t)$ and $O(\\sqrt{t\\ln t})$ anytime sublinear regrets are still\nachievable for GreedyRank and UCBRank, respectively. Our numerical experiments\nalso verify our theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of\nGreedyRank and UCBRank in seeking the optimal action under various problem\nsettings.",

Since they are mainly pre-trained to map\ninput speech to pseudo-labels, the resulting representations are only effective\nfor the type of pre-train data used, either clean or mixture speech. With the\nidea of selective auditory attention, we propose a novel pre-training solution\ncalled Selective-HuBERT, or SHuBERT, which learns the selective extraction of\ntarget speech representations from either clean or mixture speech.\nSpecifically, SHuBERT is trained to predict pseudo labels of a target speaker,\nconditioned on an enrolled speech from the target speaker. By doing so, SHuBERT\nis expected to selectively attend to the target speaker in a complex acoustic\nenvironment, thus benefiting various downstream tasks. We further introduce a\ndual-path training strategy and use the cross-correlation constraint between\nthe two branches to encourage the model to generate noise-invariant\nrepresentation. Experiments on SUPERB benchmark and LibriMix dataset\ndemonstrate the universality and noise-robustness of SHuBERT.

            "summary": "Biological and artificial microswimmers often have to propel through a\nvariety of environments, ranging from heterogeneous suspending media to strong\ngeometrical confinement. Under confinement, local flow fields generated by\nmicroswimmers, and steric and hydrodynamic interactions with their environment\ndetermine the locomotion. We propose a squirmer-like model to describe the\nmotion of microswimmers in cylindrical microchannels, where propulsion is\ngenerated by a fixed surface slip velocity. The model is studied analytically\nfor cylindrical swimmer shapes, and by numerical hydrodynamics simulations for\nspherical and spheroidal shapes. For the numerical simulations, we employ the\ndissipative particle dynamics method for modelling fluid flow. Both the\nanalytical model and simulations show that the propulsion force increases with\nincreasing confinement. However, the swimming velocity under confinement\nremains lower than the swimmer speed without confinement for all investigated\nconditions. In simulations, different swimming modes (i.e. pusher, neutral,\npuller) are investigated, and found to play a significant role in the\ngeneration of propulsion force when a swimmer approaches a dead end of a\ncapillary. Propulsion generation in confined systems is local, such that the\ngenerated flow field generally vanishes beyond the characteristic size of the\nswimmer. These results contribute to a better understanding of microswimmer\nforce generation and propulsion under strong confinement, including the motion\nin porous media and in narrow channels.",

Given a set of images taken from a freely moving camera at\ntrain time, the proposed approach could synthesize a realistic image of the\nscene from a novel viewpoint at test time. The key ideas presented in this\npaper are (i) Recovering accurate camera parameters via a robust pipeline from\nunposed day-to-day images is equally crucial in neural novel view synthesis\nproblem; (ii) It is rather more practical to model object's content at\ndifferent resolutions since dramatic camera motion is highly likely in\nday-to-day unposed images. To incorporate the key ideas, we leverage the\nfundamentals of scene rigidity, multi-scale neural scene representation, and\nsingle-image depth prediction. Concretely, the proposed approach makes the\ncamera parameters as learnable in a neural fields-based modeling framework. By\nassuming per view depth prediction is given up to scale, we constrain the\nrelative pose between successive frames. From the relative poses, absolute\ncamera pose estimation is modeled via a graph-neural network-based multiple\nmotion averaging within the multi-scale neural-fields network, leading to a\nsingle loss function. Optimizing the introduced loss function provides camera\nintrinsic, extrinsic, and image rendering from unposed images. We demonstrate,\nwith examples, that for a unified framework to accurately model multiscale\nneural scene representation from day-to-day acquired unposed multi-view images,\nit is equally essential to have precise camera-pose estimates within the scene\nrepresentation framework. Without considering robustness measures in the camera\npose estimation pipeline, modeling for multi-scale aliasing artifacts can be\ncounterproductive.

Secondly, the relative interaction and\ncross-temporal aggregation strategies are sequentially adopted to integrate\nfeatures in the current fusion module, observation interaction module, future\nfeedback module and global fusion module, in which the future feedback module\ncan enable the understanding of pre-action by feeding the influence of preview\ninformation to feedforward prediction. Thirdly, the comprehensive interaction\nfeatures are further fed into final predictor to generate the joint predicted\ntrajectories of multiple agents.

Our findings highlight the significance of introducing certain\nvariables such as regime change in the environment setting to enhance the\nprediction accuracy. Furthermore, the application of reinforcement learning in\ninvestment strategies provides a remarkable advantage of setting the\noptimization problem flexibly. This enables the integration of practical\nconstraints faced by investors into the algorithm, resulting in efficient\noptimization. Our study has categorized the investment strategy formulation\nconditions into three main categories, including performance measurement\nindicators, portfolio management rules, and other constraints.

            "summary": "Crowd counting models in highly congested areas confront two main challenges:\nweak localization ability and difficulty in differentiating between foreground\nand background, leading to inaccurate estimations. The reason is that objects\nin highly congested areas are normally small and high-level features extracted\nby convolutional neural networks are less discriminative to represent small\nobjects. To address these problems, we propose a learning discriminative\nfeatures framework for crowd counting, which is composed of a masked feature\nprediction module (MPM) and a supervised pixel-level contrastive learning\nmodule (CLM). The MPM randomly masks feature vectors in the feature map and\nthen reconstructs them, allowing the model to learn about what is present in\nthe masked regions and improving the model's ability to localize objects in\nhigh-density regions. The CLM pulls targets close to each other and pushes them\nfar away from background in the feature space, enabling the model to\ndiscriminate foreground objects from background. Additionally, the proposed\nmodules can be beneficial in various computer vision tasks, such as crowd\ncounting and object detection, where dense scenes or cluttered environments\npose challenges to accurate localization. The proposed two modules are\nplug-and-play, incorporating the proposed modules into existing models can\npotentially boost their performance in these scenarios.",

As a typical solution, the global- and the local\ncontext information are exploited to predict the emotional label for every\nsingle sentence, i.e., utterance, in the dialogue. Specifically, the global\nrepresentation could be captured via modeling of cross-modal interactions at\nthe conversation level. The local one is often inferred using the temporal\ninformation of speakers or emotional shifts, which neglects vital factors at\nthe utterance level. Additionally, most existing approaches take fused features\nof multiple modalities in an unified input without leveraging modality-specific\nrepresentations. Motivating from these problems, we propose the Relational\nTemporal Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Cross-Modality Interaction\n(CORECT), an novel neural network framework that effectively captures\nconversation-level cross-modality interactions and utterance-level temporal\ndependencies with the modality-specific manner for conversation understanding.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CORECT via its\nstate-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets for the\nmultimodal ERC task.",

We argue that a\nhigh-quality ReID representation should have three properties, namely,\nmulti-level awareness, occlusion robustness, and cross-region invariance. To\nthis end, we propose a simple yet effective pre-training framework, namely\nPersonMAE, which involves two core designs into masked autoencoders to better\nserve the task of Person Re-ID. 1) PersonMAE generates two regions from the\ngiven image with RegionA as the input and \\textit{RegionB} as the prediction\ntarget. RegionA is corrupted with block-wise masking to mimic common occlusion\nin ReID and its remaining visible parts are fed into the encoder. 2) Then\nPersonMAE aims to predict the whole RegionB at both pixel level and semantic\nfeature level. It encourages its pre-trained feature representations with the\nthree properties mentioned above. These properties make PersonMAE compatible\nwith downstream Person ReID tasks, leading to state-of-the-art performance on\nfour downstream ReID tasks, i.e., supervised (holistic and occluded setting),\nand unsupervised (UDA and USL setting). Notably, on the commonly adopted\nsupervised setting, PersonMAE with ViT-B backbone achieves 79.8% and 69.5% mAP\non the MSMT17 and OccDuke datasets, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by\na large margin of +8.0 mAP, and +5.3 mAP, respectively.",

Such a network features an arbitrary $n$ number of independent\nsources, $n$ edge parties, and a central party. Each party receives arbitrary\n$m$ inputs. We consider two different types of sharing of nonlocality in the\nnetwork. i) The symmetric case - when the sharing of nonlocality is considered\nacross all edge parties. ii) The asymmetric case - when the sharing of\nnonlocality is considered across only one edge party. For simplicity, we first\nconsider the bilocal scenario $(n=2)$ with three inputs $m=3$ and demonstrate\nthat while in the symmetric case at most two sequential observers can share\nnonlocality, in the asymmetric case at most four sequential observers can share\nnonlocality. We extend the study to $n$-local scenario by assuming each party\nreceives three inputs and show that in the symmetric case the result remains\nthe same for any $n$, but in the asymmetrical case, an unbounded number of\nsequential observers can share nonlocality across one edge for a sufficiently\nlarge value of $n$. We further extend our result for arbitrary $m$ input in\n$n$-local scenario. We demonstrate that for $m\\geq 4$, in the symmetric case at\nmost one sequential observer can share nonlocality irrespective of the value of\n$n$. For the asymmetric case, we analytically show that there exists $n(k)$ for\nwhich an arbitrary $k$ number of sequential observers can share the nonlocality\nacross one edge.

            "summary": "Machine learning based solvers have garnered much attention in physical\nsimulation and scientific computing, with a prominent example, physics-informed\nneural networks (PINNs). However, PINNs often struggle to solve high-frequency\nand multi-scale PDEs, which can be due to spectral bias during neural network\ntraining. To address this problem, we resort to the Gaussian process (GP)\nframework. To flexibly capture the dominant frequencies, we model the power\nspectrum of the PDE solution with a student t mixture or Gaussian mixture. We\nthen apply the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the covariance function\n(according to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem). The covariance derived from the\nGaussian mixture spectrum corresponds to the known spectral mixture kernel. We\nare the first to discover its rationale and effectiveness for PDE solving.\nNext,we estimate the mixture weights in the log domain, which we show is\nequivalent to placing a Jeffreys prior. It automatically induces sparsity,\nprunes excessive frequencies, and adjusts the remaining toward the ground\ntruth. Third, to enable efficient and scalable computation on massive\ncollocation points, which are critical to capture high frequencies, we place\nthe collocation points on a grid, and multiply our covariance function at each\ninput dimension. We use the GP conditional mean to predict the solution and its\nderivatives so as to fit the boundary condition and the equation itself. As a\nresult, we can derive a Kronecker product structure in the covariance matrix.\nWe use Kronecker product properties and multilinear algebra to greatly promote\ncomputational efficiency and scalability, without any low-rank approximations.\nWe show the advantage of our method in systematic experiments.",

Neural Partial Differential Equations\n(Neural PDEs), which combine deep learning (DL) techniques with domain\nexpertise (e.g., governing equations) for parameterization, have proven to be\neffective in capturing valuable correlations within spatiotemporal datasets.\nHowever, sparse and noisy measurements coupled with modeling approximation\nintroduce aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Therefore, quantifying\nuncertainties propagated from model inputs to outputs remains a challenge and\nan essential goal for establishing the trustworthiness of Neural PDEs. This\nwork evaluates various Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) approaches for both\nForward and Inverse Problems in scientific applications. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of Bayesian methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo (HMC) and Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and a more conventional approach,\nDeep Ensembles (DE). To illustrate their performance, we take two canonical\nPDEs: Burger's equation and the Navier-Stokes equation. Our results indicate\nthat Neural PDEs can effectively reconstruct flow systems and predict the\nassociated unknown parameters. However, it is noteworthy that the results\nderived from Bayesian methods, based on our observations, tend to display a\nhigher degree of certainty in their predictions as compared to those obtained\nusing the DE. This elevated certainty in predictions suggests that Bayesian\ntechniques might underestimate the true underlying uncertainty, thereby\nappearing more confident in their predictions than the DE approach.",

Recent development of large models\nhas intensified the demand for faster search speeds and more accurate search\nresults. However, designing large models by NAS is challenging due to the\ndramatical increase of search space and the associated huge performance\nevaluation cost. Consider a typical modular search space widely used in NAS, in\nwhich a neural architecture consists of $m$ block nodes and a block node has\n$n$ alternative blocks. Facing the space containing $n^m$ candidate networks,\nexisting NAS methods attempt to find the best one by searching and evaluating\ncandidate networks directly.Different from the general strategy that takes\narchitecture search as a whole problem, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer\nstrategy by making use of the modular nature of the search space.Here, we\nintroduce MathNAS, a general NAS framework based on mathematical programming.In\nMathNAS, the performances of the $m*n$ possible building blocks in the search\nspace are calculated first, and then the performance of a network is directly\npredicted based on the performances of its building blocks. Although estimating\nblock performances involves network training, just as what happens for network\nperformance evaluation in existing NAS methods, predicting network performance\nis completely training-free and thus extremely fast. In contrast to the $n^m$\ncandidate networks to evaluate in existing NAS methods, which require training\nand a formidable computational burden, there are only $m*n$ possible blocks to\nhandle in MathNAS. Therefore, our approach effectively reduces the complexity\nof network performance evaluation.Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/wangqinsi1/MathNAS.",

Starting from the two-dimensional extension of the well known AKNS\nq,r system, three different cases are considered: (i) partial and full\nparity-time (PT) symmetric, (ii) reverse-time (RT) symmetric, and (iii) general\nq,r system. Through extensive numerical experiments, it is shown that collapse\nof Gaussian initial conditions depends on the value of its quasi-power. The\ncollapse dynamics (or lack thereof) strongly depends on whether the nonlocality\nis in space or time. A so-called quasi-variance identity is derived and its\nrelationship to blow-up is discussed. Numerical simulations reveal that this\nquantity reaching zero in finite time does not (in general) guarantee collapse.\nAn alternative approach to the study of wave collapse is presented via the\nstudy of transverse instability of line soliton solutions. In particular, the\nlinear stability problem for perturbed solitons is formulated for the nonlocal\nRT and PT symmetric nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations.

This paper proposes a novel transformer model for\nmassive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are\nubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical\nsimulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based\nservices (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for\nmassive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including\nimplicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in\ncontinuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high\ncomputational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points,\nand the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer\nmodel, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a\nquad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation.\nWe also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction\nconfidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a\ntheoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs.\nExtensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our\nmethod outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can\nscale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

            "summary": "In recent years, the scientific community has become increasingly interested\non peptides with non-canonical amino acids due to their superior stability and\nresistance to proteolytic degradation. These peptides present promising\nmodifications to biological, pharmacological, and physiochemical attributes in\nboth endogenous and engineered peptides. Notwithstanding their considerable\nadvantages, the scientific community exhibits a conspicuous absence of an\neffective pre-trained model adept at distilling feature representations from\nsuch complex peptide sequences. We herein propose PepLand, a novel pre-training\narchitecture for representation and property analysis of peptides spanning both\ncanonical and non-canonical amino acids. In essence, PepLand leverages a\ncomprehensive multi-view heterogeneous graph neural network tailored to unveil\nthe subtle structural representations of peptides. Empirical validations\nunderscore PepLand's effectiveness across an array of peptide property\npredictions, encompassing protein-protein interactions, permeability,\nsolubility, and synthesizability. The rigorous evaluation confirms PepLand's\nunparalleled capability in capturing salient synthetic peptide features,\nthereby laying a robust foundation for transformative advances in\npeptide-centric research domains.

            "summary": "Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is crucial for several applications, from\nvideo editing to video data generation. Training a VOS model requires an\nabundance of manually labeled training videos. The de-facto traditional way of\nannotating objects requires humans to draw detailed segmentation masks on the\ntarget objects at each video frame. This annotation process, however, is\ntedious and time-consuming. To reduce this annotation cost, in this paper, we\npropose EVA-VOS, a human-in-the-loop annotation framework for video object\nsegmentation. Unlike the traditional approach, we introduce an agent that\npredicts iteratively both which frame (\"What\") to annotate and which annotation\ntype (\"How\") to use. Then, the annotator annotates only the selected frame that\nis used to update a VOS module, leading to significant gains in annotation\ntime. We conduct experiments on the MOSE and the DAVIS datasets and we show\nthat: (a) EVA-VOS leads to masks with accuracy close to the human agreement\n3.5x faster than the standard way of annotating videos; (b) our frame selection\nachieves state-of-the-art performance; (c) EVA-VOS yields significant\nperformance gains in terms of annotation time compared to all other methods and\nbaselines.",

In contrast\nto many previous methods that are trained on small-scale datasets such as\nShapeNet in a category-specific fashion, LRM adopts a highly scalable\ntransformer-based architecture with 500 million learnable parameters to\ndirectly predict a neural radiance field (NeRF) from the input image. We train\nour model in an end-to-end manner on massive multi-view data containing around\n1 million objects, including both synthetic renderings from Objaverse and real\ncaptures from MVImgNet. This combination of a high-capacity model and\nlarge-scale training data empowers our model to be highly generalizable and\nproduce high-quality 3D reconstructions from various testing inputs including\nreal-world in-the-wild captures and images from generative models.

            "summary": "We present 3DiffTection, a state-of-the-art method for 3D object detection\nfrom single images, leveraging features from a 3D-aware diffusion model.\nAnnotating large-scale image data for 3D detection is resource-intensive and\ntime-consuming. Recently, pretrained large image diffusion models have become\nprominent as effective feature extractors for 2D perception tasks. However,\nthese features are initially trained on paired text and image data, which are\nnot optimized for 3D tasks, and often exhibit a domain gap when applied to the\ntarget data. Our approach bridges these gaps through two specialized tuning\nstrategies: geometric and semantic. For geometric tuning, we fine-tune a\ndiffusion model to perform novel view synthesis conditioned on a single image,\nby introducing a novel epipolar warp operator. This task meets two essential\ncriteria: the necessity for 3D awareness and reliance solely on posed image\ndata, which are readily available (e.g., from videos) and does not require\nmanual annotation. For semantic refinement, we further train the model on\ntarget data with detection supervision. Both tuning phases employ ControlNet to\npreserve the integrity of the original feature capabilities. In the final step,\nwe harness these enhanced capabilities to conduct a test-time prediction\nensemble across multiple virtual viewpoints. Through our methodology, we obtain\n3D-aware features that are tailored for 3D detection and excel in identifying\ncross-view point correspondences. Consequently, our model emerges as a powerful\n3D detector, substantially surpassing previous benchmarks, e.g., Cube-RCNN, a\nprecedent in single-view 3D detection by 9.43\\% in AP3D on the\nOmni3D-ARkitscene dataset. Furthermore, 3DiffTection showcases robust data\nefficiency and generalization to cross-domain data.",

In this series of papers, we explore the origin of\nsuch large brightness variability. In this first paper, we performed large GRRT\nparameter surveys that span from the optically thin to the optically thick\nregimes, covering $R_{\\rm Low}$ from $1$ to $60$. We find, depending on the\nmodel parameters that \\emph{i}) increasing $R_{\\rm Low}$ to a higher value\ncould systematically reduce $M_{\\Delta T}$, with $M_{\\Delta T}$ consistent with\nthe observed variability of Sgr~A* in some cases; and \\emph{ii}) increasing\n$R_{\\rm Low}$ would make $M_{\\Delta T}$ increase to a higher value. Our\nanalysis of GRRT image snapshots unravels the large $M_{\\Delta T}$ for the\n$R_{\\rm Low} = 1$ models mainly comes from the photon rings. However, secondary\ncontributions from the accretion flow are also visible depending on the spin\nparameter. Our work demonstrates the importance of the electron temperature\nused for modelling radiatively inefficient accretion flows and places new\nconstraints on the ion-electron temperature ratio.

As they cater to modern mobility demands,\nthey present significant safety challenges, especially when interacting with\npedestrians. In general, e-scooters are suggested to be ridden in bike\nlanes/sidewalks or share the road with cars at the maximum speed of about 15-20\nmph, which is more flexible and much faster than pedestrians and bicyclists.\nAccurate prediction of pedestrian movement, coupled with assistant motion\ncontrol of scooters, is essential in minimizing collision risks and seamlessly\nintegrating scooters in areas dense with pedestrians. Addressing these safety\nconcerns, our research introduces a novel e-Scooter collision avoidance system\n(eCAS) with a method for predicting pedestrian trajectories, employing an\nadvanced LSTM network integrated with a state refinement module. This proactive\nmodel is designed to ensure unobstructed movement in areas with substantial\npedestrian traffic without collisions. Results are validated on two public\ndatasets, ETH and UCY, providing encouraging outcomes. Our model demonstrated\nproficiency in anticipating pedestrian paths and augmented scooter path\nplanning, allowing for heightened adaptability in densely populated locales.\nThis study shows the potential of melding pedestrian trajectory prediction with\nscooter motion planning.

While these approaches have played a\ncentral role in studying the mechanics underlying epidemics, we lack ways to\nreliably predict how the relationship between virulence (the harm to hosts\ncaused by an infection) and transmission will evolve in certain virus-host\ncontexts. In this study, we invoke evolutionary invasion analysis -- a method\nused to identify the evolution of uninvadable strategies in dynamical systems\n-- to examine how the virulence-transmission dichotomy can evolve in models of\nvirus infections defined by different natural histories. We reveal that\npeculiar ecologies drive different evolved relationships between virulence and\ntransmission. Specifically, we discover patterns of virulence evolution between\nepidemics of various kinds (SARS-CoV-2 and hepatitis C virus) and that varying\ndefinitions of virulence alter our predictions for how viruses will evolve. We\ndiscuss the findings in light of contemporary conversations in the public\nhealth sector around the possibility of predicting virus evolution and in more\nextensive theoretical discussions involving virulence evolution in emerging\ninfectious diseases.",

            "summary": "The presence of distant protoplanets could explain the observed gaps in dust\nemission in protoplanetary disks. Here we derive a novel analytical model to\ndescribe the temporal decay of the pebble flux through a protoplanetary disk as\na result of radial drift. This allows us to investigate the growth and\nmigration of distant protoplanets throughout the lifespan of the disk. We find\nthat early-formed Moon-mass protoplanets can grow to their pebble isolation\nmass between approximately $20$ and $80\\,M_{\\oplus}$ within less than\n$1\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ in the $20$ to $80\\,\\mathrm{AU}$ region around solar-like\nstars. Subsequent fast migration at the early stages of gas accretion after\npebble accretion has been halted nevertheless transports these giant planets\ninto final orbits at $<\\,$$10\\,\\mathrm{AU}$. However, our pebble decay model\nallows us to include a new pathway which can trigger the transition from pebble\naccretion to gas accretion after the pebble flux has decayed substantially.\nWith this pebble decay pathway, we show that it is possible to form gas giants\nalso beyond $10\\,\\mathrm{AU}$. The occurrence of these wide-orbit gas giants\nshould be relatively low, since their core must attain sufficient mass to\naccrete gas before the pebble flux decays while avoiding excessive migration.\nSince these gas giants do not reach the pebble isolation mass, their heavy\nelement content is typically less than $10\\,M_{\\oplus}$. Our results imply that\nthe observed gaps in protoplanetary disks could be caused by distant\nprotoplanets that reached the pebble isolation mass and then migrated, while\ngas giants in wide orbits, such as PDS 70 b and c, accreted their gas after the\ndecay in the pebble flux.",

In Paper I, we proved that this DF\ncannot have been produced by Galactic tidal torques starting from any realistic\nDF that was not already superthermal. Here, we consider the other major\ndynamical effect on wide binaries: encounters with passing stars. We derive and\nsolve the Fokker-Planck equation governing the evolution of binaries in\nsemimajor axis and eccentricity under many weak, impulsive, penetrative stellar\nencounters. We show analytically that these encounters drive the eccentricity\nDF towards thermal on the same timescale as they drive the semimajor axes $a$\ntowards ionization, $t_\\mathrm{ion} \\sim\n4\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}\\,(a/10^4\\,\\mathrm{AU})^{-1}$. We conclude that the observed\nsuperthermal DF must derive from an even more superthermal (i.e. higher\n$\\alpha$) birth distribution. This requirement rules out the possibility that\nmost wide binaries are formed via e.g. the dissolution of stellar clusters, and\ninstead favors a turbulent fragmentation scenario.

So far, controlling the N\\'eel order parameter electrically is limited\nto only very few materials where N\\'eel spin-orbit torques are allowed by\nsymmetry. In this work, we show that coupling a thin ferromagnet (permalloy)\nlayer on top of an antiferromagnet (Mn$_2$Au) solves a major roadblock -- the\ncontrolled reading, writing, and manipulation of antiferromagnetic domains. We\nconfirm by atomistic spin dynamics simulations that the domain wall patterns in\nthe Mn$_2$Au are imprinted on the permalloy, therefore allowing for indirect\nimaging of the N\\'eel order parameter. Our simulations show that the coupled\ndomain wall structures in Mn$_2$Au-Py bilayers can be manipulated by either\nacting on the N\\'eel order parameter via N\\'eel spin-orbit torques or by acting\non the magnetisation (the ferromagnetic order parameter) via magnetic fields.\nIn both cases, we predict ultra-high domain wall speeds on the order of 8.5\nkm/s. Thus, employing a thin ferromagnetic layer has the potential to easily\ncontrol the N\\'eel order parameter in antiferromagnets even where N\\'eel\nspin-orbit torques are forbidden by symmetry.

We quantify this bias and\nfind that after correction, the median $\\beta_{SED,corr} = -2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$.\nWe measure physical properties for our galaxies with Bagpipes and find that our\nfaint ($M_{UV} = -18.1^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$) sample is low mass\n(${log}[M_{\\ast}/M_\\odot] = 7.7^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$), fairly dust-poor ($A_{v} =\n0.1^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ mag), and modestly young (${log[age]} = 7.8^{+0.2}_{-0.8}$\nyr) with a median star formation rate of $\\mathrm{log(SFR)} =\n-0.3^{+0.4}_{-0.4} M_\\odot{/yr}$. We find no strong evidence for ultra-blue UV\nspectral slopes ($\\beta$ ~ -3) within our sample, as would be expected for\nexotically metal-poor ($Z/Z_{\\odot}$ < 10$^{-3}$) stellar populations with very\nhigh LyC escape fractions. Our observations are consistent with model\npredictions that galaxies of these stellar masses at z~9-16 should have only\nmodestly low metallicities ($Z/Z_{\\odot}$ ~ 0.1--0.2).",

            "summary": "We present a semi-analytic model for the growth, drift, desorption, and\nfragmentation of millimeter- to meter-sized particles in protoplanetary disks.\nFragmentation occurs where particle collision velocities exceed critical\nfragmentation velocities. Using this criterion, we produce fragmentation\nregions in disk orbital radius-particle size phase space for particles with a\nrange of material properties, structures, and compositions (including SiO$_2$,\nMg$_2$SiO$_4$, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO). For reasonable disk conditions, compact\naggregate H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ice particles do not reach destructive\nrelative velocities and are thus not likely to undergo collisional\nfragmentation. Uncoated silicate particles are more susceptible to collisional\ndestruction and are expected to fragment in the inner disk, consistent with\nprevious work. We then calculate the growth, drift, and sublimation of small\nparticles, initially located in the outer disk. We find that ice-coated\nparticles can avoid fragmentation as they grow and drift inward under a\nsubstantial range of disk conditions as long as the particles are aggregates\ncomposed of 0.1 $\\mu$m-sized monomers. Such particles may undergo runaway\ngrowth in disk regions abundant in H$_2$O or CO$_2$ ice depending on the\nassumed disk temperature structure. These results indicate that icy collisional\ngrowth to planetesimally-relevant sizes may happen efficiently throughout a\ndisk's lifetime, and is particularly robust at early times when the disk's\ndust-to-gas ratio is comparable to that of the interstellar medium.",

Moreover, simulations predict bars to be almost absent\nbeyond $z = 1.5$ in the progenitors of Milky Way-like galaxies. Here we report\nobservations of ceers-2112, a barred spiral galaxy at redshift $z_{\\rm phot}\n\\sim 3$, which was already mature when the Universe was only 2 Gyr old. The\nstellar mass ($M_{\\star} = 3.9 \\times 10^9 M_{\\odot}$) and barred morphology\nmean that ceers-2112 can be considered a progenitor of the Milky Way, in terms\nof both structure and mass-assembly history in the first 2 Gyr of the Universe,\nand was the closest in mass in the first 4 Gyr. We infer that baryons in\ngalaxies could have already dominated over dark matter at $z \\sim 3$, that\nhigh-redshift bars could form in approximately 400 Myr and that dynamically\ncold stellar disks could have been in place by redshift $z = 4-5$ (more than 12\nGyrs ago).",

These data cover ~90 arcmin^2 (10 NIRCam pointings) in six\nbroad-band and one medium-band imaging filter. With this sample we confirm at\nhigher confidence early JWST conclusions that bright galaxies in this epoch are\nmore abundant than predicted by most theoretical models. We construct the\nrest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions at z~9, 11 and 14, and show that\nthe space density of bright (M_UV=-20) galaxies changes only modestly from z~14\nto z~9, compared to a steeper increase from z~8 to z~4. While our candidates\nare photometrically selected, spectroscopic followup has now confirmed 13 of\nthem, with only one significant interloper, implying that the fidelity of this\nsample is high. Successfully explaining the evidence for a flatter evolution in\nthe number densities of UV-bright z>10 galaxies may thus require changes to the\ndominant physical processes regulating star formation. While our results\nindicate that significant variations of dust attenuation with redshift are\nunlikely to be the dominant factor at these high redshifts, they are consistent\nwith predictions from models which naturally have enhanced star-formation\nefficiency and/or stochasticity. An evolving stellar initial mass function\ncould also bring model predictions into better agreement with our results. Deep\nspectroscopic followup of a large sample of early galaxies can distinguish\nbetween these competing scenarios.",

We reduce the problem to\nthe study of geodesics on the manifold of Schmidt coefficients, equipped with\nan appropriate metric. Binding complexity is closely related to other\nquantities such as distributed computing and quantum communication complexity,\nand has a proposed holographic dual in the context of AdS/CFT. For finite\ndimensional systems with a Riemannian norm, we find an exact relation between\nbinding complexity and the minimal R\\'enyi entropy. We also find analytic\nresults for the most commonly used non-Riemannian norm (the so-called $F_1$\nnorm) and provide lower bounds for the associated notion of state complexity\nubiquitous in quantum computation and holography. We argue that our results are\nvalid for a large class of penalty factors assigned to generators acting across\nthe subsystems. We demonstrate that our results can be borrowed to study the\nusual complexity (not-binding) for a single spin for the case of the $F_1$ norm\nwhich was previously lacking from the literature.

            "summary": "Garment sewing pattern represents the intrinsic rest shape of a garment, and\nis the core for many applications like fashion design, virtual try-on, and\ndigital avatars. In this work, we explore the challenging problem of recovering\ngarment sewing patterns from daily photos for augmenting these applications. To\nsolve the problem, we first synthesize a versatile dataset, named SewFactory,\nwhich consists of around 1M images and ground-truth sewing patterns for model\ntraining and quantitative evaluation. SewFactory covers a wide range of human\nposes, body shapes, and sewing patterns, and possesses realistic appearances\nthanks to the proposed human texture synthesis network. Then, we propose a\ntwo-level Transformer network called Sewformer, which significantly improves\nthe sewing pattern prediction performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework is effective in recovering sewing patterns and well\ngeneralizes to casually-taken human photos. Code, dataset, and pre-trained\nmodels are available at: https://sewformer.github.io.",

            "summary": "Debris discs are our best means to probe the outer regions of planetary\nsystems. Many studies assume that planets lie at the inner edges of debris\ndiscs, akin to Neptune and the Kuiper Belt, and use the disc morphologies to\nconstrain those otherwise-undetectable planets. However, this produces a\ndegeneracy in planet mass and semimajor axis. We investigate the effect of a\nsculpting planet on the radial surface-density profile at the disc inner edge,\nand show that this degeneracy can be broken by considering the steepness of the\nedge profile. Like previous studies, we show that a planet on a circular orbit\nejects unstable debris and excites surviving material through mean-motion\nresonances. For a non-migrating, circular-orbit planet, in the case where\ncollisions are negligible, the steepness of the disc inner edge depends on the\nplanet-to-star mass ratio and the initial-disc excitation level. We provide a\nsimple analytic model to infer planet properties from the steepness of\nALMA-resolved disc edges. We also perform a collisional analysis, showing that\na purely planet-sculpted disc would be distinguishable from a purely\ncollisional disc and that, whilst collisions flatten planet-sculpted edges,\nthey are unlikely to fully erase a planet's signature. Finally, we apply our\nresults to ALMA-resolved debris discs and show that, whilst many inner edges\nare too steep to be explained by collisions alone, they are too flat to arise\nthrough completed sculpting by non-migrating, circular-orbit planets. We\ndiscuss implications of this for the architectures, histories and dynamics in\nthe outer regions of planetary systems.",

To remedy this deficiency, we propose Video Instance\nMatting~(VIM), that is, estimating alpha mattes of each instance at each frame\nof a video sequence. To tackle this challenging problem, we present MSG-VIM, a\nMask Sequence Guided Video Instance Matting neural network, as a novel baseline\nmodel for VIM. MSG-VIM leverages a mixture of mask augmentations to make\npredictions robust to inaccurate and inconsistent mask guidance. It\nincorporates temporal mask and temporal feature guidance to improve the\ntemporal consistency of alpha matte predictions. Furthermore, we build a new\nbenchmark for VIM, called VIM50, which comprises 50 video clips with multiple\nhuman instances as foreground objects. To evaluate performances on the VIM\ntask, we introduce a suitable metric called Video Instance-aware Matting\nQuality~(VIMQ). Our proposed model MSG-VIM sets a strong baseline on the VIM50\nbenchmark and outperforms existing methods by a large margin. The project is\nopen-sourced at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/VIM.",

            "summary": "Product attribute value extraction is an important task in e-Commerce which\ncan help several downstream applications such as product search and\nrecommendation. Most previous models handle this task using sequence labeling\nor question answering method which rely on the sequential position information\nof values in the product text and are vulnerable to data discrepancy between\ntraining and testing. This limits their generalization ability to real-world\nscenario in which each product can have multiple descriptions across various\nshopping platforms with different composition of text and style. They also have\nlimited zero-shot ability to new values. In this paper, we propose a multi-task\nlearning model with value generation/classification and attribute prediction\ncalled JPAVE to predict values without the necessity of position information of\nvalues in the text. Furthermore, the copy mechanism in value generator and the\nvalue attention module in value classifier help our model address the data\ndiscrepancy issue by only focusing on the relevant part of input text and\nignoring other information which causes the discrepancy issue such as sentence\nstructure in the text. Besides, two variants of our model are designed for\nopen-world and closed-world scenarios. In addition, copy mechanism introduced\nin the first variant based on value generation can improve its zero-shot\nability for identifying unseen values. Experimental results on a public dataset\ndemonstrate the superiority of our model compared with strong baselines and its\ngeneralization ability of predicting new values.",

Motivated by a recent\ndissipation anomaly construction for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations by Bru\\`e\nand De Lellis (2023), we prove the existence of various scenarios in the limit\nof vanishing viscosity: the total and partial loss of the energy due to\ndissipation anomaly, dissipation anomaly and anomalous dissipation with a\ncontinuous energy limit, anomalous dissipation without dissipation anomaly, and\nthe existence of infinitely many limiting solutions of the Euler equations in\nthe limit of vanishing viscosity. We also discover a relation between\ndissipation anomaly and the discontinuity of the energy of the limit solution.\nFinally, expanding on the obtained total dissipation anomaly construction, we\nshow the existence of dissipation anomaly for long time averages, relevant for\nturbulent flows, proving that the Doering-Foias (2002) upper bound is sharp.",

            "summary": "In many countries financial service providers have to elicit their customers\nrisk preferences, when offering products and services. For instance, in the\nNetherlands pension funds will be legally obliged to factor in their clients\nrisk preferences when devising their investment strategies. Therefore,\nassessing and measuring the risk preferences of individuals is critical for the\nanalysis of individuals' behavior and policy prescriptions. In the psychology\nand economics, a number of methods to elicit risk preferences have been\ndeveloped using hypothetical scenarios and economic experiments. These methods\nof eliciting individual risk preferences are usually applied to small samples\nbecause they are expensive and the implementation can be complex and not\nsuitable when large cohorts need to be measured. A large number of supervised\nlearning models ranging from linear regression to support vector machines are\nused to predict risk preference measures using socio-economic register data\nsuch as age, gender, migration background and other demographic variables in\ncombination with data on income, wealth, pension fund contributions, and other\nfinancial data. The employed machine learning models cover a range of\nassumptions and properties as well as a diverse set of regression metrics. The\noptimum model is selected using the metrics and interpretability of the model.\nThe optimal models are lasso regression and gradient boosting machines with\nmean average percentage error of about 30%. This is important as it helps to\nestimate risk attitudes without actually measuring them. It should be noted\nthat with the current accuracy the tested models are not ready for deployment\nfor applications that require high accuracy. However, the results do indicate\nwhich models should be used in situations that do not require the most accurate\npredictions such as augmentation data for pensions' recommendation.",

            "summary": "We identify a new phenomenon in neural network optimization which arises from\nthe interaction of depth and a particular heavy-tailed structure in natural\ndata. Our result offers intuitive explanations for several previously reported\nobservations about network training dynamics. In particular, it implies a\nconceptually new cause for progressive sharpening and the edge of stability; we\nalso highlight connections to other concepts in optimization and generalization\nincluding grokking, simplicity bias, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization.\n  Experimentally, we demonstrate the significant influence of paired groups of\noutliers in the training data with strong opposing signals: consistent, large\nmagnitude features which dominate the network output throughout training and\nprovide gradients which point in opposite directions. Due to these outliers,\nearly optimization enters a narrow valley which carefully balances the opposing\ngroups; subsequent sharpening causes their loss to rise rapidly, oscillating\nbetween high on one group and then the other, until the overall loss spikes. We\ndescribe how to identify these groups, explore what sets them apart, and\ncarefully study their effect on the network's optimization and behavior. We\ncomplement these experiments with a mechanistic explanation on a toy example of\nopposing signals and a theoretical analysis of a two-layer linear network on a\nsimple model. Our finding enables new qualitative predictions of training\nbehavior which we confirm experimentally. It also provides a new lens through\nwhich to study and improve modern training practices for stochastic\noptimization, which we highlight via a case study of Adam versus SGD.",
