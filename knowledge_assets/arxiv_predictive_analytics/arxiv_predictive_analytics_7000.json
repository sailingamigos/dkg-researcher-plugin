            "summary": "Despite being the go-to choice for link prediction on knowledge graphs,\nresearch on interpretability of knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) has been\nrelatively unexplored. We present KGEx, a novel post-hoc method that explains\nindividual link predictions by drawing inspiration from surrogate models\nresearch. Given a target triple to predict, KGEx trains surrogate KGE models\nthat we use to identify important training triples. To gauge the impact of a\ntraining triple, we sample random portions of the target triple neighborhood\nand we train multiple surrogate KGE models on each of them. To ensure\nfaithfulness, each surrogate is trained by distilling knowledge from the\noriginal KGE model. We then assess how well surrogates predict the target\ntriple being explained, the intuition being that those leading to faithful\npredictions have been trained on impactful neighborhood samples. Under this\nassumption, we then harvest triples that appear frequently across impactful\nneighborhoods. We conduct extensive experiments on two publicly available\ndatasets, to demonstrate that KGEx is capable of providing explanations\nfaithful to the black-box model.",

The former is an extended black-hole entropy that\narises from non-extensive statistics and quantum geometry and is quantified by\na new dimensionless parameter $q$, which possesses standard holographic dark\nenergy as a particular sub-case. In the future event horizon as the Infrared\ncutoff, we provide a simple differential equation for the dark energy density\nparameter, as well as an analytical expressions for the corresponding\nequation-of-state and deceleration parameters. We show that the scenario at\nhand can describe successfully the usual thermal history of the Universe, with\nthe sequence of matter and dark-energy epochs, while the transition to\nacceleration takes place at $z\\approx 0.6$. Additionally, according to the\nvalue of the new entropic parameter $q$, the dark energy equation-of-state\nparameter can have a rich behavior, and it can be quintessence-like,\nphantom-like, or experience the phantom-divide crossing.",

            "summary": "The charge equilibration of laser-accelerated carbon ion beams in 2 mg/cm3\nfoam target was investigated experimentally. The ions were generated through\ntarget normal sheath acceleration mechanism in laser-foil interaction scheme.\nThis allows to get the equilibrium charge state in wide energy range near Bragg\npeak within a single shot. By using foam, the charge equilibration measurement\nin density regime between gas and solid state was firstly reached out\nexperimentally. It was found that the theoretical predictions with tabulated\ncross section data for gas target greatly underestimated the charge states. The\nexperimental data are in close agreement with both semi-empirical formula as\nwell as rate equation predictions based on ion-solid interactions. The\nimportant role of target density effects that increase the ionization\nprobability and decrease the electron capture probability through frequent\nmulti-collisions in foam are demonstrated. The double electron processes are\nshown to have little influence on the average charge states. The findings are\nessential for high energy density physics research where the foams are widely\nused, and have impacts on a broad range of applications in medical, biological\nand material fields. The method also provides a new approach to investigate the\ninteraction mechanism of swift heavy ions in matter by taking advantage of the\nlaser-accelerated short-pulse wide-energy range ions.",

            "summary": "Despite the remarkable advances in language modeling, current mainstream\ndecoding methods still struggle to generate texts that align with human texts\nacross different aspects. In particular, sampling-based methods produce\nless-repetitive texts which are often disjunctive in discourse, while\nsearch-based methods maintain topic coherence at the cost of increased\nrepetition. Overall, these methods fall short in achieving holistic alignment\nacross a broad range of aspects. In this work, we frame decoding from a\nlanguage model as an optimization problem with the goal of strictly matching\nthe expected performance with human texts measured by multiple metrics of\ndesired aspects simultaneously. The resulting decoding distribution enjoys an\nanalytical solution that scales the input language model distribution via a\nsequence-level energy function defined by these metrics. And most importantly,\nwe prove that this induced distribution is guaranteed to improve the perplexity\non human texts, which suggests a better approximation to the underlying\ndistribution of human texts. To facilitate tractable sampling from this\nglobally normalized distribution, we adopt the Sampling-Importance-Resampling\ntechnique. Experiments on various domains and model scales demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method in metrics alignment with human texts and human\nevaluation over strong baselines.",

            "summary": "Fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication networks have recently emerged in\nvarious fields, including highspeed trains. However, the dense deployment of 5G\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) base stations (BSs) and the high speed of moving\ntrains lead to frequent handovers (HOs), which can adversely affect the\nQuality-of-Service (QoS) of mobile users. As a result, HO optimization and\nresource allocation are essential considerations for managing mobility in\nhigh-speed train systems. In this paper, we model system performance of a\nhigh-speed train system with a novel machine learning (ML) approach that is\nnested cross validation scheme that prevents information leakage from model\nevaluation into the model parameter tuning, thereby avoiding overfitting and\nresulting in better generalization error. To this end, we employ ML methods for\nthe high-speed train system scenario. Handover Margin (HOM) and Time-to-Trigger\n(TTT) values are used as features, and several KPIs are used as outputs, and\nseveral ML methods including Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Adaptive\nBoosting (AdaBoost), CatBoost Regression (CBR), Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and\nk-Nearest Neighbor Regression (KNNR) are employed for the problem. Finally,\nperformance comparisons of the cross validation schemes with the methods are\nmade in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) metrics\nare made. As per obtained results, boosting methods, ABR, CBR, GBR, with nested\ncross validation scheme superiorly outperforms conventional cross validation\nscheme results with the same methods. On the other hand, SVR, KNRR, KRR, ANN\nwith the nested scheme produce promising results for prediction of some KPIs\nwith respect to their conventional scheme employment.",

Recently,\nastrometric observations of Jupiter and Saturn systems have challenged our\nunderstanding of their formation and evolution, with stronger tidal dissipation\nin these planets than previously predicted, in contrast to what appears to be\nweaker in gas giant exoplanets. These new constraints are motivating the\ndevelopment of realistic models of tidal dissipation inside these planets. At\nthe same time, the Juno and Cassini space missions have revolutionised our\nknowledge of the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn, whose structure is a\ncombination of stably stratified zones and convective regions. In this work, we\npresent results of hydrodynamical calculations modelling tidal waves and their\ndissipation in Jupiter, taking for the first time the latest, state-of-the-art\ninterior model of the planet. We performed 2D numerical simulations of linear\ntidal gravito-inertial waves that propagate and dissipate within Jupiter\ninterior by taking into account viscous, thermal and chemical diffusions. This\nnew model allows us to explore the properties of the dissipation and the\nassociated tidal torque as a function of all the key hydrodynamical and\nstructural parameters.",

Path\nloss has a landmark importance in network performance optimization, and\naccurate prediction of the path loss, which characterizes the attenuation of\nsignal power during transmission, is critical for effective network planning,\ncoverage estimation, and optimization. In this sense, we utilize machine\nlearning (ML) methods, which overcome conventional path loss prediction models\ndrawbacks, for path loss prediction in a 5G network system to facilitate more\naccurate network planning, resource optimization, and performance improvement\nin wireless communication systems. To this end, we utilize a novel approach,\nnested cross validation scheme, with ML to prevent overfitting, thereby getting\nbetter generalization error and stable results for ML deployment. First, we\nacquire a publicly available dataset obtained through a comprehensive\nmeasurement campaign conducted in an urban macro-cell scenario located in\nBeijing, China. The dataset includes crucial information such as longitude,\nlatitude, elevation, altitude, clutter height, and distance, which are utilized\nas essential features to predict the path loss in the 5G network system. We\ndeploy Support Vector Regression (SVR), CatBoost Regression (CBR), eXtreme\nGradient Boosting Regression (XGBR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and\nRandom Forest (RF) methods to predict the path loss, and compare the prediction\nresults in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Square Error (MSE). As\nper obtained results, XGBR outperforms the rest of the methods. It outperforms\nCBR with a slight performance differences by 0.4 % and 1 % in terms of MAE and\nMSE metrics, respectively. On the other hand, it outperforms the rest of the\nmethods with clear performance differences.",

However, when it\ncomes to low-level vision such as image restoration their performance\ndeteriorates dramatically due to corrupted inputs. In this paper, we present a\ndegradation-aware vision-language model (DA-CLIP) to better transfer pretrained\nvision-language models to low-level vision tasks as a universal framework for\nimage restoration. More specifically, DA-CLIP trains an additional controller\nthat adapts the fixed CLIP image encoder to predict high-quality feature\nembeddings. By integrating the embedding into an image restoration network via\ncross-attention, we are able to pilot the model to learn a high-fidelity image\nreconstruction. The controller itself will also output a degradation feature\nthat matches the real corruptions of the input, yielding a natural classifier\nfor different degradation types. In addition, we construct a mixed degradation\ndataset with synthetic captions for DA-CLIP training. Our approach advances\nstate-of-the-art performance on both degradation-specific and unified image\nrestoration tasks, showing a promising direction of prompting image restoration\nwith large-scale pretrained vision-language models.

It reduces the\nincreasing communication traffic for gradient aggregation. However, existing\nsparsifiers have poor scalability because of the high computational cost of\ngradient selection and/or increase in communication traffic. In particular, an\nincrease in communication traffic is caused by gradient build-up and\ninappropriate threshold for gradient selection.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel gradient sparsification\nmethod called MiCRO. In MiCRO, the gradient vector is partitioned, and each\npartition is assigned to the corresponding worker. Each worker then selects\ngradients from its partition, and the aggregated gradients are free from\ngradient build-up. Moreover, MiCRO estimates the accurate threshold to maintain\nthe communication traffic as per user requirement by minimising the compression\nratio error. MiCRO enables near-zero cost gradient sparsification by solving\nexisting problems that hinder the scalability and acceleration of distributed\nDNN training.

            "summary": "LiDAR-based 3D object detectors have achieved unprecedented speed and\naccuracy in autonomous driving applications. However, similar to other neural\nnetworks, they are often biased toward high-confidence predictions or return\ndetections where no real object is present. These types of detections can lead\nto a less reliable environment perception, severely affecting the functionality\nand safety of autonomous vehicles. We address this problem by proposing LS-VOS,\na framework for identifying outliers in 3D object detections. Our approach\nbuilds on the idea of Virtual Outlier Synthesis (VOS), which incorporates\noutlier knowledge during training, enabling the model to learn more compact\ndecision boundaries. In particular, we propose a new synthesis approach that\nrelies on the latent space of an auto-encoder network to generate outlier\nfeatures with a parametrizable degree of similarity to in-distribution\nfeatures. In extensive experiments, we show that our approach improves the\noutlier detection capabilities of a state-of-the-art object detector while\nmaintaining high 3D object detection performance.",

Our work\nexplores this phenomenon in graph neural networks by investigating differences\nbetween models differing only in their initializations in their utilized\nfeatures for predictions. We propose a novel metric called Influence Difference\n(ID) to quantify the variation in reasons used by nodes across models by\ncomparing their influence distribution. Additionally, we consider the\ndifferences between nodes with a stable and an unstable prediction, positing\nthat both equally utilize different reasons and thus provide a meaningful\ngradient signal to closely match two models even when the predictions for nodes\nare similar. Based on our analysis, we propose to minimize this ID in Knowledge\nDistillation, a domain where a new model should closely match an established\none. As an efficient approximation, we introduce DropDistillation (DD) that\nmatches the output for a graph perturbed by edge deletions. Our empirical\nevaluation of six benchmark datasets for node classification validates the\ndifferences in utilized features.

In this paper, we propose to\nutilize social media retweeting activity data to enhance the learning of event\nparticipant prediction models. We create a joint knowledge graph to bridge the\nsocial media and the target domain, assuming that event descriptions and tweets\nare written in the same language. Furthermore, we propose a learning model that\nutilizes retweeting information for the target domain prediction more\neffectively. We conduct comprehensive experiments in two scenarios with\nreal-world data. In each scenario, we set up training data of different sizes,\nas well as warm and cold test cases.

The ore recovery depends on the\nmineralogical composition, which needs to be properly captured by the model to\nallow for good predictions. Multivariate modeling must also capture the\nbehavior of tailings and waste materials to understand the environmental risks\ninvolved in their disposal. However, multivariate spatial modeling is\nchallenging when the variables show complex relationships, such as non-linear\ncorrelation, heteroscedastic behavior, or spatial trends. This contribution\nproposes a novel methodology for general multivariate contexts, with the idea\nof disaggregating the global non-linear behavior among variables into the\nspatial domain in a piece-wise linear fashion. We demonstrate that the complex\nmultivariate behavior can be reproduced by looking at local correlations\nbetween variables at sample locations, inferred from a local neighborhood, and\ninterpolating these local linear dependencies by using a non-stationary version\nof the Linear Model of Coregionalization. This mixture of locally varying\nlinear correlations is combined to reproduce the global complex behavior seen\nin the multivariate distribution. The main challenge is to solve appropriately\nthe interpolation of the known correlation matrices over the domain, as these\nlocal correlations defined at sample locations can be endowed with a manifold\nstructure, on which the Euclidean distance is not a suitable metric for\ninterpolation of such correlations. This is addressed by using tools from\nRiemannian geometry: correlation matrices are interpolated using a weighted\nFr\\'echet mean of the correlations inferred at sample locations. An application\nof the procedure is shown in a real case study with good results in terms of\naccuracy and reproduction of the reference multivariate distributions and\nsemi-variograms.",

Based on this, we propose a\nnatural resolution to the horizon problem in cosmology.

            "summary": "The stress intensity factor is important for understanding crack initiation\nand propagation. Because it cannot be measured directly, the characterization\nof the stress intensity factor relies on the measurement of deformation around\na crack tip. Such measurements are challenging for dynamic fracture of brittle\nmaterials where the deformation is small and the crack tip velocity can be high\n(>1 km/s). Digital gradient sensing (DGS) is capable of full-field measurement\nof surface deformation with sub-microsecond temporal resolution, but it is\nlimited to centimeter-scale specimens and has a spatial resolution of only\n$\\sim 1$mm. This limits its ability to measure deformations close to the crack\ntip. Here, we demonstrate the potential of Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing\n(SHWFS), as an alternative to DGS, for measuring surface deformation during\ndynamic brittle fracture of millimeter-scale specimens. Using an commercial\nglass ceramic as an example material, we demonstrate the capability of SHWFS to\nmeasure the surface slope evolution induced by a propagating crack on\nmillimeter-scale specimens with a micrometer-scale spatial resolution and a\nsub-microsecond temporal resolution. The SHWFS apparatus has the additional\nadvantage of being physically more compact than a typical DGS apparatus. We\nverify our SHWFS measurements by comparing them with analytical predictions and\nphase-field simulations of the surface slope around a crack tip. Then, fitting\nthe surface slope measurements to the asymptotic crack-tip field solution, we\nextract the evolution of the apparent stress intensity factor associated with\nthe propagating crack tip. We conclude by discussing potential future\nenhancements of this technique and how its compactness could enable the\nintegration with other characterization techniques including x-ray\nphase-contrast imaging (XPCI) toward a multi-modal characterization.",

We regulate this\ndivergence by retaining the leading finite temperature correction in the NHEK\nscaling limit. This \"not-NHEK\" geometry lifts the eigenvalues of the zero\nmodes, rendering the path integral infrared finite.

However, the use of inverse modeling is limited for\nill-posed, high-dimensional applications due to computational costs and poor\nprediction accuracy with sparse datasets. In this paper, we combine Wasserstein\nGenerative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), a deep\ngenerative model that can accurately capture complex subsurface structure, and\nEnsemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA), an ensemble-based\ninversion method, for accurate and accelerated subsurface characterization.\nWGAN-GP is trained to generate high-dimensional K fields from a low-dimensional\nlatent space and ES-MDA then updates the latent variables by assimilating\navailable measurements. Several subsurface examples are used to evaluate the\naccuracy and efficiency of the proposed method and the main features of the\nunknown K fields are characterized accurately with reliable uncertainty\nquantification. Furthermore, the estimation performance is compared with a\nwidely-used variational, i.e., optimization-based, inversion approach, and the\nproposed approach outperforms the variational inversion method, especially for\nthe channelized and fractured field examples. We explain such superior\nperformance by visualizing the objective function in the latent space: because\nof nonlinear and aggressive dimension reduction via generative modeling, the\nobjective function surface becomes extremely complex while the ensemble\napproximation can smooth out the multi-modal surface during the minimization.\nThis suggests that the ensemble-based approach works well over the variational\napproach when combined with deep generative models at the cost of forward model\nruns unless convergence-ensuring modifications are implemented in the\nvariational inversion.",

            "summary": "The kinematics of human movements and locomotion are closely linked to the\nactivation and contractions of muscles. To investigate this, we present a\nmultimodal dataset with benchmarks collected using a novel pair of Intelligent\nKnee Sleeves (Texavie MarsWear Knee Sleeves) for human pose estimation. Our\nsystem utilizes synchronized datasets that comprise time-series data from the\nKnee Sleeves and the corresponding ground truth labels from the visualized\nmotion capture camera system. We employ these to generate 3D human models\nsolely based on the wearable data of individuals performing different\nactivities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this camera-free system and\nmachine learning algorithms in the assessment of various movements and\nexercises, including extension to unseen exercises and individuals. The results\nshow an average error of 7.21 degrees across all eight lower body joints when\ncompared to the ground truth, indicating the effectiveness and reliability of\nthe Knee Sleeve system for the prediction of different lower body joints beyond\nthe knees. The results enable human pose estimation in a seamless manner\nwithout being limited by visual occlusion or the field of view of cameras. Our\nresults show the potential of multimodal wearable sensing in a variety of\napplications from home fitness to sports, healthcare, and physical\nrehabilitation focusing on pose and movement estimation.",

Large scale, high\nresolution data derived from these sensors can be used to inform intervention\nand policy decision making, but the timeliness and accuracy of these\ninterventions is limited by use of optical data, which cannot operate at night\nand is affected by adverse weather conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\noffers a robust alternative to optical data, but its associated complexities\nlimit the scope of labelled data generation for traditional deep learning. In\nthis work, we apply a self-supervised pretraining scheme, masked autoencoding,\nto SAR amplitude data covering 8.7\\% of the Earth's land surface area, and tune\nthe pretrained weights on two downstream tasks crucial to monitoring climate\nchange - vegetation cover prediction and land cover classification. We show\nthat the use of this pretraining scheme reduces labelling requirements for the\ndownstream tasks by more than an order of magnitude, and that this pretraining\ngeneralises geographically, with the performance gain increasing when tuned\ndownstream on regions outside the pretraining set. Our findings significantly\nadvance climate change mitigation by facilitating the development of task and\nregion-specific SAR models, allowing local communities and organizations to\ndeploy tailored solutions for rapid, accurate monitoring of climate change\neffects.",

However, the\ncorrelation between the glass-forming ability (GFA) of MOFs and their\nstructural characteristics remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we\nanalyze over 20,000 MOFs from the QMOF database, comparing geometric and\nelectronic order parameters between ZIFs and other MOFs. Our findings reveal a\nset of order parameters that effectively capture the thermal stability and GFA\nof MOFs, acting as structural genes to predict glass formation. Through\nmolecular dynamics simulations on representative ZIF structures, we validate\nthe reliability of these order parameters, particularly the total bond-order\ndensity (TBOD) and the largest cavity diameter (LCD), for screening potential\nmelt-quenched MOFs. Furthermore, we predict that external pressure and electric\nfields can control the TBOD of MOFs, expanding our understanding of their\nthermal stability.

Prior efforts in this direction have focused primarily on CNN-based\narchitectures to perform the task. In this paper, we introduce a novel\ntransformer-based architecture for 2D gaze prediction. We experiment with 2\nvariants: the first one retains the same task formulation of predicting a gaze\nheatmap for one person at a time, while the second one casts the problem as a\n2D point regression and allows us to perform multi-person gaze prediction with\na single forward pass.

This task\ninvolves answering natural language (NL) questions on top of tabular data,\ndemanding proficiency in logical reasoning, understanding of data semantics,\nand fundamental analytical capabilities. Due to its significance, a substantial\nvolume of research has been dedicated to exploring a wide range of strategies\naimed at tackling this challenge including approaches that leverage Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) through in-context learning or Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nprompting as well as approaches that train and fine-tune custom models.\n  Nonetheless, a conspicuous gap exists in the research landscape, where there\nis limited exploration of how innovative foundational research, which\nintegrates incremental reasoning with external tools in the context of LLMs, as\nexemplified by the ReAct paradigm, could potentially bring advantages to the\nTQA task. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap, by introducing ReAcTable\n(ReAct for Table Question Answering tasks), a framework inspired by the ReAct\nparadigm that is carefully enhanced to address the challenges uniquely\nappearing in TQA tasks such as interpreting complex data semantics, dealing\nwith errors generated by inconsistent data and generating intricate data\ntransformations. ReAcTable relies on external tools such as SQL and Python code\nexecutors, to progressively enhance the data by generating intermediate data\nrepresentations, ultimately transforming it into a more accessible format for\nanswering the questions with greater ease. We demonstrate that ReAcTable\nachieves remarkable performance even when compared to fine-tuned approaches.

            "summary": "Inverse modeling of fluid flow through porous soils and reservoir rocks\nenables accurate determination of permeability and seepage properties critical\nfor applications such as contaminant filtration, stability assessments, and\noptimization of hydrocarbon recovery. However, the solution to the inverse\nproblem is ill-posed and sensitive to noise in measurements. Direct simulation\nof flow through granular media only provides forward predictions rather than\ninverse characterization. We present an effective method for solving inverse\nanalysis of fluid flow through granular media. The key objectives are\naccurately determining boundary conditions and characterizing the physical\nproperties of the granular media (e.g., permeability) and fluid viscosity based\non the flow state. We develop a fully differentiable lattice Boltzmann Method\n(LBM) using Automatic Differentiation (AD) to optimize the gradients of the\ninput features with respect to the observations. We implement a GPU-capable\nAD-LBM using the Domain-Specific Taichi programming language by employing\nlightweight tape gradients for end-to-end backpropagation. For complex flow\npaths in porous media, our AD-LBM approach accurately estimates the boundary\nconditions leading to observed steady-state velocity fields and consequently\nderives macro-scale permeability and fluid viscosity. Our method demonstrates\nsignificant advantages in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency,\noffering a powerful tool for solving inverse fluid flow problems in various\napplications.",

            "summary": "Recent studies have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) exhibit strong\nbiases towards the node degree: they usually perform satisfactorily on\nhigh-degree nodes with rich neighbor information but struggle with low-degree\nnodes. Existing works tackle this problem by deriving either designated GNN\narchitectures or training strategies specifically for low-degree nodes. Though\neffective, these approaches unintentionally create an artificial\nout-of-distribution scenario, where models mainly or even only observe\nlow-degree nodes during the training, leading to a downgraded performance for\nhigh-degree nodes that GNNs originally perform well at. In light of this, we\npropose a test-time augmentation framework, namely GraphPatcher, to enhance\ntest-time generalization of any GNNs on low-degree nodes. Specifically,\nGraphPatcher iteratively generates virtual nodes to patch artificially created\nlow-degree nodes via corruptions, aiming at progressively reconstructing target\nGNN's predictions over a sequence of increasingly corrupted nodes. Through this\nscheme, GraphPatcher not only learns how to enhance low-degree nodes (when the\nneighborhoods are heavily corrupted) but also preserves the original superior\nperformance of GNNs on high-degree nodes (when lightly corrupted).\nAdditionally, GraphPatcher is model-agnostic and can also mitigate the degree\nbias for either self-supervised or supervised GNNs. Comprehensive experiments\nare conducted over seven benchmark datasets and GraphPatcher consistently\nenhances common GNNs' overall performance by up to 3.6% and low-degree\nperformance by up to 6.5%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

We implement this revamped framework on our\nmanipulation platform, and demonstrate that it allows the robot to perform a\nwider set of manipulation tasks. This includes, using a wall as a support to\nre-orient an object, or regulating the contact geometry between the object and\nthe ground.

In this paper, we endeavor to explore principles of\nlink prediction across diverse datasets from a data-centric perspective. We\nrecognize three fundamental factors critical to link prediction: local\nstructural proximity, global structural proximity, and feature proximity. We\nthen unearth relationships among those factors where (i) global structural\nproximity only shows effectiveness when local structural proximity is\ndeficient. (ii) The incompatibility can be found between feature and structural\nproximity. Such incompatibility leads to GNNs for Link Prediction (GNN4LP)\nconsistently underperforming on edges where the feature proximity factor\ndominates. Inspired by these new insights from a data perspective, we offer\npractical instruction for GNN4LP model design and guidelines for selecting\nappropriate benchmark datasets for more comprehensive evaluations.",

A regular perturbation expansion in the polymer concentration,\n$c$, a generalized reciprocal theorem, and slender body theory to represent the\nvelocity field of a Newtonian fluid around the spheroid are used to obtain the\n$\\mathcal{O}(c)$ correction to the particle's orientational dynamics. The\nresulting dynamical system predicts a range of orientational behaviors\nqualitatively dependent upon $c\\cdot De$ ($De$ is the imposed shear rate times\nthe polymer relaxation time) and $\\kappa$ and quantitatively on $c$. At a small\nbut finite $c\\cdot De$, the particle spirals towards a limit cycle near the\nvorticity axis for all initial conditions. Upon increasing $\\kappa$, the limit\ncycle becomes smaller. Thus, ultimately the particle undergoes a periodic\nmotion around and at a small angle from the vorticity axis. At moderate $c\\cdot\nDe$, a particle starting near the flow-gradient plane departs it monotonically\ninstead of spirally, as this plane (a limit cycle at smaller $c\\cdot De$)\nobtains a saddle and an unstable node. The former is close to the flow\ndirection. Upon further increasing $c\\cdot De$, the saddle-node changes to a\nstable node. Therefore, depending upon the initial condition, a particle may\neither approach a periodic orbit near the vorticity axis or obtain a stable\norientation near the flow direction.

In the analytical setting the open problems\ninclude establishing methods for proving existence of axisymmetric stationary\nsolutions which are far from spherically symmetric, both in the general case\nand for certain special classes of solutions pointed out in the text. In the\nnumerical setting there are intriguing properties of highly relativistic\nsolutions that demand further attention, such as whether a sequence of such\nstationary solutions can approach a Kerr black hole, or if they necessarily\napproach the thin ring limit reminiscent of cosmic strings. The question of\nwhether stationary solutions include states with thin-disk like morphologies as\nseen in many galaxies is also open.

            "summary": "Deep Neural Networks are powerful tools for understanding complex patterns\nand making decisions. However, their black-box nature impedes a complete\nunderstanding of their inner workings. Saliency-Guided Training (SGT) methods\ntry to highlight the prominent features in the model's training based on the\noutput to alleviate this problem. These methods use back-propagation and\nmodified gradients to guide the model toward the most relevant features while\nkeeping the impact on the prediction accuracy negligible. SGT makes the model's\nfinal result more interpretable by masking input partially. In this way,\nconsidering the model's output, we can infer how each segment of the input\naffects the output. In the particular case of image as the input, masking is\napplied to the input pixels. However, the masking strategy and number of pixels\nwhich we mask, are considered as a hyperparameter. Appropriate setting of\nmasking strategy can directly affect the model's training. In this paper, we\nfocus on this issue and present our contribution. We propose a novel method to\ndetermine the optimal number of masked images based on input, accuracy, and\nmodel loss during the training. The strategy prevents information loss which\nleads to better accuracy values. Also, by integrating the model's performance\nin the strategy formula, we show that our model represents the salient features\nmore meaningful. Our experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement\nin both model accuracy and the prominence of saliency, thereby affirming the\neffectiveness of our proposed solution.",

However, the\ninherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of\nheavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations.\nConsequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for\nthese trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the\npotential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal\ndemand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the\nupcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for\nefficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck\ndata on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis\nunderscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future\ndecision-makings.

First, a network-aware Gaussian process (GP) termed\nVertex-Degree Kernel (VDK-GP), developed in prior work, is used to estimate\nvoltage-power functions for a few network configurations. The paper introduces\na novel multi-task vertex degree kernel (MT-VDK) that amalgamates the learned\nVDK-GPs to determine power flows for unseen networks, with a significant\nreduction in the computational complexity and hyperparameter requirements\ncompared to alternate approaches. Simulations on the IEEE 30-Bus network\ndemonstrate the retention and transfer of power flow knowledge in both N-1 and\nN-2 contingency scenarios. The MT-VDK-GP approach achieves over 50% reduction\nin mean prediction error for novel N-1 contingency network configurations in\nlow training data regimes (50-250 samples) over VDK-GP. Additionally, MT-VDK-GP\noutperforms a hyper-parameter based transfer learning approach in over 75% of\nN-2 contingency network structures, even without historical N-2 outage data.\nThe proposed method demonstrates the ability to achieve PVEs using sixteen\ntimes fewer power flow solutions compared to Monte-Carlo sampling-based\nmethods.",

Solutions to both problems exist, among\nothers, in the form of counterfactual examples generation to enhance\nexplainability or adversarially augment training datasets for improved\nrobustness. However, existing methods exclusively address only one of the\nissues. We propose a unified framework leveraging image-to-image translation\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce counterfactual samples that\nhighlight salient regions for interpretability and act as adversarial samples\nto augment the dataset for more robustness. This is achieved by combining the\nclassifier and discriminator into a single model that attributes real images to\ntheir respective classes and flags generated images as \"fake\". We assess the\nmethod's effectiveness by evaluating (i) the produced explainability masks on a\nsemantic segmentation task for concrete cracks and (ii) the model's resilience\nagainst the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack on a fruit defects\ndetection problem. Our produced saliency maps are highly descriptive, achieving\ncompetitive IoU values compared to classical segmentation models despite being\ntrained exclusively on classification labels. Furthermore, the model exhibits\nimproved robustness to adversarial attacks, and we show how the discriminator's\n\"fakeness\" value serves as an uncertainty measure of the predictions.",

Our innovative approach takes\ninspiration from BADGR, an LSTM-based network that primarily concentrates on\nenvironment modeling, but distinguishes itself by substituting LSTM modules\nwith transformers to greatly elevate the performance our model. Addressing\nuncertainty within the system, we train an ensemble of predictive models and\nestimate the mutual information between model weights and outputs, facilitating\ndynamic horizon planning through the introduction of variable speeds. Further\nenhancing our methodology, we incorporate a nonlinear MPC controller that\naccounts for the intricacies of the vehicle's model and states. The model-based\nRL facet produces steering angles and quantifies inherent uncertainty. At the\nsame time, the nonlinear MPC suggests optimal throttle settings, striking a\nbalance between goal attainment speed and managing model uncertainty influenced\nby velocity. In the conducted studies, our approach excels over the existing\nbaseline by consistently achieving higher metric values in predicting future\nevents and seamlessly integrating the vehicle's kinematic model for enhanced\ndecision-making.

            "summary": "Data curation tasks that prepare data for analytics are critical for turning\ndata into actionable insights. However, due to the diverse requirements of\napplications in different domains, generic off-the-shelf tools are typically\ninsufficient. As a result, data scientists often have to develop\ndomain-specific solutions tailored to both the dataset and the task, e.g.\nwriting domain-specific code or training machine learning models on a\nsufficient number of annotated examples. This process is notoriously difficult\nand time-consuming. We present SEED, an LLM-as-compiler approach that\nautomatically generates domain-specific data curation solutions via Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). Once the user describes a task, input data, and\nexpected output, the SEED compiler produces an executable pipeline composed of\nLLM-generated code, small model, and data access modules. SEED uses these\ngenerated modules to process most of the data records and dynamically decides\nwhen the LLM should step in to directly process some individual records,\npossibly using the data-access modules to retrieve relevant information from\nthe data sources to assist the LLM in solving the task. To validate this new,\nrevolutionary approach, we conducted experiments on 9 datasets spanning over 5\ndata curation tasks. The results show that SEED generates domain-specific\nsolutions that significantly outperform their generic counterparts, often\napproaching the performance of the manually curated solutions that use\nthousands of labeled training examples. Moreover, in comparison to solutions\nthat use the LLM on every data record, SEED achieves state-of-the-art or\ncomparable few-shot performance, while significantly reducing the number of LLM\ncalls.",

The\nwhispering gallery-type asymptotics are localized near the boundary of the\ndomain, and an explicit analytic representations in terms of Airy functions is\nconstructed for such asymptotics. There are several different scales in the\nproblem, which makes it possible to apply the procedure of adiabatic\napproximation in the form of operator separation of variables to reduce the\ninitial problem to one-dimensional problems up to the small correction. We also\ndiscuss the relation between the constructed whispering gallery-type\nasymptotics and classical billiards in the corresponding domain, in\nparticularly, such asymptotics correspond to almost integrable billiards with\nproper degeneracy. We illustrate the results in the case when a revolutional\ndomain is obtained by rotation of the triangle with rounded wedges.",

In this analytical\nstudy we give general statements about the thermalization of excitons in two\nand three dimensional semiconductors.

Above all, we analytically provide arguments why a\nbosonic behavior of excitons - such as an enhanced ground state occupation -\nrequires the dominant phonon scattering to be quasielastic. Acoustic phonons\ntend to fulfil this, as each scattering event only takes small amounts of\nenergy out of the distribution, while optical phonons tend to prevent\nmacroscopic occupations of the lowest exciton state, since the Pauli repulsion\nbetween the individual carriers will then dominate the thermalization dynamics.",

UniAudio 1) first tokenizes all types of target audio\nalong with other condition modalities, 2) concatenates source-target pair as a\nsingle sequence, and 3) performs next-token prediction using LLM. Also, a\nmulti-scale Transformer model is proposed to handle the overly long sequences\ncaused by the residual vector quantization based neural codec in tokenization.\nTraining of UniAudio is scaled up to 165K hours of audio and 1B parameters,\nbased on all generative tasks, aiming to obtain sufficient prior knowledge not\nonly in the intrinsic properties of audio but also the inter-relationship\nbetween audio and other modalities. Therefore, the trained UniAudio model has\nthe potential to become a foundation model for universal audio generation: it\nshows strong capability in all trained tasks and can seamlessly support new\naudio generation tasks after simple fine-tuning.

Existing work\non query facet generation has achieved compelling performance by sequentially\npredicting the next facet given previously generated facets based on\npre-trained language generation models such as BART. Given a query, there are\nmainly two types of training objectives to guide the facet generation models.\nOne is to generate the default sequence of ground-truth facets, and the other\nis to enumerate all the permutations of ground-truth facets and use the\nsequence that has the minimum loss for model updates. The second is\npermutation-invariant while the first is not. In this paper, we aim to conduct\na systematic comparative study of various types of training objectives, with\ndifferent properties of not only whether it is permutation-invariant but also\nwhether it conducts sequential prediction and whether it can control the count\nof output facets. To this end, we propose another three training objectives of\ndifferent aforementioned properties. For comprehensive comparisons, besides the\ncommonly used evaluation that measures the matching with ground-truth facets,\nwe also introduce two diversity metrics to measure the diversity of the\ngenerated facets. Based on an open-domain query facet dataset, i.e., MIMICS, we\nconduct extensive analyses and show the pros and cons of each method, which\ncould shed light on model training for clarification facet generation.

            "summary": "This paper studies the problem of learning message propagation strategies for\ngraph neural networks (GNNs). One of the challenges for graph neural networks\nis that of defining the propagation strategy. For instance, the choices of\npropagation steps are often specialized to a single graph and are not\npersonalized to different nodes. To compensate for this, in this paper, we\npresent learning to propagate, a general learning framework that not only\nlearns the GNN parameters for prediction but more importantly, can explicitly\nlearn the interpretable and personalized propagate strategies for different\nnodes and various types of graphs. We introduce the optimal propagation steps\nas latent variables to help find the maximum-likelihood estimation of the GNN\nparameters in a variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) framework. Extensive\nexperiments on various types of graph benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed\nframework can significantly achieve better performance compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, and can effectively learn personalized and\ninterpretable propagate strategies of messages in GNNs.",

Automation of\nthese vehicle poses several challenges, e.g. large swept path, asymmetric\nsteering response, large slide slip angles of non-steered trailer axles and\ntrailer instability while reversing. Therefore, a validated vehicle model is\nrequired that accurately and efficiently predicts the states of the vehicle.\nUnlike forward driving, open-loop validation methods can not be used for\nreverse driving of articulated vehicles due to their unstable dynamics. This\npaper proposes an approach to stabilize the unstable pole of the system and\ncompares three vehicle models (kinematic, non-linear single track and multibody\ndynamics model) against real-world test data obtained from low-speed\nexperiments at a distribution center.

Gradual typing improves the developer's\nability to verify program behavior, contributing to robust, secure and\ndebuggable programs. In practice, however, users only sparsely annotate types\ndirectly. At the same time, conventional type inference faces\nperformance-related challenges as program size grows. Statistical techniques\nbased on machine learning offer faster inference, but although recent\napproaches demonstrate overall improved accuracy, they still perform\nsignificantly worse on user-defined types than on the most common built-in\ntypes. Limiting their real-world usefulness even more, they rarely integrate\nwith user-facing applications. We propose CodeTIDAL5, a Transformer-based model\ntrained to reliably predict type annotations.

In this\nwork, we propose a neural network-based approach that tackles this issue and is\nsuitable for high-dimensional multi-label classification. Our model uses a\nselective concept drift adaptation mechanism that makes it suitable for a\nnon-stationary environment. Additionally, we adapt our model to an environment\nwith missing labels using a simple yet effective imputation strategy and\ndemonstrate that it outperforms a vast majority of the state-of-the-art\nsupervised models. To achieve our purposes, we introduce a weighted binary\nrelevance-based approach named ML-BELS using the Broad Ensemble Learning System\n(BELS) as its base classifier. Instead of a chain of stacked classifiers, our\nmodel employs independent weighted ensembles, with the weights generated by the\npredictions of a BELS classifier. We show that using the weighting strategy on\ndatasets with low label cardinality negatively impacts the accuracy of the\nmodel; with this in mind, we use the label cardinality as a trigger for\napplying the weights. We present an extensive assessment of our model using 11\nstate-of-the-art baselines, five synthetics, and 13 real-world datasets, all\nwith different characteristics.

            "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with\nlimited treatment options. This research proposes a workflow and deep\nlearning-based segmentation models to automatically assess tumor-vessel\ninvolvement, a key factor in determining tumor resectability. Correct\nassessment of resectability is vital to determine treatment options. The\nproposed workflow involves processing CT scans to segment the tumor and\nvascular structures, analyzing spatial relationships and the extent of vascular\ninvolvement, which follows a similar way of working as expert radiologists in\nPDAC assessment. Three segmentation architectures (nnU-Net, 3D U-Net, and\nProbabilistic 3D U-Net) achieve a high accuracy in segmenting veins, arteries,\nand the tumor. The segmentations enable automated detection of tumor\ninvolvement with high accuracy (0.88 sensitivity and 0.86 specificity) and\nautomated computation of the degree of tumor-vessel contact. Additionally, due\nto significant inter-observer variability in these important structures, we\npresent the uncertainty captured by each of the models to further increase\ninsights into the predicted involvement. This result provides clinicians with a\nclear indication of tumor-vessel involvement and may be used to facilitate more\ninformed decision-making for surgical interventions. The proposed method offers\na valuable tool for improving patient outcomes, personalized treatment\nstrategies and survival rates in pancreatic cancer.",

However, the availability of\ngood-quality fingerprints is challenging, making recognition difficult.\nFingerprint images might be degraded with a poor ridge structure and noisy or\nless contrasting backgrounds. Hence, fingerprint enhancement plays a vital role\nin the early stages of the fingerprint recognition/verification pipeline. In\nthis paper, we investigate and improvise the encoder-decoder style architecture\nand suggest intuitive modifications to U-Net to enhance low-quality\nfingerprints effectively. We investigate the use of Discrete Wavelet Transform\n(DWT) for fingerprint enhancement and use a wavelet attention module instead of\nmax pooling which proves advantageous for our task. Moreover, we replace\nregular convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions, which significantly\nreduces the memory footprint of the model without degrading the performance. We\nalso demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge with fingerprint minutiae\nprediction task can improve fingerprint reconstruction through multi-task\nlearning. Furthermore, we also integrate the orientation estimation task to\npropagate the knowledge of ridge orientations to enhance the performance\nfurther.

            "summary": "In this paper, we tackle the problem of scene-aware 3D human motion\nforecasting. A key challenge of this task is to predict future human motions\nthat are consistent with the scene by modeling the human-scene interactions.\nWhile recent works have demonstrated that explicit constraints on human-scene\ninteractions can prevent the occurrence of ghost motion, they only provide\nconstraints on partial human motion e.g., the global motion of the human or a\nfew joints contacting the scene, leaving the rest of the motion unconstrained.\nTo address this limitation, we propose to model the human-scene interaction\nwith the mutual distance between the human body and the scene. Such mutual\ndistances constrain both the local and global human motion, resulting in a\nwhole-body motion constrained prediction. In particular, mutual distance\nconstraints consist of two components, the signed distance of each vertex on\nthe human mesh to the scene surface and the distance of basis scene points to\nthe human mesh. We further introduce a global scene representation learned from\na signed distance function (SDF) volume to ensure coherence between the global\nscene representation and the explicit constraint from the mutual distance. We\ndevelop a pipeline with two sequential steps: predicting the future mutual\ndistances first, followed by forecasting future human motion. During training,\nwe explicitly encourage consistency between predicted poses and mutual\ndistances. Extensive evaluations on the existing synthetic and real datasets\ndemonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

To address above problems, we propose a novel hierarchical\nadaptation mechanism for few-shot MPP (HiMPP). The model follows a\nencoder-predictor framework. First, to make molecular representation\nproperty-adaptive, we selectively adapt encoder's parameter by designing a\nhypernetwork to modulate node embeddings during message propagation. Next, we\nmake molecule-level adaptation by design another hypernetwork, which assigns\nlarger propagating steps for harder molecules in predictor. In this way,\nmolecular representation is transformed by HiMPP hierarchically from\nproperty-level to molecular level. Extensive results show that HiMPP obtains\nthe state-of-the-art performance in few-shot MPP problems, and our proposed\nhierarchical adaptation mechanism is rational and effective.",

The DP A2AuScX6 halides were studied for their\nstructural phase stability and optoelectronic properties in order to identify\npotential materials for energy harvesting systems. The stability criteria were\nverified by computing the formation energy, binding energy, phonon dispersion\ncurve, stiffness constants, tolerance, and octahedral factors. The electronic\nband structure, carrier effective mass, density of states (DOS), and charge\ndensity distribution were calculated to reveal the nature of electronic\nconductivity and the chemical bonding nature present within them. For Cs2AuScX6\n(Rb2AuScX6) [X = Cl, Br, I], the corresponding values of band gap [using\nTB-mBJ] are 1.88 (1.93), 1.68 (1.71), and 1.30 (1.32) eV. The optical constants\n(dielectric function, absorption coefficient, refractive index, energy loss\nfunction, photoconductivity, and reflectivity) were also calculated to get more\ninsights into their electronic nature. For Cs2AuScX6 (Rb2AuScX6) [X = Cl, Br,\nI], the absorption coefficient in the visible range are 3.33 (3.45) 105 cm-1,\n2.70 (2.81) 105 cm-1, and 2.13 (2.18) 105 cm-1, respectively.

First, we skip all the intermediate state\nsupervision and only focus on action predictions. Second, we decompose\nrelatively long chains into multiple short sub-chains by skipping unreliable\nintermediate actions.

            "summary": "Causal explanations of the predictions of NLP systems are essential to ensure\nsafety and establish trust. Yet, existing methods often fall short of\nexplaining model predictions effectively or efficiently and are often\nmodel-specific. In this paper, we address model-agnostic explanations,\nproposing two approaches for counterfactual (CF) approximation. The first\napproach is CF generation, where a large language model (LLM) is prompted to\nchange a specific text concept while keeping confounding concepts unchanged.\nWhile this approach is demonstrated to be very effective, applying LLM at\ninference-time is costly. We hence present a second approach based on matching,\nand propose a method that is guided by an LLM at training-time and learns a\ndedicated embedding space. This space is faithful to a given causal graph and\neffectively serves to identify matches that approximate CFs. After showing\ntheoretically that approximating CFs is required in order to construct faithful\nexplanations, we benchmark our approaches and explain several models, including\nLLMs with billions of parameters. Our empirical results demonstrate the\nexcellent performance of CF generation models as model-agnostic explainers.\nMoreover, our matching approach, which requires far less test-time resources,\nalso provides effective explanations, surpassing many baselines. We also find\nthat Top-K techniques universally improve every tested method. Finally, we\nshowcase the potential of LLMs in constructing new benchmarks for model\nexplanation and subsequently validate our conclusions. Our work illuminates new\npathways for efficient and accurate approaches to interpreting NLP systems.",

            "summary": "Machine learning models have undeniably achieved impressive performance\nacross a range of applications. However, their often perceived black-box\nnature, and lack of transparency in decision-making, have raised concerns about\nunderstanding their predictions. To tackle this challenge, researchers have\ndeveloped methods to provide explanations for machine learning models. In this\npaper, we introduce LaPLACE-explainer, designed to provide probabilistic\ncause-and-effect explanations for any classifier operating on tabular data, in\na human-understandable manner. The LaPLACE-Explainer component leverages the\nconcept of a Markov blanket to establish statistical boundaries between\nrelevant and non-relevant features automatically. This approach results in the\nautomatic generation of optimal feature subsets, serving as explanations for\npredictions. Importantly, this eliminates the need to predetermine a fixed\nnumber N of top features as explanations, enhancing the flexibility and\nadaptability of our methodology. Through the incorporation of conditional\nprobabilities, our approach offers probabilistic causal explanations and\noutperforms LIME and SHAP (well-known model-agnostic explainers) in terms of\nlocal accuracy and consistency of explained features. LaPLACE's soundness,\nconsistency, local accuracy, and adaptability are rigorously validated across\nvarious classification models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical\nutility of these explanations via experiments with both simulated and\nreal-world datasets. This encompasses addressing trust-related issues, such as\nevaluating prediction reliability, facilitating model selection, enhancing\ntrustworthiness, and identifying fairness-related concerns within classifiers.",

It is known that derivative-based GSA is closely\nlinked to variance-based total sensitivity index, while its relationship with\nthe entropy-based measure is unclear. To fill this gap, we introduce a\nlog-derivative based functional to demonstrate that the entropy-based and\nderivative-based sensitivity measures are strongly connected. In particular, we\ngive proofs that, similar to the case with variance-based GSA, there is an\ninequality relationship between entropy-based and derivative-based important\nmeasures. Both analytical and numerical verifications are provided.

The\nconstruction relies on simple geometrical ideas and is explicit, in the sense\nthat it does not involve solving other complicated optimization problems. We\nalso show that the construct restrictions are in some sense maximal, that is,\nthe best possible ones. Optimization problems constrained to these sets are not\nonly simpler to solve but also offer feasibility guarantee for the solutions to\nthe original OPF problem. Furthermore, we present an iterative algorithm to\nimprove on the solution quality by successively constructing a sequence of\nconvex restricted sets and solving the optimization on them. The numerical\nexperiments on the IEEE 123-bus distribution network show that our method finds\ngood feasible solutions within just a few iterations and works well with\nvarious objective functions, even in situations where traditional methods fail\nto return a solution.",

We leverage JoMA to\nqualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in\nmultilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent\nhierarchical generative model.

            "summary": "Quantum state tomography (QST) is the process of reconstructing the complete\nstate of a quantum system (mathematically described as a density matrix)\nthrough a series of different measurements. These measurements are performed on\na number of identical copies of the quantum system, with outcomes gathered as\nfrequencies. QST aims to recover the density matrix and the corresponding\nproperties of the quantum state from the measured frequencies. Although an\ninformationally complete set of measurements can specify quantum state\naccurately in an ideal scenario with a large number of identical copies, both\nmeasurements and identical copies are restricted and imperfect in practical\nscenarios, making QST highly ill-posed. The conventional QST methods usually\nassume adequate or accurate measured frequencies or rely on manually designed\nregularizers to handle the ill-posed reconstruction problem, suffering from\nlimited applications in realistic scenarios. Recent advances in deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) led to the emergence of deep learning (DL) in QST. However,\nexisting DL-based QST approaches often employ generic DNN models that are not\noptimized for imperfect conditions of QST. In this paper, we propose a\ntransformer-based autoencoder architecture tailored for QST with imperfect\nmeasurement data. Our method leverages a transformer-based encoder to extract\nan informative latent representation (ILR) from imperfect measurement data and\nemploys a decoder to predict the quantum states based on the ILR. We anticipate\nthat the high-dimensional ILR will capture more comprehensive information about\nquantum states. To achieve this, we conduct pre-training of the encoder using a\npretext task that involves reconstructing high-quality frequencies from\nmeasured frequencies. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate the\nremarkable ability of the ILR in dealing with imperfect measurement data in\nQST.",

            "summary": "The recently developed DeeP-LCC (Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise\nControl) method has shown promising performance for data-driven predictive\ncontrol of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. However,\nits simplistic zero assumption of the future velocity errors for the head\nvehicle may pose safety concerns and limit its performance of smoothing traffic\nflow. In this paper, we propose a robust DeeP-LCC method to control CAVs in\nmixed traffic with enhanced safety performance. In particular, we first present\na robust formulation that enforces a safety constraint for a range of potential\nvelocity error trajectories, and then estimate all potential velocity errors\nbased on the past data from the head vehicle. We also provide efficient\ncomputational approaches to solve the robust optimization for online predictive\ncontrol. Nonlinear traffic simulations show that our robust DeeP-LCC can\nprovide better traffic efficiency and stronger safety performance while\nrequiring less offline data.",

We achieve this through a novel analytical\nmodel for predicting sparse network performance, and validate the predicted\nspeedup using several real-world computer vision architectures pruned across a\nrange of sparsity patterns and degrees. We demonstrate the utility and\nease-of-use of our model through two case studies: (1) we show how machine\nlearning researchers can predict the performance of unimplemented or\nunoptimized block-structured sparsity patterns, and (2) we show how hardware\ndesigners can predict the performance implications of new sparsity patterns and\nsparse data formats in hardware.

The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the\nimportance of detecting financial distress early and taking preventive measures\nto mitigate its effects. In this bibliometric review, we look at the research\nand literature on EWSs in finance. Our methodology included a comprehensive\nexamination of academic databases and a stringent selection procedure, which\nresulted in the final selection of 616 articles published between 1976 and\n2023. Our findings show that more than 90\\% of the papers were published after\n2006, indicating the growing importance of EWSs in financial research.\nAccording to our findings, recent research has shifted toward machine learning\ntechniques, and EWSs are constantly evolving. We discovered that research in\nthis area could be divided into four categories: bankruptcy prediction, banking\ncrisis, currency crisis and emerging markets, and machine learning forecasting.\nEach cluster offers distinct insights into the approaches and methodologies\nused for EWSs. To improve predictive accuracy, our review emphasizes the\nimportance of incorporating both macroeconomic and microeconomic data into EWS\nmodels. To improve their predictive performance, we recommend more research\ninto incorporating alternative data sources into EWS models, such as social\nmedia data, news sentiment analysis, and network analysis.",

            "summary": "Imitation learning, which learns agent policy by mimicking expert\ndemonstration, has shown promising results in many applications such as medical\ntreatment regimes and self-driving vehicles. However, it remains a difficult\ntask to interpret control policies learned by the agent. Difficulties mainly\ncome from two aspects: 1) agents in imitation learning are usually implemented\nas deep neural networks, which are black-box models and lack interpretability;\n2) the latent causal mechanism behind agents' decisions may vary along the\ntrajectory, rather than staying static throughout time steps. To increase\ntransparency and offer better interpretability of the neural agent, we propose\nto expose its captured knowledge in the form of a directed acyclic causal\ngraph, with nodes being action and state variables and edges denoting the\ncausal relations behind predictions. Furthermore, we design this causal\ndiscovery process to be state-dependent, enabling it to model the dynamics in\nlatent causal graphs. Concretely, we conduct causal discovery from the\nperspective of Granger causality and propose a self-explainable imitation\nlearning framework, {\\method}. The proposed framework is composed of three\nparts: a dynamic causal discovery module, a causality encoding module, and a\nprediction module, and is trained in an end-to-end manner. After the model is\nlearned, we can obtain causal relations among states and action variables\nbehind its decisions, exposing policies learned by it. Experimental results on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed {\\method} in learning the dynamic causal graphs for understanding the\ndecision-making of imitation learning meanwhile maintaining high prediction\naccuracy.",

When\nthese disordered phases form at low temperatures, especially in crystals with\nlight nuclei, the prediction of materials properties can be complicated by the\nimportance of nuclear quantum effects.

Titan's low surface temperature (~90 K) suggests that the\nquantum mechanical behavior of nuclei may be important in this and other\nmolecular solids in these environments. By using neural network potentials\ncombined with ring polymer molecular dynamics simulations, we show that nuclear\nquantum effects increase orientational disorder and rotational dynamics within\nthe acetylene:ammonia (1:1) co-crystal by weakening hydrogen bonds.

Chemical formulas are obligated to conform to a set of\nexacting criteria such as charge neutrality, balanced electronegativity,\nsynthesizability, and mechanical stability. In response to this formidable\ntask, we introduce a deep learning-based generative model for material\ncomposition and structure design by learning and exploiting explicit and\nimplicit chemical knowledge. Our pipeline first uses deep diffusion language\nmodels as the generator of compositions and then applies a template-based\ncrystal structure prediction algorithm to predict their corresponding\nstructures, which is then followed by structure relaxation using a universal\ngraph neural network-based potential. The density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations of the formation energies and energy-above-the-hull analysis are\nused to validate new structures generated through our pipeline. Based on the\nDFT calculation results, six new materials, including Ti2HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,\nTaReO4, HfTiO2, and HfMnO2, with formation energy less than zero have been\nfound. Remarkably, among these, four materials, namely Ti2$HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,\nand TaReO4, exhibit an e-above-hull energy of less than 0.3 eV.

            "summary": "Grid-interfacing inverters act as the interface between renewable resources\nand the electric grid, and have the potential to offer fast and programmable\ncontrols compared to synchronous generators. With this flexibility there has\nbeen significant research efforts into determining the best way to control\nthese inverters. Inverters are limited in their maximum current output in order\nto protect semiconductor devices, presenting a nonlinear constraint that needs\nto be accounted for in their control algorithms. Existing approaches either\nsimply saturate a controller that is designed for unconstrained systems, or\nassume small perturbations and linearize a saturated system. These approaches\ncan lead to stability issues or limiting the control actions to be too\nconservative.\n  In this paper, we directly focus on a nonlinear system that explicitly\naccounts for the saturation of the current magnitude. We use a Lyapunov\nstability approach to determine a stability condition for the system,\nguaranteeing that a class of controllers would be stabilizing if they satisfy a\nsimple SDP condition. With this condition we fit a linear-feedback controller\nby sampling the output (offline) model predictive control problems. This\nlearned controller has improved performances with existing designs.",

            "summary": "Disc warping, and possibly disc breaking, has been observed in protoplanetary\ndiscs around both single and multiple stars. Large disc warps can break the\ndisc, producing observational signatures in kinematics and shadowing along the\nouter disc. In this work, we use comparisons of disc timescales to derive\nupdated formulae for disc breaking, with better predictions as to when and\nwhere a disc is expected to break and how many breaks could occur. Disc\nbreaking is more likely for discs with small inner cavities, cooler\ntemperatures, and steeper power-law profiles. Thus, thin, polar-aligned discs\nare more likely to break. We test our analytic formulae using 3D grid-based\nsimulations of protoplanetary discs warped by the gravitational torque of an\ninner binary. We reproduce the expected warp behaviors in different viscosity\nregimes and observe disc breaking at locations in agreement with our derived\nequations. As disc breaking is observed only for discs with low viscosity, we\nalso consider a viscous criterion for disc breaking, where rapid alignment to\nthe precession vector can prevent a break by reducing the maximum misalignment\nbetween neighboring rings. We apply these results to the GW Orionis\ncircumtriple disc, and find that the precession induced from the central stars\ncan break the disc if the disc is relatively thin. We expect repeated or\nmultiple disc breaking to occur for discs with sufficiently steep power law\nprofiles. We simulate a disc with steep power-law profiles, and observe two\nseparate breaking events at locations in rough agreement with our analytical\npredictions.",

MINDS tracks granular end-to-end data provenance, ensuring\nreproducibility and transparency. The cloud-native architecture of MINDS can\nhandle exponential data growth in a secure, cost-optimized manner while\nensuring substantial storage optimization, replication avoidance, and dynamic\naccess capabilities.

Stable 124Sn and\nradioactive 107Sn and 124La beams with an incident energy of 600 MeV/nucleon\nwere used to explore the N/Z dependence of the identified neutron source. A\ncluster-recognition algorithm is applied for identifying individual particles\nwithin the hit distributions registered with LAND. The obtained momentum\ndistributions are extrapolated over the full phase space occupied by the\nneutrons from the projectile-spectator source. The mean multiplicities of\nspectator neutrons reach values of up to about 11 and depend strongly on the\nisotopic composition of the projectile. An effective source temperature of T\n\\approx 2-5 MeV, monotonically increasing with decreasing impact parameter, is\ndeduced from the transverse momentum distributions. For the interpretation of\nthe data, calculations with the statistical multifragmentation model were\nperformed. The variety of excited projectile spectators assumed to decay\nstatistically is represented by an ensemble of excited sources with parameters\ndetermined previously from the fragment production observed in the same\nexperiments. The obtained agreement is very satisfactory for more peripheral\ncollisions where, according to the model, neutrons are mainly emitted during\nthe secondary decays of excited fragments. The neutron multiplicity in more\ncentral collisions is underestimated, indicating that other sources besides the\nmodeled statistical breakup contribute to the observed neutron yield. The\nchoice made for the symmetry-term coefficient of the liquid-drop description of\nproduced fragments has a weak effect on the predicted neutron multiplicities.",

We discover that most existing monocular 3D object detectors rely on the\nego-vehicle prior assumption that the optical axis of the camera is parallel to\nthe ground. However, the roadside camera is installed on a pole with a pitched\nangle, which makes the existing methods not optimal for roadside scenes. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel framework for Roadside Monocular 3D object\ndetection with ground-aware embeddings, named MonoGAE. Specifically, the ground\nplane is a stable and strong prior knowledge due to the fixed installation of\ncameras in roadside scenarios. In order to reduce the domain gap between the\nground geometry information and high-dimensional image features, we employ a\nsupervised training paradigm with a ground plane to predict high-dimensional\nground-aware embeddings. These embeddings are subsequently integrated with\nimage features through cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to improve the\ndetector's robustness to the divergences in cameras' installation poses, we\nreplace the ground plane depth map with a novel pixel-level refined ground\nplane equation map. Our approach demonstrates a substantial performance\nadvantage over all previous monocular 3D object detectors on widely recognized\n3D detection benchmarks for roadside cameras. The code and pre-trained models\nwill be released soon.",

The library generation involves the spherical\nevolution of a homogeneous gas cloud around a young stellar cluster that\naccounts for stellar feedback processes including stellar winds, supernovae,\nand radiation pressure, as well as the gravitational forces on the gas. The\nsemi-analytical evolution model is coupled with the photoionization code Cloudy\nto calculate time-dependent UV-mm spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from\nstar-forming regions of varying metallicity, star-formation efficiency,\nbirth-cloud density, and mass. The calculated SEDs include the stellar,\nnebular, and dust continuum emission along with a wide range of emission lines\noriginating from H ii, photo-dissociation, and molecular gas regimes tabulated\nat high resolution. The SEDs incorporated in SKIRT are generated by calculating\na stellar-mass normalized luminosity, which assumes that each emission source\nis composed of a power-law population of star-forming clouds. When compared to\nthe previous treatment of star-forming regions in SKIRT, TODDLERS shows a\nbetter agreement with low-redshift observational data in the IR wavelength\nrange while offering a more comprehensive line-emission support. This paves the\nway for a variety of applications using simulated galaxies at low and high\nredshift.",

            "summary": "In-Context Learning (ICL) is a new paradigm for natural language processing\n(NLP), where a large language model (LLM) observes a small number of\ndemonstrations and a test instance as its input, and directly makes predictions\nwithout updating model parameters. Previous studies have revealed that ICL is\nsensitive to the selection and the ordering of demonstrations. However, there\nare few studies regarding the impact of the demonstration number on the ICL\nperformance within a limited input length of LLM, because it is commonly\nbelieved that the number of demonstrations is positively correlated with model\nperformance. In this paper, we found this conclusion does not always hold true.\nThrough pilot experiments, we discover that increasing the number of\ndemonstrations does not necessarily lead to improved performance. Building upon\nthis insight, we propose a Dynamic Demonstrations Controller (D$^2$Controller),\nwhich can improve the ICL performance by adjusting the number of demonstrations\ndynamically. The experimental results show that D$^2$Controller yields a 5.4%\nrelative improvement on eight different sizes of LLMs across ten datasets.\nMoreover, we also extend our method to previous ICL models and achieve\ncompetitive results.",

To make their applications\npractical, we introduce an innovative ensemble-based distillation approach\ndistilling inductive bias from complementary lightweight teacher models. Prior\nsystems relied solely on convolution-based teaching. However, this method\nincorporates an ensemble of light teachers with different architectural\ntendencies, such as convolution and involution, to instruct the student\ntransformer jointly. Because of these unique inductive biases, instructors can\naccumulate a wide range of knowledge, even from readily identifiable stored\ndatasets, which leads to enhanced student performance. Our proposed framework\nalso involves precomputing and storing logits in advance, essentially the\nunnormalized predictions of the model. This optimization can accelerate the\ndistillation process by eliminating the need for repeated forward passes during\nknowledge distillation, significantly reducing the computational burden and\nenhancing efficiency.",

Despite a provable advantage of fine-tuned quantum kernels for\nspecific problems, widespread practical usage of quantum kernel methods\nrequires resolving the so-called vanishing similarity issue, where\nexponentially vanishing variance of the quantum kernels causes implementation\ninfeasibility and trainability problems. In this work, we analytically and\nnumerically investigate the vanishing similarity issue in projected quantum\nkernels with alternating layered ansatzes. We find that variance depends on\ncircuit depth, size of local unitary blocks and initial state, indicating the\nissue is avoidable if shallow alternating layered ansatzes are used and initial\nstate is not highly entangled. Our work provides some insights into design\nprinciples of projected quantum kernels and implies the need for caution when\nusing highly entangled states as input to quantum kernel-based learning models.",

We introduce two\ndifferent schemes to update embedding representations for THNs, discussing the\nstrengths and weaknesses of both strategies. We also extend the set of\nbenchmarks for TNHs by introducing two novel high-resolution temporal\nheterogeneous graph datasets derived from an emerging Web3 platform and a\nwell-established e-commerce website. Overall, we conducted the experimental\nevaluation of the framework over four temporal heterogeneous network datasets\non future link prediction tasks in an evaluation setting that takes into\naccount the evolving nature of the data.

While the\nadvective Cahn-Hilliard equation effectively captures the topological evolution\nof complex interfacial structures, it tends to displace the fluid interface\nfrom its equilibrium state, impacting simulation accuracy. To tackle this\nchallenge, we present an interfacial profile-preserving formulation that relies\non a phase-field-related signed distance function, rather than the phase field\nfunction itself. It is solved iteratively to restore the equilibrium interface\nprofile after each time step. This approach effectively minimizes\ndiscretization errors and enhances mass conservation accuracy for each phase.\nOur formulation is discretized using a second-order Total Variation Diminishing\n(TVD) Runge-Kutta method within iterations and a finite volume scheme in\nspatial discretization. We quantitatively compare our present\nprofile-preserving method with the original method in terms of accuracy and\nconvergence rate through simulations of a deforming drop in a single vortex and\na rising bubble in quiescent fluid, and further validate the applicability\nthrough simulations of a two-dimensional contracting liquid filament, a drop\nimpacting a deep liquid pool, and three-dimensional drop deformation in shear\nflow.

The structure of the\nextremal surfaces suggests a geometric picture of the time-entanglement or\npseudo-entanglement wedge. The analytic continuation suggests a heuristic\nLewkowycz-Maldacena formulation of the extremal surface areas.

The classical dynamics of each domain wall are\nconstrained by two classically forbidden regions. We find that the wormhole has\nincreased the number of instantons and thus can enhance the tunneling rate. We\nhave analytically derived the formula for the bubble tunneling rate, which is\nconsistent with the result obtained by Farhi, Guth and Guven when the wormhole\ndisappears. We show that the tunneling rate increases with the throat radius of\nthe wormhole. Furthermore, we illustrate that the tunneling rate increases with\nan increases in the mass of the black hole or the surface tension. In the case\nwhere a wormhole exists within a bubble and is connected to another universe,\nwe demonstrate that the bubble can enter into another universe through quantum\ntunneling.",

            "summary": "The problem of urban event ranking aims at predicting the top-k most risky\nlocations of future events such as traffic accidents and crimes. This problem\nis of fundamental importance to public safety and urban administration\nespecially when limited resources are available. The problem is, however,\nchallenging due to complex and dynamic spatio-temporal correlations between\nlocations, uneven distribution of urban events in space, and the difficulty to\ncorrectly rank nearby locations with similar features. Prior works on event\nforecasting mostly aim at accurately predicting the actual risk score or counts\nof events for all the locations. Rankings obtained as such usually have low\nquality due to prediction errors. Learning-to-rank methods directly optimize\nmeasures such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), but cannot\nhandle the spatiotemporal autocorrelation existing among locations. In this\npaper, we bridge the gap by proposing a novel spatial event ranking approach\nnamed SpatialRank. SpatialRank features adaptive graph convolution layers that\ndynamically learn the spatiotemporal dependencies across locations from data.\nIn addition, the model optimizes through surrogates a hybrid NDCG loss with a\nspatial component to better rank neighboring spatial locations. We design an\nimportance-sampling with a spatial filtering algorithm to effectively evaluate\nthe loss during training. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that SpatialRank can effectively identify the top riskiest\nlocations of crimes and traffic accidents and outperform state-of-art methods\nin terms of NDCG by up to 12.7%.",

            "summary": "Detailed observations of the velocities of Jovian vortices exist at only one\nheight in the atmosphere, so their vertical structures are poorly understood.\nThis motivates this study that computes stable 3-dimensional, long-lived\nplanetary vortices that satisfy the equations of motion. We solve the anelastic\nequations with a high-resolution pseudo-spectral method using the observed\nJovian atmospheric temperatures and zonal flow. We examine several families of\nvortices and find that {\\it constant-vorticity} vortices, which have\nnearly-uniform vorticity as a function of height and horizontal areas that go\nto zero at their tops and bottoms, converge to stable vortices that look like\nthe Great Red Spot (GRS) and other Jovian anticyclones. In contrast, the {\\it\nconstant-area} vortices proposed in previous studies, which have nearly-uniform\nareas as a function of height and vertical vorticities that go to zero at their\ntops and bottoms, are far from equilibrium, break apart, and converge to {\\it\nconstant-vorticity} vortices. Our late-time vortices show unexpected\nproperties. Vortices that are initially non-hollow become hollow (i.e., have\nlocal minima of vertical vorticity at their centers), which is a feature of the\nGRS that cannot be explained with 2-dimensional simulations. The central axes\nof the final vortices align with the planetary-spin axis even if they initially\nalign with the local direction of gravity. We present scaling laws for how\nvortex properties change with the Rossby number and other non-dimensional\nparameters. We analytically prove that the horizontal mid-plane of a stable\nvortex must lie at a height above the top of the convective zone.",

The Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) represents an\nentirely novel category of massively parallel processors, meticulously designed\nto expedite parallel computations through a multitude of processing cores and\non-chip memory components interconnected via high-speed fabrics.

This\npaper proposes a Bayesian approach for adaptive EMG pattern classification\nusing semi-supervised sequential learning. The proposed method uses a Bayesian\nclassification model based on Gaussian distributions to predict the motion\nclass and estimate its confidence. Pseudo-labels are subsequently assigned to\ndata with high-prediction confidence, and the posterior distributions of the\nmodel are sequentially updated within the framework of Bayesian updating,\nthereby achieving adaptive motion recognition to alterations in signal\ncharacteristics over time. Experimental results on six healthy adults\ndemonstrated that the proposed method can suppress the degradation of\nclassification accuracy over time and outperforms conventional methods.

            "updated": "2023-09-30T03:27:31Z",

            "summary": "Recently, pre-trained vision-language models have been increasingly used to\ntackle the challenging zero-shot segmentation task. Typical solutions follow\nthe paradigm of first generating mask proposals and then adopting CLIP to\nclassify them. To maintain the CLIP's zero-shot transferability, previous\npractices favour to freeze CLIP during training. However, in the paper, we\nreveal that CLIP is insensitive to different mask proposals and tends to\nproduce similar predictions for various mask proposals of the same image. This\ninsensitivity results in numerous false positives when classifying mask\nproposals. This issue mainly relates to the fact that CLIP is trained with\nimage-level supervision. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet\neffective method, named Mask-aware Fine-tuning (MAFT). Specifically,\nImage-Proposals CLIP Encoder (IP-CLIP Encoder) is proposed to handle arbitrary\nnumbers of image and mask proposals simultaneously. Then, mask-aware loss and\nself-distillation loss are designed to fine-tune IP-CLIP Encoder, ensuring CLIP\nis responsive to different mask proposals while not sacrificing\ntransferability. In this way, mask-aware representations can be easily learned\nto make the true positives stand out. Notably, our solution can seamlessly plug\ninto most existing methods without introducing any new parameters during the\nfine-tuning process. We conduct extensive experiments on the popular zero-shot\nbenchmarks. With MAFT, the performance of the state-of-the-art methods is\npromoted by a large margin: 50.4% (+ 8.2%) on COCO, 81.8% (+ 3.2%) on\nPascal-VOC, and 8.7% (+4.3%) on ADE20K in terms of mIoU for unseen classes.

            "summary": "Federated learning (FL) is a popular approach to facilitate privacy-aware\nmachine learning since it allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a\nglobal model without granting others access to their private data. It is,\nhowever, known that FL can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks\n(MIAs), where the training records of the global model can be distinguished\nfrom the testing records. Surprisingly, research focusing on the investigation\nof the source inference problem appears to be lacking. We also observe that\nidentifying a training record's source client can result in privacy breaches\nextending beyond MIAs. For example, consider an FL application where multiple\nhospitals jointly train a COVID-19 diagnosis model, membership inference\nattackers can identify the medical records that have been used for training,\nand any additional identification of the source hospital can result the patient\nfrom the particular hospital more prone to discrimination. Seeking to\ncontribute to the literature gap, we take the first step to investigate source\nprivacy in FL. Specifically, we propose a new inference attack (hereafter\nreferred to as source inference attack -- SIA), designed to facilitate an\nhonest-but-curious server to identify the training record's source client. The\nproposed SIAs leverage the Bayesian theorem to allow the server to implement\nthe attack in a non-intrusive manner without deviating from the defined FL\nprotocol. We then evaluate SIAs in three different FL frameworks to show that\nin existing FL frameworks, the clients sharing gradients, model parameters, or\npredictions on a public dataset will leak such source information to the\nserver. We also conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to\ninvestigate the key factors in an SIA. The experimental results validate the\nefficacy of the proposed SIAs.",

            "summary": "The application of 3D ViTs to medical image segmentation has seen remarkable\nstrides, somewhat overshadowing the budding advancements in Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN)-based models. Large kernel depthwise convolution has\nemerged as a promising technique, showcasing capabilities akin to hierarchical\ntransformers and facilitating an expansive effective receptive field (ERF)\nvital for dense predictions. Despite this, existing core operators, ranging\nfrom global-local attention to large kernel convolution, exhibit inherent\ntrade-offs and limitations (e.g., global-local range trade-off, aggregating\nattentional features). We hypothesize that deformable convolution can be an\nexploratory alternative to combine all advantages from the previous operators,\nproviding long-range dependency, adaptive spatial aggregation and computational\nefficiency as a foundation backbone. In this work, we introduce 3D\nDeformUX-Net, a pioneering volumetric CNN model that adeptly navigates the\nshortcomings traditionally associated with ViTs and large kernel convolution.\nSpecifically, we revisit volumetric deformable convolution in depth-wise\nsetting to adapt long-range dependency with computational efficiency. Inspired\nby the concepts of structural re-parameterization for convolution kernel\nweights, we further generate the deformable tri-planar offsets by adapting a\nparallel branch (starting from $1\\times1\\times1$ convolution), providing\nadaptive spatial aggregation across all channels. Our empirical evaluations\nreveal that the 3D DeformUX-Net consistently outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art ViTs and large kernel convolution models across four\nchallenging public datasets, spanning various scales from organs (KiTS: 0.680\nto 0.720, MSD Pancreas: 0.676 to 0.717, AMOS: 0.871 to 0.902) to vessels (e.g.,\nMSD hepatic vessels: 0.635 to 0.671) in mean Dice.",

To address this, we take inspiration from\nthe human brain, in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent\ninteraction of specialized modules in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These\nmodules perform functions such as conflict monitoring, state prediction, state\nevaluation, task decomposition, and task coordination. We find that LLMs are\nsometimes capable of carrying out these functions in isolation, but struggle to\nautonomously coordinate them in the service of a goal. Therefore, we propose a\nblack box architecture with multiple LLM-based (GPT-4) modules. The\narchitecture improves planning through the interaction of specialized\nPFC-inspired modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief\nautomated calls to the LLM. We evaluate the combined architecture on two\nchallenging planning tasks -- graph traversal and Tower of Hanoi -- finding\nthat it yields significant improvements over standard LLM methods (e.g.,\nzero-shot prompting or in-context learning). These results demonstrate the\nbenefit of utilizing knowledge from cognitive neuroscience to improve planning\nin LLMs.",

Upon investigating thermodynamic properties such as internal\nenergy, entropy, specific heat, and correlation length, we observe sharp\nchanges near zero temperature. Magnetic properties, including magnetization and\nmagnetic susceptibility, display distinct behaviors that provide insights into\nspin configurations in different phases. However, the Potts model lacks genuine\nphase transitions at finite temperatures, in line with the Peierls argument for\none-dimensional systems. Nonetheless, in the general case of an arbitrary\n$q$-state, magnetic properties such as correlation length, magnetization, and\nmagnetic susceptibility exhibit intriguing remnants of a zero-temperature phase\ntransition at finite temperatures. Furthermore, residual entropy uncovers\nunusual frustrated regions at zero-temperature phase transitions. This feature\nleads to the peculiar thermodynamic properties of phase boundaries, including a\nsharp entropy change resembling a first-order discontinuity without an entropy\njump, and pronounced peaks in second-order derivatives of free energy,\nsuggestive of a second-order phase transition divergence, but without\nsingularities.

An important approach for this\ntask, known as view planning, is to judiciously place a number of cameras in\npositions that maximize the visual information improving the resulting 3D\nreconstruction. Circumventing the need for a large number of arbitrary images,\ngeometric criteria can be applied to select fewer yet more informative images\nto markedly improve the 3D reconstruction performance. Nonetheless,\nincorporating the noise of the environment that exists in various real-world\nscenarios into these criteria may be challenging, particularly when prior\ninformation about the noise is not provided. To that end, this work advocates a\nnovel geometric function that accounts for the existing noise, relying solely\non a relatively small number of noise realizations without requiring its\nclosed-form expression. With no analytic expression of the geometric function,\nthis work puts forth a Bayesian optimization algorithm for accurate 3D\nreconstruction in the presence of noise. Numerical tests on noisy agricultural\nenvironments showcase the impressive merits of the proposed approach for 3D\nreconstruction with even a small number of available cameras.",

This establishes a connection between NNs and kernel methods, the\nlatter of which are well understood. Based on this link, theoretical benefits\nand algorithmic improvements have been hypothesized and empirically\ndemonstrated in synthetic architectures. These advantages include faster\noptimization, reliable uncertainty quantification and improved continual\nlearning. However, current results quantifying the rate of convergence to the\nkernel regime suggest that exploiting these benefits requires architectures\nthat are orders of magnitude wider than they are deep. This assumption raises\nconcerns that practically relevant architectures do not exhibit behavior as\npredicted via the NTK. In this work, we empirically investigate whether the\nlimiting regime either describes the behavior of large-width architectures used\nin practice or is informative for algorithmic improvements.

The expansion\nrates of ancient nova shells offer a way to constrain both the time between\nnova eruptions and the time for post-nova mass transfer rates to decrease\nsignificantly, simultaneously testing nova thermonuclear runaway models and\nhibernation theory. Previous limits on the expansion rate of part of the Z Cam\nshell constrain the inter-eruption time between Z Cam nova events to be $>$\n1300 years. Deeper narrow-band imaging of the ejecta of Z Cam with the Condor\nArray Telescope now reveals very low surface brightness areas of the remainder\nof the shell. A second, even fainter shell is also detected, concentric with\nand nearly three times the size of the \"inner\" shell. This is the first\nobservational support of the prediction that concentric shells must surround\nthe frequently-erupting novae of relatively massive white dwarfs. The Condor\nimages extend our Z Cam imaging baseline to 15 years, yielding the inner\nshell's expansion rate as $v = 83 \\pm 37$ km s$^{-1}$ at 23 degrees South of\nWest, in excellent agreement with our 2012 prediction. This velocity\ncorresponds to an approximate age of $t = 2672^{-817}_{+2102}$ yr. While\nconsistent with the suggestion that the most recent nova eruption of Z Cam was\nthe transient recorded by Chinese Imperial astrologers in the year 77 BCE, the\nage uncertainty is still too large to support or disprove a connection with Z\nCam.",

This paper proposes a new sampling strategy for global fit called\nGradient and Uncertainty Enhanced Sequential Sampling (GUESS). The acquisition\nfunction uses two terms: the predictive posterior uncertainty of the surrogate\nmodel for exploration of unseen regions and a weighted approximation of the\nsecond and higher-order Taylor expansion values for exploitation. Although\nvarious sampling strategies have been proposed so far, the selection of a\nsuitable method is not trivial. Therefore, we compared our proposed strategy to\n9 adaptive sampling strategies for global surrogate modeling, based on 26\ndifferent 1 to 8-dimensional deterministic benchmarks functions.

            "summary": "Researchers in the behavioral and social sciences often use linear\ndiscriminant analysis (LDA) for predictions of group membership\n(classification) and for identifying the variables most relevant to group\nseparation among a set of continuous correlated variables (description). In\nthis paper, we compare existing linear classification algorithms for\nnonnormally distributed multivariate repeated measures data in a simulation\nstudy based on Likert-type data. It is widely accepted that, as a multivariate\ntechnique, LDA provides more accurate results by examining not only the\nrelationship between the independent and dependent variables but also the\nrelationships within the independent variables themselves. In educational and\npsychological research and other disciplines, longitudinal data are often\ncollected which provide additional temporal information. However, linear\nclassification methods for repeated measures data are rarely discussed in the\nliterature despite these potential applications. These methods are more\nsensitive to actual group differences by taking the complex correlations\nbetween time points and variables into account, when compared to analyzing the\ndata at each time point separately. Moreover, data in the behavioral and social\nsciences rarely fulfill the multivariate normality assumption, so we consider\ntechniques that additionally do not require multivariate normality. The results\nshow that methods which include multivariate outlier removal before parameter\nestimation as well as robust parameter estimation using generalized estimating\nequations (GEE) perform better than the standard repeated measures LDA which\nassumes multivariate normality. The results of the longitudinal support vector\nmachine (SVM) were not competitive.",

The $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $H_0=(70\\pm 5)$ km/s/Mpc\nis adopted to study the UltraVISTA DR1, COSMOS2015 and SPLASH surveys,\nalongside the number density equations of these galaxy distribution systems as\nfractals with dimension D. The relativistic distance definitions $d_L$, $d_Z$\nand $d_G$ are used to estimate the galaxy number densities in the redshift\ninterval $0.1 \\leq z \\leq 4$ at volume limited subsamples. Applying the\nappropriate relations for the description of galaxy fractal structures with\nsingle dimension $D$ in the relativistic settings to these surveys datasets it\nis possible to state that for $z<1$ the UltraVISTA DR1 galaxies presented an\naverage of $D=(1.58\\pm 0.20)$, the COSMOS2015 galaxies produced $D=(1.39\\pm\n0.19)$ and the SPLASH galaxies generated $D=(1.00\\pm 0.12)$. For $1 \\leq z \\leq\n4$ the dimensions respectively decreased to $D=(0.59\\pm 0.28)$,\n$D=0.54^{+0.27}_{-0.26}$ and $D=0.83^{+0.36}_{-0.37}$. These results are robust\nunder the Hubble constant uncertainty assumed here. Analysis of blue and red\ngalaxies subsamples in the COSMOS2015 and SPLASH surveys show that the fractal\ndimensions of blue galaxies present essentially no alteration from the values\nabove, although the ones for the red galaxies changed mostly to smaller values,\nmeaning that D may be assumed as a more intrinsic property of the distribution\nof objects in the Universe, thus allowing for the fractal dimension to be used\nas a tool to study different populations of galaxies. All results confirm the\ndecades old theoretical prediction of a decrease in the fractal dimension for\n$z>1$ suggesting that either there are yet unclear observational biases causing\nsuch decrease in the fractal dimension, or the galaxy clustering was possibly\nmore sparse and the universe void dominated in a not too distant past.",

            "summary": "The origin of Uranus and Neptune has long been challenging to explain, due to\nthe large orbital distances from the Sun. After a planetary embryo has been\nformed, the main accretion processes are likely pebble, gas and planetesimal\naccretion. Previous studies of Uranus and Neptune formation typically don't\nconsider all three processes; and furthermore, do not investigate how the\nformation of the outer planet impacts the inner planet. In this paper we study\nthe concurrent formation of Uranus and Neptune via both pebble, gas and\nplanetesimal accretion. We use a dust-evolution model to predict the size and\nmass flux of pebbles, and derive our own fit for gas accretion. We do not\ninclude migration, but consider a wide range of formation locations between 12\nand 40au. If the planetary embryos form at the same time and with the same\nmass, our formation model with an evolving dust population is unable to produce\nUranus and Neptune analogues. This is because the mass difference between the\nplanets and the H-He mass fractions become too high. However, if the outer\nplanetary embryo forms earlier and/or more massive than the inner embryo, the\ntwo planets do form in a few instances when the disk is metal-rich and\ndissipates after a few Myr. Furthermore, our study suggests that in-situ\nformation is rather unlikely. Nethertheless, giant impacts and/or migration\ncould potentially aid in the formation, and future studies including these\nprocesses could bring us one step closer to understanding how Uranus and\nNeptune formed.",

Polyureas are favored for these\napplications due to their mechanical strain rate sensitivity and energy\ndissipation. Predicting and tailoring the mechanical response of PU remains\nchallenging due to the complex interaction between its elastomeric and glassy\nphases. To elucidate the role of PU microstructure on its mechanical\nproperties, we developed a finite element modeling framework in which each\nphase is represented by a volume fraction within a representative volume\nelement (RVE). Critically, we used separate constitutive models to describe the\nelastomeric and glassy phases. We developed a plasticity-driven breakdown\nprocess in which we model the glassy phase disaggregating into a new phase. The\noverall contribution of each phase at a material point is determined by their\nrespective volume fractions within the RVE. We applied our modeling methods to\ntwo compositions of PU with differing elastomeric segment lengths derived from\noligoether diamines, Versalink P650 and P1000. Our simulations show that a\ncombination of microstructural differences and elastomeric phase properties\naccounts for the difference in mechanical response between P650 and P1000. We\nshow our model's ability to predict PU behavior in various loading conditions,\nincluding low-rate cyclic loading and monotonic loading over a wide range of\nstrain rates. Our model produces microstructure transformations that mirror\nthose indicated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. Fourier\ntransform analysis of our RVEs reveals glassy phase fibrillation due to\ndeformation, a finding consistent with SAXS experiments.",

What statistics in the\ncell's environment control this tradeoff? What properties of the environment\nmake it variable enough that this tradeoff is relevant? We model a single\neukaryotic cell sensing a chemical secreted from bacteria (e.g. folic acid). In\nthis case, the environment changes because the bacteria swim - leading to\nchanges in the true concentration at the cell. We develop analytical\ncalculations and stochastic simulations of sensing in this environment. We find\nthat cells can have a huge variety of optimal sensing strategies, ranging from\nnot time averaging at all, to averaging over an arbitrarily long time, or\nhaving a finite optimal averaging time. The factors that primarily control the\nideal averaging are the ratio of sensing noise to environmental variation, and\nthe ratio of timescales of sensing to the timescale of environmental variation.\nSensing noise depends on the receptor-ligand kinetics, while the environmental\nvariation depends on the density of bacteria and the degradation and diffusion\nproperties of the secreted chemoattractant. Our results suggest that\nfluctuating environmental concentrations may be a relevant source of noise even\nin a relatively static environment.",

            "summary": "Active surveillance (AS) is a suitable management option for newly-diagnosed\nprostate cancer (PCa), which usually presents low to intermediate clinical\nrisk. Patients enrolled in AS have their tumor closely monitored via\nlongitudinal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), serum\nprostate-specific antigen tests, and biopsies. Hence, the patient is prescribed\ntreatment when these tests identify progression to higher-risk PCa. However,\ncurrent AS protocols rely on detecting tumor progression through direct\nobservation according to standardized monitoring strategies. This approach\nlimits the design of patient-specific AS plans and may lead to the late\ndetection and treatment of tumor progression. Here, we propose to address these\nissues by leveraging personalized computational predictions of PCa growth. Our\nforecasts are obtained with a spatiotemporal biomechanistic model informed by\npatient-specific longitudinal mpMRI data. Our results show that our predictive\ntechnology can represent and forecast the global tumor burden for individual\npatients, achieving concordance correlation coefficients ranging from 0.93 to\n0.99 across our cohort (n=7). Additionally, we identify a model-based biomarker\nof higher-risk PCa: the mean proliferation activity of the tumor (p=0.041).\nUsing logistic regression, we construct a PCa risk classifier based on this\nbiomarker that achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve of 0.83. We further show that coupling our tumor forecasts with this PCa\nrisk classifier enables the early identification of PCa progression to\nhigher-risk disease by more than one year. Thus, we posit that our predictive\ntechnology constitutes a promising clinical decision-making tool to design\npersonalized AS plans for PCa patients.",

The feature is not as clearly determined in profiles around DES clusters.\nWe verify that measurements using SPT or ACT maps are consistent across all\nscales, including in the deficit feature. The SZ profiles of optically selected\nand SZ-selected clusters are also consistent for higher mass clusters. Those of\nless massive, optically selected clusters are suppressed on small scales by\nfactors of 2-5 compared to predictions, and we discuss possible interpretations\nof this behavior. An oriented stacking of clusters -- where the orientation is\ninferred from the SZ image, the brightest cluster galaxy, or the surrounding\nlarge-scale structure measured using galaxy catalogs -- shows the normalization\nof the one-halo and two-halo terms vary with orientation.

Typically, two\nparadigms are existing: a physics-driven approach utilizing process-oriented\ncomputational simulation models for the tunnel-soil interaction and the\nsettlement prediction, and a data-driven approach employing machine learning\ntechniques to establish mappings between influencing factors and the ground\nsettlement. To integrate the advantages of both approaches and to assimilate\nthe data from different sources, we propose a multi-fidelity deep operator\nnetwork (DeepONet) framework, leveraging the recently developed operator\nlearning methods. The presented framework comprises of two components: a\nlow-fidelity subnet that captures the fundamental ground settlement patterns\nobtained from finite element simulations, and a high-fidelity subnet that\nlearns the nonlinear correlation between numerical models and real engineering\nmonitoring data. A pre-processing strategy for causality is adopted to consider\nthe spatio-temporal characteristics of the settlement during tunnel excavation.\nTransfer learning is utilized to reduce the training cost for the low-fidelity\nsubnet. The results show that the proposed method can effectively capture the\nphysical information provided by the numerical simulations and accurately fit\nmeasured data as well. Remarkably, even with very limited noisy monitoring\ndata, the proposed model can achieve rapid, accurate, and robust predictions of\nthe full-field ground settlement in real-time during mechanized tunnel\nexcavation.",

Using Floquet\ntheory in combination with the atom-only description we provide a precise\ndetermination of the phase boundaries and of the dynamical response of the\natoms.

This motivates the investigation of such invariants for\na certain type of geometric transformation of interest in the context of root\nsystems, reflection groups, Lie groups and Lie algebras: the Coxeter\ntransformations. We perform exhaustive calculations of all Coxeter\ntransformations for $A_8$, $D_8$ and $E_8$ for a choice of basis of simple\nroots and compute their invariants, using high-performance computing. This\ncomputational algebra paradigm generates a dataset that can then be mined using\ntechniques from data science such as supervised and unsupervised machine\nlearning. In this paper we focus on neural network classification and principal\ncomponent analysis. Since the output -- the invariants -- is fully determined\nby the choice of simple roots and the permutation order of the corresponding\nreflections in the Coxeter element, we expect huge degeneracy in the mapping.\nThis provides the perfect setup for machine learning, and indeed we see that\nthe datasets can be machine learned to very high accuracy. This paper is a\npump-priming study in experimental mathematics using Clifford algebras, showing\nthat such Clifford algebraic datasets are amenable to machine learning, and\nshedding light on relationships between these novel and other well-known\ngeometric invariants and also giving rise to analytic results.",

            "summary": "We construct a class of solvable models for 2+1D quantum critical points by\nattaching 1+1D conformal field theories (CFTs) to fluctuating domain walls\nforming a ``loop soup''. Specifically, our local Hamiltonian attaches gapless\nspin chains to the domain walls of a triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet.\nThe macroscopic degeneracy between antiferromagnetic configurations is split by\nthe Casimir energy of each decorating CFT, which is usually negative and thus\nfavors a short loop phase with a finite gap. However, we found a set of 1D CFT\nHamiltonians for which the Casimir energy is effectively positive, making it\nfavorable for domain walls to coalesce into a single ``snake'' which is\nmacroscopically long and thus hosts a CFT with a vanishing gap. The snake\nconfigurations are geometrical objects also known as fully-packed self-avoiding\nwalks or Hamiltonian walks which are described by an $\\mathrm{O}(n=0)$ loop\nensemble with a non-unitary 2+0D CFT description. Combining this description\nwith the 1+1D decoration CFT, we obtain a 2+1D theory with unusual critical\nexponents and entanglement properties. Regarding the latter, we show that the\n$\\log$ contributions from the decoration CFTs conspire with the spatial\ndistribution of loops crossing the entanglement cut to generate a ``non-local\narea law''.

Current\nresearch, however, predominantly concentrates on the multi-task dense\nprediction setting, which overlooks the intrinsic 3D world and its multi-view\nconsistent structures, and lacks the capability for versatile imagination. In\nresponse to these limitations, we present a novel problem setting -- multi-task\nview synthesis (MTVS), which reinterprets multi-task prediction as a set of\nnovel-view synthesis tasks for multiple scene properties, including RGB. To\ntackle the MTVS problem, we propose MuvieNeRF, a framework that incorporates\nboth multi-task and cross-view knowledge to simultaneously synthesize multiple\nscene properties. MuvieNeRF integrates two key modules, the Cross-Task\nAttention (CTA) and Cross-View Attention (CVA) modules, enabling the efficient\nuse of information across multiple views and tasks. Extensive evaluation on\nboth synthetic and realistic benchmarks demonstrates that MuvieNeRF is capable\nof simultaneously synthesizing different scene properties with promising visual\nquality, even outperforming conventional discriminative models in various\nsettings. Notably, we show that MuvieNeRF exhibits universal applicability\nacross a range of NeRF backbones. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/zsh2000/MuvieNeRF.",

We compare the different\n$T_e$ measurements with HII region and interstellar medium environmental\nproperties such as electron density, ionization parameter, molecular gas\nvelocity dispersion, and stellar association/cluster mass and age obtained from\nPHANGS. We find that the temperatures from [OII] and [SII] are likely\nover-estimated due to the presence of electron density inhomogeneities in HII\nregions. We observe that differences between [NII] and [SIII] temperatures are\nweakly correlated with stellar association mass and molecular gas velocity\ndispersion. We measure high [OIII] temperatures in a subset of regions with\nhigh molecular gas velocity dispersion and low ionization parameter, which may\nbe explained by the presence of low-velocity shocks. Of all the temperatures\nconsidered, the $T_{\\rm{e}}$--$T_{\\rm{e}}$ between [NII] and [SIII]\ntemperatures have the lowest observed scatter and generally follow predictions\nfrom photoionization modeling, which suggests that these tracers reflect HII\nregion temperatures across the various ionization zones better than [OII],\n[SII], and [OIII].",

            "summary": "Recently a line of researches has delved the use of graph neural networks\n(GNNs) for decentralized control in swarm robotics. However, it has been\nobserved that relying solely on the states of immediate neighbors is\ninsufficient to imitate a centralized control policy. To address this\nlimitation, prior studies proposed incorporating $L$-hop delayed states into\nthe computation. While this approach shows promise, it can lead to a lack of\nconsensus among distant flock members and the formation of small clusters,\nconsequently resulting in the failure of cohesive flocking behaviors. Instead,\nour approach leverages spatiotemporal GNN, named STGNN that encompasses both\nspatial and temporal expansions. The spatial expansion collects delayed states\nfrom distant neighbors, while the temporal expansion incorporates previous\nstates from immediate neighbors. The broader and more comprehensive information\ngathered from both expansions results in more effective and accurate\npredictions. We develop an expert algorithm for controlling a swarm of robots\nand employ imitation learning to train our decentralized STGNN model based on\nthe expert algorithm. We simulate the proposed STGNN approach in various\nsettings, demonstrating its decentralized capacity to emulate the global expert\nalgorithm. Further, we implemented our approach to achieve cohesive flocking,\nleader following and obstacle avoidance by a group of Crazyflie drones. The\nperformance of STGNN underscores its potential as an effective and reliable\napproach for achieving cohesive flocking, leader following and obstacle\navoidance tasks.",

So far, FQAHE has been observed only\nin twisted MoTe2 (t-MoTe2) at moire filling factor v > 1/2. Graphene-based\nmoire superlattices are believed to host FQAHE with the potential advantage of\nsuperior material quality and higher electron mobility. Here we report the\nobservation of integer and fractional QAH effects in a rhombohedral pentalayer\ngraphene/hBN moire superlattice. At zero magnetic field, we observed plateaus\nof quantized Hall resistance Rxy = h/(ve^2) at filling factors v = 1, 2/3, 3/5,\n4/7, 4/9, 3/7 and 2/5 of the moire superlattice respectively. These features\nare accompanied by clear dips in the longitudinal resistance Rxx. In addition,\nat zero magnetic field, Rxy equals 2h/e^2 at v = 1/2 and varies linearly with\nthe filling factor-similar to the composite Fermi liquid (CFL) in the\nhalf-filled lowest Landau level at high magnetic fields. By tuning the gate\ndisplacement field D and v, we observed phase transitions from CFL and FQAH\nstates to other correlated electron states. Our graphene system provides an\nideal platform for exploring charge fractionalization and (non-Abelian) anyonic\nbraiding at zero magnetic field, especially considering a lateral junction\nbetween FQAHE and superconducting regions in the same device.",

A\nprototypical example of such an event is the orchestrated fusion of membranes\nwithin an endosome that enables transport of cargo and processing of\nbiochemical moieties. In this work, we demonstrate how protein filaments on the\nendosomal membrane surface can leverage a rigid-to-flexible transformation to\nelicit a large-scale change in membrane flexibility to enable membrane fusion.\nWe develop a polymer field-theoretic model that captures molecular alignment\narising from nematic interactions with varying surface density and fraction of\nflexible filaments, which are biologically controlled within the endosomal\nmembrane. We then predict the collective elasticity of the filament brush in\nresponse to changes in the filament alignment, predicting a greater than\n20-fold increase of the effective membrane elasticity over the bare membrane\nelasticity that is triggered by filament alignment. These results show that the\nendosome can modulate the filament properties to orchestrate membrane\nfluidization that facilitates vesicle fusion, providing an example of how\nactive processes that modulate local molecular properties can result in\nlarge-scale transformations that are essential to cellular survival.",

This Gumbel law describes the typical\nfluctuations of $M_t$ around its average $\\sim \\ln (r t)$ for large $t$ on a\nscale of $O(1)$. Here we compute the large-deviation tails of this distribution\nwhen $M_t = O(t)$ and show that the large-deviation function has a singularity\nwhere the second derivative is discontinuous, signalling a dynamical phase\ntransition. Then we consider a collection of independent RBMs with initial (and\nresetting) positions uniformly distributed with a density $\\rho$ over the\nnegative half-line. We show that the fluctuations in the initial positions of\nthe particles modify the distribution of $M_t$. The average over the initial\nconditions can be performed in two different ways, in analogy with disordered\nsystems: (i) the annealed case where one averages over all possible initial\nconditions and (ii) the quenched case where one considers only the\ncontributions coming from typical initial configurations. We show that in the\nannealed case, the limiting distribution of the maximum is characterized by a\nnew scaling function, different from the Gumbel law but the large-deviation\nfunction remains the same as in the single particle case. In contrast, for the\nquenched case, the limiting (typical) distribution remains Gumbel but the\nlarge-deviation behaviors are new and nontrivial. Our analytical results, both\nfor the typical as well as for the large-deviation regime of $M_t$, are\nverified numerically with extremely high precision, down to $10^{-250}$ for the\nprobability density of $M_t$.",

In this paper, we shed light on how degree bias in networks affects\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) link prediction.

We validate our theoretical analysis\non real-world citation, collaboration, and online social networks. We further\nbridge GCN's preferential attachment bias with unfairness in link prediction\nand propose a new within-group fairness metric. This metric quantifies\ndisparities in link prediction scores between social groups, towards combating\nthe amplification of degree and power disparities. Finally, we propose a simple\ntraining-time strategy to alleviate within-group unfairness, and we show that\nit is effective on citation, online social, and credit networks.",

To take advantage of the fascinating\nproperties of 2D materials, understanding the nature and impact of various GB\nstructures on the pristine 2D sheet is crucial. In this work, using an\nevolutionary algorithm search, we predict a wide variety of silicene GB\nstructures with very different atomic structures compared to those found in\ngraphene or hexagonal boron-nitride. Twenty-one GBs with the lowest energy were\nvalidated by density functional theory (DFT) - a majority of which were\npreviously unreported to our best knowledge. Based on the diversity of the GB\npredictions, we found that the formation energy and mechanical properties can\nbe dramatically altered by adatoms positions within a GB and certain types of\natomic structures, such as four-atom rings. To study the mechanical behavior of\nthese GBs, we apply strain to the GB structures stepwise and use DFT\ncalculations to investigate the mechanical properties of 9 representative\nstructures. It is observed that GB structures based on pentagon-heptagon pairs\nare likely to have similar or higher in-plane stiffness and strength compared\nwith the zigzag orientation of pristine silicene. However, an adatom located at\nthe hollow site of a heptagon ring can significantly deteriorate the mechanical\nstrength. For all the structures, the in-plane stiffness and strength were\nfound to decrease with increasing formation energy. For the failure behavior of\nGB structures, it was found that GB structures based on pentagon-heptagon pairs\nhave failure behavior similar to graphene. We also found that the GB structures\nwith atoms positioned outside of the 2D plane tend to experience phase\ntransitions before failure. Utilizing the evolutionary algorithm, we locate\ndiverse silicene GBs and obtain useful information for their mechanical\nproperties.",

In contrast to\nmost approaches that broadly label each pixel as either lumen, media, or\nbackground, we propose to approximate the lumen and media contours by closed\npolygonal chains. The chain vertices are placed at fixed angles obtained by\ndividing the entire 360\\degree~angular space into equally spaced angles, and we\npredict their radius using an adaptive-subband-decomposition CNN. We consider\ntwo loss functions during training. The first is a novel loss function using\nthe Jaccard Measure (JM) to quantify the similarities between the predicted\nlumen and media segments and the corresponding ground-truth image segments. The\nsecond loss function is the traditional Mean Squared Error. The proposed\narchitecture significantly reduces computational costs by replacing the popular\nauto-encoder structure with a simple CNN as the encoder and the decoder is\nreduced to simply joining the consecutive predicted points. We evaluated our\nnetwork on the publicly available IVUS-Challenge-2011 dataset using two\nperformance metrics, namely JM and Hausdorff Distance (HD).

We derived the velocity dispersion profiles in Galactic cylindrical\ncoordinates, and solved the Jeans Equation for the two samples separately. The\nresult is surprising that the total surface mass density as a function of\nvertical height as derived for these two chemically distinguished populations\nare different. The discrepancies are larger in the inner compared to the outer\nGalaxy, with the density calculated from thick disk being larger, independent\nof the Galactic radius. Furthermore, while there is an overall good agreement\nbetween the total mass density derived for the thick disk population and the\nStandard Halo Model for vertical heights larger than 1 kpc, close to the\nmidplane the mass density observed using the thick disk population is larger\nthan the predicted from the Standard Halo Model. We explore various\nimplications of these discrepancies, and speculate their sources, including\nproblems associated with the assumed density laws, velocity dispersion\nprofiles, and the Galactic rotation curve, potential non-equilibrium of the\nGalactic disk, or a failure of the NFW dark matter halo profile for the Milky\nWay.

            "summary": "The multipole moments of black holes in general relativity obey certain\nconsistency relations known as the no-hair theorems. The details of this\nmultipolar structure are imprinted into the gravitational waves emitted by\nbinary black holes, particularly if the binary is precessing. If black holes do\nnot obey the vacuum field equations of general relativity, then the no-hair\ntheorems may be broken, and the observed gravitational waves will be modified,\nthus providing an important test of the no-hair theorems. Recently, analytic\nsolutions to the precession dynamics and inspiral waveforms were computed\nwithin the context of binaries possessing non-axisymmetric mass quadrupole\nmoments, which are parametrized by a modulus $q_{m}$ and phase $a_{m}$ with $m\n= 1,2$ the azimuthal spherical harmonic number. Here, we use a Fisher analysis\nto study plausible constraints one may obtain on generic, non-axisymmetry\nquadrupole configurations using current and future ground-based detectors. For\nnon-precessing binaries, we generically find that no meaningful constraints can\nbe placed on the non-axisymmetry parameters $(q_{m}, a_{m})$ due to the\npresence of strong degeneracies with other waveform parameters. For precessing\nconfigurations, the exact value of the uncertainty is strongly dependent on the\nsky location, system orientation relative to the line of sight, and initial\ninclination angle of the orbital angular momentum. After averaging over these\nparameters, we find that with GWTC-3-like events, one should be able to\nplausibly constraint non-axisymmetric mass quadrupole deviations to $\\Delta\nq_{m} \\sim 10^{-2}$ for LIGO at design sensitivity, and $\\Delta q_{m} \\sim\n10^{-4}$ for the same sources with Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.",

However,\nsingle-shot FAS remains a challenging and under-explored problem due to two\nmain reasons: 1) on the data side, learning FAS from RGB images is largely\ncontext-dependent, and single-shot images without additional annotations\ncontain limited semantic information. 2) on the model side, existing\nsingle-shot FAS models are infeasible to provide proper evidence for their\ndecisions, and FAS methods based on depth estimation require expensive\nper-pixel annotations. To address these issues, a large binocular NIR image\ndataset (BNI-FAS) is constructed and published, which contains more than\n300,000 real face and plane attack images, and an Interpretable FAS Transformer\n(IFAST) is proposed that requires only weak supervision to produce\ninterpretable predictions.

Aims: We investigate the impact\nof AM transport by the magnetic Tayler instability as a possible candidate for\nsuch a missing mechanism. Methods: We derived general equations for AM\ntransport by the Tayler instability to be able to test different versions of\nthe Tayler-Spruit (TS) dynamo. Results: These general equations highlight, in a\nsimple way, the key role played by the adopted damping timescale of the\nazimuthal magnetic field on the efficiency of the resulting AM transport. Using\nthis framework, we first show that the original TS dynamo provides an\ninsufficient coupling in low-mass red giants that have a radiative core during\nthe main sequence (MS), as was found previously for more massive stars that\ndevelop a convective core during the MS. We then derived a new calibrated\nversion of the original TS dynamo and find that the damping timescale adopted\nfor the azimuthal field in the original TS dynamo has to be increased by a\nfactor of about 200 to correctly reproduce the core rotation rates of stars on\nthe red giant branch (RGB). This calibrated version predicts no correlation of\nthe core rotation rates with the stellar mass for RGB stars in good agreement\nwith asteroseismic observations. Moreover, it correctly reproduces the core\nrotation rates of clump stars similarly to a revised prescription proposed\nrecently. Interestingly, this new calibrated version of the TS dynamo is found\nto be in slightly better agreement with the core rotation rates of sub-giant\nstars, while simultaneously better accounting for the evolution of the core\nrotation rates along the RGB compared to the revised dynamo version.

The\nbiaxial-nematic and cyclic phases exhibit discrete polytope symmetries\nfeaturing non-Abelian vortices and we investigate a pair of non-commuting line\ndefects within the context of a topological interface. By numerical\nsimulations, we characterize the emergence of non-trivial defect core\nstructures, including the formation of composite defects.

The\nfield of quantum biology is one area where these algorithms could prove to be\nuseful, as biological systems are generally intractable to treat in their\ncomplete form, but amenable to an open quantum systems approach. Here we\npresent the application of a recently developed singular value decomposition\nalgorithm to two well-studied benchmark systems in quantum biology: excitonic\nenergy transport through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex and the radical pair\nmechanism for avian navigation. We demonstrate that the singular value\ndecomposition algorithm is capable of capturing accurate short- and long-time\ndynamics for these systems through implementation on a quantum simulator, and\nconclude that this algorithm has the potential to be an effective tool for the\nfuture study of systems relevant to quantum biology.",

At inference time, for each prediction,\nCross Attention scans the full set of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ tokens. In practice,\nhowever, often only a small subset of tokens are required for good performance.\nMethods such as Perceiver IO are cheap at inference as they distill the\ninformation to a smaller-sized set of latent tokens $L < N$ on which cross\nattention is then applied, resulting in only $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ complexity.\nHowever, in practice, as the number of input tokens and the amount of\ninformation to distill increases, the number of latent tokens needed also\nincreases significantly. In this work, we propose Tree Cross Attention (TCA) -\na module based on Cross Attention that only retrieves information from a\nlogarithmic $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(N))$ number of tokens for performing inference.\nTCA organizes the data in a tree structure and performs a tree search at\ninference time to retrieve the relevant tokens for prediction. Leveraging TCA,\nwe introduce ReTreever, a flexible architecture for token-efficient inference.\nWe show empirically that Tree Cross Attention (TCA) performs comparable to\nCross Attention across various classification and uncertainty regression tasks\nwhile being significantly more token-efficient.

One approach commonly used in vision for\nalleviating this issue is a deep ensemble, which constructs an ensemble by\ntraining the same model multiple times using different random initializations.\nHowever, there is a huge challenge to ensembling LLMs: the most effective LLMs\nare very, very large. Keeping a single LLM in memory is already challenging\nenough: keeping an ensemble of e.g. 5 LLMs in memory is impossible in many\nsettings. To address these issues, we propose an ensemble approach using\nLow-Rank Adapters (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique.\nCritically, these low-rank adapters represent a very small number of\nparameters, orders of magnitude less than the underlying pre-trained model.\nThus, it is possible to construct large ensembles of LoRA adapters with almost\nthe same computational overhead as using the original model.

The non parametric\nMissing Value Imputation using Random Forest (miss-Forest) method performs well\nfor coupon rates but poorly for bond prices, and the Next value method shows\nmixed results. Ultimately, the Linear Regression (LR) method is recommended for\nimputing missing data due to its ability to approximate normality and\npredictive capabilities. However, filling missing values with previous values\nhas high accuracy, thus, it will be the best choice when we have less\ninformation to be able to increase accuracy for LR.

Despite the ubiquity of\ninteraction processes among animals and the advancements in tracking\ntechnologies enabling simultaneous monitoring of multiple individuals, a common\ntheoretical framework to analyse movement data is still lacking. The diverse\nmechanisms governing how organisms perceive the proximity of others have led to\nspecies-specific theoretical approaches, hindering a common currency with which\nto evaluate and compare findings across taxa. We propose a general framework,\nborrowing tools from statistical physics, specifically from the theory of\nreaction diffusion processes. While some of these tools have been employed to\npredict pathogen transmission events, they have not yet pervaded the movement\necology literature. Using both continuous and discrete variables, we\ndemonstrate the suitability of our framework to study interaction processes.\nDefining interactions as the transfer of information between individuals, we\nshow that the probability of information transfer for the first time is\nequivalent to the first-passage probability of reacting in a multi-target\nenvironment. As interaction events reduce to encounter events for perfectly\nefficient information transfer, we compare our formalism to a recent approach\nthat takes the joint occupation probability of two animals over a region of\ninteraction as a measure of the encounter probability, rather than the\nfirst-encounter probability. We show the discrepancy between the two approaches\nby comparing analytically their predictions with continuous variables, while\nwith discrete variables we quantify their difference over time. We conclude by\npointing to some of the open problems that reaction diffusion formalism might\nbe able to tackle.",

However, predicting the effects of doping on the\natomic-scale structure of a material is often difficult or limited to high-end\nexperimental techniques. Doping can induce phase separation in a material,\nundermining the material's stability. A further complication is that dopant\natoms can segregate to interfaces in a material such as grain boundaries (GBs),\nwith consequences for key macroscopic properties of the material such as its\nconductivity. Here, we describe a computational methodology based on semi-grand\ncanonical Monte Carlo which can be used to probe these phenomena at the atomic\nscale for metal oxide solid solutions. The methodology can provide precise\npredictions of the thermodynamic conditions at which phase separation occurs.\nIt can also provide the segregation patterns exhibited by GBs at given\nconditions. We apply the methodology to one of the most important catalytic\nmaterials, ceria-zirconia. Our calculations reveal an interesting richness in\nthe GB segregation in this system. Most GBs we examined exhibited continuous\nincreases in Zr segregation upon Zr doping, with a concomitant reduction in the\nformation enthalpies of the GBs. However, a few GBs exhibited no segregation at\nlow temperatures. We also observed evidence of first-order complexion\ntransitions in some GBs.",

            "summary": "Recent quantum gas experiments are ushering in an era of fine-tailored\ntwo-body interactions. These include for example atoms with long-range\ndipole-dipole interactions and Rydberg-dressed atoms created by optical\ncoupling to highly excited electronic states. These systems differ from the\n``canonical system\" of cold atoms with contact interactions characterized by a\nsingle parameter, the scattering length. Inspired by these experiments with\ncontrollable atomic interactions, here we consider a model many-body system of\nspinless Fermi gas in two dimensions, where the bare two-body interaction takes\nthe form of a soft-core disk potential. We show that the repulsive interaction\ncan drive the system to a series of nontrivial superfluid states with higher\npartial wave paring, for example in the $f$- and $h$-wave channels instead of\nthe $p$-wave channel. The zero temperature phase diagram is obtained by\nnumerical functional renormalization group (FRG), which goes beyond leading\norder perturbation theory and retains the interaction vertices in all channels.\nWe also carry out a perturbative analysis which is justified in the dilute\nlimit and show that the second order Kohn-Luttinger diagrams provide a\nqualitative understanding of the onsets of the various superfluid phases. The\nperturbative arguments however fail to capture the quantitative phase\nboundaries predicted by FRG. Our findings illustrate that the shape of the bare\natomic interaction matters in producing the pairing glue in repulsive Fermi\ngases, and tuning the interaction potential offers a promising route to realize\nexotic many-body phases in cold atomic gases.",

In particular, DIRK admits a simple analytical solution that can\nbe evaluated with $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ operations, instead of standard matrix\ninversion, which is $\\mathcal{O}(N)^3$. Therefore the analytical solution\nsignificantly reduces the computational cost of the multifluid method, making\nit suitable for studying the dynamics of systems with particle-size\ndistributions. We demonstrate that the method conserves momentum to machine\nprecision and converges to the correct equilibrium solution with constant\nexternal acceleration. To validate our numerical method we present a series of\nsimple hydrodynamic tests, including damping of sound waves, dusty shocks, a\nmulti-fluid dusty Jeans instability, and a steady-state gas-dust drift\ncalculation.

The transient\ndiffusivity equation is a fundamental equation in reservoir engineering and the\ngeneral solution to this equation forms the basis for Pressure Transient\nAnalysis (PTA). The diffusivity equation is derived by combining three physical\nprinciples, the continuity equation, Darcy's equation, and the equation of\nstate for a slightly compressible liquid. Obtaining general solutions to this\nequation is imperative to understand flow regimes in porous media. Analytical\nsolutions of the transient diffusivity equation are usually hard to obtain due\nto the stiff nature of the equation caused by the steep gradients of the\npressure near the well. In this work we apply physics-informed neural networks\nto the one and two dimensional diffusivity equation and demonstrate that\ndecomposing the space domain into very few subdomains can overcome the\nstiffness problem of the equation.

In order to retain customers and prevent revenue loss, it is important\nto provide high reliability guarantees for these services. One way to do this\nis by predicting outages in advance, which can help in reducing the severity as\nwell as time to recovery. It is difficult to forecast critical failures due to\nthe rarity of these events. Moreover, critical failures are ill-defined in\nterms of observable data. Our proposed method, Outage-Watch, defines critical\nservice outages as deteriorations in the Quality of Service (QoS) captured by a\nset of metrics. Outage-Watch detects such outages in advance by using current\nsystem state to predict whether the QoS metrics will cross a threshold and\ninitiate an extreme event. A mixture of Gaussian is used to model the\ndistribution of the QoS metrics for flexibility and an extreme event\nregularizer helps in improving learning in tail of the distribution. An outage\nis predicted if the probability of any one of the QoS metrics crossing\nthreshold changes significantly. Our evaluation on a real-world SaaS company\ndataset shows that Outage-Watch significantly outperforms traditional methods\nwith an average AUC of 0.98. Additionally, Outage-Watch detects all the outages\nexhibiting a change in service metrics and reduces the Mean Time To Detection\n(MTTD) of outages by up to 88% when deployed in an enterprise cloud-service\nsystem, demonstrating efficacy of our proposed method.",

            "summary": "The inherently diverse and uncertain nature of trajectories presents a\nformidable challenge in accurately modeling them. Motion prediction systems\nmust effectively learn spatial and temporal information from the past to\nforecast the future trajectories of the agent. Many existing methods learn\ntemporal motion via separate components within stacked models to capture\ntemporal features. Furthermore, prediction methods often operate under the\nassumption that observed trajectory waypoint sequences are complete,\ndisregarding scenarios where missing values may occur, which can influence\ntheir performance. Moreover, these models may be biased toward particular\nwaypoint sequences when making predictions. We propose a novel approach called\nTemporal Waypoint Dropping (TWD) that explicitly incorporates temporal\ndependencies during the training of a trajectory prediction model. By\nstochastically dropping waypoints from past observed trajectories, the model is\nforced to learn the underlying temporal representation from the remaining\nwaypoints, resulting in an improved model. Incorporating stochastic temporal\nwaypoint dropping into the model learning process significantly enhances its\nperformance in scenarios with missing values. Experimental results demonstrate\nour approach's substantial improvement in trajectory prediction capabilities.\nOur approach can complement existing trajectory prediction methods to improve\ntheir prediction accuracy. We evaluate our proposed approach on three datasets:\nNBA Sports VU, ETH-UCY, and TrajNet++.",

This way, the\nproposed architecture implicitly learns a causal graph representation of sensor\nmeasurements which can be conditioned on unseen timestamps and metadata to\npredict new measurements by an expansion of the learnt graph. The proposed AGG\nis compared both conceptually and empirically to previous work, and the impact\nof data augmentation on the performance of AGG is also briefly discussed.

However, backtesting such\nstrategies poses a challenge because LLMs are trained on many years of data,\nand backtesting produces biased results if the training and backtesting periods\noverlap. This bias can take two forms: a look-ahead bias, in which the LLM may\nhave specific knowledge of the stock returns that followed a news article, and\na distraction effect, in which general knowledge of the companies named\ninterferes with the measurement of a text's sentiment. We investigate these\nsources of bias through trading strategies driven by the sentiment of financial\nnews headlines. We compare trading performance based on the original headlines\nwith de-biased strategies in which we remove the relevant company's identifiers\nfrom the text. In-sample (within the LLM training window), we find,\nsurprisingly, that the anonymized headlines outperform, indicating that the\ndistraction effect has a greater impact than look-ahead bias. This tendency is\nparticularly strong for larger companies--companies about which we expect an\nLLM to have greater general knowledge. Out-of-sample, look-ahead bias is not a\nconcern but distraction remains possible. Our proposed anonymization procedure\nis therefore potentially useful in out-of-sample implementation, as well as for\nde-biased backtesting.",

            "summary": "The internal structure of all lowest-lying pseudo-scalar mesons with\nheavy-light quark content is studied in detail using an algebraic model that\nhas been applied recently, and successfully, to the same physical observables\nof pseudo-scalar and vector mesons with hidden-flavor quark content, from light\nto heavy quark sectors. The algebraic model consists on constructing simple and\nevidence-based \\emph{ans\\\"atze} of the meson's Bethe-Salpeter amplitude (BSA)\nand quark's propagator in such a way that the Bethe-Salpeter wave function\n(BSWF) can then be readily computed algebraically. Its subsequent projection\nonto the light front yields the light front wave function (LFWF) whose form\nallows us a simple access to the valence-quark Parton Distribution Amplitude\n(PDA) by integrating over the transverse momentum squared. We exploit our\ncurrent knowledge of the PDAs of lowest-lying pseudo-scalar heavy-light mesons\nto compute their Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) through the overlap\nrepresentation of LFWFs. From these three dimensional knowledge, different\nlimits/projections lead us to deduce the related Parton Distribution functions\n(PDFs), Electromagnetic Form Factors (EFFs), and Impact parameter space GPDs\n(IPS-GPDs). When possible, we make explicit comparisons with available\nexperimental results and earlier theoretical predictions.",

Validating the performance of scalable BFT\nprotocol implementations requires careful evaluation. Our solution uses network\nsimulations to forecast the performance of BFT protocols while experimentally\nscaling the environment. Our method seamlessly plug-and-plays existing BFT\nimplementations into the simulation without requiring code modification or\nre-implementation, which is often time-consuming and error-prone. Furthermore,\nour approach is also significantly cheaper than experiments with real\nlarge-scale cloud deployments. In this paper, we first explain our simulation\narchitecture, which enables scalable performance evaluations of BFT systems\nthrough high performance network simulations. We validate the accuracy of these\nsimulations for predicting the performance of BFT systems by comparing\nsimulation results with measurements of real systems deployed on cloud\ninfrastructures. We found that simulation results display a reasonable\napproximation at a larger system scale, because the network eventually becomes\nthe dominating factor limiting system performance. In the second part of our\npaper, we use our simulation method to evaluate the performance of PBFT and BFT\nprotocols from the blockchain generation, such as HotStuff and Kauri, in\nlarge-scale and realistic wide-area network scenarios, as well as under induced\nfaults.",

The use of predictive probability (PP) to stop testing\nearly and make faster decisions is particularly appealing given the\naforementioned constraints. Given the high-consequence nature of the tests\nperformed in the national security space, a strong understanding of new methods\nis required before being deployed. Although PP has been thoroughly studied for\nbinary data, there is less work with continuous data, which often in\nreliability studies interested in certifying the specification limits of\ncomponents. A simulation study evaluating the robustness of this approach\nindicate early stopping based on PP is reasonably robust to minor assumption\nviolations, especially when only a few interim analyses are conducted.

Ensemble-based methods, like weight space ensembles that\ninterpolate model parameters, have been shown to achieve superior OOD\nperformance. However, the underlying mechanism for their effectiveness remains\nunclear. In this study, we closely examine WiSE-FT, a popular weight space\nensemble method that interpolates between a pre-trained and a fine-tuned model.\nWe observe an unexpected phenomenon, in which WiSE-FT successfully corrects\nmany cases where each individual model makes incorrect predictions, which\ncontributes significantly to its OOD effectiveness. To gain further insights,\nwe conduct theoretical analysis in a multi-class setting with a large number of\nspurious features. Our analysis predicts the above phenomenon and it further\nshows that ensemble-based models reduce prediction errors in the OOD settings\nby utilizing a more diverse set of spurious features. Contrary to the\nconventional wisdom that focuses on learning invariant features for better OOD\nperformance, our findings suggest that incorporating a large number of diverse\nspurious features weakens their individual contributions, leading to improved\noverall OOD generalization performance. Empirically we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of utilizing diverse spurious features on a MultiColorMNIST\ndataset, and our experimental results are consistent with the theoretical\nanalysis. Building upon the new theoretical insights into the efficacy of\nensemble methods, we further identify an issue of WiSE-FT caused by the\noverconfidence of fine-tuned models in OOD situations. This overconfidence\nmagnifies the fine-tuned model's incorrect prediction, leading to deteriorated\nOOD ensemble performance. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel method\ncalled BAlaNced averaGing (BANG), which significantly enhances the OOD\nperformance of WiSE-FT.",

We evaluate the generalizability\nof out-of-domain ImageNet representations for a target domain of\nhistopathological images, and study the impact of in-domain adaptation using\nself-supervised and multi-task learning approaches for pretraining the models\nusing the medium-to-large scale datasets of histopathological images. A\nsemi-supervised learning approach is furthermore proposed, where the fine-tuned\nmodels are utilized to predict the labels of unannotated regions of the whole\nslide images (WSI). The models are subsequently retrained using the\nground-truth labels and weak labels determined in the previous step, providing\nsuperior performance in comparison to standard in-domain transfer learning with\nbalanced accuracy of 96.91% and F1-score 97.07%, and minimizing the\npathologist's efforts for annotation. Finally, we provide a visualization tool\nworking at WSI level which generates heatmaps that highlight tumor areas; thus,\nproviding insights to pathologists concerning the most informative parts of the\nWSI.",

They can be synthesized\nbottom-up in solution to obtain precise ribbon geometries. Here we investigate\nthe optical properties of solution-synthesized 9-armchair graphene nanoribbons\n(9-aGNRs) that are stabilized as dispersions in organic solvents and further\nfractioned by liquid cascade centrifugation (LCC). Absorption and\nphotoluminescence spectroscopy reveal two near-infrared absorption and emission\npeaks whose ratios depend on the LCC fraction. Low-temperature\nsingle-nanoribbon photoluminescence spectra suggest the presence of two\ndifferent nanoribbon species. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and\ntime-dependent DFT calculations, the lowest energy transition can be assigned\nto pristine 9-aGNRs, while 9-aGNRs with edge-defects, caused by incomplete\ngraphitization, result in more blue-shifted transitions and higher Raman\nD/G-mode ratios. Hole doping of 9-aGNR dispersions with the electron acceptor\nF4TCNQ leads to concentration dependent bleaching and quenching of the main\nabsorption and emission bands and the appearance of redshifted, charge-induced\nabsorption features but no additional emission peaks, thus indicating the\nformation of polarons instead of the predicted trions (charged excitons) in\ndoped 9-aGNRs.",

We find that the form factor expansion of\nthe entanglement entropy along the flow organises in two different kind of\nterms. Those that couple particles with the same chirality, and reproduce the\nentropy of the infrared Ising theory, and those that couple particles with\ndifferent chirality, which provide the ultraviolet contributions. The massless\nflow under study possesses a global $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin-flip symmetry.

This\npaper proposes an efficient nonlinear modeling approach for multiple time\nseries, with a complexity comparable to linear vector autoregressive (VAR)\nmodels while still incorporating nonlinear interactions among different\ntime-series variables. The modeling assumption is that the set of time series\nis generated in two steps: first, a linear VAR process in a latent space, and\nsecond, a set of invertible and Lipschitz continuous nonlinear mappings that\nare applied per sensor, that is, a component-wise mapping from each latent\nvariable to a variable in the measurement space. The VAR coefficient\nidentification provides a topology representation of the dependencies among the\naforementioned variables. The proposed approach models each component-wise\nnonlinearity using an invertible neural network and imposes sparsity on the VAR\ncoefficients to reflect the parsimonious dependencies usually found in real\napplications. To efficiently solve the formulated optimization problems, a\ncustom algorithm is devised combining proximal gradient descent, stochastic\nprimal-dual updates, and projection to enforce the corresponding constraints.\nExperimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show that the\nproposed algorithm improves the identification of the support of the VAR\ncoefficients in a parsimonious manner while also improving the time-series\nprediction, as compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.",

In the context of landmark detection,\nparticularly in cephalometrics, it has been observed that existing methods\noften lack standardized pipelines and well-designed bias reduction processes,\nwhich significantly impact their performance. In this paper, we revisit a\nrelated task, human pose estimation (HPE), which shares numerous similarities\nwith cephalometric landmark detection (CLD), and emphasize the potential for\ntransferring techniques from the former field to benefit the latter. Motivated\nby this insight, we have developed a robust and adaptable benchmark based on\nthe well-established HPE codebase known as MMPose. This benchmark can serve as\na dependable baseline for achieving exceptional CLD performance. Furthermore,\nwe introduce an upscaling design within the framework to further enhance\nperformance. This enhancement involves the incorporation of a lightweight and\nefficient super-resolution module, which generates heatmap predictions on\nhigh-resolution features and leads to further performance refinement,\nbenefiting from its ability to reduce quantization bias.

These systems\nproduce high-dimensional data that reflect the complex interactions among the\nnetwork nodes with rich sensor measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel\nalgorithm for latent dynamic networked system identification that leverages the\nnetwork structure and performs dimension reduction for each node via dynamic\nlatent variables (DLVs). The algorithm assumes that the DLVs of each node have\nan auto-regressive model with exogenous input and interactions from other\nnodes. The DLVs of each node are extracted to capture the most predictable\nlatent variables in the high dimensional data, while the residual factors are\nnot predictable. The advantage of the proposed framework is demonstrated on an\nindustrial process network for system identification and dynamic data\nanalytics.",

            "summary": "Accurate prediction of mixing transition induced by interfacial instabilities\nis vital for engineering applications, but has remained a great challenge for\ndecades. For engineering practices, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation\n(RANS) is the most viable method. However, existing RANS models for mixing\nproblems are mostly designed for fully developed turbulence, failing to depict\nthe locally spatio-temporal-dependent characteristic of transition. In the\npresent study, the idea of the intermittent factor (denoted as $\\gamma$), which\nhas been widely used in boundary layer transition in aerospace engineering, is\nextended to the mixing problems. Specifically, a transport equation for\n$\\gamma$ is built based on local flow variables, which is used to describe the\nlocally spatio-temporal-dependent characteristic of transition. Furthermore,\n$\\gamma$ is coupled into the widely used K-L turbulent mixing model to\nconstrain the two key product sources terms that dominate the evolution of\nmixing, i.e. the Reynolds stress and the buoyancy effect. Subsequently, the\nsimulations of two reshocked Richtmyer-Meshkov mixing cases with remarkable\ntransition effects confirm that the proposed model has a good performance for\npredicting mixing transition. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first\nstudy that an extra transport equation for intermittent factor has been\nproposed for a RANS mixing transition model. More importantly, the present\nmodeling framework is flexible and has the potential to be applied to other\nRANS models. It provides a promising strategy for more advanced modeling for\nmixing transition.",

The PAU model induces accurate uncertainty and reliable predictions\nfor cross-modal retrieval.

We analyze the problem of 3D mesh segmentation\nfor pathological vessel structures (aneurysms) and conventional anatomical\nstructures (endocardium and epicardium of ventricles). Local geometrical\nfeatures are encoded as sampling from the signed distance function, and the\nneural network performs prediction for each mesh node. We show that weight\nsymmetry gains from 1 to 3% of additional accuracy and allows decreasing the\nnumber of trainable parameters up to 8 times without suffering the performance\nloss if neural networks have at least three convolutional layers. This also\nworks for very small training sets.",

We\ncompare the outcomes of leading simulation suites with observations and with\neach other, to identify the enduring successes they have cultivated and the\noutstanding challenges to be tackled with the next generation of models. Our\nkey conclusions are: 1) Realistic galaxies can be reproduced by calibrating the\nill-constrained parameters of subgrid feedback models. Feedback is dominated by\nstars and by black holes in low mass and high mass galaxies, respectively; 2)\nAdjusting or disabling the physical processes implemented in simulations can\nelucidate their impact on observables, but outcomes can be degenerate; 3)\nSimilar galaxy populations can emerge in simulations with dissimilar subgrid\nfeedback implementations. However, these models generally predict markedly\ndifferent gas flow rates into, and out of, galaxies and their haloes.

            "summary": "Diffusion models achieve great success in generating diverse and\nhigh-fidelity images. The performance improvements come with low generation\nspeed per image, which hinders the application diffusion models in real-time\nscenarios. While some certain predictions benefit from the full computation of\nthe model in each sample iteration, not every iteration requires the same\namount of computation, potentially leading to computation waste. In this work,\nwe propose DeeDiff, an early exiting framework that adaptively allocates\ncomputation resources in each sampling step to improve the generation\nefficiency of diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a timestep-aware\nuncertainty estimation module (UEM) for diffusion models which is attached to\neach intermediate layer to estimate the prediction uncertainty of each layer.\nThe uncertainty is regarded as the signal to decide if the inference\nterminates. Moreover, we propose uncertainty-aware layer-wise loss to fill the\nperformance gap between full models and early-exited models. With such loss\nstrategy, our model is able to obtain comparable results as full-layer models.\nExtensive experiments of class-conditional, unconditional, and text-guided\ngeneration on several datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and efficiency trade-off compared with existing early exiting\nmethods on diffusion models.

Monocular depth estimation, whether with\nsingle-frame or multi-frame inputs, has achieved significant success by\nlearning various types of cues and specializing in either static or dynamic\nscenes. Recently, these cues fusion becomes an attractive topic, aiming to\nenable the combined cues to perform well in both types of scenes. However,\nadaptive cue fusion relies on attention mechanisms, where the quadratic\ncomplexity limits the granularity of cue representation. Additionally, explicit\ncue fusion depends on precise segmentation, which imposes a heavy burden on\nmask prediction. To address these issues, we propose the GSDC Transformer, an\nefficient and effective component for cue fusion in monocular multi-frame depth\nestimation. We utilize deformable attention to learn cue relationships at a\nfine scale, while sparse attention reduces computational requirements when\ngranularity increases. To compensate for the precision drop in dynamic scenes,\nwe represent scene attributes in the form of super tokens without relying on\nprecise shapes. Within each super token attributed to dynamic scenes, we gather\nits relevant cues and learn local dense relationships to enhance cue fusion.\nOur method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset with\nefficient fusion speed.",

Leveraging Large Language Models, XAIstories\nprovide narratives that shed light on AI predictions: SHAPstories do so based\non SHAP explanations to explain a prediction score, while CFstories do so for\nCF explanations to explain a decision. Our results are striking: over 90% of\nthe surveyed general audience finds the narrative generated by SHAPstories\nconvincing. Data scientists primarily see the value of SHAPstories in\ncommunicating explanations to a general audience, with 92% of data scientists\nindicating that it will contribute to the ease and confidence of nonspecialists\nin understanding AI predictions. Additionally, 83% of data scientists indicate\nthey are likely to use SHAPstories for this purpose. In image classification,\nCFstories are considered more or equally convincing as users own crafted\nstories by over 75% of lay user participants. CFstories also bring a tenfold\nspeed gain in creating a narrative, and improves accuracy by over 20% compared\nto manually created narratives.

Towards automated testing of a key software\nsubsystem of CaReSS, i.e., GURI, we present a real-world application of an\nextension to the open-source tool EvoMaster, which automatically generates test\ncases with evolutionary algorithms. We named the extension EvoClass, which\nenhances EvoMaster with a machine learning classifier to reduce the overall\ntesting cost. This is imperative since testing with EvoMaster involves sending\nmany requests to GURI deployed in different environments, including the\nproduction environment, whose performance and functionality could potentially\nbe affected by many requests. The machine learning classifier of EvoClass can\npredict whether a request generated by EvoMaster will be executed successfully\nor not; if not, the classifier filters out such requests, consequently reducing\nthe number of requests to be executed on GURI. We evaluated EvoClass on ten\nGURI versions over four years in three environments: development, testing, and\nproduction. Results showed that EvoClass can significantly reduce the testing\ncost of evolving GURI without reducing testing effectiveness (measured as rule\ncoverage) across all three environments, as compared to the default EvoMaster.\nOverall, EvoClass achieved ~31% of overall cost reduction.

The\nindicators selected are related to the shape of the empirical distribution of\nthe new cases observed over 14 days. This duration has been chosen to smooth\nout the effect of weekends when fewer new cases are registered. For finding a\nforecasting variable, we have used the PCA (principal component analysis),\nwhose first principal component (a linear combination of the selected\nindicators) explains a large part of the observed variance and can then be used\nas a predictor of the phenomenon studied (here the occurrence of an epidemic\nwave).\n  Results: A score has been built from the four proposed indicators using a\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA), which allows an acceptable level of\nforecasting performance by giving a realistic retro-predicted date for the\nrupture of the stationary endemic model corresponding to the entrance in the\nepidemic exponential growth phase. This score is applied to the\nretro-prediction of the limits of the different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak\nin successive endemic/epidemic transitions and three countries, France, India,\nand Japan.\n  Conclusion: We provided a new forecasting method for predicting an epidemic\nwave occurring after an endemic phase for a contagious disease.",

This work is part of a broader research effort to develop\nintelligent agents that can interactively guide humans through performing tasks\nin the physical world. As a first step in this direction, we introduce\nHoloAssist, a large-scale egocentric human interaction dataset, where two\npeople collaboratively complete physical manipulation tasks. The task performer\nexecutes the task while wearing a mixed-reality headset that captures seven\nsynchronized data streams. The task instructor watches the performer's\negocentric video in real time and guides them verbally. By augmenting the data\nwith action and conversational annotations and observing the rich behaviors of\nvarious participants, we present key insights into how human assistants correct\nmistakes, intervene in the task completion procedure, and ground their\ninstructions to the environment. HoloAssist spans 166 hours of data captured by\n350 unique instructor-performer pairs. Furthermore, we construct and present\nbenchmarks on mistake detection, intervention type prediction, and hand\nforecasting, along with detailed analysis. We expect HoloAssist will provide an\nimportant resource for building AI assistants that can fluidly collaborate with\nhumans in the real world.

In regions where the H$_2$ to H number density\nratio is low, dissociative recombination (DR) is the dominant destruction\nprocess for OH$^+$ and the DR rate coefficient is important for predicting the\nOH$^+$ abundance and inferring the cosmic ray ionization rate. We have\nexperimentally studied DR of electronically and vibrationally relaxed OH$^+$ in\nits lowest rotational levels, using an electron--ion merged-beams setup at the\nCryogenic Storage Ring. From these measurements, we have derived a kinetic\ntemperature rate coefficient applicable to diffuse cloud chemical models, i.e.,\nfor OH$^+$ in its electronic, vibrational, and rotational ground level. At\ntypical diffuse cloud temperatures, our kinetic temperature rate coefficient is\na factor of $\\sim 5$ times larger than the previous experimentally derived\nvalue and a factor of $\\sim 33$ times larger than the value calculated by\ntheory. Our combined experimental and modelling results point to a significant\nincrease for the cosmic ray ionization rate inferred from observations of\nOH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$, corresponding to a geometric mean of $(6.6 \\pm 1.0)\n\\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is more than a factor of two larger\nthan the previously inferred values of the cosmic ray ionization rate in\ndiffuse atomic clouds. Combined with observations of diffuse and dense\nmolecular clouds, these findings indicate a greater degree of cosmic ray\nshielding in interstellar clouds than has been previously inferred.",

As a companion to a\nprevious work, we present analytic formulae for the blue isocurvature spectrum\nfor the case of the kinetic energy density of the PQ symmetry breaking field\nbeing larger than the quartic power of the final spontaneous PQ symmetry\nbreaking scale. It corresponds to a regime in which the nonlinearities of the\nclassical potential become important many times during the formation of the\naxion isocurvature quantum perturbations leading to interesting resonant\nbehavior. One consequence of this nonlinearity-driven resonance is the chaotic\nnature of the map that links the underlying Lagrangian parameters to the\nisocurvature amplitudes. We point out an accidental duality symmetry between\nthe perturbation equations and the background field equations that can be used\nto understand this. Finally, we present two types of analytic results. The\nfirst relies on a computation utilizing an effective potential wherein fast\ntime scale fluctuations have been integrated out.

Prompt detection and\naccurate prediction of bearing failures can help reduce the likelihood of\nunexpected machine downtime and enhance maintenance schedules, averting lost\nproductivity. Recent technological advances have enabled monitoring the health\nof these assets at scale using a variety of sensors, and predicting the\nfailures using modern Machine Learning (ML) approaches including deep learning\narchitectures. Vibration data has been collected using accelerated\nrun-to-failure of overloaded bearings, or by introducing known failure in\nbearings, under a variety of operating conditions such as rotating speed, load\non the bearing, type of bearing fault, and data acquisition frequency. However,\nin the development of bearing failure classification models using vibration\ndata there is a lack of consensus in the metrics used to evaluate the models,\ndata partitions used to evaluate models, and methods used to generate failure\nlabels in run-to-failure experiments. An understanding of the impact of these\nchoices is important to reliably develop models, and deploy them in practical\nsettings. In this work, we demonstrate the significance of these choices on the\nperformance of the models using publicly-available vibration datasets, and\nsuggest model development considerations for real world scenarios. Our\nexperimental findings demonstrate that assigning vibration data from a given\nbearing across training and evaluation splits leads to over-optimistic\nperformance estimates, PCA-based approach is able to robustly generate labels\nfor failure classification in run-to-failure experiments, and $F$ scores are\nmore insightful to evaluate the models with unbalanced real-world failure data.",

In this work, to\nexplore the properties of dark energy we adopt the modified $f(Q)$ gravity\ntheory, where the non-metricity scalar $Q$, emerging from Weyl geometry, plays\nthe dynamical role. For the function $f(Q)$ we adopt the functional form\n$f(Q)=Q+ 6\\gamma\\,H_0^2(Q/Q_0)^n$, where $n,\\, \\gamma,\\, H_0$ and $Q_0$ are\nconstants. Then, we test our constructed model against the various\nobservational datasets, such as the Hubble, and the Pantheon+SHOES samples, and\ntheir combined sample, through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) statistical\nanalysis. We also employ the parameter estimation technique to constrain the\nfree parameters of the model. In addition, we use the constrained values of the\nmodel parameters to explore a few implications of the cosmological model. A\ndetailed comparison of the predictions of our model with the $\\Lambda$CDM model\nis also performed. In particular, we discuss in detail some cosmographic\nparameters, like the deceleration, the jerk, and the snap parameters, as well\nas the behavior of the dark energy and matter energy densities to see the\nevolution of various energy/matter profiles. The $Om$ diagnostics is also\npresented to test the dark energy nature of our model, as compared to the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our findings show that the considered version\nof the non-metric $f(Q)$ type modified gravity theory, despite some differences\nwith respect to the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm, can still explain the current\nobservational results on the cosmological parameters, and provide a convincing\nand consistent account for the accelerating expansion of the Universe.",

To overcome this problem, we propose\nMulti-Resolution Active learning of FNO (MRA-FNO), which can dynamically select\nthe input functions and resolutions to lower the data cost as much as possible\nwhile optimizing the learning efficiency. Specifically, we propose a\nprobabilistic multi-resolution FNO and use ensemble Monte-Carlo to develop an\neffective posterior inference algorithm. To conduct active learning, we\nmaximize a utility-cost ratio as the acquisition function to acquire new\nexamples and resolutions at each step. We use moment matching and the matrix\ndeterminant lemma to enable tractable, efficient utility computation.\nFurthermore, we develop a cost annealing framework to avoid over-penalizing\nhigh-resolution queries at the early stage. The over-penalization is severe\nwhen the cost difference is significant between the resolutions, which renders\nactive learning often stuck at low-resolution queries and inferior performance.\nOur method overcomes this problem and applies to general multi-fidelity active\nlearning and optimization problems. We have shown the advantage of our method\nin several benchmark operator learning tasks.",

This unexpected superiority of machine learning models\nchallenges conventional assumptions and highlights their potential for\npractical applications in water quality prediction. Our research aims to\nestablish a robust predictive pipeline accessible to both data science experts\nand those without domain specific knowledge.

However, acquiring thorough\npower system models can be impractical in real operation due to inaccessible\nsystem parameters and privacy of consumers, which necessitate data-driven\ndynamic equivalencing of unknown subsystems. Learning reliable dynamic\nequivalent models for the external systems from SCADA and PMU data, however, is\na long-standing intractable problem in power system analysis due to complicated\nnonlinearity and unforeseeable dynamic modes of power systems. This paper\nadvances a practical application of neural dynamic equivalence (NeuDyE) called\nDriving Port NeuDyE (DP-NeuDyE), which exploits physics-informed machine\nlearning and neural-ordinary-differential-equations (ODE-NET) to discover a\ndynamic equivalence of external power grids while preserving its dynamic\nbehaviors after disturbances. The new contributions are threefold: A NeuDyE\nformulation to enable a continuous-time, data-driven dynamic equivalence of\npower systems, saving the effort and expense of acquiring inaccessible system;\nAn introduction of a Physics-Informed NeuDyE learning (PI-NeuDyE) to actively\ncontrol the closed-loop accuracy of NeuDyE; and A DP-NeuDyE to reduce the\nnumber of inputs required for the training. We conduct extensive case studies\non the NPCC system to validate the generalizability and accuracy of both\nPI-NeuDyE and DP-NeuDyE, which span a multitude of scenarios, differing in the\ntime required for fault clearance, the specific fault locations, and the\nlimitations of data.

This paper is devoted to bridging the gap by\nincreasing the temporal resolution for images, i.e., motion deblurring, and the\nspatial resolution for events, i.e., event super-resolving, respectively. To\nthis end, we introduce CrossZoom, a novel unified neural Network (CZ-Net) to\njointly recover sharp latent sequences within the exposure period of a blurry\ninput and the corresponding High-Resolution (HR) events. Specifically, we\npresent a multi-scale blur-event fusion architecture that leverages the\nscale-variant properties and effectively fuses cross-modality information to\nachieve cross-enhancement. Attention-based adaptive enhancement and\ncross-interaction prediction modules are devised to alleviate the distortions\ninherent in Low-Resolution (LR) events and enhance the final results through\nthe prior blur-event complementary information. Furthermore, we propose a new\ndataset containing HR sharp-blurry images and the corresponding HR-LR event\nstreams to facilitate future research.

            "summary": "Classical approaches to grasp planning are deterministic, requiring perfect\nknowledge of an object's pose and geometry. In response, data-driven approaches\nhave emerged that plan grasps entirely from sensory data. While these\ndata-driven methods have excelled in generating parallel-jaw and power grasps,\ntheir application to precision grasps (those using the fingertips of a\ndexterous hand, e.g, for tool use) remains limited. Precision grasping poses a\nunique challenge due to its sensitivity to object geometry, which allows small\nuncertainties in the object's shape and pose to cause an otherwise robust grasp\nto fail. In response to these challenges, we introduce Probabilistic Object\nNormals for Grasping (PONG), a novel, analytic approach for calculating a\nconservative estimate of force closure probability in the case when contact\nlocations are known but surface normals are uncertain. We then present a\npractical application where we use PONG as a grasp metric for generating robust\ngrasps both in simulation and real-world hardware experiments. Our results\ndemonstrate that maximizing PONG efficiently produces robust grasps, even for\nchallenging object geometries, and that it can serve as a well-calibrated,\nuncertainty-aware metric of grasp quality.",

            "summary": "Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the opacity of neural architectures\nby constructing and explaining their predictions using a set of high-level\nconcepts. A special property of these models is that they permit concept\ninterventions, wherein users can correct mispredicted concepts and thus improve\nthe model's performance. Recent work, however, has shown that intervention\nefficacy can be highly dependent on the order in which concepts are intervened\non and on the model's architecture and training hyperparameters. We argue that\nthis is rooted in a CBM's lack of train-time incentives for the model to be\nappropriately receptive to concept interventions. To address this, we propose\nIntervention-aware Concept Embedding models (IntCEMs), a novel CBM-based\narchitecture and training paradigm that improves a model's receptiveness to\ntest-time interventions. Our model learns a concept intervention policy in an\nend-to-end fashion from where it can sample meaningful intervention\ntrajectories at train-time. This conditions IntCEMs to effectively select and\nreceive concept interventions when deployed at test-time. Our experiments show\nthat IntCEMs significantly outperform state-of-the-art concept-interpretable\nmodels when provided with test-time concept interventions, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our approach.",

Notably, we allow the unlabeled samples to deviate\nslightly (in total variation sense) from the in-domain distribution. The core\nidea behind our framework is to combine Distributionally Robust Optimization\n(DRO) with self-supervised training. As a result, we also leverage efficient\npolynomial-time algorithms for the training stage. From a theoretical\nstandpoint, we apply our framework on the classification problem of a mixture\nof two Gaussians in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where in addition to the $m$ independent\nand labeled samples from the true distribution, a set of $n$ (usually with\n$n\\gg m$) out of domain and unlabeled samples are gievn as well. Using only the\nlabeled data, it is known that the generalization error can be bounded by\n$\\propto\\left(d/m\\right)^{1/2}$. However, using our method on both isotropic\nand non-isotropic Gaussian mixture models, one can derive a new set of\nanalytically explicit and non-asymptotic bounds which show substantial\nimprovement on the generalization error compared ERM. Our results underscore\ntwo significant insights: 1) out-of-domain samples, even when unlabeled, can be\nharnessed to narrow the generalization gap, provided that the true data\ndistribution adheres to a form of the \"cluster assumption\", and 2) the\nsemi-supervised learning paradigm can be regarded as a special case of our\nframework when there are no distributional shifts.

We perform\nempirical and theoretical studies on this relationship by utilizing mode\nconnectivity, which measures performance change (i.e., connectivity) along\nparametric paths between different modes. Empirically, reducing data\nheterogeneity makes the connectivity on different paths more similar, forming\nmore low-error overlaps between client and global modes. We also find that a\nbarrier to connectivity occurs when linearly connecting two global modes, while\nit disappears with considering non-linear mode connectivity. Theoretically, we\nestablish a quantitative bound on the global-mode connectivity using mean-field\ntheory or dropout stability. The bound demonstrates that the connectivity\nimproves when reducing data heterogeneity and widening trained models.\nNumerical results further corroborate our analytical findings.",

            "summary": "Semantic segmentation, which aims to classify every pixel in an image, is a\nkey task in machine perception, with many applications across robotics and\nautonomous driving. Due to the high dimensionality of this task, most existing\napproaches use local operations, such as convolutions, to generate per-pixel\nfeatures. However, these methods are typically unable to effectively leverage\nglobal context information due to the high computational costs of operating on\na dense image. In this work, we propose a solution to this issue by leveraging\nthe idea of superpixels, an over-segmentation of the image, and applying them\nwith a modern transformer framework. In particular, our model learns to\ndecompose the pixel space into a spatially low dimensional superpixel space via\na series of local cross-attentions. We then apply multi-head self-attention to\nthe superpixels to enrich the superpixel features with global context and then\ndirectly produce a class prediction for each superpixel. Finally, we directly\nproject the superpixel class predictions back into the pixel space using the\nassociations between the superpixels and the image pixel features. Reasoning in\nthe superpixel space allows our method to be substantially more computationally\nefficient compared to convolution-based decoder methods. Yet, our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation due to the rich\nsuperpixel features generated by the global self-attention mechanism.

Randomized smoothing provides a promising framework by relying on noise\ninjection in inputs to obtain a smoothed and more robust classifier. In this\npaper, we first show that the variance introduced by randomized smoothing\nclosely interacts with two other important properties of the classifier,\n\\textit{i.e.} its Lipschitz constant and margin.

Moreover, to increase\nthe certified robust radius, we introduce a different simplex projection\ntechnique for the base classifier to leverage the variance-margin trade-off\nthanks to Bernstein's concentration inequality, along with an enhanced\nLipschitz bound.

            "summary": "Stochastic Resonance (SR) describes a phenomenon where an additive noise\n(stochastic carrier-wave) enhances the signal transmission in a nonlinear\nsystem. In the nervous system, nonlinear properties are present from the level\nof single ion channels all the way to perception and appear to support the\nemergence of SR. For example, SR has been repeatedly demonstrated for visual\ndetection tasks, also by adding noise directly to cortical areas via\ntranscranial random noise stimulation (tRNS). When dealing with nonlinear\nphysical systems, it has been suggested that resonance can be induced not only\nby adding stochastic signals (i.e., noise) but also by adding a large class of\nsignals that are not stochastic in nature which cause \"deterministic amplitude\nresonance\" (DAR). Here we mathematically show that high-frequency,\ndeterministic, periodic signals can yield resonance-like effects with linear\ntransfer and infinite signal-to-noise ratio at the output. We tested this\nprediction empirically and investigated whether non-random, high-frequency,\ntranscranial alternating current stimulation applied to visual cortex could\ninduce resonance-like effects and enhance performance of a visual detection\ntask. We demonstrated in 28 participants that applying 80 Hz triangular-waves\nor sine-waves with tACS reduced visual contrast detection threshold for optimal\nbrain stimulation intensities. The influence of tACS on contrast sensitivity\nwas equally effective to tRNS-induced modulation, demonstrating that both tACS\nand tRNS can reduce contrast detection thresholds. Our findings suggest that a\nresonance-like mechanism can also emerge when deterministic electrical\nwaveforms are applied via tACS.",

            "summary": "Stowing, the task of placing objects in cluttered shelves or bins, is a\ncommon task in warehouse and manufacturing operations. However, this task is\nstill predominantly carried out by human workers as stowing is challenging to\nautomate due to the complex multi-object interactions and long-horizon nature\nof the task. Previous works typically involve extensive data collection and\ncostly human labeling of semantic priors across diverse object categories. This\npaper presents a method to learn a generalizable robot stowing policy from\npredictive model of object interactions and a single demonstration with\nbehavior primitives. We propose a novel framework that utilizes Graph Neural\nNetworks to predict object interactions within the parameter space of\nbehavioral primitives. We further employ primitive-augmented trajectory\noptimization to search the parameters of a predefined library of heterogeneous\nbehavioral primitives to instantiate the control action. Our framework enables\nrobots to proficiently execute long-horizon stowing tasks with a few keyframes\n(3-4) from a single demonstration. Despite being solely trained in a\nsimulation, our framework demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities.\nIt efficiently adapts to a broad spectrum of real-world conditions, including\nvarious shelf widths, fluctuating quantities of objects, and objects with\ndiverse attributes such as sizes and shapes.",

This\npaper harnesses acoustic data to identify variations in rain, wind and air\ntemperature at different thresholds, with rain being the most successfully\npredicted. Training a model solely on acoustic data yields optimal results, but\nit demands labor-intensive sample labeling. Meanwhile, hourly satellite data\nfrom the MERRA-2 system, though sufficient for certain tasks, produced\npredictions that were notably less accurate in predict these acoustic labels.\nWe find that acoustic classifiers can be trained from the MERRA-2 data that are\nmore accurate than the raw MERRA-2 data itself. By using MERRA-2 to roughly\nidentify rain in the acoustic data, we were able to produce a functional model\nwithout using human-validated labels.

Our work extends the idea of the\npopular Local Rademacher Complexity (LRC) to the transductive setting with\nconsiderable changes compared to the analysis of typical LRC methods in the\ninductive setting. We present a localized version of Rademacher complexity\nbased tool wihch can be applied to various transductive learning problems and\ngain sharp bounds under proper conditions. Similar to the development of LRC,\nwe build TLRC by starting from a sharp concentration inequality for independent\nvariables with variance information. The prediction function class of a\ntransductive learning model is then divided into pieces with a sub-root\nfunction being the upper bound for the Rademacher complexity of each piece, and\nthe variance of all the functions in each piece is limited. A carefully\ndesigned variance operator is used to ensure that the bound for the test loss\non unlabeled test data in the transductive setting enjoys a remarkable\nsimilarity to that of the classical LRC bound in the inductive setting. We use\nthe new TLRC tool to analyze the Transductive Kernel Learning (TKL) model,\nwhere the labels of test data are generated by a kernel function. The result of\nTKL lays the foundation for generalization bounds for two types of transductive\nlearning tasks, Graph Transductive Learning (GTL) and Transductive\nNonparametric Kernel Regression (TNKR). When the target function is\nlow-dimensional or approximately low-dimensional, we design low rank methods\nfor both GTL and TNKR, which enjoy particularly sharper generalization bounds\nby TLRC which cannot be achieved by existing learning theory methods, to the\nbest of our knowledge.",

While a standard non-local search is\nhigh-quality for a window surrounding each query point, the window's small size\ncannot accommodate motion. Methods for long-range motion use an auxiliary\nnetwork to predict the most similar key coordinates as offsets from each query\nlocation. However, accurately predicting this flow field of offsets remains\nchallenging, even for large-scale networks. Small spatial inaccuracies\nsignificantly impact the attention module's quality. This paper proposes a\nsearch strategy that combines the quality of a non-local search with the range\nof predicted offsets. The method, named Shifted Non-Local Search, executes a\nsmall grid search surrounding the predicted offsets to correct small spatial\nerrors. Our method's in-place computation consumes 10 times less memory and is\nover 3 times faster than previous work. Experimentally, correcting the small\nspatial errors improves the video frame alignment quality by over 3 dB PSNR.\nOur search upgrades existing space-time attention modules, which improves video\ndenoising results by 0.30 dB PSNR for a 7.5% increase in overall runtime.

            "summary": "We consider a (2+1)-dimensional modified electrodynamics endowed with terms\nthat are either Lorentz-invariant or Lorentz-violating and involve an ever\nincreasing number of derivatives. Our construction relies on U(1) gauge\ninvariance and the Abelian Chern-Simons term poses the starting point. The\nstructure of the nonminimal Standard-Model Extension (SME) in (3+1) spacetime\ndimensions serves as an inspiration for our pursuit. For elaborate studies and\napplications we particularly focus on the second term of the operator series in\nthe general framework, which is the first contribution with additional\nderivatives. The latter forms the essential ingredient for several models of\nmodified planar electrodynamics to be examined. The propagators of the models\nconstitute the foundation for us deriving the physical propagating modes as\nwell as for drawing conclusions on unitarity in the quantum regime. We are also\ninterested in identifying parameter regions of sub- and superluminal mode\npropagation and determine classical solutions of the field equations for the\nplanar models introduced. Moreover, a duality between an extended Chern-Simons\ntheory and a subset of the fermion sector coefficients in the nonminimal SME is\npointed out, as well. Finally, the integer quantum Hall effect is chosen as a\ntestbed to demonstrate the applicability of our findings to real physical\nsystems. Predictions on momentum- and direction-dependent corrections of the\nHall resistivity are made at the level of effective field theory, which could\nbe tested in experiments. Thus, the (2+1)-dimensional models proposed are\npotentially applicable to model electromagnetic phenomena in certain planar\ncondensed-matter systems.",

In this paper, we propose a\nmethod to propagate uncertainty through cascades of deep learning models in\nmedical imaging pipelines. This allows us to aggregate the uncertainty in later\nstages of the pipeline and to obtain a joint uncertainty measure for the\npredictions of later models. Additionally, we can separately report\ncontributions of the aleatoric, data-based, uncertainty of every component in\nthe pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of our method on a realistic imaging\npipeline that reconstructs undersampled brain and knee magnetic resonance (MR)\nimages and subsequently predicts quantitative information from the images, such\nas the brain volume, or knee side or patient's sex. We quantitatively show that\nthe propagated uncertainty is correlated with input uncertainty and compare the\nproportions of contributions of pipeline stages to the joint uncertainty\nmeasure.",

In recent work, it was shown that backdoor\ndata-poisoning also induces overfitting, with unusually large classification\nmargins to the attacker's target class, mediated particularly by (unbounded)\nReLU activations that allow large signals to propagate in the DNN. Thus, an\neffective post-training (with no knowledge of the training set or training\nprocess) mitigation approach against backdoors was proposed, leveraging a small\nclean dataset, based on bounding neural activations. Improving upon that work,\nwe threshold activations specifically to limit maximum margins (MMs), which\nyields performance gains in backdoor mitigation. We also provide some\nanalytical support for this mitigation approach. Most importantly, we show that\npost-training MM-based regularization substantially mitigates non-malicious\noverfitting due to class imbalances and overtraining. Thus, unlike adversarial\ntraining, which provides some resilience against attacks but which harms clean\n(attack-free) generalization, we demonstrate an approach originating from\nadversarial learning that helps clean generalization accuracy.

Nonetheless, the\nimpact of the interlayer twist angle on the band alignment of the monolayers\ncomposing the heterostructure has received scant attention in the current\nresearch. Here, we systematically investigate the twist-angle dependence of\nintra- and inter-layer excitons in twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers. By\nperforming photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, we identify the\ntwist-angle dependence of interlayer emission response, where an energy\nredshift of about 100 meV was observed for increasing twist angles. The applied\nmicroscopic theory predicts, on the contrary, a blueshift, which suggests that\nadditional features, such as atomic reconstruction, may also surpass the\nmoir\\'e potential confinement. Those findings also prompt the effects of\ndielectric screening by addressing the redshift response to the stacking layer\norder. Furthermore, our findings support the evidence of a band offset\ndependence on the twist angle for the adjacent monolayers composing the\nheterobilayer system.

Both of these approaches yield different representations for\nthe same underlying data or function.

Our method, called Predicting\nOperators and Symbolic Expressions (PROSE), learns maps from multimodal inputs\nto multimodal outputs, capable of generating both numerical predictions and\nmathematical equations. By using a transformer structure and a feature fusion\napproach, our network can simultaneously embed sets of solution operators for\nvarious parametric differential equations using a single trained network.\nDetailed experiments demonstrate that the network benefits from its multimodal\nnature, resulting in improved prediction accuracy and better generalization.\nThe network is shown to be able to handle noise in the data and errors in the\nsymbolic representation, including noisy numerical values, model\nmisspecification, and erroneous addition or deletion of terms.

Magnetic toroid patterns (narrow\nlatitude-belts warped in longitude, in which active regions are tightly bound)\nderived from surface distributions of active regions, prior/during AR12673\nemergence, reveal that the portions of the South-toroid containing AR12673 was\nnot tipped-away from its north-toroid counterpart at that longitude, unlike the\n2003 Halloween storms scenario. During the minimum-phase there were too few\nemergences to determine multi-mode longitudinal toroid patterns. A new\nemergence within AR12673 produced a complex/non-potential structure, which led\nto rapid build-up of helicity/winding that triggered the biggest X-flare of\nSC-24, suggesting that this minimum-phase storm can be anticipated several\nhours before its occurrence. However, global patterns and local dynamics for a\npeak-phase storm, such as that from AR11263, behaved like 2003 Halloween\nstorms, producing the third biggest X-flare of SC-24. AR11263 was present at\nthe longitude where the North/South toroids tipped-away from each other. While\nglobal toroid patterns indicate that pre-storm features can be forecast with a\nlead-time of a few months, its application on observational data can be\ncomplicated by complex interactions with turbulent flows. Complex/non-potential\nfield structure development hours before the storm are necessary for short term\nprediction. We infer that minimum-phase storms cannot be forecast accurately\nmore than a few hours ahead, while flare-prone active regions in peak-phase may\nbe anticipated much earlier, possibly months ahead from global toroid patterns.",

In contrast to standard monocular VO approaches\nwhich often study a known calibration within a single dataset, XVO efficiently\nlearns to recover relative pose with real-world scale from visual scene\nsemantics, i.e., without relying on any known camera parameters. We optimize\nthe motion estimation model via self-training from large amounts of\nunconstrained and heterogeneous dash camera videos available on YouTube. Our\nkey contribution is twofold. First, we empirically demonstrate the benefits of\nsemi-supervised training for learning a general-purpose direct VO regression\nnetwork. Second, we demonstrate multi-modal supervision, including\nsegmentation, flow, depth, and audio auxiliary prediction tasks, to facilitate\ngeneralized representations for the VO task. Specifically, we find audio\nprediction task to significantly enhance the semi-supervised learning process\nwhile alleviating noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in highly dynamic and\nout-of-domain video data. Our proposed teacher network achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the commonly used KITTI benchmark despite no\nmulti-frame optimization or knowledge of camera parameters. Combined with the\nproposed semi-supervised step, XVO demonstrates off-the-shelf knowledge\ntransfer across diverse conditions on KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse without\nfine-tuning.",

There have been few tests, however, of lens model predictions\nadjacent to the critical curve (<8\") where the magnification is greatest. In a\ncompanion paper, we use the GLAFIC lens model to constrain the Balmer L-sigma\nrelation for HII regions in a galaxy at redshift z=1.49 strongly lensed by the\nMACS J1149 galaxy cluster. Here we perform a detailed comparison between the\npredictions of ten cluster lens models which employ multiple modeling\nassumptions with our measurements of 11 magnified giant HII regions. We find\nthat that the models predict magnifications an average factor of 6.2 smaller, a\n2-sigma tension, than that inferred from the HII regions under the assumption\nthat they follow the low-redshift L-sigma relation. To evaluate the possibility\nthat the lens model magnifications are strongly biased, we next consider the\nflux ratios among knots in three images of Sp1149, and find that these are\nconsistent with model predictions. Moreover, while the mass-sheet degeneracy\ncould in principle account for a factor of ~6 discrepancy in magnification, the\nvalue of H0 inferred from SN Refsdal's time delay would become implausibly\nsmall. We conclude that the lens models are not likely to be highly biased, and\nthat instead the HII regions in Sp1149 are substantially more luminous than the\nlow-redshift Balmer L-sigma relation predicts.",

            "summary": "Computer vision research has long aimed to build systems that are robust to\nspatial transformations found in natural data. Traditionally, this is done\nusing data augmentation or hard-coding invariances into the architecture.\nHowever, too much or too little invariance can hurt, and the correct amount is\nunknown a priori and dependent on the instance. Ideally, the appropriate\ninvariance would be learned from data and inferred at test-time.\n  We treat invariance as a prediction problem. Given any image, we use a\nnormalizing flow to predict a distribution over transformations and average the\npredictions over them. Since this distribution only depends on the instance, we\ncan align instances before classifying them and generalize invariance across\nclasses. The same distribution can also be used to adapt to out-of-distribution\nposes. This normalizing flow is trained end-to-end and can learn a much larger\nrange of transformations than Augerino and InstaAug. When used as data\naugmentation, our method shows accuracy and robustness gains on CIFAR 10,\nCIFAR10-LT, and TinyImageNet.",

Erbium-doped cerium oxide (Er:CeO$_2$) is\na particularly promising platform for such a quantum memory, as it combines the\ntelecom-wavelength (~1.5 $\\mu$m) 4f-4f transition of erbium, a predicted long\nelectron spin coherence time supported by CeO$_2$, and is also near\nlattice-matched to silicon for heteroepitaxial growth. In this work, we report\non the epitaxial growth of Er:CeO$_2$ thin films on silicon using molecular\nbeam epitaxy (MBE), with controlled erbium concentration down to 2 parts per\nmillion (ppm). We carry out a detailed microstructural study to verify the\nCeO$_2$ host structure, and characterize the spin and optical properties of the\nembedded Er$^{3+}$ ions. In the 2-3 ppm Er regime, we identify EPR linewidths\nof 245(1) MHz, optical inhomogeneous linewidths of 9.5(2) GHz, optical excited\nstate lifetimes of 3.5(1) ms, and spectral diffusion-limited homogenoeus\nlinewidths as narrow as 4.8(3) MHz in the as-grown material. We test annealing\nof the Er:CeO$_2$ films up to 900 deg C, which yields modest narrowing of the\ninhomogeneous linewidth by 20% and extension of the excited state lifetime by\n40%. We have also studied the variation of the optical properties as a function\nof Er doping and find that the results are consistent with the trends expected\nfrom inter-dopant charge interactions.",

The main challenge lies in learning\ncompact representations generalizable to unseen environments and in learning\nhigh-capacity perception modules capable of reasoning on high-dimensional\ninput. The latter is particularly difficult when the goal is not given as a\ncategory (\"ObjectNav\") but as an exemplar image (\"ImageNav\"), as the perception\nmodule needs to learn a comparison strategy requiring to solve an underlying\nvisual correspondence problem. This has been shown to be difficult from reward\nalone or with standard auxiliary tasks. We address this problem through a\nsequence of two pretext tasks, which serve as a prior for what we argue is one\nof the main bottleneck in perception, extremely wide-baseline relative pose\nestimation and visibility prediction in complex scenes. The first pretext task,\ncross-view completion is a proxy for the underlying visual correspondence\nproblem, while the second task addresses goal detection and finding directly.\nWe propose a new dual encoder with a large-capacity binocular ViT model and\nshow that correspondence solutions naturally emerge from the training signals.\nExperiments show significant improvements and SOTA performance on the two\nbenchmarks, ImageNav and the Instance-ImageNav variant, where camera intrinsics\nand height differ between observation and goal.",

In the\nsetup, all the SM and DM fields reside on the hyper-surface while graviton\nlives in the bulk. We consider two well-known brane-world cosmologies, namely,\nthe Randall-Sundrum (RS) and the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) brane-world cosmologies, in\nwhich the standard Big Bang cosmology is reproduced at low temperatures below\nthe so-called ``transition temperature\" while at high temperatures the\nexpansion law of the universe is significantly modified. Such a non-standard\nexpansion law directly impacts the prediction for the relic density of the\nHiggs-portal DM. We investigate the brane-world cosmological effects and\nidentify the allowed model parameter region by combining the constraints from\nthe observed DM relic density, and the direct and indirect DM detection\nexperiments. It is well-known that only DM masses in the vicinity of half the\nHiggs boson mass are allowed in the Higgs-portal scalar DM model. We find that\nthe allowed parameter region becomes more severely constrained and even\ndisappears in the RS cosmology, while the GB cosmological effect significantly\nenlarges the allowed region.

Distances between graphs usually rely on\ninformative representations of these structured objects such as bag of\nsubstructures or other graph embeddings. A recently popular solution consists\nin representing graphs as metric measure spaces, allowing to successfully\nleverage Optimal Transport, which provides meaningful distances allowing to\ncompare them: the Gromov-Wasserstein distances. However, this family of\ndistances overlooks edge attributes, which are essential for many structured\nobjects. In this work, we introduce an extension of Gromov-Wasserstein distance\nfor comparing graphs whose both nodes and edges have features. We propose novel\nalgorithms for distance and barycenter computation. We empirically show the\neffectiveness of the novel distance in learning tasks where graphs occur in\neither input space or output space, such as classification and graph\nprediction.",

            "summary": "Experiments aimed at detecting ultralight dark matter typically rely on\nresonant effects, which are sensitive to the dark matter mass that matches the\nresonance frequency. In this study, we investigate the nucleon couplings of\nultralight axion dark matter using a magnetometer operating in a nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) mode. Our approach involves the use of a $^{21}$Ne\nspin-based sensor, which features the lowest nuclear magnetic moment among\nnoble-gas spins. This configuration allows us to achieve an ultrahigh\nsensitivity of 0.73 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at around 5 Hz, corresponding to energy\nresolution of approximately 1.5$\\times\n  10^{-23}\\,\\rm{eV/Hz^{1/2}}$. Our analysis reveals that under certain\nconditions it is beneficial to scan the frequency with steps significantly\nlarger than the resonance width. The analytical results are in agreement with\nexperimental data and the scan strategy is potentially applicable to other\nresonant searches. Further, our study establishes stringent constraints on\naxion-like particles (ALP) in the 4.5--15.5 Hz Compton-frequency range coupling\nto neutrons and protons, improving on prior work by several-fold. Within a band\naround 4.6--6.6 Hz and around 7.5 Hz, our laboratory findings surpass\nastrophysical limits derived from neutron-star cooling. Hence, we demonstrate\nan accelerated resonance search for ultralight dark matter, achieving an\napproximately 30-fold increase in scanning step while maintaining competitive\nsensitivity.",

            "summary": "While reliable data-driven decision-making hinges on high-quality labeled\ndata, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human\nannotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is\nbecoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are\nbeing used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;\ne.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally\nderived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite\nimagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since\npredictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into\nquestion the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:\na method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled\ndataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing\nlabels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the\nprediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error\nprobability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled\ndata. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,\nwhich assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that\ncross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of\nprediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split\noff and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction\ngives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals\ntypically have significantly lower variability.",

To\naddress the ``when'' question, we examine a variety of prompting methods for\nencoding structural information, in settings where textual node features are\neither rich or scarce. For the ``why'' questions, we probe into two potential\ncontributing factors to the LLM performance: data leakage and homophily. Our\nexploration of these questions reveals that (i) LLMs can benefit from\nstructural information, especially when textual node features are scarce; (ii)\nthere is no substantial evidence indicating that the performance of LLMs is\nsignificantly attributed to data leakage; and (iii) the performance of LLMs on\na target node is strongly positively related to the local homophily ratio of\nthe node\\footnote{Codes and datasets are at:\n\\url{https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab/LLM-Structured-Data}}.",

Second,\nour approach bypasses post-hoc interaction heuristics where individual agent\ntrajectory generation is conducted prior to interactive scoring. Instead,\nMotionLM produces joint distributions over interactive agent futures in a\nsingle autoregressive decoding process. In addition, the model's sequential\nfactorization enables temporally causal conditional rollouts. The proposed\napproach establishes new state-of-the-art performance for multi-agent motion\nprediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, ranking 1st on the interactive\nchallenge leaderboard.",

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate all forms of interaction in\nbinary systems that may affect the evolution of the components. One of such\n`laboratories' is the massive eccentric binary system MACHO$\\,$80.7443.1718\n(ExtEV). We examine whether the light variability of the ExtEV can be explained\nby a wind-wind collision (WWC) binary system model. We conducted an analysis of\nbroadband multi-color photometry of ExtEV, time-series space photometry from\nTESS, ground-based Johnson $UBV$ photometry, and time-series spectroscopy. We\nfitted an analytical model of light variations to the TESS light curve of\nExtEV. We rule out the possibility of the presence of a disk around the primary\ncomponent. We also argue that the non-linear wave-breaking scenario is not\nconsistent with the observations of ExtEV. We refine the orbital parameters of\nExtEV and find evidence for the presence of a tertiary component. Using\nevolutionary models we demonstrate that the primary component's mass is between\n25 and 45$\\,$M$_\\odot$. We successfully reproduce light curve of ExtEV with our\nmodel, showing that the dominant processes shaping its light curve are\natmospheric eclipse and light scattered in the WWC cone. We also estimate the\nprimary's mass-loss rate due to stellar wind for $4.5\\cdot\n10^{-5}\\,$M$_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. ExtEV is not an extreme eccentric\nellipsoidal variable, but an exceptional WWC binary system. The mass loss rate\nwe derived exceeds theoretical predictions by up to two orders of magnitude.\nThis implies that the wind in the system is likely enhanced by tidal\ninteractions, rotation, and possibly also tidally excited oscillations. ExtEV\nrepresents a rare evolutionary phase of a binary system that may help to\nunderstand the role of a companion-driven enhanced mass loss in the evolution\nof massive binary systems.",

However, a key\ndifficulty that remains is the choice of the model class from which the\ndynamics will be learned. The fundamental challenge is trading the richness of\nthe model class with the learnability within the model class. Toward addressing\nthe so-called model selection problem, we introduce a novel notion of\nStructural Risk Minimization (SRM) for learning nonlinear dynamics. Inspired by\nclassical SRM for classification, we minimize a bound on the true prediction\nerror over hierarchies of model classes. The class selected by our SRM scheme\nis shown to achieve a nearly optimal learning guarantee among all model classes\ncontained in the hierarchy. Employing the proposed scheme along with computable\nmodel class complexity bounds, we derive explicit SRM schemes for learning\nnonlinear dynamics under hierarchies of: i) norm-constrained Reproducing Kernel\nHilbert Spaces, and ii) norm-constrained Neural Network classes. We empirically\nshow that even though too loose to be used as absolute estimates, our SRM\nbounds on the true prediction error are able to track its relative behavior\nacross different model classes of the hierarchy.",

However, recent reports on the synthesis of the\nhexagonal 4H Si polytype have attracted the attention of the scientific\ncommunity to understand its functional properties. Here we report the\nelectronic, vibrational, and optical properties of the 4H Si polytype obtained\nwith predictive first-principles calculations. We find that, compared to the\ncubic polytype, 4H Si shows a slightly narrower indirect gap by $\\sim$ 0.05 eV.\nBy calculating its direct and phonon-assisted optical spectra, we show that 4H\nSi exhibits a stronger absorption coefficient than cubic Si across the visible\nand IR spectral regions. We further evaluate the short-circuit current density\nof textured thin-films, and we demonstrate that 4H Si can achieve the same\nshort-circuit current density for a five times thinner film compared to the\ncubic polytype. Our work demonstrates the advantages of 4H Si for thin-film\nsilicon-based solar-cell applications.",

            "summary": "The growing penetration of intermittent, renewable generation in US power\ngrids, especially wind and solar generation, results in increased operational\nuncertainty. In that context, accurate forecasts are critical, especially for\nwind generation, which exhibits large variability and is historically harder to\npredict. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel\nBundle-Predict-Reconcile (BPR) framework that integrates asset bundling,\nmachine learning, and forecast reconciliation techniques. The BPR framework\nfirst learns an intermediate hierarchy level (the bundles), then predicts wind\npower at the asset, bundle, and fleet level, and finally reconciles all\nforecasts to ensure consistency. This approach effectively introduces an\nauxiliary learning task (predicting the bundle-level time series) to help the\nmain learning tasks. The paper also introduces new asset-bundling criteria that\ncapture the spatio-temporal dynamics of wind power time series. Extensive\nnumerical experiments are conducted on an industry-size dataset of 283 wind\nfarms in the MISO footprint. The experiments consider short-term and day-ahead\nforecasts, and evaluates a large variety of forecasting models that include\nweather predictions as covariates. The results demonstrate the benefits of BPR,\nwhich consistently and significantly improves forecast accuracy over baselines,\nespecially at the fleet level.",

            "summary": "Fair machine learning seeks to mitigate model prediction bias against certain\ndemographic subgroups such as elder and female. Recently, fair representation\nlearning (FRL) trained by deep neural networks has demonstrated superior\nperformance, whereby representations containing no demographic information are\ninferred from the data and then used as the input to classification or other\ndownstream tasks. Despite the development of FRL methods, their vulnerability\nunder data poisoning attack, a popular protocol to benchmark model robustness\nunder adversarial scenarios, is under-explored. Data poisoning attacks have\nbeen developed for classical fair machine learning methods which incorporate\nfairness constraints into shallow-model classifiers. Nonetheless, these attacks\nfall short in FRL due to notably different fairness goals and model\narchitectures. This work proposes the first data poisoning framework attacking\nFRL. We induce the model to output unfair representations that contain as much\ndemographic information as possible by injecting carefully crafted poisoning\nsamples into the training data. This attack entails a prohibitive bilevel\noptimization, wherefore an effective approximated solution is proposed. A\ntheoretical analysis on the needed number of poisoning samples is derived and\nsheds light on defending against the attack. Experiments on benchmark fairness\ndatasets and state-of-the-art fair representation learning models demonstrate\nthe superiority of our attack.",

This study, conducted with a\ncohort of 821 post-COVID-19 patients from diverse regions of Iraq across the\nyears 2021, 2022, and 2023, endeavors to predict the risk of long-term renal\nimpairment using advanced machine learning algorithms.

This research encompasses comprehensive\ndata collection and preprocessing, feature selection, and the development of\npredictive models using various machine learning algorithms. The study's\nobjectives are to assess the incidence of long-term renal impairment in\npost-COVID-19 patients, identify associated risk factors, create predictive\nmodels, and evaluate their accuracy. We anticipate that our machine learning\nmodels, drawing from a rich dataset, will provide valuable insights into the\nrisk of renal impairment, ultimately enhancing patient care and quality of\nlife.

However, the currently\navailable deep learning-based TomoSAR algorithms are limited to\nthree-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. The extension of deep learning-based\nalgorithms to four-dimensional (4D) imaging, i.e., differential TomoSAR\n(D-TomoSAR) applications, is impeded mainly due to the high-dimensional weight\nmatrices required by the network designed for D-TomoSAR inversion, which\ntypically contain millions of freely trainable parameters. Learning such huge\nnumber of weights requires an enormous number of training samples, resulting in\na large memory burden and excessive time consumption. To tackle this issue, we\npropose an efficient and accurate algorithm called HyperLISTA-ABT. The weights\nin HyperLISTA-ABT are determined in an analytical way according to a minimum\ncoherence criterion, trimming the model down to an ultra-light one with only\nthree hyperparameters. Additionally, HyperLISTA-ABT improves the global\nthresholding by utilizing an adaptive blockwise thresholding scheme, which\napplies block-coordinate techniques and conducts thresholding in local blocks,\nso that weak expressions and local features can be retained in the shrinkage\nstep layer by layer. Simulations were performed and demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our approach, showing that HyperLISTA-ABT achieves superior\ncomputational efficiency and with no significant performance degradation\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.

First, we\nconstruct the fusion hierarchy of the quantum transfer matrices ($T$-functions)\nand derive functional relations ($T$- and $Y$-systems) satisfied by the\n$T$-functions and certain combinations of them ($Y$-functions). Through\nanalytical arguments, the $Y$-system is reduced to a set of non-linear integral\nequations, equivalent to the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations. Then,\nemploying GHD, we calculate the spin Drude weight at arbitrary finite\ntemperatures. As a result, a characteristic fractal-like structure of the Drude\nweight is observed at arbitrary spin, similar to the spin-1/2 case. In our\napproach, the solutions to the TBA equations (i.e., the $Y$-functions) can be\nexplicitly written in terms of the $T$-functions, thus allowing for a\nsystematic calculation of the high-temperature limit of the Drude weight.",

To\naddress these limitations, the integration of pre-trained models with\ndifferentiable access mechanisms to explicit non-parametric memory emerges as a\npromising solution. This survey delves into the realm of language models (LMs)\naugmented with the ability to tap into external knowledge sources, including\nexternal knowledge bases and search engines. While adhering to the standard\nobjective of predicting missing tokens, these augmented LMs leverage diverse,\npossibly non-parametric external modules to augment their contextual processing\ncapabilities, departing from the conventional language modeling paradigm.\nThrough an exploration of current advancements in augmenting large language\nmodels with knowledge, this work concludes that this emerging research\ndirection holds the potential to address prevalent issues in traditional LMs,\nsuch as hallucinations, un-grounded responses, and scalability challenges.",

This\ninvolves: (i) enumerating all possible symmetry-confined ways in which a given\ncomposition can be accommodated in a given space group, (ii) ranking the\nelement-assigned prototype representations using energies predicted using Wren\nML model [Sci.\\ Adv.\\ 8, eabn4117 (2022)], (iii) assigning and perturbing atoms\nalong the degree of freedom allowed by the Wyckoff positions to match the\nexperimental diffraction data (iv) validating the thermodynamic stability of\nthe material using density-functional theory (DFT). An advantage of the\npresented method is that it does not rely on a database of previously observed\nprototypes and, therefore is capable of finding crystal structures with\nentirely new symmetric arrangements of atoms. We demonstrate the workflow on\nunidentified XRD spectra from the ICDD database and identify a number of stable\nstructures, where a majority turns out to be derivable from known prototypes,\nbut at least two are found to not be part of our prior structural data sets.",

In this\nwork, we make one of the first attempts at studying the impact of adversarially\nrobust models on actionable explanations which provide end users with a means\nfor recourse. We theoretically and empirically analyze the cost (ease of\nimplementation) and validity (probability of obtaining a positive model\nprediction) of recourses output by state-of-the-art algorithms when the\nunderlying models are adversarially robust vs. non-robust. More specifically,\nwe derive theoretical bounds on the differences between the cost and the\nvalidity of the recourses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms for\nadversarially robust vs. non-robust linear and non-linear models. Our empirical\nresults with multiple real-world datasets validate our theoretical results and\nshow the impact of varying degrees of model robustness on the cost and validity\nof the resulting recourses.

It describes the nonlinear\nelectrostatic potential of charged bodies submerged in an ionic solution. The\nkinetic presence of the solvent molecules introduces randomness to the shape of\na protein, and thus a more accurate model that incorporates these random\nperturbations of the domain is analyzed to compute the statistics of quantities\nof interest of the solution. When the parameterization of the random\nperturbations is high-dimensional, this calculation is intractable as it is\nsubject to the curse of dimensionality. However, if the solution of the NPBE\nvaries analytically with respect to the random parameters, the problem becomes\namenable to techniques such as sparse grids and deep neural networks. In this\npaper, we show analyticity of the solution of the NPBE with respect to analytic\nperturbations of the domain by using the analytic implicit function theorem and\nthe domain mapping method. Previous works have shown analyticity of solutions\nto linear elliptic equations but not for nonlinear problems. We further show\nhow to derive \\emph{a priori} bounds on the size of the region of analyticity.\nThis method is applied to the trypsin molecule to demonstrate that the\nconvergence rates of the quantity of interest are consistent with the\nanalyticity result.

Existing\napproaches typically follow a \"Train-from-Scratch\" paradigm, which is\nfundamentally bounded by the availability of large-scale annotated data. While\nexpressive pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been adapted in a\n\"Pre-Train-and-Fine-Tune\" manner, the inconsistency between pre-training and\ndownstream objectives also requires costly task-specific supervision. In this\npaper, we propose \"Prompt-and-Align\" (P&A), a novel prompt-based paradigm for\nfew-shot fake news detection that jointly leverages the pre-trained knowledge\nin PLMs and the social context topology. Our approach mitigates label scarcity\nby wrapping the news article in a task-related textual prompt, which is then\nprocessed by the PLM to directly elicit task-specific knowledge. To supplement\nthe PLM with social context without inducing additional training overheads,\nmotivated by empirical observation on user veracity consistency (i.e., social\nusers tend to consume news of the same veracity type), we further construct a\nnews proximity graph among news articles to capture the veracity-consistent\nsignals in shared readerships, and align the prompting predictions along the\ngraph edges in a confidence-informed manner. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that P&A sets new states-of-the-art for\nfew-shot fake news detection performance by significant margins.",

            "summary": "Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are known for their efficiency in solving\ncombinatorial optimization problems, thanks to their ability to explore diverse\nsolution spaces, handle various representations, exploit parallelism, preserve\ngood solutions, adapt to changing dynamics, handle combinatorial diversity, and\nprovide heuristic search. However, limitations such as premature convergence,\nlack of problem-specific knowledge, and randomness of crossover and mutation\noperators make GAs generally inefficient in finding an optimal solution. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes a new metaheuristic algorithm\ncalled the Genetic Engineering Algorithm (GEA) that draws inspiration from\ngenetic engineering concepts. GEA redesigns the traditional GA while\nincorporating new search methods to isolate, purify, insert, and express new\ngenes based on existing ones, leading to the emergence of desired traits and\nthe production of specific chromosomes based on the selected genes. Comparative\nevaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark instances\ndemonstrate the superior performance of GEA, showcasing its potential as an\ninnovative and efficient solution for combinatorial optimization problems.",

Unlike existing methods, the proposed one allows to account not only for\nthe value of the variance itself but also for the uncertainty of the\ncorresponding variance predictor.

However, load shedding might negatively impact\nthe quality of results (QoR). To minimize the shedding impact on QoR, CEP\nresearchers propose shedding approaches that drop events/internal state with\nthe lowest importances/utilities. In both black-box and white-box shedding\napproaches, different features are used to predict these utilities. In this\nwork, we propose a novel black-box shedding approach that uses a new set of\nfeatures to drop events from the input event stream to maintain a given latency\nbound. Our approach uses a probabilistic model to predict these event\nutilities. Moreover, our approach uses Zobrist hashing and well-known machine\nlearning models, e.g., decision trees and random forests, to handle the\npredicted event utilities. Through extensive evaluations on several synthetic\nand two real-world datasets and a representative set of CEP queries, we show\nthat, in the majority of cases, our load shedding approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art black-box load shedding approaches, w.r.t.

There has been some works that proposes improvements for this task,\nsuch as adding several attention blocks or changing the whole structure of\nfeature fusion networks. However, the computation cost of these models is\nlarge, which makes deploying a real-time object detection system unfeasible,\nwhile leaving room for improvement. To this end, an improved YOLOv5 model:\nHIC-YOLOv5 is proposed to address the aforementioned problems. Firstly, an\nadditional prediction head specific to small objects is added to provide a\nhigher-resolution feature map for better prediction. Secondly, an involution\nblock is adopted between the backbone and neck to increase channel information\nof the feature map. Moreover, an attention mechanism named CBAM is applied at\nthe end of the backbone, thus not only decreasing the computation cost compared\nwith previous works but also emphasizing the important information in both\nchannel and spatial domain. Our result shows that HIC-YOLOv5 has improved\nmAP@[.5:.95] by 6.42% and mAP@0.5 by 9.38% on VisDrone-2019-DET dataset.",

            "summary": "Recently, a surge in biomedical academic publications suspected of image\nmanipulation has led to numerous retractions, turning biomedical image\nforensics into a research hotspot. While manipulation detectors are concerning,\nthe specific detection of splicing traces in biomedical images remains\nunderexplored. The disruptive factors within biomedical images, such as\nartifacts, abnormal patterns, and noises, show misleading features like the\nsplicing traces, greatly increasing the challenge for this task. Moreover, the\nscarcity of high-quality spliced biomedical images also limits potential\nadvancements in this field. In this work, we propose an Uncertainty-guided\nRefinement Network (URN) to mitigate the effects of these disruptive factors.\nOur URN can explicitly suppress the propagation of unreliable information flow\ncaused by disruptive factors among regions, thereby obtaining robust features.\nMoreover, URN enables a concentration on the refinement of uncertainly\npredicted regions during the decoding phase. Besides, we construct a dataset\nfor Biomedical image Splicing (BioSp) detection, which consists of 1,290\nspliced images. Compared with existing datasets, BioSp comprises the largest\nnumber of spliced images and the most diverse sources. Comprehensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method.

            "summary": "We present and evaluate the prospects for detecting coherent radio\ncounterparts to gravitational wave (GW) events using Murchison Widefield Array\n(MWA) triggered observations. The MWA rapid-response system, combined with its\nbuffering mode ($\\sim4$ minutes negative latency), enables us to catch any\nradio signals produced from seconds prior to hours after a binary neutron star\n(BNS) merger. The large field of view of the MWA ($\\sim1000\\,\\text{deg}^2$ at\n120\\,MHz) and its location under the high sensitivity sky region of the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network, forecast a high chance of being\non-target for a GW event. We consider three observing configurations for the\nMWA to follow up GW BNS merger events, including a single dipole per tile, the\nfull array, and four sub-arrays. We then perform a population synthesis of BNS\nsystems to predict the radio detectable fraction of GW events using these\nconfigurations. We find that the configuration with four sub-arrays is the best\ncompromise between sky coverage and sensitivity as it is capable of placing\nmeaningful constraints on the radio emission from 12.6\\% of GW BNS detections.\nBased on the timescales of four BNS merger coherent radio emission models, we\npropose an observing strategy that involves triggering the buffering mode to\ntarget coherent signals emitted prior to, during or shortly following the\nmerger, which is then followed by continued recording for up to three hours to\ntarget later time post-merger emission. We expect MWA to trigger on\n$\\sim5\\text{--}22$ BNS merger events during the LVK O4 observing run, which\ncould potentially result in two detections of predicted coherent emission.",

            "summary": "Most knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods learn latent representations of\nentities and relations of a given graph by mapping them into a vector space.\nAlthough the majority of these methods focus on static knowledge graphs, a\nlarge number of publicly available KGs contain temporal information stating the\ntime instant/period over which a certain fact has been true. Such graphs are\noften known as temporal knowledge graphs. Furthermore, knowledge graphs may\nalso contain textual descriptions of entities and relations. Both temporal\ninformation and textual descriptions are not taken into account during\nrepresentation learning by static KGC methods, and only structural information\nof the graph is leveraged. Recently, some studies have used temporal\ninformation to improve link prediction, yet they do not exploit textual\ndescriptions and do not support inductive inference (prediction on entities\nthat have not been seen in training).\n  We propose a novel framework called TEMT that exploits the power of\npre-trained language models (PLMs) for text-enhanced temporal knowledge graph\ncompletion. The knowledge stored in the parameters of a PLM allows TEMT to\nproduce rich semantic representations of facts and to generalize on previously\nunseen entities. TEMT leverages textual and temporal information available in a\nKG, treats them separately, and fuses them to get plausibility scores of facts.\nUnlike previous approaches, TEMT effectively captures dependencies across\ndifferent time points and enables predictions on unseen entities. To assess the\nperformance of TEMT, we carried out several experiments including time interval\nprediction, both in transductive and inductive settings, and triple\nclassification. The experimental results show that TEMT is competitive with the\nstate-of-the-art.",

By adjusting the model parameters, we decelerate the inflaton\nduring the ultra slow-roll (USR) phase and enhance curvature perturbations. %\nOur calculations predict the formation of PBHs with masses of ${\\cal\nO}(10)M_{\\odot}$, which are compatible with LIGO-Virgo observational data.\nAdditionally, we find PBHs with masses around ${\\cal O}(10^{-6})M_{\\odot}$ and\n${\\cal O}(10^{-5})M_{\\odot}$, which can explain ultrashort-timescale\nmicrolensing events in OGLE data. % Furthermore, our proposed mechanism could\nlead to the formation of PBHs in mass scales around ${\\cal\nO}(10^{-14})M_{\\odot}$ and ${\\cal O}(10^{-13})M_{\\odot}$, contributing to\napproximately 99\\% of the dark matter in the universe. % We also study the\nproduction of secondary GWs in our model. In all cases of the model, the\ndensity parameter of secondary GWs $\\Omega_{\\rm GW_0}$ exhibits peaks that\nintersect the sensitivity curves of GWs detectors, providing a means to verify\nour findings using data of these detectors. % Our numerical results demonstrate\na power-law behavior for the spectra of $\\Omega_{\\rm GW_0}$ with respect to\nfrequency, given by $\\Omega_{\\rm GW_0} (f) \\sim (f/f_c)^{n}$.

            "summary": "From dishwashers to cabinets, humans interact with articulated objects every\nday, and for a robot to assist in common manipulation tasks, it must learn a\nrepresentation of articulation. Recent deep learning learning methods can\nprovide powerful vision-based priors on the affordance of articulated objects\nfrom previous, possibly simulated, experiences. In contrast, many works\nestimate articulation by observing the object in motion, requiring the robot to\nalready be interacting with the object. In this work, we propose to use the\nbest of both worlds by introducing an online estimation method that merges\nvision-based affordance predictions from a neural network with interactive\nkinematic sensing in an analytical model. Our work has the benefit of using\nvision to predict an articulation model before touching the object, while also\nbeing able to update the model quickly from kinematic sensing during the\ninteraction. In this paper, we implement a full system using shared autonomy\nfor robotic opening of articulated objects, in particular objects in which the\narticulation is not apparent from vision alone. We implemented our system on a\nreal robot and performed several autonomous closed-loop experiments in which\nthe robot had to open a door with unknown joint while estimating the\narticulation online. Our system achieved an 80% success rate for autonomous\nopening of unknown articulated objects.",

Machine learning methods have shown promising results in\nevaluating the risk of developing atrial fibrillation from the\nelectrocardiogram. We aim to develop and evaluate one such algorithm on a large\nCODE dataset collected in Brazil.\n  Results: The deep neural network model identified patients without indication\nof AF in the presented ECG but who will develop AF in the future with an AUC\nscore of 0.845. From our survival model, we obtain that patients in the\nhigh-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF case being greater\nthan 0.7) are 50% more likely to develop AF within 40 weeks, while patients\nbelonging to the minimal-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF\ncase being less than or equal to 0.1) have more than 85% chance of remaining AF\nfree up until after seven years.\n  Conclusion: We developed and validated a model for AF risk prediction.

To\nachieve high accuracy predictions for black-box VMs, the proposed method first\nidentifies the running application inside the virtual machine. It then selects\nhighly-correlated runtime metrics as the input of the machine learning approach\nto accurately predict the performance level of the cloud application.\nExperimental results with state-of-the-art cloud benchmarks demonstrate that\nour proposed method outperforms the existing prediction methods by more than 2x\nin terms of worst prediction error.

Therefore, we employ the leading angle of the footprints\nto calculate expected travel times of Alfven waves and carry out an inversion\nof the observations. For the magnetic field we use the JRM33 magnetic field\nmodel. The inversion results show peak densities between 1830 and 2032\nparticles per cubic centimenter and scale heights between 0.92 and 0.97 Jupiter\nradii consistent with current literature values. Using a warped multipole\ncentrifugal equator instead of a planar dipole increases the quality of the fit\nby about twenty-five percent. We additionally develop two tests to confirm that\nthe multipole centrifugal equator from the JRM33 model fits explains the\napplied data set better than the dipole centrifugal equator.

            "summary": "The statistics of thermal gas pressure are a new and promising probe of\ncosmology and astrophysics. The large-scale cross-correlation between galaxies\nand the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect gives the bias-weighted mean electron\npressure, $\\langle b_\\mathrm{h}P_e\\rangle$. In this paper, we show that\n$\\langle b_\\mathrm{h}P_e\\rangle$ is sensitive to the amplitude of fluctuations\nin matter density, for example $\\langle b_\\mathrm{h}P_e\\rangle\\propto\n\\left(\\sigma_8\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}^{0.81}h^{0.67}\\right)^{3.14}$ at redshift\n$z=0$. We find that at $z<0.5$ the observed $\\langle b_\\mathrm{h}P_e\\rangle$ is\nsmaller than that predicted by the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations\nof galaxy formation, MillenniumTNG, by a factor of $0.93$. This can be\nexplained by a lower value of $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$, similar to\nthe so-called \"$S_8$ tension'' seen in the gravitational lensing effect,\nalthough the influence of astrophysics cannot be completely excluded. The\ndifference between Magneticum and MillenniumTNG at $z<2$ is small, indicating\nthat the difference in the galaxy formation models used by these simulations\nhas little impact on $\\langle b_\\mathrm{h}P_e\\rangle$ at this redshift range.\nAt higher $z$, we find that both simulations are in a modest tension with the\nexisting upper bounds on $\\langle b_\\mathrm{h}P_e\\rangle$. We also find a\nsignificant difference between these simulations there, which we attribute to a\nlarger sensitivity to the galaxy formation models in the high redshift regime.\nTherefore, more precise measurements of $\\langle b_\\mathrm{h}P_e\\rangle$ at all\nredshifts will provide a new test of our understanding of cosmology and galaxy\nformation.",

To address these challenges, Bayesian\nneural networks (BNNs) have emerged as a compelling extension of conventional\nneural networks, integrating uncertainty estimation into their predictive\ncapabilities.\n  This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the\nfundamental concepts of neural networks and Bayesian inference, elucidating\ntheir synergistic integration for the development of BNNs. The target audience\ncomprises statisticians with a potential background in Bayesian methods but\nlacking deep learning expertise, as well as machine learners proficient in deep\nneural networks but with limited exposure to Bayesian statistics. We provide an\noverview of commonly employed priors, examining their impact on model behavior\nand performance. Additionally, we delve into the practical considerations\nassociated with training and inference in BNNs.\n  Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research,\nacknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering\ninsights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips\nresearchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also\nilluminates the potential applications of this dynamic field.

To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel 3D structure-based molecular modeling method named 3D-Mol.\nIn order to accurately represent complete spatial structure, we design a novel\nencoder to extract 3D features by deconstructing the molecules into three\ngeometric graphs. In addition, we use 20M unlabeled data to pretrain our model\nby contrastive learning. We consider conformations with the same topological\nstructure as positive pairs and the opposites as negative pairs, while the\nweight is determined by the dissimilarity between the conformations.

            "summary": "The use of audio and visual modality for speaker localization has been well\nstudied in the literature by exploiting their complementary characteristics.\nHowever, most previous works employ the setting of static sensors mounted at\nfixed positions. Unlike them, in this work, we explore the ego-centric setting,\nwhere the heterogeneous sensors are embodied and could be moving with a human\nto facilitate speaker localization. Compared to the static scenario, the\nego-centric setting is more realistic for smart-home applications e.g., a\nservice robot. However, this also brings new challenges such as blurred images,\nfrequent speaker disappearance from the field of view of the wearer, and\nocclusions. In this paper, we study egocentric audio-visual speaker DOA\nestimation and deal with the challenges mentioned above. Specifically, we\npropose a transformer-based audio-visual fusion method to estimate the relative\nDOA of the speaker to the wearer, and design a training strategy to mitigate\nthe problem of the speaker disappearing from the camera's view. We also develop\na new dataset for simulating the out-of-view scenarios, by creating a scene\nwith a camera wearer walking around while a speaker is moving at the same time.\nThe experimental results show that our proposed method offers promising\nperformance in this new dataset in terms of tracking accuracy. Finally, we\nadapt the proposed method for the multi-speaker scenario. Experiments on\nEasyCom show the effectiveness of the proposed model for multiple speakers in\nreal scenarios, which achieves state-of-the-art results in the sphere active\nspeaker detection task and the wearer activity prediction task.

However, the difficulty in\naccurately predicting the dynamic strategies of diverse self-interested\nhouseholds presents a challenge for governments to implement effective tax\npolicies. Given its proficiency in modeling other agents in partially\nobservable environments and adaptively learning to find optimal policies,\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is highly suitable for solving\ndynamic games between the government and numerous households. Although MARL\nshows more potential than traditional methods such as the genetic algorithm and\ndynamic programming, there is a lack of large-scale multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning economic simulators. Therefore, we propose a MARL environment, named\n\\textbf{TaxAI}, for dynamic games involving $N$ households, government, firms,\nand financial intermediaries based on the Bewley-Aiyagari economic model. Our\nstudy benchmarks 2 traditional economic methods with 7 MARL methods on TaxAI,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of MARL algorithms. Moreover,\nTaxAI's scalability in simulating dynamic interactions between the government\nand 10,000 households, coupled with real-data calibration, grants it a\nsubstantial improvement in scale and reality over existing simulators.\nTherefore, TaxAI is the most realistic economic simulator, which aims to\ngenerate feasible recommendations for governments and individuals.",

However, when applying them to the highly specialized, safe-critical\nlegal domain, it is unclear how much legal knowledge they possess and whether\nthey can reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose\na comprehensive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulously\ncrafted to have precise assessment of the LLMs' legal capabilities from three\ncognitive levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorize\nneeded legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding:\nwhether LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legal\ntext; (3) Legal knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize their\nlegal knowledge and make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legal\ntasks. LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label\nclassification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extraction\nand generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench,\nincluding 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific\nLLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legal\ndomain, surpassing the others by a significant margin. While fine-tuning LLMs\non legal specific text brings certain improvements, we are still a long way\nfrom obtaining usable and reliable LLMs in legal tasks. All data, model\npredictions and evaluation code are released in\nhttps://github.com/open-compass/LawBench/.

During inference, the\nsimilarity score between any two audio samples is computed through Euclidean\ndistance of their embeddings. NOMAD is fully unsupervised and can be used in\ngeneral perceptual audio tasks for audio analysis e.g. quality assessment and\ngenerative tasks such as speech enhancement and speech synthesis. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated with 3 tasks. Ranking degradation intensity, predicting\nspeech quality, and as a loss function for speech enhancement. Results indicate\nNOMAD outperforms other non-matching reference approaches in both ranking\ndegradation intensity and quality assessment, exhibiting competitive\nperformance with full-reference audio metrics.

            "summary": "5G introduced modularized network functions (NFs) to support emerging\nservices in a more flexible and elastic manner. To mitigate the complexity in\nsuch modularized NF management, automated network operation and management are\nindispensable, and thus the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) has\nintroduced a network data analytics function (NWDAF). However, a conventional\nNWDAF needs to conduct both inference and training tasks, and thus it is\ndifficult to provide the analytics results to NFs in a timely manner for an\nincreased number of analytics requests. In this article, we propose a\nhierarchical network data analytics framework (H-NDAF) where inference tasks\nare distributed to multiple leaf NWDAFs and training tasks are conducted at the\nroot NWDAF. Extensive simulation results using open-source software (i.e.,\nfree5GC) demonstrate that H-NDAF can provide sufficiently accurate analytics\nand faster analytics provision time compared to the conventional NWDAF.",

            "summary": "Most audio tagging models are trained with one-hot labels as supervised\ninformation. However, one-hot labels treat all sound events equally, ignoring\nthe semantic hierarchy and proximity relationships between sound events. In\ncontrast, the event descriptions contains richer information, describing the\ndistance between different sound events with semantic proximity. In this paper,\nwe explore the impact of training audio tagging models with auxiliary text\ndescriptions of sound events. By aligning the audio features with the text\nfeatures of corresponding labels, we inject the hierarchy and proximity\ninformation of sound events into audio encoders, improving the performance\nwhile making the prediction more consistent with human perception. We refer to\nthis approach as Semantic Proximity Alignment (SPA). We use Ontology-aware mean\nAverage Precision (OmAP) as the main evaluation metric for the models. OmAP\nreweights the false positives based on Audioset ontology distance and is more\nconsistent with human perception compared to mAP. Experimental results show\nthat the audio tagging models trained with SPA achieve higher OmAP compared to\nmodels trained with one-hot labels solely (+1.8 OmAP). Human evaluations also\ndemonstrate that the predictions of SPA models are more consistent with human\nperception.",

Diabetic nephropathy, one of the chronic complication of\ndiabetes, adversely affects the kidneys, leading to kidney damage. Diagnosing\ndiabetic nephropathy involves considering various criteria, one of which is the\npresence of a pathologically significant quantity of albumin in urine, known as\nalbuminuria. Thus, early prediction of albuminuria in diabetic patients holds\nthe potential for timely preventive measures. This study aimed to develop a\nsupervised learning model to predict the risk of developing albuminuria in T2DM\npatients. The selected supervised learning algorithms included Na\\\"ive Bayes,\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost,\nand Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our private dataset, comprising 184 entries\nof diabetes complications risk factors, was used to train the algorithms. It\nconsisted of 10 attributes as features and 1 attribute as the target\n(albuminuria). Upon conducting the experiments, the MLP demonstrated superior\nperformance compared to the other algorithms. It achieved accuracy and f1-score\nvalues as high as 0.74 and 0.75, respectively, making it suitable for screening\npurposes in predicting albuminuria in T2DM.

            "summary": "Twitter is currently one of the biggest social media platforms. Its users may\nshare, read, and engage with short posts called tweets. For the ACM Recommender\nSystems Conference 2020, Twitter published a dataset around 70 GB in size for\nthe annual RecSys Challenge. In 2020, the RecSys Challenge invited\nparticipating teams to create models that would predict engagement likelihoods\nfor given user-tweet combinations. The submitted models predicting like, reply,\nretweet, and quote engagements were evaluated based on two metrics: area under\nthe precision-recall curve (PRAUC) and relative cross-entropy (RCE).\n  In this diploma thesis, we used the RecSys 2020 Challenge dataset and\nevaluation procedure to investigate how well context alone may be used to\npredict tweet engagement likelihood. In doing so, we employed the Spark engine\non TU Wien's Little Big Data Cluster to create scalable data preprocessing,\nfeature engineering, feature selection, and machine learning pipelines. We\nmanually created just under 200 additional features to describe tweet context.\n  The results indicate that features describing users' prior engagement history\nand the popularity of hashtags and links in the tweet were the most\ninformative. We also found that factors such as the prediction algorithm,\ntraining dataset size, training dataset sampling method, and feature selection\nsignificantly affect the results. After comparing the best results of our\ncontext-only prediction models with content-only models and with models\ndeveloped by the Challenge winners, we identified that the context-based models\nunderperformed in terms of the RCE score. This work thus concludes by situating\nthis discrepancy and proposing potential improvements to our implementation,\nwhich is shared in a public git repository.",

Our bound applies to noise channels that are tensor products\nof one-mode beamsplitters with arbitrary environment states, capturing, in\nparticular, photon loss occurring independently in each mode. It shows that for\nloss rates above a threshold given explicitly as a function of the locality of\nthe recovery maps, encoded information is lost at an exponential rate. This\nextends an early result by Razborov from discrete to continuous variable (CV)\nquantum systems.\n  To prove our result, we study a metric on bosonic states akin to the\nWasserstein distance between two CV density functions, which we call the\nbosonic Wasserstein distance. It can be thought of as a CV extension of a\nquantum Wasserstein distance of order 1 recently introduced by De Palma et al.\nin the context of qudit systems, in the sense that it captures the notion of\nlocality in a CV setting. We establish several basic properties, including a\nrelation to the trace distance and diameter bounds for states with finite\naverage photon number. We then study its contraction properties under quantum\nchannels, including tensorization, locality and strict contraction under\nbeamsplitter-type noise channels. Due to the simplicity of its formulation, and\nthe established wide applicability of its finite-dimensional counterpart, we\nbelieve that the bosonic Wasserstein distance will become a versatile tool in\nthe study of CV quantum systems.",

In\nreal-world scenarios, humans frequently interact with the environment and\nmanipulate various objects to complete daily tasks. In this work, we study the\nproblem of full-body human motion synthesis for the manipulation of large-sized\nobjects. We propose Object MOtion guided human MOtion synthesis (OMOMO), a\nconditional diffusion framework that can generate full-body manipulation\nbehaviors from only the object motion. Since naively applying diffusion models\nfails to precisely enforce contact constraints between the hands and the\nobject, OMOMO learns two separate denoising processes to first predict hand\npositions from object motion and subsequently synthesize full-body poses based\non the predicted hand positions. By employing the hand positions as an\nintermediate representation between the two denoising processes, we can\nexplicitly enforce contact constraints, resulting in more physically plausible\nmanipulation motions. With the learned model, we develop a novel system that\ncaptures full-body human manipulation motions by simply attaching a smartphone\nto the object being manipulated. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed pipeline and its ability to generalize to\nunseen objects. Additionally, as high-quality human-object interaction datasets\nare scarce, we collect a large-scale dataset consisting of 3D object geometry,\nobject motion, and human motion. Our dataset contains human-object interaction\nmotion for 15 objects, with a total duration of approximately 10 hours.",

            "summary": "Reading and interpreting chest X-ray images is one of the most radiologist's\nroutines. However, it still can be challenging, even for the most experienced\nones. Therefore, we proposed a multi-model deep learning-based automated chest\nX-ray report generator system designed to assist radiologists in their work.\nThe basic idea of the proposed system is by utilizing multi\nbinary-classification models for detecting multi abnormalities, with each model\nresponsible for detecting one abnormality, in a single image. In this study, we\nlimited the radiology abnormalities detection to only cardiomegaly, lung\neffusion, and consolidation. The system generates a radiology report by\nperforming the following three steps: image pre-processing, utilizing deep\nlearning models to detect abnormalities, and producing a report. The aim of the\nimage pre-processing step is to standardize the input by scaling it to 128x128\npixels and slicing it into three segments, which covers the upper, lower, and\nmiddle parts of the lung. After pre-processing, each corresponding model\nclassifies the image, resulting in a 0 (zero) for no abnormality detected and a\n1 (one) for the presence of an abnormality. The prediction outputs of each\nmodel are then concatenated to form a 'result code'. The 'result code' is used\nto construct a report by selecting the appropriate pre-determined sentence for\neach detected abnormality in the report generation step. The proposed system is\nexpected to reduce the workload of radiologists and increase the accuracy of\nchest X-ray diagnosis.",

            "summary": "Diverse explainability methods of graph neural networks (GNN) have recently\nbeen developed to highlight the edges and nodes in the graph that contribute\nthe most to the model predictions. However, it is not clear yet how to evaluate\nthe correctness of those explanations, whether it is from a human or a model\nperspective. One unaddressed bottleneck in the current evaluation procedure is\nthe problem of out-of-distribution explanations, whose distribution differs\nfrom those of the training data. This important issue affects existing\nevaluation metrics such as the popular faithfulness or fidelity score. In this\npaper, we show the limitations of faithfulness metrics. We propose GInX-Eval\n(Graph In-distribution eXplanation Evaluation), an evaluation procedure of\ngraph explanations that overcomes the pitfalls of faithfulness and offers new\ninsights on explainability methods. Using a fine-tuning strategy, the GInX\nscore measures how informative removed edges are for the model and the EdgeRank\nscore evaluates if explanatory edges are correctly ordered by their importance.\nGInX-Eval verifies if ground-truth explanations are instructive to the GNN\nmodel. In addition, it shows that many popular methods, including\ngradient-based methods, produce explanations that are not better than a random\ndesignation of edges as important subgraphs, challenging the findings of\ncurrent works in the area. Results with GInX-Eval are consistent across\nmultiple datasets and align with human evaluation.",

To answer this pressing\nneed, we propose an extensive reproducible benchmark to compare different\nmethods across a suite of tests including both near and far OODs.

We\nconsider a wide array of density-based methods and SOTA post-hoc detectors\nacross diverse predictive architectures, including MLP, ResNet, and\nTransformer. Our findings show that i) the problem appears to be solved for\nfar-OODs, but remains open for near-OODs; ii) post-hoc methods alone perform\npoorly, but improve substantially when coupled with distance-based mechanisms;\niii) the transformer architecture is far less overconfident compared to MLP and\nResNet.",

The study revealed the Cu doping induces a chemical\npressure, resulting in a structural contraction of one-dimensional Cu-O-Cu\natomic column. This unique structure promotes a one-dimensional electronic\nconduction channel along the c-axis mediated by the O atoms, which may be\nrelated to superconductivity. These O atoms occupy 1/4 of the equivalent\npositions along the c-axis and exhibit a low diffusion activation energy of 0.8\neV, indicating the possibility of diffusion between these equivalent positions.\nHere, using machine-learning based deep potential, we predict the\npressure-induced fast diffusion of 1/4-occupied O atoms along the\none-dimensional channel in Pb10(PO4)6O at 500 K, while the frameworks of Pb\ntriangles and PO4 tetrahedrons remain stable. The calculation results also\nindicate Cu doping can provide appropriate effective chemical pressure,\nindicating the one-dimensional ion diffusion channel may appear in\nPb9Cu(PO4)6O, even at ambient pressure.

In this paper, a novel diffusision generative\nadversarial network-based fMRI-to-SC (DiffGAN-F2S) model is proposed to predict\nSC from brain fMRI in an end-to-end manner. To be specific, the proposed\nDiffGAN-F2S leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and\nadversarial learning to efficiently generate high-fidelity SC through a few\nsteps from fMRI. By designing the dual-channel multi-head spatial attention\n(DMSA) and graph convolutional modules, the symmetric graph generator first\ncaptures global relations among direct and indirect connected brain regions,\nthen models the local brain region interactions. It can uncover the complex\nmapping relations between fMRI and structural connectivity. Furthermore, the\nspatially connected consistency loss is devised to constrain the generator to\npreserve global-local topological information for accurate intrinsic SC\nprediction. Testing on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\n(ADNI) dataset, the proposed model can effectively generate empirical\nSC-preserved connectivity from four-dimensional imaging data and shows superior\nperformance in SC prediction compared with other related models.

Unlike the\nexisting human mesh recovery problem, Cloth2Body needs to address new and\nemerging challenges raised by the partial observation of the input and the high\ndiversity of the output. Indeed, there are three specific challenges. First,\nhow to locate and pose human bodies into the clothes. Second, how to\neffectively estimate body shapes out of various clothing types. Finally, how to\ngenerate diverse and plausible results from a 2D clothing image. To this end,\nwe propose an end-to-end framework that can accurately estimate 3D body mesh\nparameterized by pose and shape from a 2D clothing image. Along this line, we\nfirst utilize Kinematics-aware Pose Estimation to estimate body pose\nparameters. 3D skeleton is employed as a proxy followed by an inverse\nkinematics module to boost the estimation accuracy. We additionally design an\nadaptive depth trick to align the re-projected 3D mesh better with 2D clothing\nimage by disentangling the effects of object size and camera extrinsic. Next,\nwe propose Physics-informed Shape Estimation to estimate body shape parameters.\n3D shape parameters are predicted based on partial body measurements estimated\nfrom RGB image, which not only improves pixel-wise human-cloth alignment, but\nalso enables flexible user editing. Finally, we design Evolution-based pose\ngeneration method, a skeleton transplanting method inspired by genetic\nalgorithms to generate diverse reasonable poses during inference. As shown by\nexperimental results on both synthetic and real-world data, the proposed\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance and can effectively recover\nnatural and diverse 3D body meshes from 2D images that align well with\nclothing.",

            "summary": "Assessing the costs of climate change is essential to finding efficient\npathways for the transition to a net-zero emissions economy, which is necessary\nto stabilise global temperatures at any level. In evaluating the benefits and\ncosts of climate change mitigation, the discount rate converting future damages\nand costs into net-present values influences the timing of mitigation.\n  Here, we amend the DICE model with a stochastic interest rate model to\nconsider the uncertainty of discount rates in the future. Since abatement\nreduces future damages, changing interest rates renders abatement investments\nmore or less beneficial. Stochastic interest rates will hence lead to a\nstochastic abatement strategy.\n  We introduce a simple stochastic abatement model and show that this can\nincrease intergenerational inequality concerning cost and risk.\n  Analysing the sensitivities of the model calibration analytically and\nnumerically exhibits that intergenerational inequality is a consequence of the\nDICE model calibration (and maybe that of IAMs in general).\n  We then show that introducing funding of abatement costs reduces the\nvariation of future cash-flows, which occur at different times but are\noff-setting in their net-present value. This effect can be interpreted as\nimproving intergenerational effort sharing, which might be neglected in\nclassical optimisation. This mechanism is amplified, including dependence of\nthe interest rate risk on the amount of debt to be financed, i.e. considering\nthe limited capacity of funding sources. As an alternative policy optimisation\nmethod, we propose limiting the total cost of damages and abatement below a\nfixed level relative to GDP - this modification induces equality between\ngenerations compared to their respective economic welfare, inducing early and\nfast mitigation of climate change to keep the total cost of climate change\nbelow 3% of global GDP.",

The virtue of a 1-D algorithm is that it is fast and can be\nincorporated into higher-level analysis routines and workflows, for example to\nscan parameters and conduct uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, working through\nthe 1-D algorithm exposes the fundamental importance of boundary conditions and\nthe initial proton fluence profile for an accurate reconstruction.

The images of such linear maps are called\nthe testing regions of the corresponding model or measurement. Testing regions\nare notoriously impractical to treat analytically in the quantum case. Our\nfirst result is to provide an implicit outer approximation of the testing\nregion of any given quantum statistical model or measurement in any finite\ndimension: namely, a region in probability space that contains the desired\nimage, but is defined implicitly, using a formula that depends only on the\ngiven model or measurement. The outer approximation that we construct is\nminimal among all such outer approximations, and close, in the sense that it\nbecomes the maximal inner approximation up to a constant scaling factor.\nFinally, we apply our approximation formulas to characterize, in a semi-device\nindependent way, the ability to transform one quantum statistical model or\nmeasurement into another.",

            "summary": "Machine learning (ML) based systems have been suffering a lack of\ninterpretability. To address this problem, counterfactual explanations (CEs)\nhave been proposed. CEs are unique as they provide workable suggestions to\nusers, in addition to explaining why a certain outcome was predicted. However,\nthe application of CEs has been hindered by two main challenges, namely general\nuser preferences and variable ML systems. User preferences, in particular, tend\nto be general rather than specific feature values. Additionally, CEs need to be\ncustomized to suit the variability of ML models, while also maintaining\nrobustness even when these validation models change. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose several possible general user preferences that have been\nvalidated by user research and map them to the properties of CEs. We also\nintroduce a new method called \\uline{T}ree-based \\uline{C}onditions\n\\uline{O}ptional \\uline{L}inks (T-COL), which has two optional structures and\nseveral groups of conditions for generating CEs that can be adapted to general\nuser preferences. Meanwhile, a group of conditions lead T-COL to generate more\nrobust CEs that have higher validity when the ML model is replaced. We compared\nthe properties of CEs generated by T-COL experimentally under different user\npreferences and demonstrated that T-COL is better suited for accommodating user\npreferences and variable ML systems compared to baseline methods including\nLarge Language Models.",

Mask4D is the first\ntransformer-based approach unifying semantic instance segmentation and tracking\nof sparse and irregular sequences of 3D point clouds into a single joint model.\nOur model directly predicts semantic instances and their temporal associations\nwithout relying on any hand-crafted non-learned association strategies such as\nprobabilistic clustering or voting-based center prediction. Instead, Mask4D\nintroduces spatio-temporal instance queries which encode the semantic and\ngeometric properties of each semantic tracklet in the sequence. In an in-depth\nstudy, we find that it is critical to promote spatially compact instance\npredictions as spatio-temporal instance queries tend to merge multiple\nsemantically similar instances, even if they are spatially distant. To this\nend, we regress 6-DOF bounding box parameters from spatio-temporal instance\nqueries, which is used as an auxiliary task to foster spatially compact\npredictions.

While existing methods often focus on one\naspect of the image without considering how to pay attention to this balance,\nwhich will cause problems of color distortion and overexposure etc. This\nseriously affects both human visual perception and the performance of\nhigh-level visual models. In this work, a novel synergistic structure is\nproposed which can balance brightness, color, and illumination more\neffectively. Specifically, the proposed method, so-called Joint Correcting and\nRefinement Network (JCRNet), which mainly consists of three stages to balance\nbrightness, color, and illumination of enhancement. Stage 1: we utilize a basic\nencoder-decoder and local supervision mechanism to extract local information\nand more comprehensive details for enhancement. Stage 2: cross-stage feature\ntransmission and spatial feature transformation further facilitate color\ncorrection and feature refinement. Stage 3: we employ a dynamic illumination\nadjustment approach to embed residuals between predicted and ground truth\nimages into the model, adaptively adjusting illumination balance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits comprehensive\nperformance advantages over 21 state-of-the-art methods on 9 benchmark\ndatasets. Furthermore, a more persuasive experiment has been conducted to\nvalidate our approach the effectiveness in downstream visual tasks (e.g.,\nsaliency detection).

The standard finite-temperature\napproach would be to first solve the problem in the Matsubara representation\nand then apply numerical analytic continuation to the real-frequency axis to\nlink theoretical results with experimental probes, but this ill-conditioned\nprocedure often distorts important spectral features even for very accurate\nimaginary-frequency data. We demonstrate that the ladder-type\nfinite-temperature Bethe-Salpeter equation in the Hartree-Fock basis for the\n3-point vertex function and, ultimately, system's polarization can be\naccurately solved directly on the real frequency axis using the diagrammatic\nMonte Carlo technique and series resummation. We illustrate the method by\napplying it to the homogeneous electron gas model and demonstrate how multiple\nscattering events renormalize Landau damping.",

            "summary": "Robots with increasing autonomy progress our space exploration capabilities,\nparticularly for in-situ exploration and sampling to stand in for human\nexplorers. Currently, humans drive robots to meet scientific objectives, but\ndepending on the robot's location, the exchange of information and driving\ncommands between the human operator and robot may cause undue delays in mission\nfulfillment. An autonomous robot encoded with a scientific objective and an\nexploration strategy incurs no communication delays and can fulfill missions\nmore quickly. Active learning algorithms offer this capability of intelligent\nexploration, but the underlying model structure varies the performance of the\nactive learning algorithm in accurately forming an understanding of the\nenvironment. In this paper, we investigate the performance differences between\nactive learning algorithms driven by Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural\nnetworks for exploration strategies encoded on agents that are constrained in\ntheir trajectories, like planetary surface rovers. These two active learning\nstrategies were tested in a simulation environment against science-blind\nstrategies to predict the spatial distribution of a variable of interest along\nmultiple datasets. The performance metrics of interest are model accuracy in\nroot mean squared (RMS) error, training time, model convergence, total distance\ntraveled until convergence, and total samples until convergence. Active\nlearning strategies encoded with Gaussian processes require less computation to\ntrain, converge to an accurate model more quickly, and propose trajectories of\nshorter distance, except in a few complex environments in which Bayesian neural\nnetworks achieve a more accurate model in the large data regime due to their\nmore expressive functional bases. The paper concludes with advice on when and\nhow to implement either exploration strategy for future space missions.",

We present whenever\npossible the way in which inflation can be realized approximately via three\nslow roll Hubble parameters that depend on the standard slow roll parameters in\na very different form than in the usual case and that can be less restrictive.\nFurthermore we find a general analytical solution describing an expanding\nuniverse with constant Hubble parameter that generalizes the standard\ncosmological constant case by restricting the form of the modification of the\nHeisenberg algebra. It is found that even if such modification can be neglected\nin some limit and the cosmological constant is set to zero in that limit, the\nexponential expansion is present when the modification is important.

However, this task becomes notably challenging when the leader\nlacks complete knowledge of the follower's decision-making model.

To\nthis end, we develop a Stackelberg game-theoretic approach based on Koopman\noperator to address the challenge. We first formulate the guided trajectory\nplanning problem through the lens of a dynamic Stackelberg game. We then\nleverage Koopman operator theory to acquire a learning-based linear system\nmodel that approximates the follower's feedback dynamics. Based on this learned\nmodel, the leader devises a collision-free trajectory to guide the follower,\nemploying receding horizon planning. We use simulations to elaborate the\neffectiveness of our approach in generating learning models that accurately\npredict the follower's multi-step behavior when compared to alternative\nlearning techniques.

The extensive applications include ones in\ncondensed matter and solid state physics, chemical physics, electrochemistry,\nbiochemistry, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and materials science,\namong others. In this paper we study the complex analytic properties of\nsemi-linear elliptic Partial Differential Equations with respect to random\nfluctuations on the domain. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of the\nnPBE on a bounded domain in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This proof relies on the\napplication of a contraction mapping reasoning, as the standard convex\noptimization argument for the deterministic nPBE no longer applies. Using the\nexistence and uniqueness result we subsequently show that solution to the nPBE\nadmits an analytic extension onto a well defined region in the complex\nhyperplane with respect to the number of stochastic variables. Due to the\nanalytic extension, stochastic collocation theory for sparse grids predict\nalgebraic to sub-exponential convergence rates with respect to the number of\nknots. A series of numerical experiments with sparse grids is consistent with\nthis prediction and the analyticity result.

            "summary": "Noise robustness is a key aspect of successful speech applications. Speech\nenhancement (SE) has been investigated to improve automatic speech recognition\naccuracy; however, its effectiveness for keyword spotting (KWS) is still\nunder-investigated. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on\nsingle-channel speech enhancement for keyword spotting on the Google Speech\nCommand (GSC) dataset. To investigate robustness to noise, the GSC dataset is\naugmented with noise signals from the WSJ0 Hipster Ambient Mixtures (WHAM!)\nnoise dataset. Our investigation includes not only applying SE before KWS but\nalso performing joint training of the SE frontend and KWS backend models.\nMoreover, we explore audio injection, a common approach to reduce distortions\nby using a weighted average of the enhanced and original signals. Audio\ninjection is then further optimized by using another model that predicts the\nweight for each utterance. Our investigation reveals that SE can improve KWS\naccuracy on noisy speech when the backend model is trained on clean speech;\nhowever, despite our extensive exploration, it is difficult to improve the KWS\naccuracy with SE when the backend is trained on noisy speech.",

In this article, we predict the\nelectronic properties of 17 recently predicted ground states of\nB$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N in the $x=0-1$ range using first-principles density\nfunctional theory and many-body perturbation theory within $GW$ approximation.\nAll the B$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N structures are found to be UWBG materials and have\nband gaps that vary linearly from that of wurtzite-phase (\\emph{w}) AlN (6.19\neV) to that of \\emph{w}-BN (7.47 eV). The bandstructures of B$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N\nshow that a direct-to-indirect bandgap crossover occurs near $x = 0.25$.\nFurthermore, we find that B$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N alloys have much larger dielectric\nconstants than the constituent bulk materials (AlN=$9.3~\\varepsilon_0$ or\nBN=$7.3~\\varepsilon_0$), with values reaching as high as $12.1~\\varepsilon_0$.\nThese alloys are found to exhibit large dielectric breakdown fields in the\nrange 9--35 MV/cm with a linear dependence on $x$.

The nanoscale nature of the nanodevices and the challenging\nenvironment that the bloodstream represents, result in current flow-guided\nlocalization approaches being constrained in their communication and\nenergy-related capabilities. The communication and energy constraints of the\nnanodevices result in different features of raw data for flow-guided\nlocalization, in turn affecting its performance. An analytical modeling of the\neffects of imperfect communication and constrained energy causing intermittent\noperation of the nanodevices on the raw data produced by the nanodevices would\nbe beneficial. Hence, we propose an analytical model of raw data for\nflow-guided localization, where the raw data is modeled as a function of\ncommunication and energy-related capabilities of the nanodevice. We evaluate\nthe model by comparing its output with the one obtained through the utilization\nof a simulator for objective evaluation of flow-guided localization, featuring\ncomparably higher level of realism. Our results across a number of scenarios\nand heterogeneous performance metrics indicate high similarity between the\nmodel and simulator-generated raw datasets.",

The approach involves path planning, trajectory refinement\nthrough the solution of a quadratic program, and real-time selection of optimal\ntrajectories. The paper highlights three technical innovations: a\nraytracing-based path-to-trajectory refinement, the integration of this\ntechnique with a multi-path planner to overcome difficulties due to local\nminima, and a method to achieve timescale separation in trajectory\noptimization.

Moreover, there are no\nyet established methods to streamline inference of the biochemical composition\nfrom the optical spectrum for real-time applications such as surgical\nmonitoring. In this paper, we develop a technique for fast inference of changes\nin the molecular composition of brain tissue. We base our method on the\nBeer-Lambert law to analytically connect the spectra with concentrations and\nuse a deep-learning approach to significantly speed up the concentration\ninference compared to traditional optimization methods.

They\naim to learn an energy-based model by predicting the latent representation of a\ntarget signal $y$ from a context signal $x$. JEPAs bypass the need for data\naugmentation and negative samples, which are typically required by contrastive\nlearning, while avoiding the overfitting issues associated with\ngenerative-based pretraining. In this paper, we show that graph-level\nrepresentations can be effectively modeled using this paradigm and propose\nGraph-JEPA, the first JEPA for the graph domain. In particular, we employ\nmasked modeling to learn embeddings for different subgraphs of the input graph.\nTo endow the representations with the implicit hierarchy that is often present\nin graph-level concepts, we devise an alternative training objective that\nconsists of predicting the coordinates of the encoded subgraphs on the unit\nhyperbola in the 2D plane. Extensive validation shows that Graph-JEPA can learn\nrepresentations that are expressive and competitive in both graph\nclassification and regression problems.",

We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this method by comparing the inferred rotation response to an\nexperimental measurement of the rotation response. Our results show that\nexperiments relying on zero-frequency calibration of the comagnetometer\nresponse can over- or under-estimate the comagnetometer sensitivity by orders\nof magnitude over a wide frequency range. Moreover, this discrepancy\naccumulates over time as operational parameters tend to drift during\ncomagnetometer operation.

Three key factors drive these changes. First, the LMC--analog\nbrings in many subhalos, increasing encounter rates for streams near the\nmassive satellite by up to 20--40%. Second, the LMC--analog displaces the host\nfrom its center-of-mass (inducing reflex motion), causing a north-south\nasymmetry in the density and radial velocity distribution of subhalos. This\nasymmetry results in encounter rates varying by 50--70% across the sky at the\nsame distance. Finally, the LMC--mass satellite induces a density wake in the\nhost's DM halo, further boosting the encounter rates near the LMC--analog. We\nalso explore the influence of stream orbital properties, finding a 50% increase\nin encounters for streams moving retrograde to the LMC--analog's orbit in the\nopposite hemisphere. The dependence of encounter rates on stream location and\norbit has important implications for where to search for new streams with spurs\nand gaps in the Milky Way.",

In recent developments, significant current-induced torques have been\npredicted and observed in material systems featuring interfaces with light\nelements \\textit{i.e.} possessing a weak SOI. These findings challenge existing\nmechanisms and point to the potential involvement of the orbital counterpart of\nelectrons, namely the orbital Hall and orbital Rashba effects. Here, we\nestablish, in Pt|Co|Cu|AlOx stacking, the comparable strength between the\norbital Rashba effect at the Cu|AlOx interface and the effective spin Hall\neffect in Pt|Co. Subsequently, we investigate the thickness dependence of an\nintermediate Pt layer in Co|Pt|Cu|CuOx, revealing the strong signature of the\norbital Rashba effect at the Cu|CuOx interface besides the well-identified Pt\nintrinsic spin Hall effect. Leveraging such contribution from the orbital\nRashba effect, we show a twofold enhancement in the effective torques on Co\nthrough harmonic Hall measurements. This result is corroborated by\ncomplementary spin Hall magneto-resistance and THz spectroscopy experiments.\nOur results unveil unexplored aspects of the electron's orbital degree of\nfreedom, offering an alternative avenue for magnetization manipulation in\nspintronic devices with potential implications for energy-efficient and\nenvironmentally friendly technologies using abundant and light elements.",

Here we investigate a large sample of type 1 AGN with\nnear-infrared (near-IR) cross-dispersed spectroscopy with the aim to constrain\nthe astrochemistry, location and geometry of the nuclear hot dust region.\nAssuming thermal equilibrium for optically thin dust, we derive the\nluminosity-based dust radius for different grain properties using our\nmeasurement of the temperature. We combine our results with independent dust\nradius measurements from reverberation mapping and interferometry and show that\nlarge dust grains that can provide the necessary opacity for the outflow are\nubiquitous in AGN. Using our estimates of the dust covering factor, we\ninvestigate the dust geometry using the effects of the accretion disk\nanisotropy. A flared disk-like structure for the hot dust is favoured.

            "summary": "It is well known that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host\ngalaxies co-evolve. AGN feedback plays an important role on this symbiosis. To\nstudy the effect of the AGN feedback on the host galaxy, a popular method is to\nstudy the star-formation rate (SFR) as a function of the X-ray luminosity\n(L$_X$). However, hydrodynamical simulations suggest that the cumulative impact\nof AGN feedback on a galaxy is encapsulated in the mass of the SMBH, M$_{BH}$,\nrather than the L$_X$. In this study, we compare the SFR of AGN and non-AGN\ngalaxies as a function of L$_X$, M$_{BH}$, Eddington ratio (n$_{Edd}$) and\nspecific black hole accretion rate ($\\lambda _{sBHAR}$). For that purpose, we\nuse 122 X-ray AGN in the XMM-XXL field and 3371 galaxies from the VIPERS survey\nand calculate the SFR$_{norm}$ parameter, defined as the ratio of the SFR of\nAGN to the SFR of non-AGN galaxies with similar stellar mass, M$_*$, and\nredshift. Our datasets span a redshift range of $\\rm 0.5\\leq z\\leq 1.2$. The\nresults show that the correlation between SFR$_{norm}$ and M$_{BH}$ is stronger\ncompared to that between SFR$_{norm}$ and L$_X$. A weaker correlation is found\nbetween SFR$_{norm}$ and $\\lambda _{sBHAR}$. No correlation is detected between\nSFR$_{norm}$ and n$_{Edd}$. These results corroborate the idea that the\nM$_{BH}$ is a more robust tracer of the cumulative impact of the AGN feedback\ncompared to the instantaneous accretion rate (L$_X$) and, thus, a better\npredictive parameter of the changes of the SFR of the host galaxy.",

A fraction of ULX sources\nshow X-ray pulses which are evidence for accreting neutron stars (NSs).\nTheoretical studies have suggested that NSs dominate the compact objects of\nintrinsic ULXs, even though the majority of observed sample is non-pulsating,\nimplying that X-ray pulses from many NS ULXs are unobservable. We use POSYDON\nto generate and study X-ray binary populations spanning starburst ages 5 to\n1000Myr. Following theoretical predictions for the alignment of the NS spin\naxis with the accretion disc, we estimate the required accreted mass in ULXs so\nthat the alignment suppresses observable X-ray pulses. While the properties of\nULXs are sensitive to model assumptions, there are certain trends that the\npopulations follow. Young and old stellar populations are dominated by BH and\nNS accretors, respectively. The donors go from massive H-rich main-sequence\n(MS) stars in young populations (<100Myr) to low-mass post-MS H-rich stars in\nolder populations (>100Myr), with stripped He-rich giant stars dominating the\npopulations at around 100Myr. In addition, we find that NS ULXs exhibit\nstronger geometrical beaming than BH ULXs, leading to an under-representation\nof NS accretors in observed populations. Coupled with our finding that X-ray\npulses are suppressed in at least 60% of the NS ULXs, we suggest that the\nobserved fraction of ULXs with detectable X-ray pulses is very small, in\nagreement with observations. This study investigates the effects of age on ULXs\nas well as the effects of different model assumptions on ULX demographics. We\nshow that geometrical beaming and the mass-accretion phase are critical aspects\nof understanding ULX observations. Our results suggest that even though most\nULXs have accreting NSs, those with observable X-ray pulses would be very few.",

            "summary": "In theoretical models of galaxy evolution, black hole feedback is a necessary\ningredient in order to explain the observed exponential decline in number\ndensity of massive galaxies. Most contemporary black hole feedback models in\ncosmological simulations rely on a constant radiative efficiency (usually $\\eta\n\\sim 0.1$) at all black hole accretion rates. We present a synthesis model for\nthe spin-dependent radiative efficiencies of three physical accretion rate\nregimes, i.e. $\\eta = \\eta(j, \\dot{M}_\\mathrm{BH})$, for use in large-volume\ncosmological simulations. The three regimes include: an advection dominated\naccretion flow ($\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{BH} < 0.03\\,\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{Edd}$), a\nquasar-like mode ($0.03 < \\dot{M}_\\mathrm{BH} / \\dot{M}_\\mathrm{Edd} < 0.3$),\nand a slim disc mode ($\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{BH} > 0.3\\,\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{Edd}$).\nAdditionally, we include a large-scale powerful jet at low accretion rates. The\nblack hole feedback model we present is a kinetic model that prescribes mass\nloadings but could be used in thermal models directly using the radiative\nefficiency. We implemented our model into the \\texttt{Simba} galaxy evolution\nmodel to determine if it is possible to reproduce galaxy populations\nsuccessfully, and provide a first calibration for further study. Using a\n$2\\times1024^3$ particle cosmological simulation in a $(150\\,\\mathrm{cMpc})^3$\nvolume, we found that the model is successful in reproducing the galaxy stellar\nmass function, black hole mass-stellar mass relationship, and stellar mass-halo\nmass relationship. Our model shines when we extrapolate to the galaxy group and\ncluster scale as it impressively predicts the observed baryon fraction within\nmassive groups and low-mass clusters. Moving forward, this model opens new\navenues for exploration of the impact of black hole feedback on galactic\nenvironments.",

            "summary": "Modelling galaxy formation in hydrodynamic simulations has increasingly\nadopted various radiative transfer methods to account for photoionization\nfeedback from young massive stars. However, the evolution of HII regions around\nstars begins in dense star-forming clouds and spans large dynamical ranges in\nboth space and time, posing severe challenges for numerical simulations in\nterms of both spatial and temporal resolution that depends strongly on gas\ndensity ($\\propto n^{-1}$). In this work, we perform a series of idealized HII\nregion simulations using the moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic code Arepo-RT\nto study the effects of numerical resolution. The simulated results match the\nanalytical solutions and the ionization feedback converges only if the\nStr\\\"omgren sphere is resolved by at least $10$--$100$ resolution elements and\nthe size of each time integration step is smaller than $0.1$ times the\nrecombination timescale. Insufficient spatial resolution leads to reduced\nionization fraction but enhanced ionized gas mass and momentum feedback from\nthe HII regions, as well as degrading the multi-phase interstellar medium into\na diffuse, partially ionized, warm ($\\sim8000$ K) gas. On the other hand,\ninsufficient temporal resolution strongly suppresses the effects of ionizing\nfeedback. This is because longer timesteps are not able to resolve the rapid\nvariation of the thermochemistry properties of the gas cells around massive\nstars, especially when the photon injection and thermochemistry are performed\nwith different cadences. Finally, we provide novel numerical implementations to\novercome the above issues when strict resolution requirements are not\nachievable in practice.",

            "summary": "Wide-field survery have recently detected recurring optical and X-ray sources\nnear galactic nuclei, with period spanning hours to years. These phenomena\ncould result from repeated partial tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) or by interaction between star and SMBH-accretion discs. We\nstudy the physical processes that produce period changes in such sources,\nhighlighting the key role of the interaction between the orbiting star and the\naccretion disc. We focus on ASASSN-14ko - a repeatedly flaring optical source\nwith a mean period $P_0 = 115 \\, \\rm d$ and a detected period decay $\\dot{P} =\n-2.6\\times 10^{-3}$ (Payne et al. 2022). We argue that the system's $\\dot{P}$\nis most compatible with true orbital decay produced by hydrodynamical drag as a\nstar passes through the accretion disc on an inclined orbit, twice per orbit.\nThe star is likely a sun-like star whose envelope is somewhat inflated,\npossibly due to tidal heating. Star-disc interaction inevitably leads to\ndrag-induced stripping of mass from the star, which may be the dominant\ncomponent in powering the observed flares. We discuss ASASSN-14ko's possible\nformation history and observational tests of our interpretation of the measured\n$\\dot P$. Our results imply that partial tidal disruption events manifesting as\nrepeating nuclear transients cannot be modeled without accounting for the\ncumulative impact of tidal heating over many orbits. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for other repeating transients, and predict that\nthe recurrence time of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions is expected to decay at a rate\nof order $|\\dot{P}| \\approx 10^{-6}-10^{-5}$.",

            "summary": "Since the discovery of superconductivity in cuprate materials, the minimal\ningredients for high-T$_c$ superconductivity have been an outstanding puzzle.\nMotivated by the recently discovered nickelate bilayer superconductor\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_3$ under pressure, we study a minimal bilayer model, in which,\nas in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_3$, inter- and intralayer magnetic interactions but no\ninterlayer hopping are present: a mixed-dimensional (mixD) $t-J$ model. In the\nsetting of a mixD ladder, we show that the system exhibits a crossover\nassociated with a Feshbach resonance: from a closed-channel dominated regime of\ntightly bound bosonic pairs of holes to an open-channel dominated regime of\nspatially more extended Cooper pairs. The crossover can be tuned by varying\ndoping, or by a nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V$ that we include in our\nmodel. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and\nanalytical descriptions of both regimes, we find that the ground state is a\nLuther-Emery liquid, competing with a density wave of tetraparton plaquettes at\ncommensurate filling $\\delta=0.5$ at large repulsion, and exhibits a pairing\ndome where binding is facilitated by doping. Our observations can be understood\nin terms of pairs of correlated spinon-chargon excitations constituting the\nopen channel, which are subject to attractive interactions mediated by the\nclosed channel of tightly bound chargon-chargon pairs. When the closed channel\nis lowered in energy by doping or tuning $V$, a Feshbach resonance is realized,\nassociated with a dome in the binding energy. Our predictions can be directly\ntested in state-of-the art quantum simulators, and we argue that the pairing\nmechanism we describe may be realized in the nickelate bilayer superconductor\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_3$.",

We develop a novel technique for distinguishing\nbetween long transients and asymptotic steady states via an energy minimisation\napproach. The technique involves first approximating our study equation using a\nlimiting process and a moment closure procedure. We then analyse local minimum\nenergy states of this approximate system, hypothesising that these will\ncorrespond to asymptotic patterns in the aggregation-diffusion equation.\nFinally, we verify our hypotheses through numerical investigation, showing that\nour approximate analytic technique gives good predictions as to whether a state\nis asymptotic or a long transient.

Furthermore, our approach\nsimplifies the incorporation of production-reactant atom mapping alignment by\nleveraging node alignment to determine a specific order for node generation and\ngenerating molecular graphs in an auto-regressive manner node-by-node. This\nmethod ensures that the node generation order coincides with the node order in\nthe input graph, overcoming the difficulty of determining a specific node\ngeneration order in an auto-regressive manner.

Moreover, for each point $p\\in M$, either the Ricci tensor\ndegenerates or else there is a foliation by totally geodesic flat 3-manifolds\nin a neighborhood of $p$. As a corollary, we show that if in addition the\nmetric is analytic, then the universal cover of $M$ has a nontrivial Euclidean\nde Rham factor. Finally we discuss how this result creates an implication of\nconjectures on simplicial volume in dimension four.",

By using a\ntheorem of C.Glanois, we proved that continuous multiple zeta values include\nall cyclotomic multiple zeta values of level 2. We will give a detail analysis\nabout the two different shuffle products. Furthermore, we will discuss the\nextension of the two different products, we proved a theorem about comparing\nthe two different shuffle product, this is an analogy of Ihara-Kaneko-Zagier's\ncomparison theorem in the case of continuous multiple zeta values.

To identify potential biomarkers for this condition,\nmulti-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data\nRepository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were\nemployed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA\nmethylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6J mouse\nsoleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on\nthe international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was\nintroduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either\nexperimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics\nfeatures. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to\nidentify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these\nmodels, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers\nrelated to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space.

We present a new model for the halo-[C II] connection,\nbuilding upon results from the FIRE simulations suggesting that gas mass and\nmetallicity most directly determine [C II] luminosity. Applying our new model\nto an ensemble of peak-patch halo lightcones, we generate new predictions for\nthe [C II] LIM signal at $z\\gtrsim6$. We expect a baseline 4000-hour LIM survey\nfrom the CCAT facility to have the fundamental sensitivity to detect the [C II]\npower spectrum at a significance of $4\\sigma$ at $z\\sim6$, with an extended or\nsuccessor Stage 2 experiment improving significance to $36\\sigma$ at $z\\sim6$\nand achieving $8\\sigma$ at $z\\sim7.5$. Cross-correlation through stacking,\nsimulated against a mock narrow-band Lyman-break galaxy survey, would yield a\nstrong detection of the radial profile of cosmological [C II] emission\nsurrounding star-forming galaxies. We also analyse the role of a few of our\nmodel's parameters through the pointwise relative entropy (PRE) of the\ndistribution of [C II] intensities. While the PRE signature of different model\nparameters can become degenerate or diminished after factoring in observational\ndistortions, various parameters do imprint themselves differently on the\none-point statistics of the intrinsic signal.

In our algorithm, we first\nextract the enclosing subgraph around a target link, and then employ a weighted\ngraph labeling algorithm to label the subgraph nodes. Next, we transform the\nsubgraph into a line graph and apply the graph convolution neural networks to\nlearn the node embedding in the line graph, which can represent the links in\nthe original subgraph. Finally, the link feature vectors are put into a\nfully-connected neural network to predict the weight of the target link. Our\nalgorithm directly obtain the feature vectors of the target links in the\noriginal graph, which is better than the previous methods that splice the node\nfeature vectors for link weight prediction.

In this work, we aim at characterising the SFH\nvariability of early galaxies as a function of their stellar mass and redshift.\nWe use the JADES public catalogue and derive the physical properties of the\ngalaxies as well as their SFH using the spectral energy distribution modelling\ncode CIGALE. To this aim, we implement a non-parametric SFH with a flat prior\nallowing for as much stochasticity as possible. We use the SFR gradient, an\nindicator of the movement of galaxies on the SFR-$M_\\ast$ plane, linked to the\nrecent SFH of galaxies. This dynamical approach of the relation between the SFR\nand stellar mass allows us to show that, at $z>9$, 87% of massive galaxies,\n($\\log(M_\\ast/M_\\odot)\\gtrsim$9), have SFR gradients consistent with a\nstochastic star-formation activity during the last 100 Myr, while this fraction\ndrops to 15% at $z<7$. On the other hand, we see an increasing fraction of\ngalaxies with a star-formation activity following a common stream on the\nSFR-$M_\\ast$ plane with cosmic time, indicating that a secular mode of\nstar-formation is emerging. We place our results in the context of the observed\nexcess of UV emission as probed by the UV luminosity function at $z\\gtrsim10$,\nby estimating $\\sigma_{UV}$, the dispersion of the UV absolute magnitude\ndistribution, to be of the order of 1.2mag and compare it with predictions from\nthe literature. In conclusion, we find a transition of star-formation mode\nhappening around $z\\sim9$: Galaxies with stochastic SFHs dominates at\n$z\\gtrsim9$, although this level of stochasticity is too low to reach those\ninvoked by recent models to reproduce the observed UV luminosity function.",

            "summary": "Recently, cosmography emerged as a valuable tool to effectively describe the\nvast amount of astrophysical observations without relying on a specific\ncosmological model. Its model-independent nature ensures a faithful\nrepresentation of data, free from theoretical biases. Indeed, the commonly\nassumed fiducial model, the $\\Lambda$CDM, shows some shortcomings and tensions\nbetween data at late and early times that need to be further investigated. In\nthis paper, we explore an extension of the standard cosmological model by\nadopting the $f(z)$CDM approach, where $f(z)$ represents the cosmographic\nseries characterizing the evolution of recent universe driven by dark energy.\nTo construct $f(z)$, we take into account the Pad\\'e series, since this\nrational polynomial approximation offers a better convergence at high redshifts\nthan the standard Taylor series expansion. Several orders of such an\napproximant have been proposed in previous works, here we want to answer the\nquestions: What is the impact of the cosmographic series choice on the\nparameter constraints? Which series is the best for the analysis? So, we\nanalyse the most promising ones by identifying which order is preferred in\nterms of stability and goodness of fit. Theoretical predictions of the\n$f(z)$CDM model are obtained by the Boltzmann solver code and the posterior\ndistributions of the cosmological and cosmographic parameters are constrained\nby a Monte Carlo Markov Chains analysis. We consider a joint data set of cosmic\nmicrowave background temperature measurements from the Planck collaboration,\ntype Ia supernovae data from the latest Pantheon+ sample, baryonic acoustic\noscillations and cosmic chronometers data. In conclusions, we state which\nseries can be used when only late time data are used, while which orders has to\nbe considered in order to achieve the necessary stability when large redshifts\nare considered.",

            "summary": "This paper deals with uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution\ndetection in deep learning using Bayesian and ensemble methods. It proposes a\npractical solution to the lack of prediction diversity observed recently for\nstandard approaches when used out-of-distribution (Ovadia et al., 2019; Liu et\nal., 2021). Considering that this issue is mainly related to a lack of weight\ndiversity, we claim that standard methods sample in \"over-restricted\" regions\nof the weight space due to the use of \"over-regularization\" processes, such as\nweight decay and zero-mean centered Gaussian priors. We propose to solve the\nproblem by adopting the maximum entropy principle for the weight distribution,\nwith the underlying idea to maximize the weight diversity. Under this paradigm,\nthe epistemic uncertainty is described by the weight distribution of maximal\nentropy that produces neural networks \"consistent\" with the training\nobservations. Considering stochastic neural networks, a practical optimization\nis derived to build such a distribution, defined as a trade-off between the\naverage empirical risk and the weight distribution entropy. We develop a novel\nweight parameterization for the stochastic model, based on the singular value\ndecomposition of the neural network's hidden representations, which enables a\nlarge increase of the weight entropy for a small empirical risk penalization.\nWe provide both theoretical and numerical results to assess the efficiency of\nthe approach. In particular, the proposed algorithm appears in the top three\nbest methods in all configurations of an extensive out-of-distribution\ndetection benchmark including more than thirty competitors.",

            "summary": "In the field of 3D scene understanding, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a new\nscene representation that combines geometric and semantic information about\nobjects and their relationships. However, learning semantic 3D scene graphs in\na fully supervised manner is inherently difficult as it requires not only\nobject-level annotations but also relationship labels. While pre-training\napproaches have helped to boost the performance of many methods in various\nfields, pre-training for 3D scene graph prediction has received little\nattention. Furthermore, we find in this paper that classical contrastive point\ncloud-based pre-training approaches are ineffective for 3D scene graph\nlearning. To this end, we present SGRec3D, a novel self-supervised pre-training\nmethod for 3D scene graph prediction. We propose to reconstruct the 3D input\nscene from a graph bottleneck as a pretext task. Pre-training SGRec3D does not\nrequire object relationship labels, making it possible to exploit large-scale\n3D scene understanding datasets, which were off-limits for 3D scene graph\nlearning before. Our experiments demonstrate that in contrast to recent point\ncloud-based pre-training approaches, our proposed pre-training improves the 3D\nscene graph prediction considerably, which results in SOTA performance,\noutperforming other 3D scene graph models by +10% on object prediction and +4%\non relationship prediction. Additionally, we show that only using a small\nsubset of 10% labeled data during fine-tuning is sufficient to outperform the\nsame model without pre-training.",

            "summary": "Advancements in deep neural networks have allowed automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems to attain human parity on several publicly available\nclean speech datasets. However, even state-of-the-art ASR systems experience\nperformance degradation when confronted with adverse conditions, as a\nwell-trained acoustic model is sensitive to variations in the speech domain,\ne.g., background noise. Intuitively, humans address this issue by relying on\ntheir linguistic knowledge: the meaning of ambiguous spoken terms is usually\ninferred from contextual cues thereby reducing the dependency on the auditory\nsystem. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the first open-source\nbenchmark to utilize external large language models (LLMs) for ASR error\ncorrection, where N-best decoding hypotheses provide informative elements for\ntrue transcription prediction. This approach is a paradigm shift from the\ntraditional language model rescoring strategy that can only select one\ncandidate hypothesis as the output transcription. The proposed benchmark\ncontains a novel dataset, HyPoradise (HP), encompassing more than 334,000 pairs\nof N-best hypotheses and corresponding accurate transcriptions across prevalent\nspeech domains. Given this dataset, we examine three types of error correction\ntechniques based on LLMs with varying amounts of labeled\nhypotheses-transcription pairs, which gains a significant word error rate (WER)\nreduction. Experimental evidence demonstrates the proposed technique achieves a\nbreakthrough by surpassing the upper bound of traditional re-ranking based\nmethods. More surprisingly, LLM with reasonable prompt and its generative\ncapability can even correct those tokens that are missing in N-best list. We\nmake our results publicly accessible for reproducible pipelines with released\npre-trained models, thus providing a new evaluation paradigm for ASR error\ncorrection with LLMs.",

While they provide\nprecious insights into the internal dynamics of evolved stars as well as\nmassive and intermediate-mass stars, their non-detection in main sequence (MS)\nsolar-type stars make them a crucial missing piece in our understanding of\nangular momentum transport in radiative zones and stellar rotational evolution.\nIn this work, we aim to apply certain analysis tools originally developed for\nhelioseismology in order to look for g-mode signatures in MS solar-type stars.\nWe select a sample of the 34 most promising MS solar-type stars with Kepler\nfour-year long photometric time series. All these stars are well-characterised\nlate F-type stars with thin convective envelopes, fast convective flows, and\nstochastically excited acoustic modes (p modes). For each star, we compute the\nbackground noise level of the Fourier power spectrum to identify significant\npeaks at low frequency. After successfully detecting individual peaks in 12\ntargets, we further analyse four of them and observe distinct patterns of\nsurrounding peaks with a low probability of being noise artifacts. Comparisons\nwith the predictions from reference models suggest that these patterns are\ncompatible with the presence of non-asymptotic low-order pure g modes, pure p\nmodes, and mixed modes. Given their sensitivity to both the convective core\ninterface stratification and the coupling between p- and g-mode resonant\ncavities, such modes are able to provide strong constraints on the structure\nand evolutionary states of the related targets.

The related calculations were performed within a one-dimensional\nHubbard model by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations\nwithout the Hartree-Fock (HF) interaction potential. The phase diagram of the\nsurface superconducting, metallic, and insulating states was obtained as\ndependent on the electric field and temperature. This diagram was found to be\nin agreement with experimental results reported previously for (Li,Fe)OHFeSe\nthin flakes. In the present work, by taking into account the HF potential, we\nfind that the latter acts as a kind of an extra electrostatic potential that\nenhances the electric-field effects on the surface states. The qualitative\nfeatures of the phase diagram remain the same but the surface\nsuperconductor-insulator transition occurs at significantly lower electric\nfields, which supports prospects of its experimental observation in bulk\nsamples.",

To\naddress this, we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework called Partial\nObservations Prediction (POP) for congested urban road scenarios. The framework\nconsists of two stages: self-supervised learning (SSL) and feature\ndistillation. In SSL, a reconstruction branch reconstructs the hidden history\nof partial observations using a mask procedure and reconstruction head. The\nfeature distillation stage transfers knowledge from a fully observed teacher\nmodel to a partially observed student model, improving prediction accuracy.

For this reason, many state-of-the-art\nSGGs are not applicable to large graphs. In this paper, we present SANGEA, a\nsizeable synthetic graph generation framework which extends the applicability\nof any SGG to large graphs. By first splitting the large graph into\ncommunities, SANGEA trains one SGG per community, then links the community\ngraphs back together to create a synthetic large graph. Our experiments show\nthat the graphs generated by SANGEA have high similarity to the original graph,\nin terms of both topology and node feature distribution. Additionally, these\ngenerated graphs achieve high utility on downstream tasks such as link\nprediction. Finally, we provide a privacy assessment of the generated graphs to\nshow that, even though they have excellent utility, they also achieve\nreasonable privacy scores.",

Recent research on noisy label\nlearning confirms that neural networks first focus on the clean and simple\ninstances and then follow the noisy and hard instances in the training stage.\nTo address the learning with noisy label problem and protect the human\nsubjects' privacy, we propose a simple but effective approach named Joint\nCooperative training with Trinity Networks (JoCoT). To mitigate the privacy\nissue, human skeleton data are used. The robustness and performance of the\nnoisy label learning framework is improved by using the two teacher modules and\none student module in the proposed JoCoT. To mitigate the incorrect selections,\nthe predictions from the teacher modules are applied with the consensus-based\nmethod to guide the student module training. The performance evaluation on the\nwidely used UP-Fall dataset and comparison with the state-of-the-art, confirms\nthe effectiveness of the proposed JoCoT in high noise rates.

Due to these\nvariations among the train and test domains, the road segmentation algorithms\nfail to generalize to new geographical locations. Unlike the generic domain\nalignment scenarios, road segmentation has no scene structure, and generic\ndomain adaptation methods are unable to enforce topological properties like\ncontinuity, connectivity, smoothness, etc., thus resulting in degraded domain\nalignment. In this work, we propose a topology-aware unsupervised domain\nadaptation approach for road segmentation in remote sensing imagery.\nSpecifically, we predict road skeleton, an auxiliary task to impose the\ntopological constraints. To enforce consistent predictions of road and\nskeleton, especially in the unlabeled target domain, the conformity loss is\ndefined across the skeleton prediction head and the road-segmentation head.\nFurthermore, for self-training, we filter out the noisy pseudo-labels by using\na connectivity-based pseudo-labels refinement strategy, on both road and\nskeleton segmentation heads, thus avoiding holes and discontinuities. Extensive\nexperiments on the benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

            "summary": "In survival analysis, longitudinal information on the health status of a\npatient can be used to dynamically update the predicted probability that a\npatient will experience an event of interest. Traditional approaches to dynamic\nprediction such as joint models become computationally unfeasible with more\nthan a handful of longitudinal covariates, warranting the development of\nmethods that can handle a larger number of longitudinal covariates. We\nintroduce the R package pencal, which implements a Penalized Regression\nCalibration approach that makes it possible to handle many longitudinal\ncovariates as predictors of survival. pencal uses mixed-effects models to\nsummarize the trajectories of the longitudinal covariates up to a prespecified\nlandmark time, and a penalized Cox model to predict survival based on both\nbaseline covariates and summary measures of the longitudinal covariates. This\narticle illustrates the structure of the R package, provides a step by step\nexample showing how to estimate PRC, compute dynamic predictions of survival\nand validate performance, and shows how parallelization can be used to\nsignificantly reduce computing time.",

The dominant\napproaches for language-guided manipulation use 2D image representations, which\nface difficulties in combining multi-view cameras and inferring precise 3D\npositions and relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a 3D\npoint cloud based policy called PolarNet for language-guided manipulation. It\nleverages carefully designed point cloud inputs, efficient point cloud\nencoders, and multimodal transformers to learn 3D point cloud representations\nand integrate them with language instructions for action prediction. PolarNet\nis shown to be effective and data efficient in a variety of experiments\nconducted on the RLBench benchmark. It outperforms state-of-the-art 2D and 3D\napproaches in both single-task and multi-task learning. It also achieves\npromising results on a real robot.",

Addressing this need, we\npropose the application of a machine-learning-based Fourier Neural Operator\napproach to find the solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equations coupled with\nextra exciton rate equations.

The\nanalytical model created by Wolfram and De Wames was extended to include\nperpendicular surface anisotropy in boundary conditions. Its comparison with\nnumerical simulations demonstrate perfect agreement between the approaches. The\nanalysis of the dispersion relation indicates that the presence of surface\nanisotropy increases the avoided crossing size between Damon-Eshbach mode and\nperpendicular standing modes. Additionally, asymmetrical one-sided surface\nanisotropy induces nonreciprocity in the dispersion relation. In-depth analysis\nof the avoided crossing size is conducted for systems with different boundary\nconditions, different thicknesses, surface anisotropy constant values, and\nexternal magnetic fields. It shows the significant role of the strength of\nsurface localization of Damon-Eshbach mode and the symmetry of perpendicular\nstanding modes in the avoided crossing broadening. Interestingly, for specific\nset of parameters the interaction between the particular modes can be\nsuppressed, resulting in a mode crossing. Such a crossing, which occurs only on\none side of the dispersion relation in a one-sided surface anisotropy system,\ncan be utilized in nonreciprocal devices.",

This\nproblem occurs in maximising the visibility, as well as in limiting the\nuncertainty in localisation problems. More formally, we define the following\nmaximum cover problem: \"Given a convex polygon $P$ and a Field Of View (FOV)\nwith a given centre and inner angle $\\phi$; find the direction (an angle of\nrotation $\\theta$) of the FOV such that the intersection between the FOV and\n$P$ has the maximum area\". In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundation\nfor the analysis of the maximum cover with a rotating field of view. The main\nchallenge is that the function of the area $A_{\\phi}(\\theta)$, with the angle\nof rotation $\\theta$ and the fixed inner angle $\\phi$, cannot be approximated\ndirectly. We found an alternative way to express it by various compositions of\na function $A_{\\theta}(\\phi)$ (with a restricted inner angle $\\phi$ and a fixed\ndirection $\\theta$). We show that $A_{\\theta}(\\phi)$ has an analytical solution\nin the special case of a two-sector intersection and later provides a\nconstrictive solution for the original problem.

In most explanations,\nconsciousness is epiphenomenal, without causal power. The most notable\nexception is Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which provides a causal\nexplanation for consciousness. However, IIT relies on an identity between\nsubjectivity and a particular type of physical structure, namely with an\ninformation structure that has intrinsic causal power greater than the sum of\nits parts. Any theory that relies on a psycho-physical identity must eventually\nappeal to panpsychism, which undermines that theorys claim to be fundamental.\nIIT has recently pivoted towards a strong version of causal emergence, but\nmacroscopic causal structures cannot be causally stronger than its microscopic\nparts without some new physical law or governing principle. The approach taken\nhere is designed to uncover such a principle. The decisive argument is entirely\ndeductive from initial premises that are phenomenologically certain. If\ncorrect, the arguments prove that conscious experience is sufficient to create\nadditional degrees of causal freedom independently of the content of\nexperience, and in a manner that is unpredictable and unobservable by any\ntemporally sequential means. This provides a fundamental principle about\nconsciousness, and a conceptual bridge between it and the physics describing\nwhat is experienced. The principle makes testable predictions about brain\nfunction, with notable differences from IIT, some of which are also empirically\ntestable.",

            "summary": "Cyclic polymers display unique physical behaviors in comparison to their\nlinear counterparts. Theoretical, computational and experimental studies have\nrevealed that some of their distinctive properties are also observed in charged\nvariants of cyclic polymers, known as cyclic polyelectrolytes (PEs), especially\nin terms of their structural responses to variations in the strength of\nelectrostatic interactions. In this study, we investigate the impact of cyclic\ntopology on the conformations of PE chains in dilute good solvent using scaling\nanalysis and coarse-grained bead-spring molecular dynamics simulations. Our\nobservations indicate that, in contrast to linear PE chains, cyclic topology\nresults in more compact conformations at low and intermediate Bjerrum lengths.\nMoreover, two structural metrics, asphericity and prolateness, which quantify\ndeviations from spherical and flat molecular shapes, exhibit non-monotonic\nbehaviors for cyclic PEs. This stands in contrast to linear PEs, where these\nshape characteristics exhibit a monotonic trend with increasing Bjerrum length.\nA feasible analytical theory, developed to account for ionic distributions\naround cyclic PE chains, suggests that the fundamental difference between\nlinear and cyclic chain conformations may be attributed to topological effects\ninfluencing long-range electrostatic interactions.",

The problem of stability of long-term operation of\nvarious optoelectronic devices based on organic materials, both conjugated\npolymers and small molecules of organic semiconductors (SMOSs), is becoming\nrelevant now. One way to solve this problem is to use carbon nanostructures,\nsuch as carbon nanotubes and a large family of graphene-based materials, which\nhave enhanced stability, in carefully designed nanohybrid or nanocomposite\narchitectures that can be integrated into photosensitive layers and where their\npotential is not yet know fully disclosed. Recently, a new trend has been seen\nin this direction - the use of nanoscale materials for, first of all, the\nconversion of light into electricity. The main goal of this approach is to\nrationally design stable and highly efficient carbon-based hybrid nanomaterials\nfor optoelectrical applications, namely light harvesting/electricity\nconversion, which can be implemented in real optoelectrical devices. In this\nreview, we will discuss the theoretical and experimental foundations of the\nhybridization of carbon nanostructures (CNSs) with other materials to reveal\nnew optoelectronic properties and provide an overview of existing examples in\nthe literature that will predict interesting future perspectives for use in\nfuture devices.",

            "summary": "Uncertainty quantification is crucial for the deployment of image restoration\nmodels in safety-critical domains, like autonomous driving and biological\nimaging. To date, methods for uncertainty visualization have mainly focused on\nper-pixel estimates. Yet, a heatmap of per-pixel variances is typically of\nlittle practical use, as it does not capture the strong correlations between\npixels. A more natural measure of uncertainty corresponds to the variances\nalong the principal components (PCs) of the posterior distribution.\nTheoretically, the PCs can be computed by applying PCA on samples generated\nfrom a conditional generative model for the input image. However, this requires\ngenerating a very large number of samples at test time, which is painfully slow\nwith the current state-of-the-art (diffusion) models. In this work, we present\na method for predicting the PCs of the posterior distribution for any input\nimage, in a single forward pass of a neural network. Our method can either wrap\naround a pre-trained model that was trained to minimize the mean square error\n(MSE), or can be trained from scratch to output both a predicted image and the\nposterior PCs. We showcase our method on multiple inverse problems in imaging,\nincluding denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, and biological\nimage-to-image translation. Our method reliably conveys instance-adaptive\nuncertainty directions, achieving uncertainty quantification comparable with\nposterior samplers while being orders of magnitude faster.

Existing explicit or implicit 3D geometry construction\nmethods are computationally expensive while those based on learning have\npredominantly focused on isolated views of object categories with regular\ngeometric structure. Differing from the traditional \\textit{render-inpaint}\napproach to new view synthesis in the real indoor environment, we propose a\nconditional generative adversarial neural network (P2I-NET) to directly predict\nthe new view from the given pose. P2I-NET learns the conditional distribution\nof the images of the environment for establishing the correspondence between\nthe camera pose and its view of the environment, and achieves this through a\nnumber of innovative designs in its architecture and training lost function.\nTwo auxiliary discriminator constraints are introduced for enforcing the\nconsistency between the pose of the generated image and that of the\ncorresponding real world image in both the latent feature space and the real\nworld pose space. Additionally a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is\nintroduced to further reinforce this consistency in the pixel space. We have\nperformed extensive new view synthesis experiments on real indoor datasets.\nResults show that P2I-NET has superior performance against a number of NeRF\nbased strong baseline models. In particular, we show that P2I-NET is 40 to 100\ntimes faster than these competitor techniques while synthesising similar\nquality images. Furthermore, we contribute a new publicly available indoor\nenvironment dataset containing 22 high resolution RGBD videos where each frame\nalso has accurate camera pose parameters.",

Input sparsity makes obtaining high-quality embeddings for\nrarely-occurring categories harder as their representations are updated\ninfrequently. We demonstrate a training-time technique to produce superior\nembeddings via effective cross-category learning and theoretically explain its\nsurprising effectiveness. The scheme, termed the multi-layer embeddings\ntraining (MLET), trains embeddings using factorization of the embedding layer,\nwith an inner dimension higher than the target embedding dimension. For\ninference efficiency, MLET converts the trained two-layer embedding into a\nsingle-layer one thus keeping inference-time model size unchanged.\n  Empirical superiority of MLET is puzzling as its search space is not larger\nthan that of the single-layer embedding. The strong dependence of MLET on the\ninner dimension is even more surprising. We develop a theory that explains both\nof these behaviors by showing that MLET creates an adaptive update mechanism\nmodulated by the singular vectors of embeddings. When tested on multiple\nstate-of-the-art recommendation models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction\ntasks, MLET consistently produces better models, especially for rare items. At\nconstant model quality, MLET allows embedding dimension, and model size,\nreduction by up to 16x, and 5.8x on average, across the models.",

            "summary": "Voice conversion is becoming increasingly popular, and a growing number of\napplication scenarios require models with streaming inference capabilities. The\nrecently proposed DualVC attempts to achieve this objective through streaming\nmodel architecture design and intra-model knowledge distillation along with\nhybrid predictive coding to compensate for the lack of future information.\nHowever, DualVC encounters several problems that limit its performance. First,\nthe autoregressive decoder has error accumulation in its nature and limits the\ninference speed as well. Second, the causal convolution enables streaming\ncapability but cannot sufficiently use future information within chunks. Third,\nthe model is unable to effectively address the noise in the unvoiced segments,\nlowering the sound quality. In this paper, we propose DualVC 2 to address these\nissues. Specifically, the model backbone is migrated to a Conformer-based\narchitecture, empowering parallel inference. Causal convolution is replaced by\nnon-causal convolution with dynamic chunk mask to make better use of\nwithin-chunk future information. Also, quiet attention is introduced to enhance\nthe model's noise robustness. Experiments show that DualVC 2 outperforms DualVC\nand other baseline systems in both subjective and objective metrics, with only\n186.4 ms latency. Our audio samples are made publicly available.",

In the scope of space weather forecasting, it is crucial to be able\nto more reliably predict the arrival time, speed, and magnetic field\nconfiguration of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). From the time a CME is\nlaunched, the dominant factor influencing all of the above is the interaction\nof the interplanetary CME (ICME) with the ambient plasma and interplanetary\nmagnetic field. Aims. Due to a generally anisotropic heliosphere, differently\noriented ICMEs may interact differently with the ambient plasma and\ninterplanetary magnetic field, even when the initial eruption conditions are\nsimilar. For this, we examined the possible link between the orientation of an\nICME and its propagation in the heliosphere (up to 1 AU). Methods. We\ninvestigated 31 CME-ICME associations in the period from 1997 to 2018. The CME\norientation in the near-Sun environment was determined using an ellipse-fitting\ntechnique applied to single-spacecraft data from SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3\ncoronagraphs. In the near-Earth environment, we obtained the orientation of the\ncorresponding ICME using in situ plasma and magnetic field data. The shock\norientation and nonradial flows in the sheath region for differently oriented\nICMEs were investigated. In addition, we calculated the ICME transit time to\nEarth and drag parameter to probe the overall drag force for differently\noriented ICMEs. The drag parameter was calculated using the reverse modeling\nprocedure with the drag-based model. Results. We found a significant difference\nin nonradial flows for differently oriented ICMEs, whereas a significant\ndifference in drag for differently oriented ICMEs was not found.",

We used a simple generalized Navarro-Frenk-White potential\nmodel along with a beta-model for the density of baryonic matter, which sets\nthe emission to provide an estimation of the observed redshift in the simplest\nof cases.

We investigated the observability of the gravitational redshift in an\nidealized test case of a nearby massive cluster with the Athena X-IFU\ninstrument, as well as its use in probing the properties of the potential well.\nWe were also able to constrain the mass to a 20 % level of precision and the\ncosmological redshift to less than 1%, within a simplified and idealized\nobservational framework.

            "summary": "Legged locomotion is a complex control problem that requires both accuracy\nand robustness to cope with real-world challenges. Legged systems have\ntraditionally been controlled using trajectory optimization with inverse\ndynamics. Such hierarchical model-based methods are appealing due to intuitive\ncost function tuning, accurate planning, and most importantly, the insightful\nunderstanding gained from more than one decade of extensive research. However,\nmodel mismatch and violation of assumptions are common sources of faulty\noperation and may hinder successful sim-to-real transfer. Simulation-based\nreinforcement learning, on the other hand, results in locomotion policies with\nunprecedented robustness and recovery skills. Yet, all learning algorithms\nstruggle with sparse rewards emerging from environments where valid footholds\nare rare, such as gaps or stepping stones. In this work, we propose a hybrid\ncontrol architecture that combines the advantages of both worlds to\nsimultaneously achieve greater robustness, foot-placement accuracy, and terrain\ngeneralization. Our approach utilizes a model-based planner to roll out a\nreference motion during training. A deep neural network policy is trained in\nsimulation, aiming to track the optimized footholds. We evaluate the accuracy\nof our locomotion pipeline on sparse terrains, where pure data-driven methods\nare prone to fail. Furthermore, we demonstrate superior robustness in the\npresence of slippery or deformable ground when compared to model-based\ncounterparts. Finally, we show that our proposed tracking controller\ngeneralizes across different trajectory optimization methods not seen during\ntraining. In conclusion, our work unites the predictive capabilities and\noptimality guarantees of online planning with the inherent robustness\nattributed to offline learning.",

The comparison of the\npresent numerical calculations with the predictions from empirical nuclear\ncharge models, the non-relativistic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock calculations, and the\nresults based on experimental charge densities indicate that both the nuclear\ncharge radius and the detailed shape of charge density distribution play\nimportant roles in determining the FNS corrections.

It\nis shown that they both increase by orders of magnitude with increasing the\nnuclear charge, while the ratio between them has a relatively weak dependence\non the nuclear charge. The FNS corrections to the $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ bound\nstate energies from the RCHB calculations are generally in good agreement with\nthe analytical estimations by Shabaev [J. Phys. B, 26, 1103 (1993)] based on\nthe homogeneously charged sphere nuclear model, with the discrepancy indicating\nthe distinct contribution of microscopic nuclear structure to the FNS effects.",

            "summary": "Decline of the dissolved oxygen in the ocean is a growing concern, as it may\neventually lead to global anoxia, an elevated mortality of marine fauna and\neven a mass extinction. Deoxygenation of the ocean often results in the\nformation of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZ): large domains where the abundance of\noxygen is much lower than that in the surrounding ocean environment. Factors\nand processes resulting in the OMZ formation remain controversial. We consider\na conceptual model of coupled plankton-oxygen dynamics that, apart from the\nplankton growth and the oxygen production by phytoplankton, also accounts for\nthe difference in the timescales for phyto and zooplankton (making it a\n\"slow-fast system\") and for the implicit effect of upper trophic levels. The\nmodel is investigated using a combination of analytical techniques and\nnumerical simulations. We show that the system does not allow for persistent\nrelaxation oscillations; instead, the blowup of the canard cycle results in\nplankton extinction and oxygen depletion. For the spatially explicit model, an\ninitial non-uniform perturbation can lead to the formation of an OMZ, which\nthen grows in size and spreads over space. For a sufficiently large timescale\nseparation, the spread of the OMZ can result in global anoxia.",

It also presents sensitivity studies for future neutrino\nexperiments. The first part covers the status of the determination of the\noscillation parameters in the three-neutrino framework, the mass ordering and\nthe absolute mass scale. A second part is devoted to other neutrino properties\npredicted in neutrino mass models. The topics covered include the study of\nspin-flavour precession in solar neutrinos from non-zero neutrino magnetic\nmoments, the prospects for neutrino non-standard interactions with quarks from\nthe solar sector and the expected limits on CPT violation from a separate\nanalysis of neutrino and antineutrino data. Regarding cosmology, the impact of\nnon-standard interactions with electrons and a non-unitary three-neutrino\nmixing matrix in the process of neutrino decoupling are addressed. Finally, a\nthird part explores possible connections between dark matter and neutrinos. The\nexistence of dark matter has been proven indirectly via its gravitational\neffects. This thesis presents two studies that explore how neutrinos could\nprobe the fraction of dark matter that could exist in the form of primordial\nblack holes and the experimental signatures expected from a hypothetical\ncoupling between neutrinos and an ultralight scalar dark matter candidate.",

To address this, we introduce the Stock\nNetwork Inference Framework (SNIF), which leverages a self-encoding mechanism.\nSpecifically, the Stock Network Inference Encoder (SNIE) facilitates network\nconstruction, while the Movement Prediction Decoder (MPD) enhances movement\nforecasting. This integrated process culminates in the inference of a stock\nnetwork, exhibiting remarkable performance across applications such as market\nstructure analysis, stock movement prediction, portfolio construction, and\ncommunity evolution analysis. Our approach streamlines the automatic\nconstruction of stock networks, liberating the process from threshold\ndependencies and eliminating the need for additional financial indicators.\nIncorporating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) models within the SNIF framework, we effectively unearth deep-seated\nassociations among stocks, augmenting the toolset available for comprehensive\nfinancial market research.

            "summary": "The competitive auction was first proposed by Goldberg, Hartline, and Wright.\nIn their paper, they introduce the competitive analysis framework of online\nalgorithm designing into the traditional revenue-maximizing auction design\nproblem. While the competitive analysis framework only cares about the\nworst-case bound, a growing body of work in the online algorithm community\nstudies the learning-augmented framework. In this framework, designers are\nallowed to leverage imperfect machine-learned predictions of unknown\ninformation and pursue better theoretical guarantees when the prediction is\naccurate(consistency). Meanwhile, designers also need to maintain a\nnearly-optimal worst-case ratio(robustness).\n  In this work, we revisit the competitive auctions in the learning-augmented\nsetting. We leverage the imperfect predictions of the private value of the\nbidders and design the learning-augmented mechanisms for several competitive\nauctions with different constraints, including digital good auctions,\nlimited-supply auctions, and general downward-closed permutation environments.\nFor all these auction environments, our mechanisms enjoy $1$-consistency\nagainst the strongest benchmark $OPT$, which is impossible to achieve\n$O(1)$-competitive without predictions. At the same time, our mechanisms also\nmaintain the $O(1)$-robustness against all benchmarks considered in the\ntraditional competitive analysis. Considering the possible inaccuracy of the\npredictions, we provide a reduction that transforms our learning-augmented\nmechanisms into an error-tolerant version, which enables the learning-augmented\nmechanism to ensure satisfactory revenue in scenarios where the prediction\nerror is moderate.",

            "summary": "Although it is generally believed that the solar photosphere is not\nmagnetically force-free owning to its high plasma $\\beta$, the estimations of\nforce-freeness using observed magnetograms have produced disputable results.\nSome studies confirmed that the photosphere is largely not force-free whereas\nsome authors argued that the photosphere is not far away from being force-free.\nIn a previous paper of ours we demonstrated that, due to the fact that the\nnoise levels of the transverse field in the magnetograms are much larger than\nthose of the vertical field, wrong judgements on the force-freeness could be\nmade: a truly force-free field could be judged as being not-force-free and a\ntruly not-force-free field could be judged as being force-free. Here in this\nletter we propose an approach to overcome this serious problem. By reducing the\nspatial resolution to lower the noise level, the heavy influence of the\nmeasurement noise on the force-freeness judgement can be significantly\nsuppressed. We first use two analytical solutions to show the success and the\neffectiveness of this approach. Then we apply this new approach to two large\ndatasets of active region magnetograms, obtained with the HMI/SDO and\nSP/Hinode, respectively. Our analysis shows that the photospheric magnetic\nfields are actually far away from being force-free. Particularly and most\nnotably, the mean value of Fz/Fp (where Fz the net Lorentz force in the\nvertical direction and Fp the total Lorentz force) is as low as -0.47, with\nmore than 98% of the active regions having |Fz/Fp|>0.1, when using the\nSP/Hinode magnetograms of true field strength.",

Notably, our research reveals that the\nparameters within these equations are dynamic, adapting to evolving climate\npatterns. Ultimately, the unveiled equations have practical applications,\nparticularly in fine-scale downscaling for precipitation predictions using\nlow-resolution future climate data.

            "summary": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a crucial component of synaptic\ntransmission, and its dysfunction is implicated in many neurological diseases\nand psychiatric conditions. NMDAR-based short-term postsynaptic plasticity\n(STPP) is a newly discovered postsynaptic response facilitation mechanism. Our\ngroup has suggested that long-lasting glutamate binding of NMDAR allows input\ninformation to be held for up to 500 ms or longer in brain slices, which\ncontributes to response facilitation. However, the implications of STPP in the\ndynamics of neuronal populations remain unknown. In this study, we implemented\nSTPP in a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) model to describe the\nneural information encoded in neuronal populations. Unlike short-term\nfacilitation, which is a kind of presynaptic plasticity, the temporally\nenhanced synaptic efficacy induced by STPP destabilizes the network state of\nthe CANN by increasing the mobility of the system. This nontrivial dynamical\neffect enables a CANN with STPP to track a moving stimulus predictively, i.e.,\nthe network state responds to the anticipated stimulus. Our findings reveal a\nnovel STPP-based mechanism for sensory prediction that can help develop\nbrain-inspired computational algorithms for prediction.",

We also highlight a concerning discrepancy where the\nexplanations provided by ResNet-like models do not reflect the inherent\nperiodicity in the input data, a crucial attribute in URE detection from stable\ndevices. In response to these findings, we propose a novel application of\nNeural SDEs to build models for URE classification that are not only robust to\nnoise but also provide more meaningful and intuitive explanations. Neural SDE\nmodels maintain a high F1-score of 0.93 even when exposed to Gaussian noise\nwith a standard deviation of 0.5, demonstrating superior resilience to ResNet\nmodels. Neural SDE models successfully recover the time-invariant or periodic\nhorizontal bands from the input data, a feature that was conspicuously missing\nin the explanations generated by ResNet-like models.

For both Abelian and non-Abelian\ninteractions, the characteristic screening length $1/m_D$ is set by the\nso-called Debye mass $m_D \\sim g_s T$, proportional to the plasma temperature\n$T$ and the dimensionless gauge coupling $g_s$. One of the most interesting\nnaturally occurring examples is the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) that filled the\nearly universe prior to the QCD confinement phase transition at $t_{\\rm QCD}\n\\sim 10^{-5}\\,{\\rm s}$. During this early epoch, regimes of strong spacetime\ncurvature are of significant cosmological interest, such as near primordial\nblack holes (PBHs). However, the typical description of Debye screening only\napplies within Minkowski spacetime, and is therefore insufficient to describe\nthe dynamics of charged plasmas near PBHs or other primordial features. We\nconstruct an effective field theory for soft modes of the gauge field $A_\\mu^a$\nto give a full description of Debye screening in non-Abelian plasmas within\narbitrary curved spacetimes, recovering a temperature-dependent Debye mass that\nexhibits gravitational redshift.

            "summary": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) networks bring computing and storage capabilities\ncloser to edge devices, which reduces latency and improves network performance.\nHowever, to further reduce transmission and computation costs while satisfying\nuser-perceived quality of experience, a joint optimization in computing,\npushing, and caching is needed. In this paper, we formulate the joint-design\nproblem in MEC networks as an infinite-horizon discounted-cost Markov decision\nprocess and solve it using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework\nthat enables the dynamic orchestration of computing, pushing, and caching.\nThrough the deep networks embedded in the DRL structure, our framework can\nimplicitly predict user future requests and push or cache the appropriate\ncontent to effectively enhance system performance. One issue we encountered\nwhen considering three functions collectively is the curse of dimensionality\nfor the action space. To address it, we relaxed the discrete action space into\na continuous space and then adopted soft actor-critic learning to solve the\noptimization problem, followed by utilizing a vector quantization method to\nobtain the desired discrete action. Additionally, an action correction method\nwas proposed to compress the action space further and accelerate the\nconvergence. Our simulations under the setting of a general single-user,\nsingle-server MEC network with dynamic transmission link quality demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework effectively decreases transmission bandwidth and\ncomputing cost by proactively pushing data on future demand to users and\njointly optimizing the three functions. We also conduct extensive parameter\ntuning analysis, which shows that our approach outperforms the baselines under\nvarious parameter settings.",

            "summary": "Multimedia recommendation aims to predict users' future behaviors based on\nhistorical behavioral data and item's multimodal information. However, noise\ninherent in behavioral data, arising from unintended user interactions with\nuninteresting items, detrimentally impacts recommendation performance.\nRecently, diffusion models have achieved high-quality information generation,\nin which the reverse process iteratively infers future information based on the\ncorrupted state. It meets the need of predictive tasks under noisy conditions,\nand inspires exploring their application to predicting user behaviors.\nNonetheless, several challenges must be addressed: 1) Classical diffusion\nmodels require excessive computation, which does not meet the efficiency\nrequirements of recommendation systems. 2) Existing reverse processes are\nmainly designed for continuous data, whereas behavioral information is discrete\nin nature. Therefore, an effective method is needed for the generation of\ndiscrete behavioral information.\n  To tackle the aforementioned issues, we propose a Light Diffusion model for\nMultimedia Recommendation. First, to reduce computational complexity, we\nsimplify the formula of the reverse process, enabling one-step inference\ninstead of multi-step inference. Second, to achieve effective behavioral\ninformation generation, we propose a novel Conditional neural Network. It maps\nthe discrete behavior data into a continuous latent space, and generates\nbehaviors with the guidance of collaborative signals and user multimodal\npreference. Additionally, considering that completely clean behavior data is\ninaccessible, we introduce a soft behavioral reconstruction constraint during\nmodel training, facilitating behavior prediction with noisy data.

This state is\npredicted to feature perfect Coulomb drag, where a current in one layer must be\naccompanied by an equal but opposite current in the other, and counterflow\nsuperconductivity, where the excitons form a superfluid with zero viscosity.\nElectron-hole bilayers in the strong coupling limit with an excitonic insulator\nground state have been recently achieved in semiconducting transition metal\ndichalcogenide heterostructures, but direct electrical transport measurements\nremain challenging. Here we use a novel optical spectroscopy to probe the\nelectrical transport of correlated electron-hole fluids in MoSe2/hBN/WSe2\nheterostructures. We observe perfect Coulomb drag in the excitonic insulator\nphase up to a temperature as high as ~15K. Strongly correlated electron and\nhole transport is also observed at unbalanced electron and hole densities,\nalthough the Coulomb drag is not perfect anymore. Meanwhile, the counterflow\nresistance of interlayer excitons remains finite. These results indicate the\nformation of an exciton gas in the excitonic insulator which does not\ncondensate into a superfluid at low temperature.

Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a potential paradigm shift by\ndeveloping fast data-driven surrogate models. In particular, an AI framework,\nknown as neural operators, presents a principled framework for learning\nmappings between functions defined on continuous domains, e.g., spatiotemporal\nprocesses and partial differential equations (PDE). They can extrapolate and\npredict solutions at new locations unseen during training, i.e., perform\nzero-shot super-resolution. Neural operators can augment or even replace\nexisting simulators in many applications, such as computational fluid dynamics,\nweather forecasting, and material modeling, while being 4-5 orders of magnitude\nfaster. Further, neural operators can be integrated with physics and other\ndomain constraints enforced at finer resolutions to obtain high-fidelity\nsolutions and good generalization.

This further harms the reproducibility of SSL, which is\nalready limited to few research groups due to its resource usage. We show that\nmore powerful techniques can actually lead to more efficient pre-training,\nopening SSL to more research groups. We propose WavLabLM, which extends WavLM's\njoint prediction and denoising to 40k hours of data across 136 languages. To\nbuild WavLabLM, we devise a novel multi-stage pre-training method, designed to\naddress the language imbalance of multilingual data. WavLabLM achieves\ncomparable performance to XLS-R on ML-SUPERB with less than 10% of the training\ndata, making SSL realizable with academic compute. We show that further\nefficiency can be achieved with a vanilla HuBERT Base model, which can maintain\n94% of XLS-R's performance with only 3% of the data, 4 GPUs, and limited\ntrials.

Similarly, in liquid crystals, an external angular stress\ncreates an analogous force, which drives disclinations to move. In this work,\nwe develop a method to calculate the relevant angular stress either\nanalytically or numerically, and hence to determine the force on a\ndisclination. We demonstrate this method by applying the Peach-Koehler force\ntheory to four problems: (a) Single disclination in a liquid crystal cell\nbetween two uniform in-plane alignments perpendicular to each other. (b) Array\nof disclinations in a liquid crystal cell with patterned substrates. (c) Pair\nof disclinations in a long capillary tube with homeotropic anchoring. (d)\nRadial hedgehog or disclination loop inside a sphere with homeotropic\nanchoring, and its response to an applied magnetic field. In all of these\nproblems, the Peach-Koehler force theory predicts the equilibrium defect\nstructure, and the predictions are consistent with the results of minimizing\nthe total free energy.",

To this end, we introduce Telescope, a novel\nmachine learning-based forecasting approach that automatically retrieves\nrelevant information from a given time series and splits it into parts,\nhandling each of them separately. In contrast to deep learning methods, our\napproach doesn't require parameterization or the need to train and fit a\nmultitude of parameters.

However, each approach presents its own set of\nchallenges: physics models fall short in predictability, while data-driven\nmodels lack interpretability. Addressing these identified shortcomings, this\npaper proposes a novel framework, the Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL)\nmodel. PERL integrates the strengths of physics-based and data-driven methods\nfor traffic state prediction. PERL contains a physics model and a residual\nlearning model. Its prediction is the sum of the physics model result and a\npredicted residual as a correction to it. It preserves the interpretability\ninherent to physics-based models and has reduced data requirements compared to\ndata-driven methods. Experiments were conducted using a real-world vehicle\ntrajectory dataset. We proposed a PERL model, with the Intelligent Driver Model\n(IDM) as its physics car-following model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as\nits residual learning model. We compare this PERL model with the physics\ncar-following model, data-driven model, and other physics-informed neural\nnetwork (PINN) models. The result reveals that PERL achieves better prediction\nwith a small dataset, compared to the physics model, data-driven model, and\nPINN model. Second, the PERL model showed faster convergence during training,\noffering comparable performance with fewer training samples than the\ndata-driven model and PINN model. Sensitivity analysis also proves comparable\nperformance of PERL using another residual learning model and a physics\ncar-following model.",

Accordingly, the corrected entropy takes the\nform $S\\sim A^{1+\\frac{\\Delta}{2}}$, where $0\\leq\\Delta\\leq1,$ indicates the\namount of the quantum-gravitational deformation effects. By considering the\nmodified Barrow entropy associated with the apparent horizon, the Friedmann\nequations get modified as well. We show that considering a universe filled with\nthe matter and cosmological constant $\\Lambda$, it is possible to determine the\namount of deviation from standard cosmology by reconstructing the parameter\n$\\delta$ in terms of curvature parameters $\\{q,Q,\\Omega_{k}\\}$ as\n$\\Delta=\\frac{(Q-1-\\Omega_k)(1+\\Omega_k)}{(1+\\Omega_k+q)^{2}}$. Here, $q$ is\nthe deceleration parameter and $Q$ is the third derivative of scale factor .\nThis relation provides some advantages. The first is that it indicates that\nthere is profound connection between quantum-gravitational deformation effects\nand curvature effects, for $\\Omega_k\\simeq0$ the pair $\\{q,Q\\}$ can be regarded\nas deviation curvature factors which reflect the amount of deviation of the\nmodel from the standard model. The second interesting feature is that, since\nthis pair are observational parameters which can be directly measured in a\nmodel independent approach, they can be regarded as powerful tools to enable us\nto put constraint on parameter $\\Delta$ and test the Barrow entropy model. Our\nanalysis predicts the value for $Q_{0}$ which is slightly deviates from 1 as\n$(Q_{0}-1)<0.001$. This can be a relativity well target and criterion for\ntheoretical and observational measurements of parameter $Q_{0}$.

Here we report\na numerical study of the density profiles of fragments of Wigner crystals from\nfirst principles, i.e., without any empirical data or adjustable parameters. To\nsimulate the Wigner fragments we use Clifford periodic boundary conditions and\na renormalized distance in the Coulomb potential [3,4]. We show that these\nboundary conditions together with high-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock\ntheory provide a method that can accurately capture the Wigner localisation for\nsystems with many electrons. We do not make any assumptions about the positions\nwhere the electrons will localise. The density profiles we obtain emerge\nnaturally when we minimise the total energy of the system. With our approach we\nstudy two-dimensional Wigner fragments with up to 20 electrons. We clearly\nobserve the emergence of the hexagonal crystal structure which has been\npredicted to be ground-state structure of the two-dimensional Wigner crystal.",

            "summary": "In order to solve a task using reinforcement learning, it is necessary to\nfirst formalise the goal of that task as a reward function. However, for many\nreal-world tasks, it is very difficult to manually specify a reward function\nthat never incentivises undesirable behaviour. As a result, it is increasingly\npopular to use reward learning algorithms, which attempt to learn a reward\nfunction from data. However, the theoretical foundations of reward learning are\nnot yet well-developed. In particular, it is typically not known when a given\nreward learning algorithm with high probability will learn a reward function\nthat is safe to optimise. This means that reward learning algorithms generally\nmust be evaluated empirically, which is expensive, and that their failure modes\nare difficult to predict in advance. One of the roadblocks to deriving better\ntheoretical guarantees is the lack of good methods for quantifying the\ndifference between reward functions. In this paper we provide a solution to\nthis problem, in the form of a class of pseudometrics on the space of all\nreward functions that we call STARC (STAndardised Reward Comparison) metrics.\nWe show that STARC metrics induce both an upper and a lower bound on worst-case\nregret, which implies that our metrics are tight, and that any metric with the\nsame properties must be bilipschitz equivalent to ours. Moreover, we also\nidentify a number of issues with reward metrics proposed by earlier works.\nFinally, we evaluate our metrics empirically, to demonstrate their practical\nefficacy. STARC metrics can be used to make both theoretical and empirical\nanalysis of reward learning algorithms both easier and more principled.",

We assess three models for\npower production that account for wind speed and direction shear. Two are based\non actuator disc representations and the third is a blade element\nrepresentation. We also evaluate the predictions from a standard power curve\nmodel that has no knowledge of wind shear. The predictions from each model,\ndriven by wind profile measurements from a profiling LiDAR, are compared to\nconcurrent power measurements from an adjacent utility-scale wind turbine. In\nthe field measurements of the utility-scale turbine, discrete combinations of\nspeed and direction shear induce changes in power production of -19% to +34%\nrelative to the turbine power curve for a given hub height wind speed. Positive\nspeed shear generally corresponds to over-performance and positive direction\nshear to under-performance, relative to the power curve. Overall, the blade\nelement model produces both higher correlation and lower error relative to the\nother models, but its quantitative accuracy depends on induction and controller\nsub-models. To further assess the influence of complex, non-monotonic wind\nprofiles, we also drive the models with best-fit power law wind speed profiles\nand linear wind direction profiles. These idealized inputs produce qualitative\nand quantitative differences in power predictions from each model,\ndemonstrating that time-varying, non-monotonic wind shear affects wind power\nproduction.",

            "summary": "TRAPPIST-1e is a potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanet orbiting an\nultra-cool M Dwarf star and is a key target for observations with the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST). One-dimensional photochemical modelling of\nterrestrial planetary atmospheres has shown the importance of the incoming\nstellar UV flux in modulating the concentration of chemical species, such as\nO$_3$ and H$_2$O. In addition, three-dimensional (3D) modelling has\ndemonstrated anisotropy in chemical abundances due to transport in tidally\nlocked exoplanet simulations. We use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate\nModel Version 6 (WACCM6), a 3D Earth System Model, to investigate how\nuncertainties in the incident UV flux, combined with transport, affect\nobservational predictions for TRAPPIST-1e (assuming an initial Earth-like\natmospheric composition). We use two semi-empirical stellar spectra for\nTRAPPIST-1 from the literature. The UV flux ratio between them can be as large\nas a factor of 5000 in some wavelength bins. Consequently, the\nphotochemically-produced total O$_3$ columns differ by a factor of 26. Spectral\nfeatures of O$_3$ in both transmission and emission spectra vary between these\nsimulations (e.g. differences of 19 km in transmission spectra effective\naltitude for O$_3$ at 0.6 $\\mu$m). This leads to potential ambiguities when\ninterpreting observations, including overlap with scenarios that assume\nalternative O$_2$ concentrations. Hence, to achieve robust interpretations of\nterrestrial exoplanetary spectra, characterisation of the UV spectra of their\nhost stars is critical. In the absence of such stellar measurements,\natmospheric context can still be gained from other spectral features (e.g.\nH$_2$O), or by comparing direct imaging and transmission spectra in\nconjunction.",

Forecast error of all model variations were benchmarked in real-time\nagainst a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model. Performance was\nassessed using classical and novel evaluation metrics. Results indicate that\nusing the Variance Horizon reduced computational usage by more than 50\\%, while\nincreasing between 0-15\\% in error.

Predictive states of a subsystem are\nformed by equivalence classes of state vectors in the exterior Hilbert space\nthat effectively predict the same future behavior of that subsystem for some\ntime. As an illustrative example, we present calculations in the dynamics of an\nisotropic Heisenberg model spin chain and show that, in comparison to the\nentanglement entropy, the predictive complexity better signifies dynamically\nimportant events, such as magnon collisions. We discuss how this quantity may\nusefully characterize a variety of symmetries in quantum systems in an\ninformation-theoretic way, and comment on possible applications and extensions.",

            "summary": "It is widely believed that the binary neutron star merger GW190425 produced a\nblack hole promptly upon merger. Motivated by the potential association with\nthe fast radio burst FRB 20190425A, which took place 2.5~hours after the\nmerger, we revisit the question of the outcome of GW190425 by means of\nnumerical relativity simulations. We show that current laboratory and\nastrophysical constraints on the equation of state of dense matter do not rule\nout the formation of a long-lived remnant. However, the formation of a stable\nremnant would have produced a bright kilonova, in tension with upper limits by\nZTF at the location and time of FRB 20190425A. Moreover, the ejecta would have\nbeen optically thick to radio emission for days to months, preventing a\nputative FRB from propagating out. The predicted dispersion measure is also\nseveral orders of magnitude larger than that observed for FRB 20190425A. Our\nresults indicate that FRB 20190425A and GW190425 are not associated. However,\nwe cannot completely rule out the formation of a long-lived remnant, due to the\nincomplete coverage of the relevant sky regions. More observations of\nGW190425-like events, including potential upper limit, have the potential to\nconstrain nuclear physics. To this aim, it is important that follow-up\nobservational campaigns of gravitational wave events are informed by the\nproperties of the source, such as their chirp mass, and we urge the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration to promptly release them publicly.",

Shifting our gaze between objects of interest quickly\nand consistently requires changes both in depth and direction. Gaze changes in\ndepth are driven by slow, inconsistent vergence movements which rotate the eyes\nin opposite directions, while changes in direction are driven by ballistic,\nconsistent movements called saccades, which rotate the eyes in the same\ndirection. In the natural world, most of our eye movements are a combination of\nboth types. While scientific consensus on the nature of saccades exists,\nvergence and combined movements remain less understood and agreed upon.\n  We eschew the lack of scientific consensus in favor of proposing an\noperationalized computational model which predicts the speed of any type of\ngaze movement during target-shifting in 3D. To this end, we conduct a\npsychophysical study in a stereo VR environment to collect more than 12,000\ngaze movement trials, analyze the temporal distribution of the observed gaze\nmovements, and fit a probabilistic model to the data. We perform a series of\nobjective measurements and user studies to validate the model. The results\ndemonstrate its predictive accuracy, generalization, as well as applications\nfor optimizing visual performance by altering content placement. Lastly, we\nleverage the model to measure differences in human target-changing time\nrelative to the natural world, as well as suggest scene-aware projection depth.\nBy incorporating the complexities and randomness of human oculomotor control,\nwe hope this research will support new behavior-aware metrics for VR/AR display\ndesign, interface layout, and gaze-contingent rendering.",

However, in real\nflight experiments, or wind tunnel tests, often only sparse sensor measurements\ncan be collected at fixed locations. Thus, in developing reduced models for\npredicting and controlling the flow at the sensor locations, the main challenge\nis in accounting for how the surrounding field of unobserved variables\ninteracts with the observed variables at the fixed sensor locations. This makes\nthe Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism a natural choice, as it results in the\nGeneralized Langevin Equations which provides a framework for constructing\nnon-Markovian reduced-order models that includes the effects the unresolved\nvariables have on the resolved variables. These effects are captured in the so\ncalled memory kernel and orthogonal dynamics. In this work, we explore the\ndata-driven MZ formulations to two boundary layer flows obtained from DNS data;\na low speed incompressible flow; and a high speed compressible flow over a\nflared cone at Mach 6. An array of \"sensors\" are placed near the surface of the\nsolid boundary, and the MZ operators are learned and the predictions are\ncompared to the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), both using delay\nembedded coordinates. Further comparisons are made with Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) and a regression based projection framework using neural networks for\nthe MZ operators. First we compare the effects of including delay embedded\ncoordinates with EDMD and Mori based MZ and provide evidence that using both\nmemory and delay embedded coordinates minimizes generalization errors on the\nrelevant time scales. Next, we provide numerical evidence that the data-driven\nregression based projection MZ model performs best with respect to the\nprediction accuracy (minimum generalization error) on the relevant time scales.",

When placed off food, the foraging behavior of C. elegans\ncan be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior\ncharacterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search\nbehavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in\nindividual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half\nappear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts\nboth abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that does not rely on\nbehavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that\ndefines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By\nstochastically sampling from the probability distribution defined by this rate,\nboth abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching\nexperimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on\nbehavioral states or information accumulation.

            "summary": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting involves predicting future time\nseries data based on historical observations. Existing research primarily\nemphasizes the development of complex spatial-temporal models that capture\nspatial dependencies and temporal correlations among time series variables\nexplicitly. However, recent advances have been impeded by challenges relating\nto data scarcity and model robustness. To address these issues, we propose\nSpatial-Temporal Masked Autoencoders (STMAE), an MTS forecasting framework that\nleverages masked autoencoders to enhance the performance of spatial-temporal\nbaseline models. STMAE consists of two learning stages. In the pretraining\nstage, an encoder-decoder architecture is employed. The encoder processes the\npartially visible MTS data produced by a novel dual-masking strategy, including\nbiased random walk-based spatial masking and patch-based temporal masking.\nSubsequently, the decoders aim to reconstruct the masked counterparts from both\nspatial and temporal perspectives. The pretraining stage establishes a\nchallenging pretext task, compelling the encoder to learn robust\nspatial-temporal patterns. In the fine-tuning stage, the pretrained encoder is\nretained, and the original decoder from existing spatial-temporal models is\nappended for forecasting. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple MTS\nbenchmarks. The promising results demonstrate that integrating STMAE into\nvarious spatial-temporal models can largely enhance their MTS forecasting\ncapability.",

Traditional CGM models using simple density\nprofiles are inadequate in describing such a multiphase atmosphere.\nAlternatively, a model based on probability distribution functions (PDFs) with\nparameters motivated by relevant physical processes can better match\nmulti-wavelength observations. In this work, we use log-normal distributions,\ncommonly seen in the simulations of the multiphase interstellar and\ncircumgalactic media, to quantify the volume fraction of different phases. We\ngeneralize the isothermal background model by Faerman et al. 2017 to include\nmore general CGM profiles. We extend the existing probabilistic models from\n1D-PDFs in temperature to 2D-PDFs in density-temperature phase space and\nconstrain its parameters using a Milky Way-like {\\tt Illustris TNG50-1} halo.\nWe generate various synthetic observables such as column densities of different\nions, UV/X-ray spectra, dispersion, and emission measures. X-ray and radio\n(Fast Radio Burst) observations constrain the hot gas properties. However,\ninterpreting cold/warm phase diagnostics is not straightforward since these\nphases are clumpy/patchy, with inherent variability in intercepting these\nclouds along arbitrary lines of sight. We provide a tabulated comparison of\nmodel predictions to observations, and plan to expand this into a comprehensive\ncompilation of models and data. Our modeling provides a simple, analytic\nframework that is useful to describe important aspects of the multiphase CGM.",

In this study, we employ tensor network methods to simulate\nthe time evolution of a single hole doped into the Kitaev spin-liquid ground\nstate and reveal two fundamentally different scenarios. For ferromagnetic spin\ncouplings, the spin liquid is highly susceptible to hole doping: a Nagaoka\nferromagnet forms dynamically around the doped hole, even at weak coupling. By\ncontrast, in the case of antiferromagnetic spin couplings, the hole spectrum\ndemonstrates an intricate interplay between charge, spin, and flux degrees of\nfreedom, best described by a parton mean-field ansatz of fractionalized holons\nand spinons.

An interesting result is that for halo samples with\n$M_h<10^{14}$ M$_\\odot$/h, the kNN-CDFs respond to \\textit{equilateral} PNG in\na manner distinct from the other parameters. This persists in the galaxy\ncatalogs in redshift space and can be differentiated from the impact of galaxy\nmodelling, at least within the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework\nconsidered here. kNN-CDFs are related to counts-in-cells and, through mapping a\nsubset of the kNN-CDF measurements into the count-in-cells picture, we show\nthat our results can be modeled analytically.

            "summary": "I analyze a new X-ray image of the youngest supernova remnant (SNR) in the\nGalaxy, which is the type Ia SNR G1.9+0.3, and reveal a very clear\npoint-symmetrical structure. Since explosion models of type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa) do not form such morphologies, the point-symmetrical morphology must come\nfrom the circumstellar material (CSM) into which the ejecta expands. The\nlarge-scale point-symmetry that I identify and the known substantial\ndeceleration of the ejecta of SNR G1.9+0.3 suggest a relatively massive CSM of\n>1Mo. I argue that the most likely explanation is the explosion of this SN Ia\ninto a planetary nebula (PN). The scenario that predicts a large fraction of SN\nIa inside PNe (SNIPs) is the core degenerate scenario. Other SN Ia scenarios\nmight lead to only a very small fraction of SNIPs or not at all.",

The\nevolution of the global differential brightness temperature in this line was\ncomputed to study its dependence on the values of cosmological parameters and\nphysical conditions in the intergalactic medium. Variations of the depth of the\nDark Ages absorption line at $z\\sim80$ with variations of the cosmological\nparameters $\\Omega_b$, $\\Omega_{cdm}$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$, $\\Omega_K$ and $H_0$\nare studied. The standard model with post-Planck parameters predicts a value of\nthe differential brightness temperature in the center of the absorption line\n$\\sim$30-50 mK. The profile of this line can be quite another in the\nnon-standard cosmological models, which include the annihilating or decaying\ndark matter, a primordial stochastic magnetic field, etc. It can be shallower\nor be an emission bump instead of an absorption trough. It is also shown that\nthe position and depth of the Cosmic Dawn absorption line formed at 10<z<30,\ndue to the Wouthuysen-Field effect, is mainly defined by the spectral energy\ndistribution of the first sources of light. If reionization occurs at\n$z_{ri}=7\\pm1$, then the differential brightness temperature in the center of\nthis line is $\\sim$80 mK. During the reionization, the emission with an\namplitude of $\\sim$20 mK is possible. It is also shown that the temperature,\ndensity, and degree of ionization of the baryonic component are decisive in\ncalculating the intensity of the 21-cm absorption/emission line from these\nepochs.",

            "summary": "Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a promising approach to leverage high\nfidelity cosmological simulations and extract information from the\nnon-Gaussian, non-linear scales that cannot be modeled analytically. However,\nscaling SBI to the next generation of cosmological surveys faces the\ncomputational challenge of requiring a large number of accurate simulations\nover a wide range of cosmologies, while simultaneously encompassing large\ncosmological volumes at high resolution. This challenge can potentially be\nmitigated by balancing the accuracy and computational cost for different\ncomponents of the the forward model while ensuring robust inference. To guide\nour steps in this, we perform a sensitivity analysis of SBI for galaxy\nclustering on various components of the cosmological simulations: gravity\nmodel, halo-finder and the galaxy-halo distribution models (halo-occupation\ndistribution, HOD). We infer the $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_m$ using galaxy power\nspectrum multipoles and the bispectrum monopole assuming a galaxy number\ndensity expected from the luminous red galaxies observed using the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopy Instrument (DESI). We find that SBI is insensitive to changing\ngravity model between $N$-body simulations and particle mesh (PM) simulations.\nHowever, changing the halo-finder from friends-of-friends (FoF) to Rockstar can\nlead to biased estimate of $\\sigma_8$ based on the bispectrum. For galaxy\nmodels, training SBI on more complex HOD leads to consistent inference for less\ncomplex HOD models, but SBI trained on simpler HOD models fails when applied to\nanalyze data from a more complex HOD model. Based on our results, we discuss\nthe outlook on cosmological simulations with a focus on applying SBI approaches\nto future galaxy surveys.",

However, it requires predicting the mutual head orientations of\nboth the speaker and the listener, which is challenging in practice. This paper\npresents a system for jointly predicting speaker-listener head orientations by\nleveraging inherent human voice directivity and listener's head-related\ntransfer function (HRTF) as perceived by the ear-mounted microphones on the\nlistener. We propose a convolution neural network model that, given binaural\nspeech recording, can predict the orientation of both speaker and listener with\nrespect to the line joining the two. The system builds on the core observation\nthat the recordings from the left and right ears are differentially affected by\nthe voice directivity as well as the HRTF. We also incorporate the fact that\nvoice is more directional at higher frequencies compared to lower frequencies.",

As the most delicate piece of $a_\\mu$ is\nits leading order HVP part $a_\\mu^{HVP-LO}$, methods to ascertain its\ntheoretical value are crucial to interpret appropriately this departure with\nthe measurement.

A special focus is put to the\nhigh statistic dipion spectra from the $\\eta$ decay collected by the KLOE/KLOE2\nCollaboration and $\\eta'$ decay collected by the BESIII Collaboration. It is\nshown that, once the Final State Interaction (FSI) effects are accounted for,\nthe BHLS$_2$ framework provides a fair account of their dipion spectra. More\nprecisely, it is first proven that a single FSI polynomial is requested, common\nto both the $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$ dipion spectra. Moreover, it is shown that fits\ninvolving the $\\eta/\\eta'/\\tau$ dipion spectra, and excluding the $e^+e^- \\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ annihilation data, allow for a prediction of the pion form factor\ndata $F_\\pi(s)$ which fairly agree with the usual dipion spectra collected in\nthe $e^+e^- \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$ annihilation channel.

            "summary": "Class incremental learning (CIL) is a challenging setting of continual\nlearning, which learns a series of tasks sequentially. Each task consists of a\nset of unique classes. The key feature of CIL is that no task identifier (or\ntask-id) is provided at test time for each test sample. Predicting the task-id\nfor each test sample is a challenging problem. An emerging theoretically\njustified and effective approach is to train a task-specific model for each\ntask in a shared network for all tasks based on a task-incremental learning\n(TIL) method to deal with forgetting. The model for each task in this approach\nis an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector rather than a conventional classifier.\nThe OOD detector can perform both within-task (in-distribution (IND)) class\nprediction and OOD detection. The OOD detection capability is the key for\ntask-id prediction during inference for each test sample. However, this paper\nargues that using a traditional OOD detector for task-id prediction is\nsub-optimal because additional information (e.g., the replay data and the\nlearned tasks) available in CIL can be exploited to design a better and\nprincipled method for task-id prediction. We call the new method TPLR (Task-id\nPrediction based on Likelihood Ratio}). TPLR markedly outperforms strong CIL\nbaselines.",

            "summary": "Purely medical cancer screening methods are often costly, time-consuming, and\nweakly applicable on a large scale. Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nmethods greatly help cancer detection but require specific or deep medical\ndata. These aspects affect the mass implementation of cancer screening methods.\nFor these reasons, it is a disruptive change for healthcare to apply AI methods\nfor mass personalized assessment of the cancer risk among patients based on the\nexisting Electronic Health Records (EHR) volume.\n  This paper presents a novel method for mass cancer risk prediction using EHR\ndata. Among other methods, our one stands out by the minimum data greedy\npolicy, requiring only a history of medical service codes and diagnoses from\nEHR. We formulate the problem as a binary classification. This dataset contains\n175 441 de-identified patients (2 861 diagnosed with cancer). As a baseline, we\nimplement a solution based on a recurrent neural network (RNN). We propose a\nmethod that combines machine learning and survival analysis since these\napproaches are less computationally heavy, can be combined into an ensemble\n(the Survival Ensemble), and can be reproduced in most medical institutions.\n  We test the Survival Ensemble in some studies. Firstly, we obtain a\nsignificant difference between values of the primary metric (Average Precision)\nwith 22.8% (ROC AUC 83.7%, F1 17.8%) for the Survival Ensemble versus 15.1%\n(ROC AUC 84.9%, F1 21.4%) for the Baseline. Secondly, the performance of the\nSurvival Ensemble is also confirmed during the ablation study. Thirdly, our\nmethod exceeds age baselines by a significant margin. Fourthly, in the blind\nretrospective out-of-time experiment, the proposed method is reliable in cancer\npatient detection (9 out of 100 selected). Such results exceed the estimates of\nmedical screenings, e.g., the best Number Needed to Screen (9 out of 1000\nscreenings).",

We consider a one-shot communication over a channel with\ncorrelated Rayleigh fading and colored Gaussian noise. We first provide a\ntheoretical analysis on the limitations of non-negative pulse-amplitude\nmodulation (PAM) in systems of this kind, based on maximum likelihood\ndetection. The existence of a fundamental error floor at high signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) regimes is proved for constellations with more than two energy\nlevels, when no (statistical) channel state information is available at the\ntransmitter. In the main body of the paper, we present a design framework for\nquadratic detectors that generalizes the widely-used energy detector, to better\nexploit the statistical knowledge of the channel. This allows us to design\nreceivers optimized according to information-theoretic criteria that exhibit\nlower error rates at moderate and high SNR. We subsequently derive an analytic\napproximation for the error probability of a general class of quadratic\ndetectors in the large array regime. Finally, we introduce an improved\nreception scheme based on the combination of quadratic detectors and assess its\ncapabilities numerically.",

We further probe the trained networks to\nreveal representational biases in different visual areas, generate\nexperimentally testable hypotheses, and formulate an interpretable metric to\nassociate these hypotheses with cortical functions.

Numerous deepfake detection methods are thus proposed.\nHowever, existing methods only focus on detecting one-step facial manipulation.\nAs the emergence of easy-accessible facial editing applications, people can\neasily manipulate facial components using multi-step operations in a sequential\nmanner. This new threat requires us to detect a sequence of facial\nmanipulations, which is vital for both detecting deepfake media and recovering\noriginal faces afterwards. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need\nand propose a novel research problem called Detecting Sequential DeepFake\nManipulation (Seq-DeepFake). Unlike the existing deepfake detection task only\ndemanding a binary label prediction, detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation\nrequires correctly predicting a sequential vector of facial manipulation\noperations. To support a large-scale investigation, we construct the first\nSeq-DeepFake dataset, where face images are manipulated sequentially with\ncorresponding annotations of sequential facial manipulation vectors. Based on\nthis new dataset, we cast detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation as a specific\nimage-to-sequence task and propose a concise yet effective Seq-DeepFake\nTransformer (SeqFakeFormer). To better reflect real-world deepfake data\ndistributions, we further apply various perturbations on the original\nSeq-DeepFake dataset and construct the more challenging Sequential DeepFake\ndataset with perturbations (Seq-DeepFake-P). To exploit deeper correlation\nbetween images and sequences when facing Seq-DeepFake-P, a dedicated\nSeq-DeepFake Transformer with Image-Sequence Reasoning (SeqFakeFormer++) is\ndevised, which builds stronger correspondence between image-sequence pairs for\nmore robust Seq-DeepFake detection.",

It gives us the\npossibility to evaluate the receding and advancing wetting angle accurately.\nWith our modeling, we found that the interplay between capillary forces and\nviscous forces is crucial to characterize the droplet shape at the nanoscale.\nIn this frame, the importance of the rolling movement of the interface between\nliquid and vapor was pointed out. We also demonstrate that in the range of the\nexternal forces when capillary forces are most significant compared to others,\nhysteresis is well described by the macroscale Cox-Voinov model.",

Then, filter and refine all the\npredictions from different detectors in the mixture. We term this approach as\nMoCaE and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on object\ndetection, instance segmentation and rotated object detection tasks.\nSpecifically, MoCaE improves (i) three strong object detectors on COCO test-dev\nby $2.4$ $\\mathrm{AP}$ by reaching $59.0$ $\\mathrm{AP}$; (ii) instance\nsegmentation methods on the challenging long-tailed LVIS dataset by $2.3$\n$\\mathrm{AP}$; and (iii) all existing rotated object detectors by reaching\n$82.62$ $\\mathrm{AP_{50}}$ on DOTA dataset, establishing a new state-of-the-art\n(SOTA).

In this work, we\ncomprehensively explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in\ncosmological parameter estimations by considering the 3G GW detectors and the\nfuture short $\\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector THESEUS-like telescope joint\nobservations. Based on the 10-year observation of different detection\nstrategies, we predict that the numbers of detectable GW-GRB events are 277-685\nwith the redshifts $z<4$ and the inclination angles $\\iota<17^{\\circ}$. For the\ncosmological analysis, we consider five typical dark energy models, i.e., the\n$\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM models, and interacting dark energy (IDE)\nmodels (I$\\Lambda$CDM and I$w$CDM). We find that GW can tightly constrain the\nHubble constant with precisions of $0.09\\%$-$0.37\\%$, but perform not well in\nconstraining other cosmological parameters. Fortunately, GW could effectively\nbreak the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM\nobservations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). When combining the mock GW data with the CBS\ndata, CBS+GW can tightly constrain the equation of state parameter of dark\nenergy $w$ with a precision of $1.36\\%$, close to the standard of precision\ncosmology. Meanwhile, the addition of GW to CBS could improve constraints on\ncosmological parameters by $35.3\\%$-$92.0\\%$. In conclusion, GW standard siren\nobservations from 3G GW detectors could play a crucial role in helping solve\nthe Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.",

            "summary": "Accurate trajectory prediction (TP) for climbing aircraft is hampered by the\npresence of epistemic uncertainties concerning aircraft operation, which can\nlead to significant misspecification between predicted and observed\ntrajectories. This paper proposes a generative model for climbing aircraft in\nwhich the standard Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model is enriched by a\nfunctional correction to the thrust that is learned from data. The method\noffers three features: predictions of the arrival time with 66.3% less error\nwhen compared to BADA; generated trajectories that are realistic when compared\nto test data; and a means of computing confidence bounds for minimal\ncomputational cost.",

            "summary": "We study the origin of dichroic effects in elastic scattering of high energy\nelectrons by hydrogen atoms in the presence of a two-color bicircular laser\nfield of commensurate frequencies, in the domain of moderate intensities below\n10 TW/cm2 . We use a semiperturbative approach in which the interaction of the\nhydrogen atom with the laser field is treated in second-order perturbation\ntheory, while the interaction of the projectile electron with the laser field\nis described by Gordon- Volkov wave functions. An analytical formula of\ncircular dichroism in the angular distribution of scattered electrons is\nderived in the weak-field domain for a two-color laser field that is a\ncombination of the fundamental and its third harmonic. A comparison between the\ntwo-photon differential cross sections for two-color co- and counterrotating\ncircularly polarized laser fields is made and the effect of the intensity ratio\nof the monochromatic field components on the circular dichroism is\ninvestigated. The dichroic effect in the angular distribution of scattered\nelectrons for two-photon absorption is analyzed as a function of the scattering\nand azimuthal angles. We show that the two-color bicircular laser field can\ninduce a strong circular dichroism in the angular distribution of scattered\nelectrons at small scattering angles where the atomic dressing effects are\nimportant, as well at larger scattering angles. At small scattering angles we\ndemonstrate that the dichroic effect for two-photon transitions can be\npredicted under the following conditions: the scattering process is treated in\nfist-order Born approximation and the dressing of the atomic states by the\nlaser field is carried out at least in first-order time-dependent perturbation\ntheory.",

We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that\nallows learning superior target models with few-shot unlabelled target samples.\nNtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted\npseudo-labels of the few-shot unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It\nconsists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation\nthat combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to\ntheir prediction confidence. The second is pseudo-label rectification, which\ncorrects both pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging\nknowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models.

When\nusing empirical force fields - the most popular computational methods applied\nto such systems - vdW forces are typically described by Lennard-Jones-like\npotentials, which unfortunately have a limited predictive power. Here, we\npresent a universal parameterization of a quantum-mechanical vdW potential,\nwhich requires only two free-atom properties - the static dipole polarizability\n$\\alpha_1$ and the dipole-dipole $C_6$ dispersion coefficient. This is achieved\nby deriving the functional form of the potential from the quantum Drude\noscillator (QDO) model, employing scaling laws for the equilibrium distance and\nthe binding energy as well as applying the microscopic law of corresponding\nstates. The vdW-QDO potential is shown to be accurate for vdW binding energy\ncurves, as demonstrated by comparing to ab initio binding curves of 21\nnoble-gas dimers. The functional form of the vdW-QDO potential has the correct\nasymptotic behavior both at zero and infinite distances. In addition, it is\nshown that the damped vdW-QDO potential can accurately describe vdW\ninteractions in dimers consisting of group II elements. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe applicability of the atom-in-molecule vdW-QDO model for predicting accurate\ndispersion energies for molecular systems.

Achieving the expressive performances demanded in\nentertainment requires manipulating complex models with hundreds of parameters.\nFull creative control requires the freedom to make edits at any stage of the\nproduction, which prohibits the use of a fully automatic ``black box'' solution\nwith uninterpretable parameters. On the other hand, producing realistic\nanimation with these sophisticated models is difficult and laborious. This\npaper describes FDLS (Facial Deep Learning Solver), which is Weta Digital's\nsolution to these challenges. FDLS adopts a coarse-to-fine and\nhuman-in-the-loop strategy, allowing a solved performance to be verified and\nedited at several stages in the solving process. To train FDLS, we first\ntransform the raw motion-captured data into robust graph features. Secondly,\nbased on the observation that the artists typically finalize the jaw pass\nanimation before proceeding to finer detail, we solve for the jaw motion first\nand predict fine expressions with region-based networks conditioned on the jaw\nposition. Finally, artists can optionally invoke a non-linear finetuning\nprocess on top of the FDLS solution to follow the motion-captured virtual\nmarkers as closely as possible. FDLS supports editing if needed to improve the\nresults of the deep learning solution and it can handle small daily changes in\nthe actor's face shape. FDLS permits reliable and production-quality\nperformance solving with minimal training and little or no manual effort in\nmany cases, while also allowing the solve to be guided and edited in unusual\nand difficult cases.

For planar graphs,\nthis is arguably the simplest ``2D random walk model'', and proving the\nconvergence of such models to the Gaussian free field (GFF) is a major open\nquestion. Our main result is that for subgraphs of the honeycomb lattice (and\nsome other cubic planar lattices), with flat boundary conditions and $1 \\leq\n\\mathbf{ c } \\leq 2$, such functions exhibit logarithmic variations. This is in\nline with the GFF prediction and improves a non-quantitative delocalization\nresult by P. Lammers. The proof goes via level-set percolation arguments,\nincluding a renormalization inequality and a dichotomy theorem for level-set\nloops. In another direction, we show that random Lipschitz functions have\nbounded variance whenever the wired FK-Ising model with $p=1-1/\\mathbf{c}$\npercolates on the same lattice (corresponding to $\\mathbf{c} > 2 + \\sqrt{3}$ on\nthe honeycomb lattice). Via a simple coupling, this also implies, perhaps\nsurprisingly, that random homomorphisms are localized on the rhombille lattice.",

            "summary": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a critical task in online advertising\nand recommendation systems, as accurate predictions are essential for user\ntargeting and personalized recommendations. Most recent cutting-edge methods\nprimarily focus on investigating complex implicit and explicit feature\ninteractions. However, these methods neglect the issue of false correlations\ncaused by confounding factors or selection bias. This problem is further\nmagnified by the complexity and redundancy of these interactions. We propose a\nCTR prediction framework that removes false correlation in multi-level feature\ninteraction, termed REFORM. The proposed REFORM framework exploits a wide range\nof multi-level high-order feature representations via a two-stream stacked\nrecurrent structure while eliminating false correlations. The framework has two\nkey components: I. The multi-level stacked recurrent (MSR) structure enables\nthe model to efficiently capture diverse nonlinear interactions from feature\nspaces of different levels, and the richer representations lead to enhanced CTR\nprediction accuracy. II. The false correlation elimination (FCE) module further\nleverages Laplacian kernel mapping and sample reweighting methods to eliminate\nfalse correlations concealed within the multi-level features, allowing the\nmodel to focus on the true causal effects. Extensive experiments based on four\nchallenging CTR datasets and our production dataset demonstrate that the\nproposed REFORM model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Codes, models and\nour dataset will be released at https://github.com/yansuoyuli/REFORM.",

Our method involves independently lifting\neach subject's 2D pose to 3D, before combining them in a shared 3D coordinate\nsystem.

The phenomenological impacts of\n$\\rm{{NNLO}_A+\\overline{{NNLL}}}$ predictions for 13 TeV LHC are studied. We\nobserve that, for $m_A$ =125(700) GeV, the SV+NSV resummation at $\\rm{\n\\overline{NNLL}}$ level brings about 14.76\\% (11.48\\%) corrections to the\n$\\rm{NNLO}_A$ results at the central scale value of $\\mu_R=\\mu_F=m_A$. Further,\nwe find that the sensitivity to the renormalisation scale gets improved\nsubstantially by the inclusion of NSV resummed predictions at $\\rm\n\\overline{NNLL}$ accuracy.",

Among various tools for robot imitation learning, supervised\nlearning has been observed to have a prominent role. Structured prediction is a\nform of supervised learning that enables learning models to operate on output\nspaces with complex structures. Through the lens of structured prediction, we\nshow how robots can learn to imitate trajectories belonging to not only\nEuclidean spaces but also Riemannian manifolds. Exploiting ideas from\ninformation theory, we propose a class of loss functions based on the\nf-divergence to measure the information loss between the demonstrated and\nreproduced probabilistic trajectories. Different types of f-divergence will\nresult in different policies, which we call imitation modes. Furthermore, our\napproach enables the incorporation of spatial and temporal trajectory\nmodulation, which is necessary for robots to be adaptive to the change in\nworking conditions. We benchmark our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods\nin terms of trajectory reproduction and adaptation. The quantitative evaluation\nshows that our approach outperforms other algorithms regarding both accuracy\nand efficiency. We also report real-world experimental results on learning\nmanifold trajectories in a polishing task with a KUKA LWR robot arm,\nillustrating the effectiveness of our algorithmic framework.",

This allows us to \"rank\" the different approaches in\ndecreasing order of accuracy as follows: IReD, DNMR, second-order gradient\nexpansion, and 14-moment approximation. We find that IReD theory is far\nsuperior to Navier-Stokes, being very accurate both in the asymptotic regime\n(i.e. for slow processes) and in the transient regime (i.e. on timescales\ncomparable to the relaxation time). Also, the high accuracy of DNMR is\nconfirmed, but neglecting second-order terms in the Knudsen number, which would\nrender the equations parabolic, introduces serious systematic errors. Finally,\nsecond-order gradient expansion (a.k.a. non-resummed BRSSS) is shown to be more\ninaccurate than Navier-Stokes in the transient regime. Overall, this analysis\nclearly shows that Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics is falsifiable, and the\nrelaxation time is observable, thereby ending the debate on the viability of\ntransient hydrodynamics as a well-defined physical theory distinguished from\nNavier-Stokes.",

The\nsimulation experiments prove that the CSKPF method can improve the tracking\nintegrity, continuity, and precision compared with the existing constant\nvelocity based particle filter (CVPF) method.

Unlike previous SSL methods which focus on exploring highly\nconfident pseudo-labels or developing consistency regularization schemes, our\nempirical findings suggest that inconsistent decoder features emerge naturally\nwhen two decoders strive to generate consistent predictions. Based on the\nobservation, we first analyze the treasure of discrepancy in learning towards\nconsistency, under both pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization\nsettings, and subsequently propose a novel SSL method called LeFeD, which\nlearns the feature-level discrepancy obtained from two decoders, by feeding the\ndiscrepancy as a feedback signal to the encoder. The core design of LeFeD is to\nenlarge the difference by training differentiated decoders, and then learn from\nthe inconsistent information iteratively. We evaluate LeFeD against eight\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three public datasets. Experiments show\nLeFeD surpasses competitors without any bells and whistles such as uncertainty\nestimation and strong constraints, as well as setting a new state-of-the-art\nfor semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

The same energy source also appears to lower the central density\nand raise the cooling time of baryonic atmospheres in massive halos, thereby\nlimiting both star formation and black hole growth, by lifting the baryons in\nthose halos to greater altitudes. One predicted signature of that feedback\nmechanism is a nearly linear relationship between the central black hole's mass\n(MBH) and the original binding energy of the halo's baryons. We present the\nincreasingly strong observational evidence supporting a such a relationship,\nshowing that it extends up to halos of mass Mhalo ~10^14 MSun. We then compare\ncurrent observational constraints on the MBH--Mhalo relation with numerical\nsimulations, finding that black hole masses in IllustrisTNG appear to exceed\nthose constraints at Mhalo < 10^13 MSun and that black hole masses in EAGLE\nfall short of observations at Mhalo ~ 10^14 MSun. A closer look at IllustrisTNG\nshows that quenching of star formation and suppression of black hole growth do\nindeed coincide with black hole energy input that lifts the halo's baryons.\nHowever, IllustrisTNG does not reproduce the observed MBH--Mhalo relation\nbecause its black holes gain mass primarily through accretion that does not\ncontribute to baryon lifting. We suggest adjustments to some of the parameters\nin the IllustrisTNG feedback algorithm that may allow the resulting black hole\nmasses to reflect the inherent links between black hole growth, baryon lifting,\nand star formation among the massive galaxies in those simulations.",

            "summary": "Spontaneous emission and internal conversion rates are calculated within\nharmonic approximations and compared to results obtained within the\nsemi-classical extended thawed Gaussian approximation. This is the first\napplication of the ETGA in the calculation of internal conversion and emission\nrates for real molecular systems, namely formaldehyde, fluorobenzene, azulene\nand a dicyano-squaraine dye. The viability of the models as black-box tools for\nprediction of spontaneous emission and internal conversion rates is assessed.\nAll calculations were done using a consistent protocol in order to investigate\nhow different methods perform without previous experimental knowledge.\nContrasting the results with experimental data shows that there are further\nimprovements required before theoretical predictions of emission and internal\nconversion rates can be used as reliable indicator for the photo-luminescence\nproperties of molecules. We find that the extended thawed Gaussian\napproximation performs rather similar to the vertical harmonical model.\nIncluding anharmonicities in the calculation of internal conversion rates has a\nmoderate effect on the quantitative results in the studied systems. The\nelectronic structure calculations were done using the B3LYP, PBE0,\n$\\omega$B97XD and CAM-B3LYP functionals. The choice of the functional does not\nappear to be a major limiting factor for a black-box approach, when it comes to\nthe prediction of radiative and nonradiative rates for organic molecules. The\nemission rates are fairly stable with respect to computational parameters, but\nthe internal conversion rate reveals itself to be highly dependent on the\nchoice of the spectral lineshape function, particularly the width of the\nLorentzian function, associated with homogeneous broadening.",

            "summary": "Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) is a task that aims to detect\nthe most salient object in a video without external guidance about the object.\nTo leverage the property that salient objects usually have distinctive\nmovements compared to the background, recent methods collaboratively use motion\ncues extracted from optical flow maps with appearance cues extracted from RGB\nimages. However, as optical flow maps are usually very relevant to segmentation\nmasks, the network is easy to be learned overly dependent on the motion cues\nduring network training. As a result, such two-stream approaches are vulnerable\nto confusing motion cues, making their prediction unstable. To relieve this\nissue, we design a novel motion-as-option network by treating motion cues as\noptional. During network training, RGB images are randomly provided to the\nmotion encoder instead of optical flow maps, to implicitly reduce motion\ndependency of the network. As the learned motion encoder can deal with both RGB\nimages and optical flow maps, two different predictions can be generated\ndepending on which source information is used as motion input. In order to\nfully exploit this property, we also propose an adaptive output selection\nalgorithm to adopt optimal prediction result at test time.

To unleash the power of LLMs in\nfew-shot learning scenarios, we introduce a novel Knowledgeable In-Context\nTuning (KICT) framework to further improve the performance of ICL: 1) injecting\nfactual knowledge to LLMs during continual self-supervised pre-training, 2)\njudiciously selecting the examples with high knowledge relevance, and 3)\ncalibrating the prediction results based on prior knowledge. We evaluate the\nproposed approaches on auto-regressive LLMs (e.g., GPT-style models) over\nmultiple text classification and question answering tasks.

Specifically, we\npresent a novel knowledge distillation framework, named ADU-Depth, with the\ngoal of leveraging the well-trained teacher network to guide the learning of\nthe student network, thus boosting the precise depth estimation with the help\nof extra spatial scene information. To enable domain adaptation and ensure\neffective and smooth knowledge transfer from teacher to student, we apply both\nattention-adapted feature distillation and focal-depth-adapted response\ndistillation in the training stage. In addition, we explicitly model the\nuncertainty of depth estimation to guide distillation in both feature space and\nresult space to better produce 3D-aware knowledge from monocular observations\nand thus enhance the learning for hard-to-predict image regions.

            "summary": "Cryptocurrency has been subject to illicit activities probably more often\nthan traditional financial assets due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of its\ntransacting entities. An ideal detection model is expected to achieve all three\ncritical properties of (I) early detection, (II) good interpretability, and\n(III) versatility for various illicit activities. However, existing solutions\ncannot meet all these requirements, as most of them heavily rely on deep\nlearning without interpretability and are only available for retrospective\nanalysis of a specific illicit type. To tackle all these challenges, we propose\nIntention-Monitor for early malice detection in Bitcoin (BTC), where the\non-chain record data for a certain address are much scarcer than other\ncryptocurrency platforms. We first define asset transfer paths with the\nDecision-Tree based feature Selection and Complement (DT-SC) to build different\nfeature sets for different malice types. Then, the Status/Action Proposal\nModule (S/A-PM) and the Intention-VAE module generate the status, action,\nintent-snippet, and hidden intent-snippet embedding. With all these modules,\nour model is highly interpretable and can detect various illegal activities.\nMoreover, well-designed loss functions further enhance the prediction speed and\nmodel's interpretability. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Furthermore, additional case studies justify our model can not only\nexplain existing illicit patterns but can also find new suspicious characters.",

In this\npaper, we propose a tile classification based viewport prediction method with\nMulti-modal Fusion Transformer, namely MFTR. Specifically, MFTR utilizes\ntransformer-based networks to extract the long-range dependencies within each\nmodality, then mine intra- and inter-modality relations to capture the combined\nimpact of user historical inputs and video contents on future viewport\nselection. In addition, MFTR categorizes future tiles into two categories: user\ninterested or not, and selects future viewport as the region that contains most\nuser interested tiles. Comparing with predicting head trajectories, choosing\nfuture viewport based on tile's binary classification results exhibits better\nrobustness and interpretability. To evaluate our proposed MFTR, we conduct\nextensive experiments on two widely used PVS-HM and Xu-Gaze dataset. MFTR shows\nsuperior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of average\nprediction accuracy and overlap ratio, also presents competitive computation\nefficiency.",

            "summary": "In rapidly sprawling urban areas and booming intercity express rail networks,\nefficiently designed feeder bus systems are more essential than ever to\ntransport passengers to and from trunk-line rail terminals. When the feeder\nservice region is sufficiently large, the spatial heterogeneity in demand\ndistribution must be considered. This paper develops continuous approximation\nmodels for optimizing a heterogeneous fixed-route feeder network in a\nrectangular service region next to a rail terminal. Our work enhances previous\nstudies by: (i) optimizing heterogeneous stop spacings along with line spacings\nand headways; (ii) accounting for passenger boarding and alighting numbers on\nbus dwell times and patron transfer delays at the rail terminal; and (iii)\nexamining the advantages of asymmetric coordination between trunk and feeder\nschedules in both service directions. To tackle the increased modeling\ncomplexity, we introduce a semi-analytical method that combines analytically\nderived properties of the optimal solution with an iterative search algorithm.\nLocal transit agencies can readily utilize this approach to design a real\nfixed-route feeder system. This paper reveals many findings and insights not\npreviously reported. For instance, integrating the heterogeneous stop spacing\noptimization further reduces the system cost (by 4% under specific operating\nconditions). The cost savings increase with demand heterogeneity but decrease\nwith the demand rate and service region size. Choosing the layout of feeder\nlines where buses pick up and drop off passengers along the service region's\nshorter side also significantly lowers the system cost (by 6% when the service\nregion's aspect ratio is 1 to 2). Furthermore, coordinating trunk and feeder\nschedules in both service directions yields an additional cost saving of up to\n20%.",

            "summary": "With the growing demand for vision applications and deployment across edge\ndevices, the development of hardware-friendly architectures that maintain\nperformance during device deployment becomes crucial. Neural architecture\nsearch (NAS) techniques explore various approaches to discover efficient\narchitectures for diverse learning tasks in a computationally efficient manner.\nIn this paper, we present the next-generation neural architecture design for\ncomputationally efficient neural architecture distillation - DONNAv2 .\nConventional NAS algorithms rely on a computationally extensive stage where an\naccuracy predictor is learned to estimate model performance within search\nspace. This building of accuracy predictors helps them predict the performance\nof models that are not being finetuned. Here, we have developed an elegant\napproach to eliminate building the accuracy predictor and extend DONNA to a\ncomputationally efficient setting. The loss metric of individual blocks forming\nthe network serves as the surrogate performance measure for the sampled models\nin the NAS search stage. To validate the performance of DONNAv2 we have\nperformed extensive experiments involving a range of diverse vision tasks\nincluding classification, object detection, image denoising, super-resolution,\nand panoptic perception network (YOLOP). The hardware-in-the-loop experiments\nwere carried out using the Samsung Galaxy S10 mobile platform. Notably, DONNAv2\nreduces the computational cost of DONNA by 10x for the larger datasets.\nFurthermore, to improve the quality of NAS search space, DONNAv2 leverages a\nblock knowledge distillation filter to remove blocks with high inference costs.",

            "summary": "We investigate the geometrodynamical effects of introducing the boundary term\nin symmetric teleparallel gravity. Specifically, we consider a homogeneous and\nisotropic universe in $f\\left( Q, B \\right) $, where $Q$ is the non-metricity\nscalar, and $B$ is the boundary term that relates the non-metricity and Ricci\nscalars. For the connection in the coincidence gauge, we find that the field\nequations are of fourth-order, and the fluid components introduced by the\nboundary are attributed to a scalar field. In the coincidence gauge, the\ncosmological field equations are equivalent to those of teleparallelism with a\nboundary term. Nevertheless, for the connection defined in the non-coincidence\ngauge, the geometrodynamical fluid consists of three scalar fields. We focus on\nthe special case of $f\\left( Q, B \\right) = Q + F\\left( B \\right) $ theory, and\nwe determine a new analytic cosmological solution that can explain the\nlate-time acceleration of the universe and provide a geometric mechanism for\nthe unification of dark energy with dark matter.",

These proposed potentials encompass microscopic-scale bond-breaking\nprocesses. The development of a thermodynamically consistent micro-macro model\nis revisited, employing the energy variational method. To validate the model's\npredictions, we conduct numerical simulations utilizing a deterministic\nparticle-FEM method. Our numerical findings shed light on the distinct\nbehaviors exhibited by polymer chains at the micro-scale in comparison to the\nmacro-scale velocity and induced shear stresses of fluids under shear flow.\nNotably, we observe that polymer elongation, rotation, and bond breaking\ncontribute to the zero polymer-induced stress in the micro-macro model when\nemploying Morse and Elastic-plastic potentials. Furthermore, at high shear\nrates, polymer rotation is found to induce shear-thinning behavior in the model\nemploying the classical Hookean potential.",

Confidence intervals are an\nindication of how accurate the sample F1 score is. However, most studies either\ndo not report them or report them using methods that demonstrate poor\nstatistical properties. In the present study, I review current analytical\nmethods (i.e., Clopper-Pearson method and Wald method) to construct confidence\nintervals for the population F1 score, propose two new analytical methods\n(i.e., Wilson direct method and Wilson indirect method) to do so, and compare\nthese methods based on their coverage probabilities and interval lengths, as\nwell as whether these methods suffer from overshoot and degeneracy. Theoretical\nresults demonstrate that both proposed methods do not suffer from overshoot and\ndegeneracy. Experimental results suggest that both proposed methods perform\nbetter, as compared to current methods, in terms of coverage probabilities and\ninterval lengths. I illustrate both current and proposed methods on two\nsuggestion mining tasks. I discuss the practical implications of these results,\nand suggest areas for future research.",

            "summary": "Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has garnered significant\nattention in recent years due to its potential to predict complex semantics and\ngeometry shapes from a single image, requiring no 3D inputs. In this paper, we\nidentify several critical issues in current state-of-the-art methods, including\nthe Feature Ambiguity of projected 2D features in the ray to the 3D space, the\nPose Ambiguity of the 3D convolution, and the Computation Imbalance in the 3D\nconvolution across different depth levels. To address these problems, we devise\na novel Normalized Device Coordinates scene completion network (NDC-Scene) that\ndirectly extends the 2D feature map to a Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC)\nspace, rather than to the world space directly, through progressive restoration\nof the dimension of depth with deconvolution operations. Experiment results\ndemonstrate that transferring the majority of computation from the target 3D\nspace to the proposed normalized device coordinates space benefits monocular\nSSC tasks. Additionally, we design a Depth-Adaptive Dual Decoder to\nsimultaneously upsample and fuse the 2D and 3D feature maps, further improving\noverall performance. Our extensive experiments confirm that the proposed method\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both outdoor SemanticKITTI\nand indoor NYUv2 datasets.

            "summary": "Industrial demand response (IDR) plays an important role in promoting the\nutilization of renewable energy (RE) in power systems. However, it will lead to\npower adjustments on the supply side, which is also a non-negligible factor in\naffecting RE utilization. To comprehensively analyze this impact while\nenhancing RE utilization, this paper proposes a power demand-supply cooperative\nresponse (PDSCR) strategy based on both day-ahead and intraday time scales. The\nday-ahead PDSCR determines a long-term scheme for responding to the predictable\ntrends in RE supply. However, this long-term scheme may not be suitable when\nuncertain RE fluctuations occur on an intraday basis. Regarding intraday PDSCR,\nwe formulate a profit-driven cooperation approach to address the issue of RE\nfluctuations. In this context, unreasonable profit distributions on the\ndemand-supply side would lead to the conflict of interests and diminish the\neffectiveness of cooperative responses. To mitigate this issue, we derive\nmulti-individual profit distribution marginal solutions (MIPDMSs) based on\nsatisfactory profit distributions, which can also maximize cooperative profits.\nCase studies are conducted on an modified IEEE 24-bus system and an actual\npower system in China. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nstrategy for enhancing RE utilization, via optimizing the coordination of IDR\nflexibility with generation resources.",

This means some\nmechanism must be at work that favors their emergence. Most previous\nexplanations however need to resort to some factors based upon imitative\nlearning, a simple version of social learning. Here, we turn to the paradigm of\nreinforcement learning, where individuals update their strategies by evaluating\nthe long-term return through accumulated experience. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the trust game with the Q-learning algorithm, where each\nparticipant is associated with two evolving Q-tables that guide one's decision\nmaking as trustor and trustee respectively. In the pairwise scenario, we reveal\nthat high levels of trust and trustworthiness emerge when individuals\nappreciate both their historical experience and returns in the future.\nMechanistically, the evolution of the Q-tables shows a crossover that resembles\nhuman's psychological changes. We also provide the phase diagram for the game\nparameters, where the boundary analysis is conducted. These findings are robust\nwhen the scenario is extended to a latticed population. Our results thus\nprovide a natural explanation for the emergence of trust and trustworthiness\nwithout external factors involved.

Understanding the structure and\ncharacteristics of this kind of data is important when predicting the atomic\ncomposition from the properties in inverse molecular designs. Intrinsic\ndimension analysis, clustering, and outlier detection methods were used in the\nstudy. They revealed that for both datasets the intrinsic dimensionality is\nseveral times smaller than the descriptive dimensions. The QM7b data is\ncomposed of well defined clusters related to atomic composition. The QM9 data\nconsists of an outer region predominantly composed of outliers, and an inner\ncore region that concentrates clustered, inliner objects. A significant\nrelationship exists between the number of atoms in the molecule and its\noutlier/inner nature. Despite the structural differences, the predictability of\nvariables of interest for inverse molecular design is high. This is exemplified\nwith models estimating the number of atoms of the molecule from both the\noriginal properties, and from lower dimensional embedding spaces.",

For this purpose, we study two models, the nearest-neighbor\nmodel on a square lattice, and the more tractable mean-field model\ncorresponding to infinite-ranged coupling between all sites. In the\nhigh-temperature limit, we show that the logarithm of the Yang-Lee zeros can be\nwritten as a series in half odd integer powers of the inverse temperature, $k$,\nwith the leading term $\\sim k^{1/2}$. This result is true in any dimension and\nfor arbitrary lattices. We also show that the coefficients of the expansion\nsatisfy simple identities (akin to sum rules) for the nearest-neighbor case.\nThese new identities are verified numerically by computing the exact partition\nfunction for a 2D square lattice of size $16\\times16$. For the mean-field\nmodel, we write down the partition function (termed the mean-field polynomials)\nfor the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) cases, and derive from\nthem the mean-field equations. We analytically show that at high temperatures\nthe zeros of the AFM mean-field polynomial scale as $\\sim k^{1/2}$ as well.\nUsing a simple numerical method, we find the roots lie on certain curves (the\nroot curves), in the thermodynamic limit for the mean-field polynomials for the\nAFM case as well as for the FM one. Our results show a new root curve, that was\nnot found earlier. Our results also clearly illustrate the phase transition\nexpected for the FM and AFM cases, in the language of Yang-Lee zeros. Moreover,\nfor the AFM case, we observe that the root curves separate two distinct phases\nof zero and non-zero complex staggered magnetization, and thus depict a complex\nphase boundary.",

Results: The obtained information from the proposed\napproach will help decision-makers and supply chain practitioners make\nappropriate decisions aiming at minimizing negative impact of disruptive events\nbased on real-time disruption detection data. The results demonstrate the\ntrade-off between disruption detection model sensitivity, encountered delay in\ndisruption detection, and false alarms.

            "summary": "This research aims to evaluate the performance of the rotors and study the\nbehavior of the human driver in interacting with the rotors. In recent years,\nrotors have been increasingly used between countries due to their safety,\ncapacity, and environmental advantages, and because they provide safe and fluid\nflows of vehicles for transit and integration. It turns out that roundabouts\ncan significantly reduce speed at twisting intersections, entry speed and the\nresulting effect on speed depends on the rating of road users. In our research,\n(bus, car, truck) drivers were given special attention and their behavior was\ncategorized into (conservative, normal, aggressive). Anticipating and\nrecognizing driver behavior is an important challenge. Therefore, the aim of\nthis research is to study the effect of roundabouts on these classifiers and to\ndevelop a method for predicting the behavior of road users at roundabout\nintersections. Safety is primarily due to two inherent features of the rotor.\nFirst, by comparing the data collected and processed in order to classify and\nevaluate drivers' behavior, and comparing the speeds of the drivers (bus, car\nand truck), the speed of motorists at crossing the roundabout was more fit than\nthat of buses and trucks. We looked because the car is smaller and all parts of\nthe rotor are visible to it. So drivers coming from all directions have to slow\ndown, giving them more time to react and mitigating the consequences in the\nevent of an accident. Second, with fewer conflicting flows (and points of\nconflict), drivers only need to look to their left (in right-hand traffic) for\nother vehicles, making their job of crossing the roundabout easier as there is\nless need to split attention between different directions.",

            "summary": "The transport of biomolecules, drugs, or reactants encapsulated inside\nstimuli-responsive polymer networks in aqueous media is fundamental for many\nmaterial and environmental science applications, including drug delivery,\nbiosensing, catalysis, nanofiltration, water purification, and desalination.\nThe transport is particularly complex in dense polymer media, such as collapsed\nhydrogels, where the molecules strongly interact with the polymer network and\ndiffuse via a hopping mechanism. In this study, we employ Dynamical Density\nFunctional Theory (DDFT) to investigate the non-equilibrium release kinetics of\nnon-ionic subnanometer-sized molecules initially uploaded inside collapsed\nmicrogel particles. The theory is consistent with previous molecular dynamics\nsimulations of collapsed poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) polymer\nmatrices, accommodating molecules of varying shapes and sizes. We found that,\ndespite the intricate physico-chemical properties involved in the released\nprocess, the kinetics is predominantly dictated by two material parameters: the\ndiffusion coefficient of the molecules inside the microgel ($D^*$) and the\ninteraction free energy of the molecules with the microgel ($\\Delta G$). Our\nresults reveal two distinct limiting regimes: For large, slowly diffusing\nmolecules weakly attracted to the polymer network, the release is primarily\ndriven by diffusion, with a release time that scales as $\\tau_{1/2} \\sim\n1/D^*$. Conversely, for small molecules strongly attracted to the polymer\nnetwork, the release time is dominated by the interaction, scaling as\n$\\tau_{1/2} \\sim \\exp(-\\Delta G/k_{\\textrm{B}} T)$. Our DDFT calculations are\ndirectly compared with an analytical equation for the half-release time,\ndemonstrating excellent quantitative agreement. This equation represents a\nvaluable tool for predicting release kinetics of non-ionic molecules from\ncollapsed microgels.",

            "summary": "Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) form a critical component of Space Weather.\nThe complex, intertwined dynamics of SEP sources, acceleration, and transport\nmake their forecasting very challenging. Yet, information about SEP arrival and\ntheir properties (e.g., peak flux) is crucial for space exploration on many\nfronts. We have recently introduced a novel probabilistic ensemble model called\nthe Multivariate Ensemble of Models for Probabilistic Forecast of Solar\nEnergetic Particles (MEMPSEP). Its primary aim is to forecast the occurrence\nand physical properties of SEPs. The occurrence forecasting, thoroughly\ndiscussed in a preceding paper (Chatterjee et al., 2023), is complemented by\nthe work presented here, which focuses on forecasting the physical properties\nof SEPs. The MEMPSEP model relies on an ensemble of Convolutional Neural\nNetworks, which leverage a multi-variate dataset comprising full-disc\nmagnetogram sequences and numerous derived and in-situ data from various\nsources. Skill scores demonstrate that MEMPSEP exhibits improved predictions on\nSEP properties for the test set data with SEP occurrence probability above 50%,\ncompared to those with a probability below 50%. Results present a promising\napproach to address the challenging task of forecasting SEP physical\nproperties, thus improving our forecasting capabilities and advancing our\nunderstanding of the dominant parameters and processes that govern SEP\nproduction.",

Recently, deep learning models\nhave been widely used for log anomaly detection.

However, there is a gap between language modeling and\nanomaly detection as the objective of training a sequential model via a\nlanguage modeling loss is not directly related to anomaly detection. To fill up\nthe gap, we propose LogGPT, a novel framework that employs GPT for log anomaly\ndetection. LogGPT is first trained to predict the next log entry based on the\npreceding sequence. To further enhance the performance of LogGPT, we propose a\nnovel reinforcement learning strategy to finetune the model specifically for\nthe log anomaly detection task.

            "summary": "The third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) contains 90 binary\ncoalescence candidates detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK). We\nprovide a re-analysis of binary black hole (BBH) events using a recently\ndeveloped numerical relativity (NR) waveform surrogate model, NRSur7dq4, that\nincludes all $\\ell \\leq 4$ spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes as well as\nthe complete physical effects of precession. Properties of the remnant black\nholes' (BH's) mass, spin vector, and kick vector are found using an associated\nremnant surrogate model NRSur7dq4Remnant. Both NRSur7dq4 and NRSur7dq4Remnant\nmodels have errors comparable to numerical relativity simulations and allow for\nhigh-accuracy parameter estimates. We restrict our analysis to 47 BBH events\nthat fall within the regime of validity of NRSur7dq4 (mass ratios greater than\n1/6 and total masses greater than $60 M_{\\odot}$). While for most of these\nevents our results match the LVK analyses that were obtained using the\nsemi-analytical models such as IMRPhenomXPHM and SEOBNRv4PHM, we find that for\nmore than 20\\% of events the NRSur7dq4 model recovers noticeably different\nmeasurements of black hole properties like the masses and spins, as well as\nextrinsic properties like the binary inclination and distance. For instance,\nGW150914_095045 exhibits noticeable differences in spin precession and spin\nmagnitude measurements. Other notable findings include one event\n(GW191109_010717) that constrains the effective spin $\\chi_{eff}$ to be\nnegative at a 99.3\\% credible level and two events (GW191109_010717 and\nGW200129_065458) with well-constrained kick velocities. Furthermore, compared\nto the models used in the LVK analyses, NRSur7dq4 recovers a larger\nsignal-to-noise ratio and/or Bayes factors for several events.",

Transportation-dependent\nsystems, such as for navigation and logistics, have great potential to benefit\nfrom reliable speed estimation. While there is prior research in this area\nreporting competitive accuracy levels, their solutions lack reproducibility and\nrobustness across different datasets. To address this, we provide a novel\nframework for automatic real-time vehicle speed calculation, which copes with\nmore diverse data from publicly available traffic cameras to achieve greater\nrobustness. Our model employs novel techniques to estimate the length of road\nsegments via depth map prediction. Additionally, our framework is capable of\nhandling realistic conditions such as camera movements and different video\nstream inputs automatically. We compare our model to three well-known models in\nthe field using their benchmark datasets. While our model does not set a new\nstate of the art regarding prediction performance, the results are competitive\non realistic CCTV videos. At the same time, our end-to-end pipeline offers more\nconsistent results, an easier implementation, and better compatibility. Its\nmodular structure facilitates reproducibility and future improvements.",

            "summary": "In ski jumping, low repetition rates of jumps limit the effectiveness of\ntraining. Thus, increasing learning rate within every single jump is key to\nsuccess. A critical element of athlete training is motor learning, which has\nbeen shown to be accelerated by feedback methods. In particular, a fine-grained\ncontrol of the center of gravity in the in-run is essential. This is because\nthe actual takeoff occurs within a blink of an eye ($\\sim$300ms), thus any\nunbalanced body posture during the in-run will affect flight. This paper\npresents a smart, compact, and energy-efficient wireless sensor system for\nreal-time performance analysis and biofeedback during ski jumping. The system\noperates by gauging foot pressures at three distinct points on the insoles of\nthe ski boot at 100Hz. Foot pressure data can either be directly sent to\ncoaches to improve their feedback, or fed into a ML model to give athletes\ninstantaneous in-action feedback using a vibration motor in the ski boot. In\nthe biofeedback scenario, foot pressures act as input variables for an\noptimized XGBoost model. We achieve a high predictive accuracy of 92.7% for\ncenter of mass predictions (dorsal shift, neutral stand, ventral shift).\nSubsequently, we parallelized and fine-tuned our XGBoost model for a RISC-V\nbased low power parallel processor (GAP9), based on the PULP architecture. We\ndemonstrate real-time detection and feedback (0.0109ms/inference) using our\non-chip deployment. The proposed smart system is unobtrusive with a slim form\nfactor (13mm baseboard, 3.2mm antenna) and a lightweight build (26g). Power\nconsumption analysis reveals that the system's energy-efficient design enables\nsustained operation over multiple days (up to 300 hours) without requiring\nrecharge.",

            "summary": "The computational method of discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD), used as a\ncoarse-grained model of true atomistic dynamics of lattice dislocations, has\nbecome of powerful tool to study metal plasticity arising from the collective\nbehavior of dislocations. As a mesoscale approach, motion of dislocations in\nthe DDD model is prescribed via the mobility law; a function which specifies\nhow dislocation lines should respond to the driving force. However, the\ndevelopment of traditional hand-crafted mobility laws can be a cumbersome task\nand may involve detrimental simplifications. Here we introduce a\nmachine-learning (ML) framework to streamline the development of data-driven\nmobility laws which are modeled as graph neural networks (GNN) trained on\nlarge-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of crystal plasticity. We\nillustrate our approach on BCC tungsten and demonstrate that our GNN mobility\nimplemented in large-scale DDD simulations accurately reproduces the\nchallenging tension/compression asymmetry observed in ground-truth MD\nsimulations while correctly predicting the flow stress at lower straining rate\nconditions unseen during training, thereby demonstrating the ability of our\nmethod to learn relevant dislocation physics. Our DDD+ML approach opens new\npromising avenues to improve fidelity of the DDD model and to incorporate more\ncomplex dislocation motion behaviors in an automated way, providing a faithful\nproxy for dislocation dynamics several orders of magnitude faster than\nground-truth MD simulations.",

Here we\npresent an extension in chemical complexity to a heavily studied high-mass star\nforming region: the Orion Kleinmann-Low (Orion KL) nebula. Unlike TMC-1, Orion\nKL is composed of several structurally distinct environments that differ\nchemically and kinematically, wherein the column densities of molecules between\nthese components can have non-linear correlations that cause the unexpected\nappearance or even lack of likely species in various environments.

We identify a single\nrange of impact parameters, typically of width $\\sim0.86-1.59$ binary Hill\nradii depending on AGN disk density, that reliably leads to binary formation.\nThe periapsis of the first encounter is the primary variable that determines\nthe outcome of the initial scattering. We find an associated power-law between\nthe energy dissipated and the periapsis depth to be $\\Delta E\\propto r^{-b}$\nwith $b=0.42\\pm0.16$, where deeper encounters dissipate more energy. Excluding\naccretion physics does not significantly alter these results. We identify the\nregion of parameter space in initial energy vs impact parameter where a\nscattering leads to binary formation. Based on our findings, we provide a\nready-to-use analytic criterion that utilises these two pre-encounter\nparameters to determine the outcome of an encounter, with a reliability rate of\n>90\\%. As the criterion is based directly on our simulations, it provides a\nreliable and highly physically motivated criterion for predicting binary\nscattering outcomes which can be used in population studies of BH binaries and\nmergers around AGN.",

Here\nwe present a comprehensive study of the transformation that brings the Bethe\nansatz into a quantum circuit, which leads us to determine the analytical\nexpression of the circuit gates. As a crucial step of the derivation, we\npresent a simple set of diagrammatic rules that define a novel Matrix Product\nState network building Bethe wavefunctions.

In this work, we perform Hartree-Fock and\nexact diagonalization calculations to test whether the standard MoTe$_2$\nmoir\\'e model with the (greatly varying) parameter values available in the\nliterature can reproduce the non-magnetic states at $\\nu=-1/3$ and $-4/3$ in\nunison with the FCI at $\\nu=-2/3$ and CI state at $\\nu = -1$.

We demonstrate that absence of long range magnetic order, previously\nobserved in bulk FeSi and CoSi, is broken near the FeSi/CoSi interface, where a\nmagnetic state with non-trivial topology appears. Using electronic structure\ncalculations in combination with the magnetic force theorem, we calculate the\nHeisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions in these systems. With\nthis information, we perform atomistic spin dynamics simulations at finite\ntemperature and applied magnetic field for large supercells with up to\n$2\\cdot10^6$ spins to capture the complexity of non-collinear textures induced\nby the DM interaction. The spin dynamics simulations predict the formation of\nantiskyrmions in a [001]-oriented FeSi/CoSi multilayer, intermediate skyrmions\nin a [111]-oriented FeSi/CoSi system and Bloch skyrmions in the FeSi/FeGe (001)\nsystem. The size of different types of skyrmions is found to vary between 7 nm\nand 37 nm. The varying topological magnetic texture in these systems can be\nattributed to the complex asymmetric structure of the DM micromagnetic matrix,\nwhich is different from previously known topological magnets. Furthermore,\nthrough structural engineering, we demonstrate that both FM and AFM skyrmions\ncan be stabilized, where the latter are especially appealing for applications\ndue to the zero skyrmion Hall effect.

Seminal K-theory classifications of non-Hermitian systems based on\nline and point gaps have deepened the understanding of many physical phenomena.\nHowever, ample systems remain beyond this description; reference points and\nlines are in general unable to distinguish whether multiple non-Hermitian bands\nexhibit band crossings and braids. To remedy this we consider the complementary\nnotions of non-Hermitian band gaps and separation gaps that crucially include a\nbroad class of multi-band scenarios, enabling the description of generic band\nstructures with symmetries. With these concepts, we provide a unified and\nsystematic classification of both gapped and nodal systems in the presence of\nphysically relevant parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) and pseudo-Hermitian\nsymmetries using homotopy theory. This uncovers new fragile phases and,\nremarkably, also implies new stable phenomena stemming from the topology of\nboth eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In particular, we reveal different Abelian\nand non-Abelian phases in $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, described by frame\nand braid topology. The corresponding invariants are robust to\nsymmetry-preserving perturbations that do not close band gaps, and they also\npredict the deformation rules of nodal phases. We further demonstrate that\nspontaneous $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking is captured by a Chern-Euler\ndescription, a fingerprint of unprecedented non-Hermitian topology. These\nresults open the door for theoretical and experimental exploration of a rich\nvariety of novel topological phenomena in a wide range of physical platforms.",

Motivated by the new ultra-high-redshift\n(z > 10) frontier enabled by JWST, we present a new suite of Gadget at\nUltrahigh Redshift with Extra-Fine Timesteps (GUREFT) dark matter-only\ncosmological simulations that are carefully designed to capture halo merger\nhistories and structural properties in the ultra-z universe. The simulation\nsuite consists of four 1024^3-particle simulations with box sizes of 5, 15, 35,\nand 90 Mpc h-1, each with 170 snapshots stored between 40 > z > 6. With the\nunprecedented number of available snapshots and strategically chosen dynamic\nrange covered by these boxes, gureft uncovers the emerging dark matter halo\npopulations and their assembly histories in the earliest epochs of cosmic\nhistory. In this work, we present the halo mass functions between z ~ 20 to 6\ndown to log(Mvir/Msun) ~ 5, and show that at high redshift, these robust halo\nmass functions can differ substantially from commonly used analytic\napproximations or older fitting functions in the literature.

Comparative experiments show that pLMFPPred outperforms current\nmethods for predicting functional peptides.The experimental results suggest\nthat the proposed method (pLMFPPred) can provide better performance in terms of\nAccuracy, Area under the curve - Receiver Operating Characteristics, and\nF1-Score than existing methods. pLMFPPred has achieved good performance in\npredicting functional peptides and represents a new computational method for\npredicting functional peptides.",

            "summary": "Teams that have trained large Transformer-based models have reported training\ninstabilities at large scale that did not appear when training with the same\nhyperparameters at smaller scales. Although the causes of such instabilities\nare of scientific interest, the amount of resources required to reproduce them\nhas made investigation difficult. In this work, we seek ways to reproduce and\nstudy training stability and instability at smaller scales. First, we focus on\ntwo sources of training instability described in previous work: the growth of\nlogits in attention layers (Dehghani et al., 2023) and divergence of the output\nlogits from the log probabilities (Chowdhery et al., 2022). By measuring the\nrelationship between learning rate and loss across scales, we show that these\ninstabilities also appear in small models when training at high learning rates,\nand that mitigations previously employed at large scales are equally effective\nin this regime. This prompts us to investigate the extent to which other known\noptimizer and model interventions influence the sensitivity of the final loss\nto changes in the learning rate. To this end, we study methods such as warm-up,\nweight decay, and the $\\mu$Param (Yang et al., 2022), and combine techniques to\ntrain small models that achieve similar losses across orders of magnitude of\nlearning rate variation. Finally, to conclude our exploration we study two\ncases where instabilities can be predicted before they emerge by examining the\nscaling behavior of model activation and gradient norms.",

For each of the $\\ell\\ge 2$ modes, there\nare two physical solutions to the perturbative equations that correspond to\nadding the multipole moments of mass and electric charge, respectively. By\nadjusting the ratio of the amplitudes of the two solutions appropriately, it is\npossible to realize a distorted photon surface. In the case of $\\ell=1$,\nalthough there is only one physical solution to the perturbative equations,\nthere is also a degree of freedom to shift the coordinate position of the\nphoton surface, and this enables the formation of a photon surface. Such a\nphoton surface has a spherically symmetric spatial section, but it is also\ndistorted in the three-dimensional sense. Our results show that distorted\nstatic photon surfaces can be formed at least at the level of the first-order\nperturbations, and imply that the uniqueness of the photon surface may not hold\nin electrovacuum spacetimes.",

            "summary": "Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have demonstrated promising performance in\nself-supervised learning for both 2D and 3D computer vision. Nevertheless,\nexisting MAE-based methods still have certain drawbacks. Firstly, the\nfunctional decoupling between the encoder and decoder is incomplete, which\nlimits the encoder's representation learning ability. Secondly, downstream\ntasks solely utilize the encoder, failing to fully leverage the knowledge\nacquired through the encoder-decoder architecture in the pre-text task. In this\npaper, we propose Point Regress AutoEncoder (Point-RAE), a new scheme for\nregressive autoencoders for point cloud self-supervised learning. The proposed\nmethod decouples functions between the decoder and the encoder by introducing a\nmask regressor, which predicts the masked patch representation from the visible\npatch representation encoded by the encoder and the decoder reconstructs the\ntarget from the predicted masked patch representation. By doing so, we minimize\nthe impact of decoder updates on the representation space of the encoder.\nMoreover, we introduce an alignment constraint to ensure that the\nrepresentations for masked patches, predicted from the encoded representations\nof visible patches, are aligned with the masked patch presentations computed\nfrom the encoder. To make full use of the knowledge learned in the pre-training\nstage, we design a new finetune mode for the proposed Point-RAE. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach is efficient during pre-training and\ngeneralizes well on various downstream tasks. Specifically, our pre-trained\nmodels achieve a high accuracy of \\textbf{90.28\\%} on the ScanObjectNN hardest\nsplit and \\textbf{94.1\\%} accuracy on ModelNet40, surpassing all the other\nself-supervised learning methods.

Pushing is a fundamental skill that enables robots to move\nunwieldy objects that cannot be grasped. We propose a stable pushing method\nthat maintains stiff contact between the robot and the object to avoid\nconsuming repositioning actions. We prove that a line contact, rather than a\nsingle point contact, is necessary for nonholonomic robots to achieve stable\npushing. We also show that the stable pushing constraint and the nonholonomic\nconstraint of the robot can be simplified as a concise linear motion\nconstraint. Then the pushing planning problem can be formulated as a\nconstrained optimization problem using nonlinear model predictive control\n(NMPC). According to the experiments, our NMPC-based planner outperforms a\nreactive pushing strategy in terms of efficiency, reducing the robot's traveled\ndistance by 23.8\\% and time by 77.4\\%. Furthermore, our method requires four\nfewer hyperparameters and decision variables than the Linear Time-Varying (LTV)\nMPC approach, making it easier to implement. Real-world experiments are carried\nout to validate the proposed method with two differential-drive robots, Husky\nand Boxer, under different friction conditions.",

Multiple geometric signals\nare fused into robust pose estimations, and a data-efficient training process\nis achieved after applying the strategy of sim-to-real transfer. As a result,\nwe can achieve proprioception that is robust to the variation of external\nloading and has an average error of 0.7% across the workspace on a\npneumatic-driven soft manipulator. The realized proprioception on soft\nmanipulator is then contributed to building a sensor-space based algorithm for\nclosed-loop control. A gradient descent solver is developed to drive the\nend-effector to achieve the required poses by iteratively computing a sequence\nof reference sensor signals. A conventional controller is employed in the inner\nloop of our algorithm to update actuators (i.e., the pressures in chambers) for\napproaching a reference signal in the sensor-space.

            "summary": "The iMaNGA project uses a forward-modelling approach to compare the\npredictions of cosmological simulations with observations from SDSS-IV/MaNGA.\nWe investigate the dependency of age and metallicity radial gradients on galaxy\nmorphology, stellar mass, stellar surface mass density ($\\Sigma_*$), and\nenvironment. The key of our analysis is that observational biases affecting the\ninterpretation of MaNGA data are emulated in the theoretical iMaNGA sample. The\nsimulations reproduce the observed global stellar population scaling relations\nwith positive correlations between galaxy mass and age/metallicity quite well\nand also produce younger stellar populations in late-type in agreement with\nobservations. We do find interesting discrepancies, though, that can inform the\nphysics and further development of the simulations. Ages of spiral galaxies and\nlow-mass ellipticals are overestimated by about 2-4 Gyr. Radial metallicity\ngradients are steeper in iMaNGA than in MaNGA, a discrepancy most prominent in\nspiral and lenticular galaxies. Also, the observed steepening of metallicity\ngradients with increasing galaxy mass is not well matched by the simulations.\nWe find that the theoretical radial profiles of surface mass density $\\Sigma_*$\nare steeper than in observations except for the most massive galaxies. In both\nMaNGA and iMaNGA [Z/H] correlates with $\\Sigma_*$, however, the simulations\nsystematically predict lower [Z/H] by almost a factor of 2 at any $\\Sigma_*$.\nMost interestingly, for galaxies with stellar mass $\\log M_*\\leq 10.80 M_\\odot$\nthe MaNGA data reveal a positive correlation between galaxy radius and [Z/H] at\nfixed $\\Sigma_*$, which is not recovered in iMaNGA. Finally, the dependence on\nenvironmental density is negligible in both the theoretical iMaNGA and the\nobserved MaNGA data.",

            "summary": "A crucial task for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to specify a\nstatistical method that can yield an efficient estimator and powerful test for\nthe treatment effect. A novel and effective strategy to obtain efficient and\npowerful treatment effect inferences is to incorporate predictions from\ngenerative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms into covariate adjustment\nfor the regression analysis of a RCT. Training a generative AI algorithm on\nhistorical control data enables one to construct a digital twin generator (DTG)\nfor RCT participants, which utilizes a participant's baseline covariates to\ngenerate a probability distribution for their potential control outcome.\nSummaries of the probability distribution from the DTG are highly predictive of\nthe trial outcome, and adjusting for these features via regression can thus\nimprove the quality of treatment effect inferences, while satisfying regulatory\nguidelines on statistical analyses, for a RCT. However, a critical assumption\nin this strategy is homoskedasticity, or constant variance of the outcome\nconditional on the covariates. In the case of heteroskedasticity, existing\ncovariate adjustment methods yield inefficient estimators and underpowered\ntests. We propose to address heteroskedasticity via a weighted prognostic\ncovariate adjustment methodology (Weighted PROCOVA) that adjusts for both the\nmean and variance of the regression model using information obtained from the\nDTG. We prove that our method yields unbiased treatment effect estimators, and\ndemonstrate via comprehensive simulation studies and case studies from\nAlzheimer's disease that it can reduce the variance of the treatment effect\nestimator, maintain the Type I error rate, and increase the power of the test\nfor the treatment effect from 80% to 85%~90% when the variances from the DTG\ncan explain 5%~10% of the variation in the RCT participants' outcomes.",

We found no significant\nrelationship between word attributes and hard mode results.\n  To predict word difficulty, we employed a Backpropagation Neural Network,\novercoming overfitting via feature engineering. We also used K-means\nclustering, optimized at five clusters, to categorize word difficulty\nnumerically. Our findings indicate that on March 1st, 2023, around 12,884\nresults will be submitted and the word \"eerie\" averages 4.8 attempts, falling\ninto the hardest difficulty cluster.\n  We further examined the percentage of loyal players and their propensity to\nundertake daily challenges. Our models underwent rigorous sensitivity analyses,\nincluding ADF, ACF, PACF tests, and cross-validation, confirming their\nrobustness. Overall, our study provides a predictive framework for Wordle\ngameplay based on date or a given five-letter word.

However, with the dramatic and rapid changes in the world environment,\nthe assumption that data obey Independent Identically Distribution is\nundermined by the subsequent changes in data distribution, known as concept\ndrift, leading to weak replicability and transferability of the model over\nunseen data. To address the issue, previous approaches typically retrain the\nmodel, forcing it to fit the most recent observed data. However, retraining is\nproblematic in that it leads to model lag, consumption of resources, and model\nre-invalidation, causing the drift problem to be not well solved in realistic\nscenarios. In this study, we propose a new urban time series prediction model\nfor the concept drift problem, which encodes the drift by considering the\nperiodicity in the data and makes on-the-fly adjustments to the model based on\nthe drift using a meta-dynamic network. Experiments on real-world datasets show\nthat our design significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can be\nwell generalized to existing prediction backbones by reducing their sensitivity\nto distribution changes.",

To tackle this challenge, a surge\nof research in scenario-based autonomous driving has emerged, with a focus on\ngenerating high-risk driving scenarios and applying them to conduct\nsafety-critical testing of AV models. However, limited work has been explored\non the reuse of these extensive scenarios to iteratively improve AV models.\nMoreover, it remains intractable and challenging to filter through gigantic\nscenario libraries collected from other AV models with distinct behaviors,\nattempting to extract transferable information for current AV improvement.\nTherefore, we develop a continual driving policy optimization framework\nfeaturing Closed-Loop Individualized Curricula (CLIC), which we factorize into\na set of standardized sub-modules for flexible implementation choices: AV\nEvaluation, Scenario Selection, and AV Training. CLIC frames AV Evaluation as a\ncollision prediction task, where it estimates the chance of AV failures in\nthese scenarios at each iteration. Subsequently, by re-sampling from historical\nscenarios based on these failure probabilities, CLIC tailors individualized\ncurricula for downstream training, aligning them with the evaluated capability\nof AV. Accordingly, CLIC not only maximizes the utilization of the vast\npre-collected scenario library for closed-loop driving policy optimization but\nalso facilitates AV improvement by individualizing its training with more\nchallenging cases out of those poorly organized scenarios. Experimental results\nclearly indicate that CLIC surpasses other curriculum-based training\nstrategies, showing substantial improvement in managing risky scenarios, while\nstill maintaining proficiency in handling simpler cases.",

We show that this approach allows to extract $\\sim 99\\%$\nof the total value of $a_{\\mu}^\\text{HLO}$ from the MUonE data, while the\nremaining $\\sim 1\\%$ can be computed combining perturbative QCD and data on\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation to hadrons. This leads to a competitive evaluation of\n$a_{\\mu}^\\text{HLO}$ which is robust against the parameterization used to model\n$\\Delta\\alpha_{had}(t)$ in the MUonE kinematic region, thanks to the\nanalyticity properties of $\\Delta\\alpha_{had}(t)$, which can be expanded as a\npolynomial at $t\\sim 0$.",

This approach was applied to Lake Michigan\nby incorporating wind data from multiple Automatic Surface Observation Systems\n(ASOS) stations as input features. A wave height time series from the Wave\nInformation System model (WIS) served as the training, validation, and testing\ndataset for the proposed model. Several models were developed, considering\ndifferent numbers of wind stations, revealing the importance of incorporating\nstations with variable distances and orientations to enhance prediction\naccuracy. Notably, the improvement in the model performance plateaued after a\ncertain number of stations, underscoring the importance of selecting an optimal\nnumber of wind stations. Additionally, an ensemble learning technique was\nemployed to combine multiple models, resulting in further enhancements in\nprediction accuracy. The developed model added 30 years of wave height\npredictions to the existing time series, expanding it by 70% which allows\ninsights into the long-term wave climatology of the Lake Michigan. This\nframework offers a promising avenue for utilizing historical wind records\nworldwide to extend wave height time series, in turn improving coastal\nresilience and coastal management plans.",

            "summary": "Background: With the ever-increasing amount of medical imaging data, the\ndemand for algorithms to assist clinicians has amplified. Unsupervised anomaly\ndetection (UAD) models promise to aid in the crucial first step of disease\ndetection. While previous studies have thoroughly explored fairness in\nsupervised models in healthcare, for UAD, this has so far been unexplored.\n  Methods: In this study, we evaluated how dataset composition regarding\nsubgroups manifests in disparate performance of UAD models along multiple\nprotected variables on three large-scale publicly available chest X-ray\ndatasets. Our experiments were validated using two state-of-the-art UAD models\nfor medical images. Finally, we introduced a novel subgroup-AUROC (sAUROC)\nmetric, which aids in quantifying fairness in machine learning.\n  Findings: Our experiments revealed empirical \"fairness laws\" (similar to\n\"scaling laws\" for Transformers) for training-dataset composition: Linear\nrelationships between anomaly detection performance within a subpopulation and\nits representation in the training data. Our study further revealed performance\ndisparities, even in the case of balanced training data, and compound effects\nthat exacerbate the drop in performance for subjects associated with multiple\nadversely affected groups.\n  Interpretation: Our study quantified the disparate performance of UAD models\nagainst certain demographic subgroups. Importantly, we showed that this\nunfairness cannot be mitigated by balanced representation alone. Instead, the\nrepresentation of some subgroups seems harder to learn by UAD models than that\nof others. The empirical fairness laws discovered in our study make disparate\nperformance in UAD models easier to estimate and aid in determining the most\ndesirable dataset composition.",

            "summary": "A stationary body that is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment,\nand for which the electric susceptibility is non-reciprocal, experiences a\nquantum torque. This arises from the spatially non-symmetric electrical\nresponse of the body to its interaction with the non-equilibrium thermal\nfluctuations of the electromagnetic field: the non-equilibrium nature of the\nthermal field fluctuations results in a net energy flow through the body, and\nthe spatially non-symmetric nature of the electrical response of the body to\nits interaction with these field fluctuations causes that energy flow to be\ntransformed into a rotational motion. We establish an exact, closed-form,\nanalytical expression for this torque in the case that the environment is the\nvacuum and the material of the body is described by a damped oscillator model,\nwhere the non-reciprocal nature of the electric susceptibility is induced by an\nexternal magnetic field, as for magneto-optical media. We also generalise this\nexpression to the context in which the body is slowly rotating. By exploring\nthe high-temperature expansion of the torque, we are able to identify the\nseparate contributions from the continuous spectral distribution of the\nnon-reciprocal electric susceptibility, and from the resonance modes. In\nparticular, we find that the torque persists in the limiting case of zero\ndamping parameter, due to the contribution of the resonance modes. We also\nconsider the low-temperature expansion of the torque. This work extends our\nprevious consideration of this model to an external magnetic field of arbitrary\nstrength, thereby including non-linear magnetic field effects.",

Nevertheless, there is still an inadequacy in assessing the\nabilities of MLLMs on low-level visual perception and understanding. To address\nthis gap, we present Q-Bench, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically\nevaluate potential abilities of MLLMs on three realms: low-level visual\nperception, low-level visual description, and overall visual quality\nassessment. a) To evaluate the low-level perception ability, we construct the\nLLVisionQA dataset, consisting of 2,990 diverse-sourced images, each equipped\nwith a human-asked question focusing on its low-level attributes. We then\nmeasure the correctness of MLLMs on answering these questions. b) To examine\nthe description ability of MLLMs on low-level information, we propose the\nLLDescribe dataset consisting of long expert-labelled golden low-level text\ndescriptions on 499 images, and a GPT-involved comparison pipeline between\noutputs of MLLMs and the golden descriptions. c) Besides these two tasks, we\nfurther measure their visual quality assessment ability to align with human\nopinion scores. Specifically, we design a softmax-based strategy that enables\nMLLMs to predict quantifiable quality scores, and evaluate them on various\nexisting image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. Our evaluation across the\nthree abilities confirms that MLLMs possess preliminary low-level visual\nskills. However, these skills are still unstable and relatively imprecise,\nindicating the need for specific enhancements on MLLMs towards these abilities.\nWe hope that our benchmark can encourage the research community to delve deeper\nto discover and enhance these untapped potentials of MLLMs. Project Page:\nhttps://vqassessment.github.io/Q-Bench.",

            "summary": "The dissipative capacity as quantified by the nonlinear bandwidth measure of\nimpulsively loaded primary structures (PSs) coupled to particle impact dampers\n(PIDs) is assessed. The considered PIDs are designed by initially placing\ndifferent numbers of spherical, linearly viscoelastic granules at different 2D\ninitial topologies and clearances. The strongly nonlinear and highly\ndiscontinuous dynamics of the PIDs are simulated via the discrete element\nmethod taking Hertzian interactions, slipping friction and granular rotations\ninto account. The general definition of nonlinear bandwidth is used to evaluate\nthe energy dissipation capacity of the integrated PS-PID systems. Moreover, the\neffect of the dynamics of the PIDs on the time-bandwidth product of these\nsystems is studied, as a measure of their capacity to store or dissipate\nvibration energy. It is found that the initial topologies of the granules in\nthe PID drastically affect the time-bandwidth product, which, depending on\nshock intensity, may break the classical limit of unity which holds for linear\ntime-invariant dissipative resonators. The optimal PS-PID systems composed of\nmultiple granules produce large nonlinear bandwidths, indicating strong\ndissipative capacity of broadband input energy by the PIDs. Additionally, in\nthe optimal configurations, the time-bandwidth product, i.e., the measure of\nthe frequency bandwidth of the input shock that is stored in the PS-PID system,\nin tandem with the amount of time it takes for the system to dissipate (1/e) of\nthe initial energy, can be tuned either above or below unity by varying the\napplied shock intensity. The implications of these findings on the dissipative\ncapacity of the system considered are discussed, showing that it can be\npredictively assessed so that PIDs can act as highly effective nonlinear energy\nsinks capable of rapid and efficient suppression of vibration induced by\nshocks.",

We replace the singular kernel with a regularized version having a\nlength parameter $\\delta$ in order to control discretization error. Analysis\nnear the singularity leads to an expression for the error due to regularization\nwhich has terms with unknown coefficients multiplying known quantities. By\ncomputing the integral with three choices of $\\delta$ we can solve for an\nextrapolated value that has regularization error reduced to $O(\\delta^5)$. In\nexamples with $\\delta/h$ constant and moderate resolution we observe total\nerror about $O(h^5)$. For convergence as $h \\to 0$ we can choose $\\delta$\nproportional to $h^q$ with $q < 1$ to ensure the discretization error is\ndominated by the regularization error.

            "summary": "Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a fundamental topic of geometric computer\nvision and a core technique for many downstream applications. Recently, several\nmethods reframe the MDE as a classification-regression problem where a linear\ncombination of probabilistic distribution and bin centers is used to predict\ndepth. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of iterative elastic bins\n(IEBins) for the classification-regression-based MDE. The proposed IEBins aims\nto search for high-quality depth by progressively optimizing the search range,\nwhich involves multiple stages and each stage performs a finer-grained depth\nsearch in the target bin on top of its previous stage. To alleviate the\npossible error accumulation during the iterative process, we utilize a novel\nelastic target bin to replace the original target bin, the width of which is\nadjusted elastically based on the depth uncertainty. Furthermore, we develop a\ndedicated framework composed of a feature extractor and an iterative optimizer\nthat has powerful temporal context modeling capabilities benefiting from the\nGRU-based architecture. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, NYU-Depth-v2 and\nSUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses prior\nstate-of-the-art competitors.

            "summary": "V1298 Tau hosts at least four planets. Since its discovery, this system has\nbeen a target of intensive photometric and spectroscopic monitoring. The\ncharacterisation of its architecture and planets' fundamental properties turned\nout to be very challenging so far. The determination of the orbital ephemeris\nof the outermost planet V1298 Tau $e$ remains an open question. Only two\ntransits have been detected so far by $Kepler/K2$ and TESS, allowing for a grid\nof reference periods to be tested with new observations, without excluding the\npossibility of transit timing variations. Observing a third transit would allow\nto better constrain the orbital period, and would also help determining an\naccurate radius of V1298 Tau $e$ because the former transits showed different\ndepths. We observed V1298 Tau with the CHEOPS space telescope to search for a\nthird transit of planet $e$ within observing windows that have been selected in\norder to test three of the shortest predicted orbital periods. We also\ncollected ground-based observations to verify the result found with CHEOPS. We\nreanalysed $Kepler/K2$ and TESS light curves to test how the results derived\nfrom these data are affected by alternative photometric extraction and\ndetrending methods. We report the detection with CHEOPS of a transit that could\nbe attributed to V1298 Tau $e$. If so, that result implies that the orbital\nperiod calculated from fitting a linear ephemeris to the three available\ntransits is close to $\\sim45$ days. Results from the ground-based follow-up\nmarginally support this possibility. We found that $\\textit{i}$) the transit\nobserved by CHEOPS has a longer duration compared to that of the transits\nobserved by $Kepler/K2$ and TESS; $\\textit{ii}$) the transit observed by TESS\nis $>30\\%$ deeper than that of $Kepler/K2$ and CHEOPS, and deeper than the\nmeasurement previously reported in the literature, according to our reanalysis.",

An\nexact analytical solution of the FP equation is only available for a limited\nsubset of dynamical systems. Semi-analytical methods are available for larger,\nyet still a small subset of systems, while traditional computational methods;\ne.g. Finite Elements and Finite Difference require dividing the computational\ndomain into a grid of discrete points, which incurs significant computational\ncosts for high-dimensional systems. Physics-informed learning offers a\npotentially powerful alternative to traditional computational schemes. To\nevaluate its potential, we present a data-free, physics-informed neural network\n(PINN) framework to solve the FP equation for a class of nonlinear stochastic\ndynamical systems. In particular, through several examples concerning the\nstochastic response of the Duffing, Van der Pol, and the Duffing-Van der Pol\noscillators, we assess the ability and accuracy of the PINN framework in $i)$\npredicting the PDF under the combined effect of additive and multiplicative\nnoise, $ii)$ capturing P-bifurcations of the PDF, and $iii)$ effectively\ntreating high-dimensional systems.

Multimodal (MM) models aim to extract the\nsynergistic predictive potential of multiple data types to create a shared\nfeature space with aligned semantic meaning across inputs of drastically\nvarying sizes (i.e. images, text, sound). Most current MM architectures fuse\nthese representations in parallel, which not only limits their interpretability\nbut also creates a dependency on modality availability. We present MultiModN, a\nmultimodal, modular network that fuses latent representations in a sequence of\nany number, combination, or type of modality while providing granular real-time\npredictive feedback on any number or combination of predictive tasks.\nMultiModN's composable pipeline is interpretable-by-design, as well as innately\nmulti-task and robust to the fundamental issue of biased missingness. We\nperform four experiments on several benchmark MM datasets across 10 real-world\ntasks (predicting medical diagnoses, academic performance, and weather), and\nshow that MultiModN's sequential MM fusion does not compromise performance\ncompared with a baseline of parallel fusion.

As one of the results of the thermodynamic study, a new\nequation for the dependence of surface tension on radius (curvature effect),\nalternative to the corresponding Tolman equation and associated with the\nspinodal point, is obtained. The Kelvin type equation for the equimolecular\nradius is shown to be exact over the entire metastability region and serves as\nthe basis for the TL equation. The expansions of surface tension near the\nspinodal and binodal points show that the correction to Rusanov s linear\nasymptotics in the first case is a series in cubes of the radius, whereas a\nseries in curvature holds in the second case. As a result of the analysis of\nthese expansions, the fundamental impossibility to determine the curvature\neffect analytically from the binodal point is established; the computational\nprocedure determines it from the spinodal point.

To address this gap, we present a\nsimple analytical solution based on linear response theory, offering a\ncomprehensive depiction of the Coulomb screened potential in both 2D and 3D\nsystems, where screening effects from both charge carriers and charge-neutral\ndipoles are addressed. Our work provides a handy tool for directly analysing\nand evaluating Coulomb interaction strength in atomically thin materials and\nparticularly in the context of electronic and optoelectronic engineering.

            "summary": "When reflected from an interface, a laser beam generally drifts and tilts\naway from the path predicted by ray optics, an intriguing consequence of its\nfinite transverse extent. Such beam shifts manifest more dramatically for\nstructured light fields, and in particular for optical vortices. Upon\nreflection, a field containing a high-order optical vortex is expected to\nexperience not only geometrical shifts, but an additional splitting of its\nhigh-order vortex into a constellation of unit-charge vortices, a phenomenon\nknown as topological aberration. In this article, we report on the first direct\nobservation of the topological aberration effect, measured through the\ntransformation of a vortex constellation upon reflection. We develop a general\ntheoretical framework to study topological aberrations in terms of the\nelementary symmetric polynomials of the coordinates of a vortex constellation,\na mathematical abstraction which we prove to be the physical quantity of\ninterest. Using this approach, we are able to verify experimentally the\naberration of constellations of up to three vortices reflected from a thin\nmetallic film. Our work not only deepens the understanding of the reflection of\nnaturally occurring structured light fields such as vortex constellations but\nalso sets forth a potential method for studying the interaction of twisted\nlight fields with matter.",

This study provides a systematic\nanalysis of glottal source features and investigates their effectiveness in\nvoice pathology detection. Glottal source features are extracted using glottal\nflows estimated with the quasi-closed phase (QCP) glottal inverse filtering\nmethod, using approximate glottal source signals computed with the zero\nfrequency filtering (ZFF) method, and using acoustic voice signals directly. In\naddition, we propose to derive mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from\nthe glottal source waveforms computed by QCP and ZFF to effectively capture the\nvariations in glottal source spectra of pathological voice. Experiments were\ncarried out using two databases, the Hospital Universitario Principe de\nAsturias (HUPA) database and the Saarbrucken Voice Disorders (SVD) database.\nAnalysis of features revealed that the glottal source contains information that\ndiscriminates normal and pathological voice. Pathology detection experiments\nwere carried out using support vector machine (SVM). From the detection\nexperiments it was observed that the performance achieved with the studied\nglottal source features is comparable or better than that of conventional MFCCs\nand perceptual linear prediction (PLP) features. The best detection performance\nwas achieved when the glottal source features were combined with the\nconventional MFCCs and PLP features, which indicates the complementary nature\nof the features.",

This problem is particularly challenging\nwhen robots navigate in continuous workspaces due to the high computational\ncomplexity involved. Sampling-based methods have emerged as a promising avenue\nfor addressing this challenge by incrementally constructing random trees,\nthereby sidestepping the need to explicitly explore the entire state-space.\nHowever, the performance of this sampling-based approach hinges crucially on\nthe chosen sampling strategy, and a well-informed heuristic can notably enhance\nsample efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel neural-network guided\n(NN-guided) sampling strategy tailored for LTL planning. Specifically, we\nemploy a multi-modal neural network capable of extracting features concurrently\nfrom both the workspace and the B\\\"{u}chi automaton. This neural network\ngenerates predictions that serve as guidance for random tree construction,\ndirecting the sampling process toward more optimal directions.

            "summary": "Mixing describes the process by which scalars, such as solute concentration\nor fluid temperature, evolve from an initial heterogeneous state to uniformity\nunder the stirring action of a fluid flow. Mixing occurs initially through the\nformation of scalar lamellae as a result of fluid stretching and later by their\ncoalescence due to molecular diffusion. Owing to the linearity of the\nadvection-diffusion equation, scalar coalescence can be envisioned as an\naggregation process. While random aggregation models have been shown to capture\nscalar mixing across a range of turbulent flows, we demonstrate here that they\nare not accurate for most chaotic flows. In particular, we show that the\nspatial distribution of the number of lamellae in aggregates is highly\ncorrelated with their elongation and is also influenced by the fractal geometry\nthat arises from the chaotic flow. The presence of correlations makes mixing\nless efficient than a completely random aggregation process because lamellae\nwith similar elongations and scalar levels tend to remain isolated from each\nother. Based on these observations, we propose a correlated aggregation\nframework that captures the asymptotic mixing dynamics of chaotic flows and\npredicts the evolution of the scalar pdf based on the flow stretching\nstatistics. We show that correlated aggregation is uniquely determined by a\nsingle exponent which quantifies the effective number of random aggregation\nevents, and is dependent on the fractal dimension of the flow. These findings\nexpand aggregation theories to a larger class of systems, which have relevance\nto various fundamental and applied mixing problems.",

The\nmechanism is not well understood, as an overarching modeling framework is\nlacking. Capturing chirality requires going beyond electric dipole transitions,\nthe common approximation in condensed matter calculations. We present a density\nfunctional theory (DFT) parameterized tight-binding (TB) model, which allows us\nto calculate optical properties including circular dichroism (CD) at low\ncomputational cost. Comparing Pb-based chiral perovskites with different\norganic cations and halide anions, we find that the structural helicity within\nthe metal halide layers determines the size of the CD. Our results mark an\nimportant step in understanding the complex correlations of structural,\nelectronic and optical properties of chiral perovskites, and provide a useful\ntool to predict new compounds with desired properties for novel optoelectronic\napplications.",

The model is\nbased on simplified kinematics and allows for the onset of incompatible\ndeformations between discrete layers of an additively manufactured stack.\nThanks to the discrete nature of the model, we obtain an averaged formulation\nof mechanical equilibrium for the growing stack, leading to closed-form\nsolutions that are both analytically simple and physically transparent. In\nparticular, we are able to explain the origin of residual stresses by the\naccumulation of incompatible deformations between adjacent layers. At the same\ntime, we are able to formulate the technologically relevant inverse problem\nthat provides the deposition protocol required to produce a desired state of\ninternal stress in the manufactured stack. Another important aspect analyzed in\nthe work is the role played by an ideal ``glue'' between the layers, whose\npresence is fundamental to prevent their sliding and whose mechanical behavior\ncan quantitatively influence the final stress distribution in the stack.\nAlthough the model is an elementary approximation of additive manufacturing,\nits simplicity makes it possible to highlight how the controls exerted during\ndeposition will have qualitative or quantitative effects on the final stress\nstate of the stack.

As the covariate dimension increases\nquadratically, we develop an estimator that adapts well to this increase, while\nproviding accurate estimates and appropriate inference. Existing strategies\novercome the dimensionality problem by only allowing interactions between\nrelevant main effects. Building on this philosophy, we implement a softer link\nbetween the two types of effects using a local shrinkage model. We empirically\nshow that borrowing strength between the amount of shrinkage for main effects\nand their interactions can strongly improve estimation of the regression\ncoefficients. Moreover, we evaluate the potential of the model for inference,\nwhich is notoriously hard for selection strategies. Large-scale cohort data are\nused to provide realistic illustrations and evaluations. Comparisons with other\nmethods are provided. The evaluation of variable importance is not trivial in\nregression models with many interaction terms. Therefore, we derive a new\nanalytical formula for the Shapley value, which enables rapid assessment of\nindividual-specific variable importance scores and their uncertainties.\nFinally, while not targeting for prediction, we do show that our models can be\nvery competitive to a more advanced machine learner, like random forest, even\nfor fairly large sample sizes.

We demonstrate this\nfrom the first-principles calculation of orbital Hall conductivities of\ntransition metals by Wannier interpolation. Our results show that consistent\ntreatment of the velocity operator by adding the additional term originating\nfrom the anomalous position predicts the orbital Hall conductivities different\nfrom those obtained by considering only the group velocity. We find the\ndifference is crucial in several metals. For example, we predict the negative\nsign of the orbital Hall conductivities for elements in the groups X and XI\nsuch as Cu, Ag, Au, and Pd, for which the previous studies predicted the\npositive sign.

In vitro\nexperiments have shown that such fluid flow can direct tumour cell movement\nupstream or downstream depending on the balance between the competing\nmechanisms of tensotaxis and autologous chemotaxis. In this work we develop a\nprobabilistic-continuum, two-phase model for cell migration in response to\ninterstitial flow. We use a Fokker-Planck type equation for the cell-velocity\nprobability density function, and model the flow-dependent mechanochemical\nstimulus as a forcing term which biases cell migration upstream and downstream.\nUsing velocity-space averaging, we reformulate the model as a system of\ncontinuum equations for the spatio-temporal evolution of the cell volume\nfraction and flux, in response to forcing terms which depend on the local\ndirection and magnitude of the mechanochemical cues. We specialise our model to\ndescribe a one-dimensional cell layer subject to fluid flow. Using a\ncombination of numerical simulations and asymptotic analysis, we delineate the\nparameter regime where transitions from downstream to upstream cell migration\noccur. As has been observed experimentally, the model predicts\ndownstream-oriented, chemotactic migration at low cell volume fractions, and\nupstream-oriented, tensotactic migration at larger volume fractions. We show\nthat the locus of the critical volume fraction, at which the system transitions\nfrom downstream to upstream migration, is dominated by the ratio of the rate of\nchemokine secretion and advection. Our model predicts that, because the\ntensotactic stimulus depends strongly on the cell volume fraction, upstream\nmigration occurs only transiently when the cells are initially seeded, and\ntransitions to downstream migration occur at later times due to the dispersive\neffect of cell diffusion.",

While most\ncomputer vision approaches prioritize the RGB camera, the Depth modality -\nwhich can further amplify the subtleties of actions from an egocentric\nperspective - remains underexplored. Our work focuses on recognizing actions\nfrom egocentric RGB and Depth modalities in an industry-like environment. To\nstudy this problem, we consider the recent MECCANO dataset, which provides a\nwide range of assembling actions. Our framework is based on the 3D Video SWIN\nTransformer to encode both RGB and Depth modalities effectively. To address the\ninherent skewness in real-world multimodal action occurrences, we propose a\ntraining strategy using an exponentially decaying variant of the focal loss\nmodulating factor. Additionally, to leverage the information in both RGB and\nDepth modalities, we opt for late fusion to combine the predictions from each\nmodality. We thoroughly evaluate our method on the action recognition task of\nthe MECCANO dataset, and it significantly outperforms the prior work.

            "summary": "Pseudo-Labeling is a simple and effective approach to semi-supervised\nlearning. It requires criteria that guide the selection of pseudo-labeled data.\nThe latter have been shown to crucially affect pseudo-labeling's generalization\nperformance. Several such criteria exist and were proven to work reasonably\nwell in practice. However, their performance often depends on the initial model\nfit on labeled data. Early overfitting can be propagated to the final model by\nchoosing instances with overconfident but wrong predictions, often called\nconfirmation bias. In two recent works, we demonstrate that pseudo-label\nselection (PLS) can be naturally embedded into decision theory. This paves the\nway for BPLS, a Bayesian framework for PLS that mitigates the issue of\nconfirmation bias. At its heart is a novel selection criterion: an analytical\napproximation of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples and labeled data.\nWe derive this selection criterion by proving Bayes-optimality of this \"pseudo\nposterior predictive\". We empirically assess BPLS for generalized linear,\nnon-parametric generalized additive models and Bayesian neural networks on\nsimulated and real-world data. When faced with data prone to overfitting and\nthus a high chance of confirmation bias, BPLS outperforms traditional PLS\nmethods. The decision-theoretic embedding further allows us to render PLS more\nrobust towards the involved modeling assumptions. To achieve this goal, we\nintroduce a multi-objective utility function. We demonstrate that the latter\ncan be constructed to account for different sources of uncertainty and explore\nthree examples: model selection, accumulation of errors and covariate shift.",

Most existing methods in\nliterature aim to learn discriminative features from labeled images for\nclassification, however, they generally neglect confounders that infiltrate\ninto the learned features, resulting in low performances for discriminating\ntest images. To address this problem, we propose a Recursive Counterfactual\nDeconfounding model for object recognition in both closed-set and open-set\nscenarios based on counterfactual analysis, called RCD. The proposed model\nconsists of a factual graph and a counterfactual graph, where the relationships\namong image features, model predictions, and confounders are built and updated\nrecursively for learning more discriminative features. It performs in a\nrecursive manner so that subtler counterfactual features could be learned and\neliminated progressively, and both the discriminability and generalization of\nthe proposed model could be improved accordingly. In addition, a negative\ncorrelation constraint is designed for alleviating the negative effects of the\ncounterfactual features further at the model training stage. Extensive\nexperimental results on both closed-set recognition task and open-set\nrecognition task demonstrate that the proposed RCD model performs better than\n11 state-of-the-art baselines significantly in most cases.",

Using this equation, we can analyze the\nparabolic-like relationship between the critical temperature and pressure of a\nsuperconductor. The parabolic behavior of these superconductors' critical\ntemperature versus pressure can fit well. The maximal critical temperature of\nTl2Ba2CaCu2O8+{\\delta}, H3S, LaH10, and CaH6 superconductors are predicted to\nbe 112 K at 7 GPa, 197 K at 140 GPa, 252 K at 143 GPa, and 207 K at 174 GPa,\nrespectively.",

            "summary": "We investigate several distinct spectral crossovers amongst various\nintegrable and quantum-chaotic limits of a 1D disordered quantum spin-1/2\nmodel, by tuning the relative amplitudes of various Hamiltonian parameters to\nretain or break relevant unitary and antiunitary symmetries. Since we are\nspecially interested in crossovers involving a Gaussian symplectic ensemble\n(GSE) limit, we carry out all our calculations with an odd number of spins that\nnaturally results in eigenspectra with Kramers degeneracies. The various\ncrossovers are investigated via detailed studies of both short-range (NNSD) and\nlong-range (spectral rigidity and number variance) spectral correlations. The\nshort-range studies show excellent agreement with RMT predictions. One of the\nhighlights of this study is the systematic investigation of the consequences of\nretaining both eigenvalues corresponding to every Kramers doublet, in a\ncrossover involving the GSE limit, and see how it evolves to a limit where the\nKD is naturally lifted. The NNSD plot in the GSE limit exhibits a Dirac delta\npeak at zero splitting and a renormalized GSE hump at finite splitting, whose\ngeneral analytical form is derived. With an increasing symmetry breaking\nmagnetic field the NNSD shows an interesting, dynamic two-peaked structure that\nfinally converges to the standard GUE lineshape. We explain this trend in terms\nof a competition between the splittings amongst distinct Kramers doublets and\nthe Zeeman-like splittings induced by a breaking of time-reversal symmetry. In\nthe long-range spectral correlation studies, we shed light on the extent of\nagreement between our physical spin systems and RMT predictions. Our studies\nalso show that the long-range correlations may serve to distinguish between the\ntwo Poissonian limits (nonlocalized and localized) in the reentrant crossovers,\nwhich the short-range correlations fail to distinguish.",

Furthermore, we calculate the nuclear quadrupole\nmoments of the GeV defect. We vary the Hartree-Fock mixing parameter for\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional and show that the\nhyperfine couplings of the defect atoms have a linear dependence on the mixing\npercentage.

One popular application of this estimation\nlies in the prediction of the impact of a treatment (e.g., a promotion) on an\noutcome (e.g., sales) of a particular unit (e.g., an item), known as the\nindividual treatment effect (ITE). In many online applications, the outcome of\na unit can be affected by the treatments of other units, as units are often\nassociated, which is referred to as interference. For example, on an online\nshopping website, sales of an item will be influenced by an advertisement of\nits co-purchased item. Prior studies have attempted to model interference to\nestimate the ITE accurately, but they often assume a homogeneous interference,\ni.e., relationships between units only have a single view. However, in\nreal-world applications, interference may be heterogeneous, with multi-view\nrelationships. For instance, the sale of an item is usually affected by the\ntreatment of its co-purchased and co-viewed items. We hypothesize that ITE\nestimation will be inaccurate if this heterogeneous interference is not\nproperly modeled. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to model heterogeneous\ninterference by developing a new architecture to aggregate information from\ndiverse neighbors. Our proposed method contains graph neural networks that\naggregate same-view information, a mechanism that aggregates information from\ndifferent views, and attention mechanisms. In our experiments on multiple\ndatasets with heterogeneous interference, the proposed method significantly\noutperforms existing methods for ITE estimation, confirming the importance of\nmodeling heterogeneous interference.",

This will\nrise the security issues in highly-demanding tasks because small perturbations\nto the input video will result in potential attack risks. Though adversarial\nexamples have been extensively used for classification, it is rarely studied in\nvideo object segmentation. Existing related methods in computer vision either\nrequire prior knowledge of categories or cannot be directly applied due to the\nspecial design for certain tasks, failing to consider the pixel-wise region\nattack. Hence, this work develops an object-agnostic adversary that has\nadversarial impacts on VOS by first-frame attacking via hard region discovery.\nParticularly, the gradients from the segmentation model are exploited to\ndiscover the easily confused region, in which it is difficult to identify the\npixel-wise objects from the background in a frame. This provides a hardness map\nthat helps to generate perturbations with a stronger adversarial power for\nattacking the first frame.

In this paper, we explore the penalized eigenvalue\nproblem (PEP) which reformulates the computation of the first eigenvector as an\noptimization problem and adds an L1 penalty constraint. The contribution of our\narticle is threefold. First, we extend PEP by applying Nesterov smoothing to\nthe original LASSO-type L1 penalty. This allows one to compute analytical\ngradients which enable faster and more efficient minimization of the objective\nfunction associated with the optimization problem. Second, we demonstrate how\nhigher order eigenvectors can be calculated with PEP using established results\nfrom singular value decomposition (SVD). Third, using data from the 1000 Genome\nProject dataset, we empirically demonstrate that our proposed smoothed PEP\nallows one to increase numerical stability and obtain meaningful eigenvectors.\nWe further investigate the utility of the penalized eigenvector approach over\ntraditional PCA.",

            "summary": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to infer novel classes without training samples\nby transferring knowledge from seen classes. Existing embedding-based\napproaches for ZSL typically employ attention mechanisms to locate attributes\non an image. However, these methods often ignore the complex entanglement among\ndifferent attributes' visual features in the embedding space. Additionally,\nthese methods employ a direct attribute prediction scheme for classification,\nwhich does not account for the diversity of attributes in images of the same\ncategory. To address these issues, we propose a novel Dual Feature Augmentation\nNetwork (DFAN), which comprises two feature augmentation modules, one for\nvisual features and the other for semantic features. The visual feature\naugmentation module explicitly learns attribute features and employs cosine\ndistance to separate them, thus enhancing attribute representation. In the\nsemantic feature augmentation module, we propose a bias learner to capture the\noffset that bridges the gap between actual and predicted attribute values from\na dataset's perspective. Furthermore, we introduce two predictors to reconcile\nthe conflicts between local and global features. Experimental results on three\nbenchmarks demonstrate the marked advancement of our method compared to\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Sion1/DFAN.",

            "summary": "Could there be a quantum superposition of consciousness, as in the Wigner's\nfriend thought experiment? The integrated information theory (IIT) of\nconsciousness has turned this into a well-defined question. According to IIT,\nconsciousness is a measurable physical quantity given by integrated information\n($\\Phi$), such that the amount of consciousness in a system corresponds to its\namount of $\\Phi$. We use the most recent IIT formalism (IIT4.0) to analyze the\nsimplest non-zero $\\Phi$ system known as a feedback dyad. We then propose a\ncircuit that puts the dyad into a superposition of states which, according to\nIIT, would correspond to a superposition of conscious states. We refer to this\nas \"Schr\\\"odinger's dyad\". We therefore show that either IIT is false or the\nsimple dyad is conscious and can easily be put into a superposition of\nconscious states. We then identify the simplest possible consciousness-collapse\nmodel, which predicts that this superposition is unstable and collapses at a\nrate determined by a measure of difference between the superposed conscious\nstates. Our analysis will enable us to make a number of key observations about\nthe general structure of integrated information theory (IIT2.0, IIT3.0, IIT4.0,\nand QIIT) and the general structure of consciousness-collapse models.",

A ring-like structure produced\nby magnetic flux loss has been predicted theoretically, but no observational\nidentification has been presented. We have performed ALMA observations of the\nClass I protostar IRS 2 in the Corona Australis star-forming region and\nresolved a distinctive gas ring in the C$^{18}$O ($J$ = 2-1) line emission. The\ncenter of this gas ring is $\\sim$5,000 au away from the protostar, with a\ndiameter of $\\sim$7,000 au. The radial velocity of the gas is $\\lesssim1$ km\ns$^{-1}$ blueshifted from that of the protostar, with a possible expanding\nfeature judged from the velocity-field (moment 1) map and position-velocity\ndiagram. These features are either observationally new or have been discovered\nbut not discussed in depth because they are difficult to explain by\nwell-studied protostellar phenomena such as molecular outflows and accretion\nstreamers. A plausible interpretation is a magnetic wall created by the\nadvection of magnetic flux which is theoretically expected in the Class 0/I\nphase during star formation as a removal mechanism of magnetic flux. Similar\nstructures reported in the other young stellar sources could likely be\ncandidates formed by the same mechanism, encouraging us to revisit the issue of\nmagnetic flux transport in the early stages of star formation from an\nobservational perspective.",

            "summary": "Scoliosis diagnosis and assessment depend largely on the measurement of the\nCobb angle in spine X-ray images. With the emergence of deep learning\ntechniques that employ landmark detection, tilt prediction, and spine\nsegmentation, automated Cobb angle measurement has become increasingly popular.\nHowever, these methods encounter difficulties such as high noise sensitivity,\nintricate computational procedures, and exclusive reliance on a single type of\nmorphological information. In this paper, we introduce the Multiple\nMorphology-Aware Network (MMA-Net), a novel framework that improves Cobb angle\nmeasurement accuracy by integrating multiple spine morphology as attention\ninformation. In the MMA-Net, we first feed spine X-ray images into the\nsegmentation network to produce multiple morphological information (spine\nregion, centerline, and boundary) and then concatenate the original X-ray image\nwith the resulting segmentation maps as input for the regression module to\nperform precise Cobb angle measurement. Furthermore, we devise joint loss\nfunctions for our segmentation and regression network training, respectively.\nWe evaluate our method on the AASCE challenge dataset and achieve superior\nperformance with the SMAPE of 7.28% and the MAE of 3.18{\\deg}, indicating a\nstrong competitiveness compared to other outstanding methods.

This work proposes a standardised and explainable\nmachine learning pipeline to model patient readmission on a multicentric\ndatabase (i.e., the eICU cohort with 166,355 patients, 200,859 admissions and\n6,021 readmissions) while validating it on monocentric (i.e., the MIMIC IV\ncohort with 382,278 patients, 523,740 admissions and 5,984 readmissions) and\nmulticentric settings. Our machine learning pipeline achieved predictive\nperformance in terms of the area of the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUC) up to 0.7 with a Random Forest classification model, yielding an overall\ngood calibration and consistency on validation sets. From explanations provided\nby the constructed models, we could also derive a set of insightful\nconclusions, primarily on variables related to vital signs and blood tests\n(e.g., albumin, blood urea nitrogen and hemoglobin levels), demographics (e.g.,\nage, and admission height and weight), and ICU-associated variables (e.g., unit\ntype). These insights provide an invaluable source of information during\nclinicians' decision-making while discharging ICU patients.",

Current methods\ngenerally calculate variable importance for a given model trained on a given\ndataset. However, for a given dataset, there may be many models that explain\nthe target outcome equally well; without accounting for all possible\nexplanations, different researchers may arrive at many conflicting yet equally\nvalid conclusions given the same data. Additionally, even when accounting for\nall possible explanations for a given dataset, these insights may not\ngeneralize because not all good explanations are stable across reasonable data\nperturbations. We propose a new variable importance framework that quantifies\nthe importance of a variable across the set of all good models and is stable\nacross the data distribution. Our framework is extremely flexible and can be\nintegrated with most existing model classes and global variable importance\nmetrics. We demonstrate through experiments that our framework recovers\nvariable importance rankings for complex simulation setups where other methods\nfail. Further, we show that our framework accurately estimates the true\nimportance of a variable for the underlying data distribution. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees on the consistency and finite sample error rates for our\nestimator.

The size of the dataflows and the\ncomplexity of their operators often make existing equivalence verifiers (EVs)\nnot able to solve the problem.

The solution divides the dataflow version pair into small parts,\ncalled windows, and verifies the equivalence within each window by using an\nexisting EV as a black box.

            "summary": "The state of the art for physical hazard prediction from weather and climate\nrequires expensive km-scale numerical simulations driven by coarser resolution\nglobal inputs. Here, a km-scale downscaling diffusion model is presented as a\ncost effective alternative. The model is trained from a regional\nhigh-resolution weather model over Taiwan, and conditioned on ERA5 reanalysis\ndata. To address the downscaling uncertainties, large resolution ratios (25km\nto 2km), different physics involved at different scales and predict channels\nthat are not in the input data, we employ a two-step approach\n(\\textit{ResDiff}) where a (UNet) regression predicts the mean in the first\nstep and a diffusion model predicts the residual in the second step.\n\\textit{ResDiff} exhibits encouraging skill in bulk RMSE and CRPS scores. The\npredicted spectra and distributions from ResDiff faithfully recover important\npower law relationships regulating damaging wind and rain extremes. Case\nstudies of coherent weather phenomena reveal appropriate multivariate\nrelationships reminiscent of learnt physics. This includes the sharp wind and\ntemperature variations that co-locate with intense rainfall in a cold front,\nand the extreme winds and rainfall bands that surround the eyewall of typhoons.\nSome evidence of simultaneous bias correction is found. A first attempt at\ndownscaling directly from an operational global forecast model successfully\nretains many of these benefits. The implication is that a new era of fully\nend-to-end, global-to-regional machine learning weather prediction is likely\nnear at hand.",

            "summary": "Stance detection, the task of predicting an author's viewpoint towards a\nsubject of interest, has long been a focal point of research. Current stance\ndetection methods predominantly rely on manual annotation of sentences,\nfollowed by training a supervised machine learning model. This manual\nannotation process, however, imposes limitations on the model's ability to\nfully comprehend the stances in the sentence and hampers its potential to\ngeneralize across different contexts. In this study, we investigate the use of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for the task of stance classification, with an\nabsolute minimum use of human labels. We scrutinize four distinct types of\nprompting schemes combined with LLMs, comparing their accuracies with manual\nstance determination. Our study reveals that while LLMs can match or sometimes\neven exceed the benchmark results in each dataset, their overall accuracy is\nnot definitively better than what can be produced by supervised models. This\nsuggests potential areas for improvement in the stance classification for LLMs.\nThe application of LLMs, however, opens up promising avenues for unsupervised\nstance detection, thereby curtailing the need for manual collection and\nannotation of stances. This not only streamlines the process but also paves the\nway for expanding stance detection capabilities across languages. Through this\npaper, we shed light on the stance classification abilities of LLMs, thereby\ncontributing valuable insights that can guide future advancements in this\ndomain.",

Moreover, the reasons behind any prediction of the Arabic\nsentiment analysis methods exploiting advanced artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based approaches are like black-box - quite difficult to understand. This\npaper proposes an explainable sentiment classification framework for the Arabic\nlanguage by introducing a noise layer on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory\n(BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-BiLSTM models that overcome\nover-fitting problem. The proposed framework can explain specific predictions\nby training a local surrogate explainable model to understand why a particular\nsentiment (positive or negative) is being predicted. We carried out experiments\non public benchmark Arabic SA datasets. The results concluded that adding noise\nlayers improves the performance in sentiment analysis for the Arabic language\nby reducing overfitting and our method outperformed some known state-of-the-art\nmethods. In addition, the introduced explainability with noise layer could make\nthe model more transparent and accountable and hence help adopting AI-enabled\nsystem in practice.",

            "summary": "Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to remove\nadverse weather conditions in single images using a single set of pre-trained\nweights, they fail to restore weather videos due to the absence of temporal\ninformation. Furthermore, existing methods for removing adverse weather\nconditions (e.g., rain, fog, and snow) from videos can only handle one type of\nadverse weather. In this work, we propose the first framework for restoring\nvideos from all adverse weather conditions by developing a video\nadverse-weather-component suppression network (ViWS-Net). To achieve this, we\nfirst devise a weather-agnostic video transformer encoder with multiple\ntransformer stages. Moreover, we design a long short-term temporal modeling\nmechanism for weather messenger to early fuse input adjacent video frames and\nlearn weather-specific information. We further introduce a weather\ndiscriminator with gradient reversion, to maintain the weather-invariant common\ninformation and suppress the weather-specific information in pixel features, by\nadversarially predicting weather types. Finally, we develop a messenger-driven\nvideo transformer decoder to retrieve the residual weather-specific feature,\nwhich is spatiotemporally aggregated with hierarchical pixel features and\nrefined to predict the clean target frame of input videos. Experimental\nresults, on benchmark datasets and real-world weather videos, demonstrate that\nour ViWS-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of restoring\nvideos degraded by any weather condition.",

Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs) of defect-induced differential\ncharge density perturbations highlight the resulting screening effect, and,\ntogether with hydrogen Bader charges, strongly correlate to a large set of\natomic properties of the metal species forming the bulk crystal. We observe the\nspontaneous emergence of classes of charge responses while coarse-graining over\ncrystal compositions. Nudge-Elastic-Band calculations show that RDFs and charge\nfeatures also connect to hydrogen migration energy barriers between\ninterstitial sites.

This process, the current\nstandard, is both time-consuming and limiting: even the largest human coding\nefforts are typically constrained to measure only a small set of dimensions\nacross a subsample of available texts. In this work, we present an inferential\nframework that can be used to increase the power of an impact assessment, given\na fixed human-coding budget, by taking advantage of any ``untapped\"\nobservations -- those documents not manually scored due to time or resource\nconstraints -- as a supplementary resource. Our approach, a methodological\ncombination of causal inference, survey sampling methods, and machine learning,\nhas four steps: (1) select and code a sample of documents; (2) build a machine\nlearning model to predict the human-coded outcomes from a set of automatically\nextracted text features; (3) generate machine-predicted scores for all\ndocuments and use these scores to estimate treatment impacts; and (4) adjust\nthe final impact estimates using the residual differences between human-coded\nand machine-predicted outcomes. As an extension to this approach, we also\ndevelop a strategy for identifying an optimal subset of documents to code in\nStep 1 in order to further enhance precision. Through an extensive simulation\nstudy based on data from a recent field trial in education, we show that our\nproposed approach can be used to reduce the scope of a human-coding effort\nwhile maintaining nominal power to detect a significant treatment impact.",

Path finding algorithms that\naim at tracking suspicious flows of money usually struggle with scale and\ncomplexity. Existing community detection techniques also fail to properly\ncapture the time-dependent relationships. This is particularly evident when\nperforming analytics over massive transaction graphs. We propose a framework\n(called FaSTMAN), adapted for domain-specific constraints, to efficiently\nconstruct a temporal graph of sequential transactions. The framework includes a\nweighting method, using 2nd order graph representation, to quantify the\nsignificance of the edges. This method enables us to distribute complex queries\non smaller and densely connected networks of flows. Finally, based on those\nqueries, we can effectively identify networks of suspicious flows.

            "summary": "The increasing capacities of large language models (LLMs) present an\nunprecedented opportunity to scale up data analytics in the humanities and\nsocial sciences, augmenting and automating qualitative analytic tasks\npreviously typically allocated to human labor. This contribution proposes a\nsystematic mixed methods framework to harness qualitative analytic expertise,\nmachine scalability, and rigorous quantification, with attention to\ntransparency and replicability. 16 machine-assisted case studies are showcased\nas proof of concept. Tasks include linguistic and discourse analysis, lexical\nsemantic change detection, interview analysis, historical event cause inference\nand text mining, detection of political stance, text and idea reuse, genre\ncomposition in literature and film; social network inference, automated\nlexicography, missing metadata augmentation, and multimodal visual cultural\nanalytics. In contrast to the focus on English in the emerging LLM\napplicability literature, many examples here deal with scenarios involving\nsmaller languages and historical texts prone to digitization distortions. In\nall but the most difficult tasks requiring expert knowledge, generative LLMs\ncan demonstrably serve as viable research instruments. LLM (and human)\nannotations may contain errors and variation, but the agreement rate can and\nshould be accounted for in subsequent statistical modeling; a bootstrapping\napproach is discussed. The replications among the case studies illustrate how\ntasks previously requiring potentially months of team effort and complex\ncomputational pipelines, can now be accomplished by an LLM-assisted scholar in\na fraction of the time. Importantly, this approach is not intended to replace,\nbut to augment researcher knowledge and skills. With these opportunities in\nsight, qualitative expertise and the ability to pose insightful questions have\narguably never been more critical.",

            "summary": "The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) makes it important to\nrecognize their strengths and limitations. We argue that in order to develop a\nholistic understanding of these systems we need to consider the problem that\nthey were trained to solve: next-word prediction over Internet text. By\nrecognizing the pressures that this task exerts we can make predictions about\nthe strategies that LLMs will adopt, allowing us to reason about when they will\nsucceed or fail. This approach - which we call the teleological approach -\nleads us to identify three factors that we hypothesize will influence LLM\naccuracy: the probability of the task to be performed, the probability of the\ntarget output, and the probability of the provided input. We predict that LLMs\nwill achieve higher accuracy when these probabilities are high than when they\nare low - even in deterministic settings where probability should not matter.\nTo test our predictions, we evaluate two LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on eleven\ntasks, and we find robust evidence that LLMs are influenced by probability in\nthe ways that we have hypothesized. In many cases, the experiments reveal\nsurprising failure modes. For instance, GPT-4's accuracy at decoding a simple\ncipher is 51% when the output is a high-probability word sequence but only 13%\nwhen it is low-probability. These results show that AI practitioners should be\ncareful about using LLMs in low-probability situations. More broadly, we\nconclude that we should not evaluate LLMs as if they are humans but should\ninstead treat them as a distinct type of system - one that has been shaped by\nits own particular set of pressures.",

Crack evolution in\ncomposites is the bridge to elucidate the relationship between the\nmicrostructure and fracture performance, but crack-based finite element methods\nare computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting their application in\ncomputation-intensive scenarios. Here we propose a deep learning framework\ncalled Crack-Net, which incorporates the relationship between crack evolution\nand stress response to predict the fracture process in composites. Trained on a\nhigh-precision fracture development dataset generated using the phase field\nmethod, Crack-Net demonstrates a remarkable capability to accurately forecast\nthe long-term evolution of crack growth patterns and the stress-strain curve\nfor a given composite design. The Crack-Net captures the essential principle of\ncrack growth, which enables it to handle more complex microstructures such as\nbinary co-continuous structures. Moreover, transfer learning is adopted to\nfurther improve the generalization ability of Crack-Net for composite materials\nwith reinforcements of different strengths. The proposed Crack-Net holds great\npromise for practical applications in engineering and materials science, in\nwhich accurate and efficient fracture prediction is crucial for optimizing\nmaterial performance and microstructural design.",

The jet energy loss is simulated as a perturbative final-state vacuum\nparton shower followed by a medium-induced shower originating from elastic and\nradiative collisions with the medium constituents. Coherency is achieved by\nstarting with trial gluons that act as field dressing of the initial jet\nparton. These are formed according to a Gunion-Bertsch seed. The QCD version of\nthe LPM effect is attained by increasing the phase of the trial gluons through\nelastic scatterings with the medium. Above a phase threshold, the trial gluons\nwill be realised and can produce coherent radiation themselves. The model has\nbeen implemented in a Monte Carlo code and has been validated by successfully\nreproducing the BDMPS-Z prediction for the energy spectrum. The realistic case\nwith minimal assumptions are also produced and shown. In particular, we show\nthe influence of various parameters on the energy spectrum and transverse\nmomentum distribution, such as the in-medium quark masses, the energy transfer\nin the recoil process, and the phase accumulation criteria, especially for low\nand intermediate energy gluons. Future studies will allow for the interface\nwith full simulations of the quark-gluon-plasma with hydrodynamic evolution,\nsuch as vHLLE, along with subsequent hadronisation of the jet partons in order\nto produce realistic distributions that can be directly compared to LHC and\nRHIC data.",

As a\nresult, laminated glass exhibits greater ductility than non-laminated glass,\nmaking structures made with it suitable for safety-critical applications while\nmaintaining their aesthetic qualities. However, as shown in our previous\nstudies, such post-critical response is challenging to reproduce using\ndeterministic failure models, which mostly predict failure through a single\nthrough-thickness crack localized simultaneously in all layers. In this\nnumerical-experimental study, we explore the extent to which progressive\nfailure can be predicted by a simple randomized model, where layer-wise tensile\nstrength is modeled by independent, identically distributed Weibull variables.\nOn the numerical side, we employ a computationally efficient,\ndimensionally-reduced phase field formulation -- with each layer considered to\nbe a Reissner-Mindlin beam -- to study progressive failure through\ncombinatorial analysis and detailed Monte Carlo simulations. The reference\nexperimental data were obtained from displacement-controlled four-point bending\ntests performed on multi-layer laminated glass beams. For certain combinations\nof the glass layer strengths, results show that the randomized model can\nreproduce progressive structural failure and the formation of multiple\nlocalized cracks in the glass layers. However, the predicted response was less\nductile than that observed in experiments, and the model could not reproduce\nthe most frequent glass layer failure sequence. These findings highlight the\nneed to consider strength variability along the length of a beam and to include\nit in phase-field formulations.",

We analyze the behavior of accretion disks around\nSchwarzschild-like black holes in this modified gravity scenario, considering\nthe effects of the bumblebee field on the accretion process. Furthermore, we\nscrutinize the deflection angle of light rays as they traverse the\ngravitational field, highlighting potential deviations from standard\npredictions due to the underlying metric-affine structure. Investigating\ngreybody bounds in this context sheds light on the thermal radiation emitted by\nblack holes and how the modified gravity framework influences this phenomenon.\nMoreover, we explore neutrino propagation around Schwarzschild-like black holes\nwithin metric-affine bumblebee gravity, examining alterations in neutrino\ntrajectories and interactions compared to conventional general relativity. By\ncomprehensively probing these aspects, we aim to unravel the distinctive\nfeatures and consequences of Schwarzschild-like black holes in the context of\nmetric-affine bumblebee gravity, offering new insights into the nature of\ngravitational interactions and their observable signatures.",

            "summary": "Analytical dexterous grasping synthesis is often driven by grasp quality\nmetrics. However, existing metrics possess many problems, such as being\ncomputationally expensive, physically inaccurate, and non-differentiable.\nMoreover, none of them can facilitate the synthesis of non-force-closure\ngrasps, which account for a significant portion of task-oriented grasping such\nas lid screwing and button pushing. The main challenge behind all the above\ndrawbacks is the difficulty in modeling the complex Grasp Wrench Space (GWS).\nIn this work, we overcome this challenge by proposing a novel GWS estimator,\nthus enabling gradient-based task-oriented dexterous grasp synthesis for the\nfirst time. Our key contribution is a fast, accurate, and differentiable\ntechnique to estimate the GWS boundary with good physical interpretability by\nparallel sampling and mapping, which does not require iterative optimization.\nSecond, based on our differentiable GWS estimator, we derive a task-oriented\nenergy function to enable gradient-based grasp synthesis and a metric to\nevaluate non-force-closure grasps. Finally, we improve the previous dexterous\ngrasp synthesis pipeline mainly by a novel technique to make nearest-point\ncalculation differentiable, even on mesh edges and vertices. Extensive\nexperiments are performed to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our\nmethods. Our GWS estimator can run in several milliseconds on GPUs with minimal\nmemory cost, more than three orders of magnitude faster than the classic\ndiscretization-based method. Using this GWS estimator, we synthesize 0.1\nmillion dexterous grasps to show that our pipeline can significantly outperform\nthe SOTA method, even in task-unaware force-closure-grasp synthesis. For\ntask-oriented grasp synthesis, we provide some qualitative results. Our project\npage is https://pku-epic.github.io/TaskDexGrasp/.",

In\nthe non-SUSY models, single-stage unification is possible if one include a\nlight (around TeV) real triplet Higgs scalar. However, these models predict\nspeedy proton decay, inconsistent with the present experimental bound on the\nproton decay. This situation may be improved by including newer scalars and new\nintermediate-mass scales, which are present in the $SO(10)$ GUTs. The standard\nmodel is extended to a left-right symmetric model (LR), and the scale of LR\nbreaking naturally introduces the intermediate scale in the model.

As traditional discriminative\nmethods bear the problem of low interpretability, the recent large language\nmodels have been explored for interpretable mental health analysis on social\nmedia, which aims to provide detailed explanations along with predictions. The\nresults show that ChatGPT can generate approaching-human explanations for its\ncorrect classifications. However, LLMs still achieve unsatisfactory\nclassification performance in a zero-shot/few-shot manner. Domain-specific\nfinetuning is an effective solution, but faces 2 challenges: 1) lack of\nhigh-quality training data. 2) no open-source LLMs for interpretable mental\nhealth analysis were released to lower the finetuning cost. To alleviate these\nproblems, we build the first multi-task and multi-source interpretable mental\nhealth instruction (IMHI) dataset on social media, with 105K data samples. The\nraw social media data are collected from 10 existing sources covering 8 mental\nhealth analysis tasks. We use expert-written few-shot prompts and collected\nlabels to prompt ChatGPT and obtain explanations from its responses. To ensure\nthe reliability of the explanations, we perform strict automatic and human\nevaluations on the correctness, consistency, and quality of generated data.\nBased on the IMHI dataset and LLaMA2 foundation models, we train MentalLLaMA,\nthe first open-source LLM series for interpretable mental health analysis with\ninstruction-following capability. We also evaluate the performance of\nMentalLLaMA on the IMHI evaluation benchmark with 10 test sets, where their\ncorrectness for making predictions and the quality of explanations are\nexamined.

To fill these fundamental gaps, we devise LOGICSEG, a holistic\nvisual semantic parser that integrates neural inductive learning and logic\nreasoning with both rich data and symbolic knowledge. In particular, the\nsemantic concepts of interest are structured as a hierarchy, from which a set\nof constraints are derived for describing the symbolic relations and formalized\nas first-order logic rules. After fuzzy logic-based continuous relaxation,\nlogical formulae are grounded onto data and neural computational graphs, hence\nenabling logic-induced network training. During inference, logical constraints\nare packaged into an iterative process and injected into the network in a form\nof several matrix multiplications, so as to achieve hierarchy-coherent\nprediction with logic reasoning. These designs together make LOGICSEG a general\nand compact neural-logic machine that is readily integrated into existing\nsegmentation models. Extensive experiments over four datasets with various\nsegmentation models and backbones verify the effectiveness and generality of\nLOGICSEG.

While\nsuch investigations have been conducted for attached/flat-plate flow\nconfigurations, systematic studies specifically targeting turbulent flows with\nseparation are notably sparse. To bridge this gap, our study focuses on the\nflow over a two-dimensional Gaussian-shaped bump at a moderately high Reynolds\nnumber, which involves smooth-body separation of a turbulent boundary layer\nunder pressure-gradient and surface-curvature effects. In the simulations, the\nno-slip condition at the wall is replaced by three different forms of boundary\ncondition based on the thin boundary layer equations and the mean wall-shear\nstress from high-fidelity numerical simulation to avoid the additional\ncomplexity of modeling the wall-shear stress. Various statistics, including the\nmean separation bubble size, mean velocity profile, and eddy viscosity from SGS\nmodel, are compared and analyzed. The results reveal that capturing the\nseparation bubble strongly depends on the choice of SGS model. While grid\nconvergence can be achieved at a resolution comparable to wall-resolved LES\nmesh, above this limit, the LES predictions exhibit intricate sensitivities to\nmesh resolution.

Existing self-training\nmethods use a model trained on labeled source data to generate pseudo labels\nfor target data and refine the predictions via fine-tuning the network on the\npseudo labels. These methods suffer from domain shifts caused by different\nLiDAR sensor configurations in the source and target domains. We propose two\ntechniques to reduce sensor discrepancy and improve pseudo label quality: 1)\nLiDAR beam subsampling, which simulates different LiDAR scanning patterns by\nrandomly dropping beams; 2) cross-frame ensembling, which exploits temporal\nconsistency of consecutive frames to generate more reliable pseudo labels. Our\nmethod is simple, generalizable, and does not incur any extra inference cost.\nWe evaluate our method on several public LiDAR datasets and show that it\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods by more than $3.9\\%$ mIoU on average\nfor all scenarios.

Furthermore, traditional workflows based on using analytic\nreconstruction algorithms require a large number of projections for accurate\ncharacterization - leading to longer measurement times and hindering the\nadoption of XCT for in-line inspections. In this paper, we introduce a new\nworkflow based on the use of two neural networks to obtain high-quality\naccelerated reconstructions from sparse-view XCT scans of single material metal\nparts. The first network, implemented using fully-connected layers, helps\nreduce the impact of BH in the projection data without the need of any\ncalibration or knowledge of the component material. The second network, a\nconvolutional neural network, maps a low-quality analytic 3D reconstruction to\na high-quality reconstruction. Using experimental data, we demonstrate that our\nmethod robustly generalizes across several alloys, and for a range of sparsity\nlevels without any need for retraining the networks thereby enabling accurate\nand fast industrial XCT inspections.",

Taking a step ahead, language-supervised semantic\nsegmentation enables spatial localization of textual inputs by learning pixel\ngrouping solely from image-text pairs. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art\nsuffers from clear semantic gaps between visual and textual modality: plenty of\nvisual concepts appeared in images are missing in their paired captions. Such\nsemantic misalignment circulates in pre-training, leading to inferior zero-shot\nperformance in dense predictions due to insufficient visual concepts captured\nin textual representations. To close such semantic gap, we propose Concept\nCuration (CoCu), a pipeline that leverages CLIP to compensate for the missing\nsemantics. For each image-text pair, we establish a concept archive that\nmaintains potential visually-matched concepts with our proposed vision-driven\nexpansion and text-to-vision-guided ranking. Relevant concepts can thus be\nidentified via cluster-guided sampling and fed into pre-training, thereby\nbridging the gap between visual and textual semantics. Extensive experiments\nover a broad suite of 8 segmentation benchmarks show that CoCu achieves superb\nzero-shot transfer performance and greatly boosts language-supervised\nsegmentation baseline by a large margin, suggesting the value of bridging\nsemantic gap in pre-training data.",

Machine learning-based methods, fueled by extensive PPI\ndatasets such as Ab-Bind, PINT, SKEMPI, and others, have shown promise in\npredicting binding affinity changes. However, accurate predictions and\ngeneralization of these models across different datasets remain challenging.\nGeometric graph learning has emerged as a powerful approach, combining graph\ntheory and machine learning, to capture structural features of biomolecules.

            "summary": "Autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and drones, have made\nsignificant strides in recent years by leveraging visual inputs and machine\nlearning for decision-making and control. Despite their impressive performance,\nthese vision-based controllers can make erroneous predictions when faced with\nnovel or out-of-distribution inputs. Such errors can cascade to catastrophic\nsystem failures and compromise system safety. In this work, we introduce a\nrun-time anomaly monitor to detect and mitigate such closed-loop, system-level\nfailures. Specifically, we leverage a reachability-based framework to\nstress-test the vision-based controller offline and mine its system-level\nfailures. This data is then used to train a classifier that is leveraged online\nto flag inputs that might cause system breakdowns. The anomaly detector\nhighlights issues that transcend individual modules and pertain to the safety\nof the overall system. We also design a fallback controller that robustly\nhandles these detected anomalies to preserve system safety. We validate the\nproposed approach on an autonomous aircraft taxiing system that uses a\nvision-based controller for taxiing. Our results show the efficacy of the\nproposed approach in identifying and handling system-level anomalies,\noutperforming methods such as prediction error-based detection, and ensembling,\nthereby enhancing the overall safety and robustness of autonomous systems.",

Here we have studied a prototype\n4d-4f compound, Ba3HoRu2O9, through time-of-flight neutron diffraction, ac\nsusceptibility, and complex dielectric spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the\nnon-colinear structure involving two different magnetic ions, Ru(4d) and\nHo(4f), breaks the spatial inversion symmetry via inverse Dzyaloshinskii Moriya\n(D-M) interaction through strong 4d-4f magnetic correlation, which results in\nnon-zero polarization. The stronger spin-orbit coupling of 4d-orbital might\nplay a major role in creating D-M interaction of non-linear spins. We have\nsystematically investigated the magnetoelectric domain dynamics in this system,\nwhich exhibits intriguing behavior with shorter coherence lengths. Further, we\nhave investigated the effect of external pressure on the magnetic transition.\nThe result reveals an enhancement of ordering temperature by the application of\nexternal pressure (1.6K per GPa). We speculate that external pressure might\nfavor stabilizing the magnetoelectric phase. Our study shows a route to\ndesigning magnetoelectric multiferroic compounds containing larger d-orbital\nthrough strong 4d-4f cross-coupling.",

            "summary": "As Basu (1977) writes, \"Eliminating nuisance parameters from a model is\nuniversally recognized as a major problem of statistics,\" but after more than\n50 years since Basu wrote these words, the two mainstream schools of thought in\nstatistics have yet to solve the problem. Fortunately, the two mainstream\nframeworks aren't the only options. This series of papers rigorously develops a\nnew and very general inferential model (IM) framework for\nimprecise-probabilistic statistical inference that is provably valid and\nefficient, while simultaneously accommodating incomplete or partial prior\ninformation about the relevant unknowns when it's available. The present paper,\nPart III in the series, tackles the marginal inference problem. Part II showed\nthat, for parametric models, the likelihood function naturally plays a central\nrole and, here, when nuisance parameters are present, the same principles\nsuggest that the profile likelihood is the key player. When the likelihood\nfactors nicely, so that the interest and nuisance parameters are perfectly\nseparated, the valid and efficient profile-based marginal IM solution is\nimmediate. But even when the likelihood doesn't factor nicely, the same\nprofile-based solution remains valid and leads to efficiency gains. This is\ndemonstrated in several examples, including the famous Behrens--Fisher and\ngamma mean problems, where I claim the proposed IM solution is the best\nsolution available. Remarkably, the same profiling-based construction offers\nvalidity guarantees in the prediction and non-parametric inference problems.\nFinally, I show how a broader view of this new IM construction can handle\nnon-parametric inference on risk minimizers and makes a connection between\nnon-parametric IMs and conformal prediction.",

The GAN models have achieved remarkable results in\nreproducing ECG signals but are only designed for multiple lead inputs and the\nfeatures the GAN model preserves have not been identified-limiting the\ngenerated signals use in cardiovascular disease (CVD)-predictive models. This\npaper presents ECGNet which is a procedure that generates a complete set of\n12-lead ECG signals from any single lead input using a GAN framework with a\nbidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) generator and a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) discriminator. Cross and auto-correlation analysis\nperformed on the generated signals identifies features conserved during the\nsignal generation-i.e., features that can characterize the unique-nature of\neach signal and thus likely indicators of CVD.

Due to the labor intensity in data collection and cleaning,\nautomating outlier data generation has been a long-desired alternative. Despite\nthe appeal, generating photo-realistic outliers in the high dimensional pixel\nspace has been an open challenge for the field. To tackle the problem, this\npaper proposes a new framework DREAM-OOD, which enables imagining\nphoto-realistic outliers by way of diffusion models, provided with only the\nin-distribution (ID) data and classes. Specifically, DREAM-OOD learns a\ntext-conditioned latent space based on ID data, and then samples outliers in\nthe low-likelihood region via the latent, which can be decoded into images by\nthe diffusion model. Different from prior works, DREAM-OOD enables visualizing\nand understanding the imagined outliers, directly in the pixel space. We\nconduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative studies to understand the\nefficacy of DREAM-OOD, and show that training with the samples generated by\nDREAM-OOD can benefit OOD detection performance.

In this work, we present a nonparametric strategy for learning\ninvariant representations based on the recently-proposed Nadaraya-Watson (NW)\nhead. The NW head makes a prediction by comparing the learned representations\nof the query to the elements of a support set that consists of labeled data. We\ndemonstrate that by manipulating the support set, one can encode different\ncausal assumptions. In particular, restricting the support set to a single\nenvironment encourages the model to learn invariant features that do not depend\non the environment.

Our catalogue aims to connect the chemical\nand kinematic properties of GCs to the assembly histories of their host\ngalaxies. We apply the model to a selected sample of simulated galaxies that\nclosely match the virial mass, circular velocity profile, and defining assembly\nevents of the MW and M31. The resulting catalogue has been calibrated to\nsuccessfully reproduce key characteristics of the observed GC systems,\nincluding total cluster mass, mass function, metallicity distribution, radial\nprofile, and velocity dispersion. We find that clusters in M31 span a wider\nrange of age and metallicity, relative to the MW, possibly due to M31's recent\nmajor merger. Such a merger also heated up the in-situ GC population to higher\norbital energy and introduced a large number of ex-situ clusters at large\nradii.

Yet, data scarcity, especially\nhigh-resolution DEMs, challenges regions with limited resources. This paper\nexamines how DEM type and resolution affect flood prediction accuracy,\nutilizing a cutting-edge deep learning (DL) method called 1D convolutional\nneural network (CNN). It utilizes synthetic hydrographs for training input and\nwater depth data from LISFLOOD-FP, a 2D hydrodynamic model, for target data.\nThis study investigates digital surface models (DSMs) and digital terrain\nmodels (DTMs) derived from a 1 m LIDAR-based DTM, with resolutions from 15 to\n30 m. The methodology is applied and assessed in the established benchmark site\nof Carlisle, UK. The models' performance is then evaluated and compared against\nan observed flood event using RMSE, Bias, and Fit indices. Leveraging the\ninsights gained from this region, the paper discusses the applicability of the\nmethodology to address the challenges encountered in a data-scarce flood-prone\nregion, exemplified by Pakistan. Results indicated that utilizing a 30 m DTM\nimproved flood depth prediction accuracy by about 21% during the flood peak\nstage compared to a 30 m DSM, highlighting the superior performance of DTM at\nlower resolutions. Increasing the resolution of DTM to 15 m resulted in a\nminimum 50% increase in RMSE and a 20% increase in fit index across all flood\nphases. The findings emphasize that while a coarser resolution DEM may impact\nthe accuracy of machine learning models, it remains a viable option for rapid\nflood prediction. Any attempts to improve data resolution in data-scarce\nregions would provide significant added value, ultimately enhancing flood risk\nmanagement.",

GNS represents the domain as a graph with particles as nodes and\nlearned interactions as edges. Compared to modeling global dynamics, GNS\nenables learning local interaction laws through edge messages, improving its\ngeneralization to new environments. GNS achieves over 165x speedup for granular\nflow prediction compared to parallel CPU numerical simulations. We propose a\nnovel hybrid GNS/Material Point Method (MPM) to accelerate forward simulations\nby minimizing error on a pure surrogate model by interleaving MPM in GNS\nrollouts to satisfy conservation laws and minimize errors achieving 24x speedup\ncompared to pure numerical simulations. The differentiable GNS enables solving\ninverse problems through automatic differentiation, identifying material\nparameters that result in target runout distances. We demonstrate the ability\nof GNS to solve inverse problems by iteratively updating the friction angle (a\nmaterial property) by computing the gradient of a loss function based on the\nfinal and target runouts, thereby identifying the friction angle that best\nmatches the observed runout. The physics-embedded and differentiable simulators\nopen an exciting new paradigm for AI-accelerated design, control, and\noptimization.",

So, to\ncombat this, temperature prediction with strong accuracy is vital. So far, the\nmost effective widely used measure for such forecasting is Numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) which is a mathematical model that needs broad data from\ndifferent applications to make predictions. This expensive, time and labor\nconsuming work can be minimized through making such predictions using Machine\nlearning algorithms. Using the database made by University of Dayton which\nconsists the change of temperature in major cities we used the Time Series\nAnalysis method where we use LSTM for the purpose of turning existing data into\na tool for future prediction. LSTM takes the long-term data as well as any\nshort-term exceptions or anomalies that may have occurred and calculates trend,\nseasonality and the stationarity of a data. By using models such as ARIMA,\nSARIMA, Prophet with the concept of RNN and LSTM we can, filter out any\nabnormalities, preprocess the data compare it with previous trends and make a\nprediction of future trends. Also, seasonality and stationarity help us analyze\nthe reoccurrence or repeat over one year variable and removes the constrain of\ntime in which the data was dependent so see the general changes that are\npredicted. By doing so we managed to make prediction of the temperature of\ndifferent cities during any time in future based on available data and built a\nmethod of accurate prediction. This document contains our methodology for being\nable to make such predictions.",

We demonstrate how\nexcluding censored data results in an overestimation of the initial tumour\nvolume and the MM-predicted tumour volumes prior to the first measurements, and\nan underestimation of the carrying capacity and the MM-predicted tumour volumes\nbeyond the latest measurable time points. We show in which way the choice of\nprior for the MM parameters can impact the posterior distributions, and\nillustrate that reporting the highest-likelihood parameters and their 95%\ncredible interval can lead to confusing or misleading interpretations.

The model is based on the social validation concept that has been\napplied to various social systems and is still interesting to study today,\nespecially when agents who interact with each other do not follow the\nprevailing norms. This paper examines the generalized Sznajd model involving\nindependent agents defined on a complete graph and a two-dimensional square\nlattice. Agents on the networks act independently with probability $p$, that\nis, change their opinion or state without the influence of others. In this\nmodel, we defined a paired agent size $r$, which persuades its nearest neighbor\nsize $n$ to follow their opinion. Based on our results, both analytically and\nnumerically, on the complete graph, the macroscopic state of the system is not\naffected by the neighbor size $n$ but only depends on the number of the paired\nagents $r$. The time required to reach a stationary state is inversely\nproportional to the number of neighboring agents $n$. We obtain two critical\npoints $p = p_c$ in the two-dimensional square lattice depending on the\nconfiguration agents. Our results suggest that the model universality class\ndefined on the complete graph still belongs to the mean-field Ising\nuniversality class. In addition, the model universality class defined on the\ntwo-dimensional square lattice with two different configurations is identical\nand belongs to the two-dimensional Ising universality class.",

Deep\nlearning methods have shown promising results, but demanding large volumes of\nannotated data for training. However, annotating medical images is costly and\nrequires specialized knowledge. The diverse forms and contrasts of objects in\nmedical images make fully annotation even more challenging, resulting in\nincomplete annotations. Directly training ULD detectors on such datasets can\nyield suboptimal results. Pseudo-label-based methods examine the training data\nand mine unlabelled objects for retraining, which have shown to be effective to\ntackle this issue. Presently, top-performing methods rely on a dynamic\nlabel-mining mechanism, operating at the mini-batch level. However, the model's\nperformance varies at different iterations, leading to inconsistencies in the\nquality of the mined labels and limits their performance enhancement. Inspired\nby the observation that deep models learn concepts with increasing complexity,\nwe introduce an innovative exploratory training to assess the reliability of\nmined lesions over time. Specifically, we introduce a teacher-student detection\nmodel as basis, where the teacher's predictions are combined with incomplete\nannotations to train the student. Additionally, we design a prediction bank to\nrecord high-confidence predictions. Each sample is trained several times,\nallowing us to get a sequence of records for each sample. If a prediction\nconsistently appears in the record sequence, it is likely to be a true object,\notherwise it may just a noise. This serves as a crucial criterion for selecting\nreliable mined lesions for retraining. Our experimental results substantiate\nthat the proposed framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods on two medical\nimage datasets, demonstrating its superior performance.",

When recommendations\nare too narrow and fail to cover the full range of users' preferences, the\nsystem is perceived as useless. Conversely, when the system suggests too many\nitems that users don't like, it is considered impersonal or ineffective. To\nbetter understand user sentiment about the breadth of recommendations given by\na movie recommender, we conducted interviews and surveys and found out that\nmany users considered narrow recommendations to be useful, while a smaller\nnumber explicitly wanted greater breadth. Additionally, we designed and ran an\nonline field experiment with a larger user group, evaluating two new interfaces\ndesigned to provide users with greater access to broader recommendations. We\nlooked at user preferences and behavior for two groups of users: those with\nhigher initial movie diversity and those with lower diversity. Among our\nfindings, we discovered that different level of exploration control and users'\nsubjective preferences on interfaces are more predictive of their satisfaction\nwith the recommender.",

            "summary": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, often manifests as\nspeech and voice dysfunction. While utilizing voice data for PD detection has\ngreat potential in clinical applications, the widely used deep learning models\ncurrently have fairness issues regarding different ages of onset. These deep\nmodels perform well for the elderly group (age $>$ 55) but are less accurate\nfor the young group (age $\\leq$ 55). Through our investigation, the discrepancy\nbetween the elderly and the young arises due to 1) an imbalanced dataset and 2)\nthe milder symptoms often seen in early-onset patients. However, traditional\ndebiasing methods are impractical as they typically impair the prediction\naccuracy for the majority group while minimizing the discrepancy. To address\nthis issue, we present a new debiasing method using GradCAM-based feature\nmasking combined with ensemble models, ensuring that neither fairness nor\naccuracy is compromised. Specifically, the GradCAM-based feature masking\nselectively obscures age-related features in the input voice data while\npreserving essential information for PD detection. The ensemble models further\nimprove the prediction accuracy for the minority (young group). Our approach\neffectively improves detection accuracy for early-onset patients without\nsacrificing performance for the elderly group. Additionally, we propose a\ntwo-step detection strategy for the young group, offering a practical risk\nassessment for potential early-onset PD patients.",

In the literature, change- and\nfault-proneness have been predicted using the internal software metrics which\nare almost one decade earlier. Therefore, as software systems and structures\nare evolving in nature, we present an empirical study to revisit the\nrelationship of the internal software metrics with change- and fault-proneness\nto provide up-to-date insights. In particular, we identify 25 internal software\nmetrics, change-proneness and fault-proneness in the wellknown open source\nsystems from Apache and Eclipse ecosystems. Then we analyse the relationship\nbased on the statistical correlation method. The results show that almost all\nof the metrics have no or low relationship with fault-proneness, while\ninheritance, coupling and comments-related metrics have a moderate or high\nrelationship with change-proneness. These findings will assist developers to\nminimize the higher related software metrics to enhance maintainability in\nterms of change- and fault-proneness.

These interfaces have a range of\napplications, including the control of extended reality, agile prosthetics, and\nexoskeletons. However, the natural variability of sEMG among individuals has\nled researchers to focus on subject-specific solutions. Deep learning methods,\nwhich often have complex structures, are particularly data-hungry and can be\ntime-consuming to train, making them less practical for subject-specific\napplications. In this paper, we propose and develop a generalizable, sequential\ndecoder of transient high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) that achieves 73% average\naccuracy on 65 gestures for partially-observed subjects through\nsubject-embedded transfer learning, leveraging pre-knowledge of HGR acquired\nduring pre-training. The use of transient HD-sEMG before gesture stabilization\nallows us to predict gestures with the ultimate goal of counterbalancing system\ncontrol delays. The results show that the proposed generalized models\nsignificantly outperform subject-specific approaches, especially when the\ntraining data is limited, and there is a significant number of gesture classes.\nBy building on pre-knowledge and incorporating a multiplicative\nsubject-embedded structure, our method comparatively achieves more than 13%\naverage accuracy across partially observed subjects with minimal data\navailability. This work highlights the potential of HD-sEMG and demonstrates\nthe benefits of modeling common patterns across users to reduce the need for\nlarge amounts of data for new users, enhancing practicality.",

            "summary": "Deep learning models fail on cross-domain challenges if the model is\noversensitive to domain-specific attributes, e.g., lightning, background,\ncamera angle, etc. To alleviate this problem, data augmentation coupled with\nconsistency regularization are commonly adopted to make the model less\nsensitive to domain-specific attributes. Consistency regularization enforces\nthe model to output the same representation or prediction for two views of one\nimage. These constraints, however, are either too strict or not\norder-preserving for the classification probabilities. In this work, we propose\nthe Order-preserving Consistency Regularization (OCR) for cross-domain tasks.\nThe order-preserving property for the prediction makes the model robust to\ntask-irrelevant transformations. As a result, the model becomes less sensitive\nto the domain-specific attributes. The comprehensive experiments show that our\nmethod achieves clear advantages on five different cross-domain tasks.",

In this work, we conduct a pilot study showing that PLMs as\nfew-shot learners are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks while existing\ndefenses are inadequate due to the unique challenges of few-shot scenarios. To\naddress such challenges, we advocate MDP, a novel lightweight, pluggable, and\neffective defense for PLMs as few-shot learners. Specifically, MDP leverages\nthe gap between the masking-sensitivity of poisoned and clean samples: with\nreference to the limited few-shot data as distributional anchors, it compares\nthe representations of given samples under varying masking and identifies\npoisoned samples as ones with significant variations. We show analytically that\nMDP creates an interesting dilemma for the attacker to choose between attack\neffectiveness and detection evasiveness. The empirical evaluation using\nbenchmark datasets and representative attacks validates the efficacy of MDP.",

This study introduces over-parameterized neural networks\nnot only to forecast tropical rain rates, but also to explain their\nheavy-tailed distribution. The prediction is separately conducted for three\nrain types (stratiform, deep convective, and shallow convective) observed by\nthe Global Precipitation Measurement satellite radar over the West and East\nPacific regions. Atmospheric profiles of humidity, temperature, and zonal and\nmeridional winds from the MERRA-2 reanalysis are considered as features.\nAlthough over-parameterized neural networks are well-known for their \"double\ndescent phenomenon,\" little has been explored about their applicability to\nclimate data and capability of capturing the tail behavior of data. In our\nresults, over-parameterized neural networks accurately predict the rain rate\ndistributions and outperform other machine learning methods. Spatial maps show\nthat over-parameterized neural networks also successfully describe spatial\npatterns of each rain type across the tropical Pacific. In addition, we assess\nthe feature importance for each over-parameterized neural network to provide\ninsight into the key factors driving the predictions, with low-level humidity\nand temperature variables being the overall most important. These findings\nhighlight the capability of over-parameterized neural networks in predicting\nthe distribution of the rain rate and explaining extreme values.",

            "summary": "Video scene graph generation (VidSGG) aims to identify objects in visual\nscenes and infer their relationships for a given video. It requires not only a\ncomprehensive understanding of each object scattered on the whole scene but\nalso a deep dive into their temporal motions and interactions. Inherently,\nobject pairs and their relationships enjoy spatial co-occurrence correlations\nwithin each image and temporal consistency/transition correlations across\ndifferent images, which can serve as prior knowledge to facilitate VidSGG model\nlearning and inference. In this work, we propose a spatial-temporal\nknowledge-embedded transformer (STKET) that incorporates the prior\nspatial-temporal knowledge into the multi-head cross-attention mechanism to\nlearn more representative relationship representations. Specifically, we first\nlearn spatial co-occurrence and temporal transition correlations in a\nstatistical manner. Then, we design spatial and temporal knowledge-embedded\nlayers that introduce the multi-head cross-attention mechanism to fully explore\nthe interaction between visual representation and the knowledge to generate\nspatial- and temporal-embedded representations, respectively. Finally, we\naggregate these representations for each subject-object pair to predict the\nfinal semantic labels and their relationships.

Existing methods reconstruct either the original\npoints or related features as the objective of pre-training. However,\nconsidering the diversity of downstream tasks, it is necessary for the model to\nhave both low- and high-level representation modeling capabilities to capture\ngeometric details and semantic contexts during pre-training. To this end,\nM$^3$CS is proposed to enable the model with the above abilities. Specifically,\nwith masked point cloud as input, M$^3$CS introduces two decoders to predict\nmasked representations and the original points simultaneously. While an extra\ndecoder doubles parameters for the decoding process and may lead to\noverfitting, we propose siamese decoders to keep the amount of learnable\nparameters unchanged. Further, we propose an online codebook projecting\ncontinuous tokens into discrete ones before reconstructing masked points. In\nsuch way, we can enforce the decoder to take effect through the combinations of\ntokens rather than remembering each token.

Using two-layer quasi-geostrophic turbulence as the test\ncase, MEDIDA is shown to successfully discover various linear and nonlinear\nstructural/parametric errors when full observations are available. Discovery\nfrom spatially sparse observations is found to require highly accurate\ninterpolation schemes. While NNs have shown success as interpolators in recent\nstudies, here, they are found inadequate due to their inability to accurately\nrepresent small scales, a phenomenon known as spectral bias. We show that a\ngeneral remedy, adding a random Fourier feature layer to the NN, resolves this\nissue enabling MEDIDA to successfully discover model errors from sparse\nobservations. These promising results suggest that with further development,\nMEDIDA could be scaled up to models of the Earth system and real observations.",

            "summary": "Robust quantification of predictive uncertainty is critical for understanding\nfactors that drive weather and climate outcomes. Ensembles provide predictive\nuncertainty estimates and can be decomposed physically, but both physics and\nmachine learning ensembles are computationally expensive. Parametric deep\nlearning can estimate uncertainty with one model by predicting the parameters\nof a probability distribution but do not account for epistemic uncertainty..\nEvidential deep learning, a technique that extends parametric deep learning to\nhigher-order distributions, can account for both aleatoric and epistemic\nuncertainty with one model. This study compares the uncertainty derived from\nevidential neural networks to those obtained from ensembles. Through\napplications of classification of winter precipitation type and regression of\nsurface layer fluxes, we show evidential deep learning models attaining\npredictive accuracy rivaling standard methods, while robustly quantifying both\nsources of uncertainty. We evaluate the uncertainty in terms of how well the\npredictions are calibrated and how well the uncertainty correlates with\nprediction error. Analyses of uncertainty in the context of the inputs reveal\nsensitivities to underlying meteorological processes, facilitating\ninterpretation of the models. The conceptual simplicity, interpretability, and\ncomputational efficiency of evidential neural networks make them highly\nextensible, offering a promising approach for reliable and practical\nuncertainty quantification in Earth system science modeling. In order to\nencourage broader adoption of evidential deep learning in Earth System Science,\nwe have developed a new Python package, MILES-GUESS\n(https://github.com/ai2es/miles-guess), that enables users to train and\nevaluate both evidential and ensemble deep learning.",

            "summary": "Direct dry-cooled power plants typically operate numerous large-diameter\naxial flow fans in air-cooled condensers to facilitate the condensation of\nsteam in the plant thermodynamic cycle. Enhanced fan efficiency may, at scale,\nlead to significant parasitic power reductions and subsequent increases in\nplant power output. The performance of these fans may be increased by adding\nblade tip modifications which act to control blade tip leakage flow. Previous\nstudies have shown that manipulating the tip leakage vortex increases the\nblade-to-air momentum transfer and stabilizes the air flow structures as it\ntraverses the fan blade. This paper takes a step towards the development of\nimproved tip vortex manipulators for an ACC fan. Three-dimensional\ncomputational fluid dynamic simulations, and experimental testing of the\nmodified and unmodified fan within an ISO test facility is performed. The\nresults are then utilized to assess the accuracy of the simulation model,\nvisualize the manipulated flow structures at the blade tip, and ultimately\nquantify the effect of the endplate designs on fan performance. Excellent\ncorrelation between numerical and test results for the unmodified fan is\nobserved, and the benefit of blade tip modification on fan performance is again\nconfirmed experimentally. The simulation model however fails to predict\nimprovements in fan performance under modification, and simulated tip leakage\nflows are investigated for clarification. It is hypothesized that deflection of\ntip endplates under operation account for differences between simulation and\nexperiment, and that fluid-structure interaction analyses could potentially\nresolve discrepancies.",

            "summary": "Interfacial thermal resistance has been often estimated and understood using\nthe Landauer formalism that assumes incident phonons with equilibrium\ndistribution. However, previous studies suggest that phonons are\nout-of-equilibrium near the interface because of the heat flow through the\nleads and the scattering of phonons by the interface. In this paper, we report\na systematic study on how vibrational spectra mismatch affects the degree of\nphonon non-equilibrium near an interface, how fast it is relaxed as the phonons\ndiffuse into a lead, and the overall interfacial thermal resistance from the\nnon-equilibrium phonons. Our discussion is based on the solution of the\nPeierls-Boltzmann transport equation with ab initio inputs for 36 interfaces\nbetween semi-infinite group-III (Al, Ga, In) and group-V (P, As, Sb) compound\nsemiconductor leads. The simulation reveals that the non-equilibrium phonons\ncause significant interfacial thermal resistance for all 36 interfaces, making\nthe overall interfacial thermal resistance two to three times larger than that\npredicted by the Landauer formalism. We observe a clear trend that the degree\nof phonon non-equilibrium near an interface and the interfacial thermal\nresistance from the non-equilibrium phonons increase as the mismatch of the\nDebye temperature of two lead materials increases. This contrasts with Landauer\nformalism's predictions, which show no correlation with the Debye temperature\nmismatch. The relaxation length of the phonon non-equilibrium varies\nsignificantly from 50nm to 1.5um depending on the combination of the lead\nmaterials. The relaxation length is proportional to the phonon mean free path\nof the corresponding lead material but also largely depends on the material in\nthe opposite lead. This suggests the relaxation length cannot be considered an\nintrinsic property of the corresponding lead material.",

We also provide our observational analysis of running\nCLT in three major cloud providers and share the lessons we learned.",

            "summary": "The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and it plays a crucial role\nin protecting the body from external insults such as UV radiation and physical\ntrauma. The stratum corneum is the topmost layer of the epidermis, composed of\ndead skin cells and characterized by low water content. This low water content\ncreates a gradient in the refractive index. The current work aims to elucidate\nthe impact of a significant gradient of water content and, consequently, the\nvariations of the refractive index of the skin on light propagation in tissues.\nUsing analytical models of light propagation in single-layer and two-layer\ntissues, we predict light confinement in the stratum corneum layer. For\nexample, the light intensity in the stratum corneum layer is noticeably\n(11-17%) higher than in the underlying tissue layer. This effect can be\nattributed to the high refractive index of the stratum corneum caused by low\nwater content, compared with underlying tissues, and scattering in the stratum\ncorneum layer. The effect is the most prominent for smaller diffuse reflectance\nof the underlying tissue. Furthermore, the effect is expected to be maximal if\nthe thickness of the stratum corneum layer is more than the reduced scattering\nlength. Therefore, in the visible range of the spectrum, the light confinement\nphenomena should be more noticable in stratum corneum layers with a thickness\nof at least 150um, which can be found in the glabrous skin of palms and soles\nand thickened epidermis-like calluses and corns",

            "summary": "Emotion estimation in images is a challenging task, typically using computer\nvision methods to directly estimate people's emotions using face, body pose and\ncontextual cues. In this paper, we explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan support the contextual emotion estimation task, by first captioning images,\nthen using an LLM for inference. First, we must understand: how well do LLMs\nperceive human emotions? And which parts of the information enable them to\ndetermine emotions? One initial challenge is to construct a caption that\ndescribes a person within a scene with information relevant for emotion\nperception. Towards this goal, we propose a set of natural language descriptors\nfor faces, bodies, interactions, and environments. We use them to manually\ngenerate captions and emotion annotations for a subset of 331 images from the\nEMOTIC dataset. These captions offer an interpretable representation for\nemotion estimation, towards understanding how elements of a scene affect\nemotion perception in LLMs and beyond. Secondly, we test the capability of a\nlarge language model to infer an emotion from the resulting image captions. We\nfind that GPT-3.5, specifically the text-davinci-003 model, provides\nsurprisingly reasonable emotion predictions consistent with human annotations,\nbut accuracy can depend on the emotion concept. Overall, the results suggest\npromise in the image captioning and LLM approach.",

Consequently, the significance of a\nwell-calibrated model becomes paramount in the medical imaging domain, where\naccurate and reliable predictions are of utmost importance. While there has\nbeen a significant effort towards training modern deep neural networks to\nachieve high accuracy on medical imaging tasks, model calibration and factors\nthat affect it remain under-explored. To address this, we conducted a\ncomprehensive empirical study that explores model performance and calibration\nunder different training regimes. We considered fully supervised training,\nwhich is the prevailing approach in the community, as well as rotation-based\nself-supervised method with and without transfer learning, across various\ndatasets and architecture sizes. Multiple calibration metrics were employed to\ngain a holistic understanding of model calibration. Our study reveals that\nfactors such as weight distributions and the similarity of learned\nrepresentations correlate with the calibration trends observed in the models.\nNotably, models trained using rotation-based self-supervised pretrained regime\nexhibit significantly better calibration while achieving comparable or even\nsuperior performance compared to fully supervised models across different\nmedical imaging datasets.

We investigated the thermal and chemical structure and rotation rate in\nthe near-core boundary layer of the double-lined B-type binary KIC4930889 from\nits four-year Kepler light curve, ground-based spectroscopy, and Gaia\nastrometry. We computed grids of 1D stellar structure and evolution models for\ndifferent mixing profiles and prescriptions of the temperature gradient in the\nnear-core region. We examined the preferred prescription and the near-core\nrotation rate using 22 prograde dipole modes detected by Kepler photometry. We\nemployed a Mahalanobis distance merit function and considered various nested\nstellar model grids, rewarding goodness of fit but penalising model complexity.\nFurthermore, we found a preference for either an exponentially decaying mixing\nprofile in the near-core region or absence of additional near-core mixing, but\nfound no preference for the temperature gradient in this region. The frequency\n(co)variances of our theoretical predictions are much larger than the errors on\nthe observed frequencies. This forms the main limitation on further\nconstraining the individual parameters of our models.

            "summary": "The ground state of the toric code, that of the two-dimensional class D\nsuperconductor, and the partition sum of the two-dimensional Ising model are\ndual to each other. This duality is remarkable inasmuch as it connects systems\ncommonly associated to different areas of physics -- that of long range\nentangled topological order, (topological) band insulators, and classical\nstatistical mechanics, respectively. Connecting fermionic and bosonic systems,\nthe duality construction is intrinsically non-local, a complication that has\nbeen addressed in a plethora of different approaches, including dimensional\nreduction to one dimension, conformal field theory methods, and operator\nalgebra. In this work, we propose a unified approach to this duality, whose\nmain protagonist is a tensor network (TN) assuming the role of an intermediate\ntranslator. Introducing a fourth node into the net of dualities offers several\nadvantages: the formulation is integrative in that all links of the duality are\ntreated on an equal footing, (unlike in field theoretical approaches) it is\nformulated with lattice precision, a feature that becomes key in the mapping of\ncorrelation functions, and their possible numerical implementation. Finally,\nthe passage from bosons to fermions is formulated entirely within the\ntwo-dimensional TN framework where it assumes an intuitive and technically\nconvenient form. We illustrate the predictive potential of the formalism by\nexploring the fate of phase transitions, point and line defects, topological\nboundary modes, and other structures under the mapping between system classes.\nHaving condensed matter readerships in mind, we introduce the construction\npedagogically in a manner assuming only minimal familiarity with the concept of\nTNs.",

Here, we study the interplay of these ingredients in a power-law\nrandom banded matrix model of spin-1/2 fermions with repulsive Hubbard\ninteractions. Focusing on the regime of weak interactions, we perform both\nanalytical field theory and numerical self-consistent Hartree-Fock numerical\ncalculations. We show that interference-mediated effects strongly enhance the\ndensity of states and magnetic fluctuations upon approaching the MIT from the\nmetallic side. These are consistent with results due to Finkel'stein obtained\nfour decades ago. Our numerics further show that local moments nucleate from\ntypical states at the Fermi energy near the MIT, with a density that grows\ncontinuously into the insulating phase. We identify spin-glass order in the\ninsulator by computing the overlap distribution between converged Hartree-Fock\nmean-field moment profiles. Our results indicate that itinerant interference\neffects can morph smoothly into moment formation and magnetic frustration\nwithin a single model, revealing a common origin for these disparate phenomena.",

This paradigm can incorporate hard\nproblem constraints, which we demonstrate by considering the Maximum\nIndependent Set (MIS) problem. We show that, for QAOA with depth $p=1$, this\nalgorithm performs exactly the same operations and selections as the classical\ngreedy algorithm for MIS. We then turn to deeper $p>1$ circuits and other ways\nto modify the quantum algorithm that can no longer be easily mimicked by\nclassical algorithms, and empirically confirm improved performance.

Here, we study pairing in a minimal model of\nbilayer nickelates, featuring robust binding energies - despite dominant\nrepulsive interactions - that are strongly enhanced in the finite doping\nregime. The mixed-dimensional (mixD) $t-J$ ladder we study features a crossover\nfrom tightly bound pairs of holes (closed channel) at small repulsion, to more\nspatially extended, correlated pairs of individual holes (open channel) at\nlarge repulsion. We derive an effective model for the latter, in which the\nattraction is mediated by the closed channel, in analogy to atomic Feshbach\nresonances. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations we\nreveal a dome of large binding energies at around $30\\%$ doping and we observe\nthe formation of a tetraparton density wave of plaquettes consisting of two\nspin-charge excitation pairs on neighboring rungs.

The impacts of this new media effect, oriented\ndirectly for a specific audience, is investigated on this study, in which we\nfocus on the opinion evolution of agents in the majority-rule model,\nconsidering the presence of directed propaganda. We introduce $p$ as the\nprobability of a \"positive\" external propaganda and $q$ as the probability to\nthe agents follow the external propaganda. Our results show that the usual\nmajority-rule model stationary state is reached, with a full consensus, only\nfor two cases, namely when the external propaganda is absent or when the media\nfavors only one of the two opinions. However, even for a small influence of\nexternal propaganda, the final state is reached with a majority opinion\ndominating the population. For the case in which the propaganda influence is\nstrong enough among the agents, we show that the consensus can not be reached\nat all, and we observe the polarization of opinions. In addition, we show\nthrough analytical and numerical results that the system undergoes an\norder-disorder phase transition that occurs at $q_c = 1/3$ for the case $p =\n0.5$.",

            "summary": "JWST NIRCam observations at 1.5-4.5 $\\mu$m have provided broad and narrow\nband imaging of the evolving remnant of SN 1987A with unparalleled sensitivity\nand spatial resolution. Comparing with previous marginally spatially resolved\nSpitzer IRAC observations from 2004-2019 confirms that the emission arises from\nthe circumstellar equatorial ring (ER), and the current brightness at 3.6 and\n4.5 $\\mu$m was accurately predicted by extrapolation of the declining\nbrightness tracked by IRAC. Despite the regular light curve, the NIRCam\nobservations clearly reveal that much of this emission is from a newly\ndeveloping outer portion of the ER. Spots in the outer ER tend to lie at\nposition angles in between the well-known ER hotspots. We show that the bulk of\nthe emission in the field can be represented by 5 standard spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs), each with a distinct origin and spatial distribution.\nThis spectral decomposition provides a powerful technique for distinguishing\noverlapping emission from the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the supernova (SN)\nejecta, excited by the forward and reverse shocks respectively.",

We illustrate this phenomenon (and show that it\nactually occurs) by working through the construction for an explicit example (a\nlog Calabi-Yau 4-fold obtained by blowing up a toric variety), and discuss a\nfamily Floer approach to the geometry of the corrected mirror in this setting.\nAlong the way, we introduce a Morse-theoretic model for family Floer theory\nwhich may be of independent interest.",

Our results have\nshown that the light nuclei yield ratio of proton, deuteron, and triton,\nexpressed by the elegant expression $N_tN_p/N_d^2$, remains unchanged even as\nthe rapidity coverage and collision centrality increase. Interestingly, we have\nalso revealed that the effect of CR is entirely dependent on the presence of\nMPI; CR has no impact on the yield ratio if MPI is off. Our findings further\ndemonstrate that the light nuclei yield ratio experiences a slight increase\nwith increasing collision energy as predicted by the PYTHIA8 Angantyr model,\nbut it cannot describe the non-monotonic trend observed by the STAR experiment.\nBased on the Angantyr model simulation results, it is essential not to overlook\nthe correlation between neutron and proton fluctuations.

An automated segmentation\nfollowing the guideline facilitates consistent and precise lesion detection,\nstaging and treatment. The guideline recommends a division of the prostate into\nfour zones, PZ (peripheral zone), TZ (transition zone), DPU (distal prostatic\nurethra) and AFS (anterior fibromuscular stroma). Not every zone shares a\nboundary with the others and is present in every slice. Further, the\nrepresentations captured by a single model might not suffice for all zones.\nThis motivated us to design a dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN),\nwhere each branch captures the representations of the connected zones\nseparately. Further, the representations from different branches act\ncomplementary to each other at the second stage of training, where they are\nfine-tuned through an unsupervised loss. The loss penalises the difference in\npredictions from the two branches for the same class. We also incorporate\nmulti-task learning in our framework to further improve the segmentation\naccuracy.

            "summary": "Passwords remain the most widely used form of user authentication, despite\nadvancements in other methods. However, their limitations, such as\nsusceptibility to attacks, especially weak passwords defined by human users,\nare well-documented. The existence of weak human-defined passwords has led to\nrepeated password leaks from websites, many of which are of large scale. While\nsuch password leaks are unfortunate security incidents, they provide security\nresearchers and practitioners with good opportunities to learn valuable\ninsights from such leaked passwords, in order to identify ways to improve\npassword policies and other security controls on passwords. Researchers have\nproposed different data visualisation techniques to help analyse leaked\npasswords. However, many approaches rely solely on frequency analysis, with\nlimited exploration of distance-based graphs. This paper reports PassViz, a\nnovel method that combines the edit distance with the t-SNE (t-distributed\nstochastic neighbour embedding) dimensionality reduction algorithm for\nvisualising and analysing leaked passwords in a 2-D space. We implemented\nPassViz as an easy-to-use command-line tool for visualising large-scale\npassword databases, and also as a graphical user interface (GUI) to support\ninteractive visual analytics of small password databases. Using the\n\"000webhost\" leaked database as an example, we show how PassViz can be used to\nvisually analyse different aspects of leaked passwords and to facilitate the\ndiscovery of previously unknown password patterns. Overall, our approach\nempowers researchers and practitioners to gain valuable insights and improve\npassword security through effective data visualisation and analysis.",

Combining nodal properties\n(centrality metrics) derived from local and global topological information\nrespectively is shown to better predict nodal influence than a single metric.\nIn this work, we investigate to what extent local and global topological\ninformation around a node contributes to the prediction of nodal influence and\nwhether relatively local information is sufficient for the prediction. We show\nthat by leveraging the iterative process used to derives a classical nodal\ncentrality such as eigenvector centrality, we can define an iterative metric\nset that progressively incorporates more global information around the node. We\npropose to predict nodal influence using an iterative metric set that consists\nof an iterative metric from order $1$ to $K$ that are produced in an iterative\nprocess, encoding gradually more global information as $K$ increases. Three\niterative metrics are considered, which converge to three classical node\ncentrality metrics respectively. Our results show that for each of the three\niterative metrics, the prediction quality is close to optimal when the metric\nof relatively low orders ($K\\sim4$) are included and increases only marginally\nwhen further increasing $K$. The best performing iterative metric set shows\ncomparable prediction quality to the benchmark that combines seven centrality\nmetrics, in both real-world networks and synthetic networks with community\nstructures. Our findings are further explained via the correlation between an\niterative metric and nodal influence, the convergence of iterative metrics and\nnetwork properties.",

However, these methods do not state the confidence\nassociated with the classification and the results from these methods are quite\nambiguous due to the overlap of different source types in these diagrams. Here,\nwe utilize photometric colors and magnitudes from seven near and mid-infrared\nbands simultaneously and employ machine and deep learning algorithms to carry\nout probabilistic classification of YSOs, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars,\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and main-sequence (MS) stars. Our approach also\nsub-classifies YSOs into Class I, II, III and flat spectrum YSOs, and AGB stars\ninto carbon-rich and oxygen-rich AGB stars. We apply our methods to\ninfrared-selected targets compiled in preparation for SPHEREx which are likely\nto include YSOs and other classes of objects. Our classification indicates that\nout of $8,308,384$ sources, $1,966,340$ have class prediction with probability\nexceeding $90\\%$, amongst which $\\sim 1.7\\%$ are YSOs, $\\sim 58.2\\%$ are AGB\nstars, $\\sim 40\\%$ are (reddened) MS stars, and $\\sim 0.1\\%$ are AGN whose red\nbroadband colors mimic YSOs.

To address these gaps, this paper\nextends the original environment by not only standardizing the environment\nsettings and benchmarking cooperative learning algorithms across different\nscenarios, including the most challenging full-game scenarios, but also by\ndiscussing approaches to enhance football AI from diverse perspectives and\nintroducing related research tools. Specifically, we provide a distributed and\nasynchronous population-based self-play framework with diverse pre-trained\npolicies for faster training, two football-specific analytical tools for deeper\ninvestigation, and an online leaderboard for broader evaluation.

            "summary": "Weakly supervised object localization and semantic segmentation aim to\nlocalize objects using only image-level labels. Recently, a new paradigm has\nemerged by generating a foreground prediction map (FPM) to achieve pixel-level\nlocalization. While existing FPM-based methods use cross-entropy to evaluate\nthe foreground prediction map and to guide the learning of the generator, this\npaper presents two astonishing experimental observations on the object\nlocalization learning process: For a trained network, as the foreground mask\nexpands, 1) the cross-entropy converges to zero when the foreground mask covers\nonly part of the object region. 2) The activation value continuously increases\nuntil the foreground mask expands to the object boundary. Therefore, to achieve\na more effective localization performance, we argue for the usage of activation\nvalue to learn more object regions. In this paper, we propose a Background\nActivation Suppression (BAS) method. Specifically, an Activation Map Constraint\n(AMC) module is designed to facilitate the learning of generator by suppressing\nthe background activation value. Meanwhile, by using foreground region guidance\nand area constraint, BAS can learn the whole region of the object. In the\ninference phase, we consider the prediction maps of different categories\ntogether to obtain the final localization results. Extensive experiments show\nthat BAS achieves significant and consistent improvement over the baseline\nmethods on the CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC datasets. In addition, our method also\nachieves state-of-the-art weakly supervised semantic segmentation performance\non the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.

Here we fill this critical gap by\nproviding fundamental insights into the propagation of anisotropic polaritons\nin thin biaxial layers. In particular, we introduce a novel methodology that\nallows us to represent isofrequency curves of polaritons in strongly\nanisotropic materials considering that the real and imaginary parts of the\nwavevector are not parallel. In fact, we analytically show that the direction\nof the imaginary part of the wavevector is parallel to the group velocity,\nwhich can have different, even perpendicular or opposite, directions with\nrespect to the phase velocity. This finding is crucial for understanding\npolaritonic phenomena in anisotropic media, yet it has so far been widely\noverlooked in the literature. Additionally, we introduce a criterion for\nclassifying the polaritonic modes in biaxial layers into volume and surface\ncategories, and analyze their dispersion, field structure, and losses. Finally,\nwe discover the existence of anisotropic transverse electric modes, which can\nexhibit natural canalization. Taken together, our results shed light on\nhitherto unexplored areas of the theory of electromagnetic modes in thin\nbiaxial layers. Although exemplified for van der Waals MoO3 layers, our\nfindings are general for polaritons in other strongly anisotropic biaxial\nhyperbolic crystals.",

Our work may open up a door\nto emulate non-Abelian dynamical gauge fields and correlated topological phases\nwith experimental feasibility.",

While literature\nhas shown the existence of an association between posting hate speech and\nmisinformation online and certain personality traits of posters, the general\nrelationship and relevance of online hate speech/misinformation in the context\nof overall psychological wellbeing of posters remain elusive. One difficulty\nlies in the lack of adequate data analytics tools capable of adequately\nanalyzing the massive amount of social media posts to uncover the underlying\nhidden links. Recent progresses in machine learning and large language models\nsuch as ChatGPT have made such an analysis possible. In this study, we\ncollected thousands of posts from carefully selected communities on the social\nmedia site Reddit. We then utilized OpenAI's GPT3 to derive embeddings of these\nposts, which are high-dimensional real-numbered vectors that presumably\nrepresent the hidden semantics of posts. We then performed various\nmachine-learning classifications based on these embeddings in order to\nunderstand the role of hate speech/misinformation in various communities.\nFinally, a topological data analysis (TDA) was applied to the embeddings to\nobtain a visual map connecting online hate speech, misinformation, various\npsychiatric disorders, and general mental health.",

Using both pretrained and trained from\nscratch CNNs we unveil that considering the sign and the effect not only of the\ncorrect class, but also the influence of the other classes, allows to better\nidentify the pixels of the image that the network is really focusing on.\nFurthermore, how occluding or altering those pixels is expected to affect the\noutcome also becomes clearer.",

This paper\naims to provide a reliable, valid, and scalable approach to measure populist\nstances. For that purpose, we created an annotated dataset based on\nparliamentary speeches of the German Bundestag (2013 to 2021). Following the\nideational definition of populism, we label moralizing references to the\nvirtuous people or the corrupt elite as core dimensions of populist language.\nTo identify, in addition, how the thin ideology of populism is thickened, we\nannotate how populist statements are attached to left-wing or right-wing host\nideologies. We then train a transformer-based model (PopBERT) as a multilabel\nclassifier to detect and quantify each dimension. A battery of validation\nchecks reveals that the model has a strong predictive accuracy, provides high\nqualitative face validity, matches party rankings of expert surveys, and\ndetects out-of-sample text snippets correctly. PopBERT enables dynamic analyses\nof how German-speaking politicians and parties use populist language as a\nstrategic device. Furthermore, the annotator-level data may also be applied in\ncross-domain applications or to develop related classifiers.",

When $U(1)_{L_\\mu-L_\\tau}$ is introduced to a scalar LQ model with\nthe LQ $S_1$ charged under the new symmetry, $S_1$ primarily couples to the\nthird-generation leptons while its couplings to first and second-generation\nleptons are naturally suppressed. Furthermore, only $S_1$ in the scalar LQ\nmodels has the feature that down-type quarks merely couple to neutrinos but not\nthe charged leptons, avoiding strict restrictions from $b\\to s \\mu^+ \\mu^-$.\nWith this distinctive characteristic of $S_1$, we investigate its impact on\nrare processes involving the $d_i \\to d_j \\nu \\bar\\nu$ transitions. Under the\ndominant constraints from $\\Delta F=2$ processes, we find that the $S_1$\ncontributions to the branching ratios (BRs) of $B\\to K(K^*) \\nu \\bar\\nu$ and\n$K_L \\to \\pi^0 \\nu \\bar\\nu$ can be factorized into the same multiplicative\nfactor multiplying the standard model predictions. Enhancement in the BRs can\npossibly exceed a factor of 2. In particular, ${\\cal B}(K^+\\to \\pi^+ \\nu\n\\bar\\nu)$ can reach the upper $1\\sigma$ error of the experimental value, i.e.,\n$\\simeq 15.4 \\times 10^{-11}$.

Prograde\npropagating thermal Rossby waves are naturally trapped in the radial direction\nfor frequencies above a critical threshold, which depends on the angle of\npropagation. Below the threshold frequency, there exists a continuous spectrum\nof prograde and retrograde inertial waves that are untrapped in an isentropic\natmosphere, but can be trapped by gradients in the specific entropy density\nsuch as occurs in a stellar convection zone.

With this objective in mind, we introduce a data-driven approach that\ncan determine the most suitable set of control points, assuming that we have a\ngiven set of possible shape variations. The challenges associated with this\ntask primarily stem from the computationally demanding nature of the problem.\nTwo main factors contribute to this complexity: solving a large linear system\nfor the biharmonic weight computation and addressing the combinatorial problem\nof finding the optimal subset of mesh vertices. To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose a reformulation of the biharmonic computation that reduces the\nmatrix size, making it dependent on the number of control points rather than\nthe number of vertices. Additionally, we present an efficient search algorithm\nthat significantly reduces the time complexity while still delivering a nearly\noptimal solution. Experiments on SMPL, SMAL, and DeformingThings4D datasets\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our method. Our control points achieve better\ntemplate-to-target fit than FPS, random search, and neural-network-based\nprediction.

            "summary": "In this paper, we develop a novel efficient and robust nonparametric\nregression estimator under a framework of feedforward neural network. There are\nseveral interesting characteristics for the proposed estimator. First, the loss\nfunction is built upon an estimated maximum likelihood function, who integrates\nthe information from observed data, as well as the information from data\nstructure. Consequently, the resulting estimator has desirable optimal\nproperties, such as efficiency. Second, different from the traditional maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE), the proposed method avoid the specification of the\ndistribution, hence is flexible to any kind of distribution, such as heavy\ntails, multimodal or heterogeneous distribution. Third, the proposed loss\nfunction relies on probabilities rather than direct observations as in least\nsquares, contributing the robustness in the proposed estimator. Finally, the\nproposed loss function involves nonparametric regression function only. This\nenables a direct application of existing packages, simplifying the computation\nand programming. We establish the large sample property of the proposed\nestimator in terms of its excess risk and minimax near-optimal rate. The\ntheoretical results demonstrate that the proposed estimator is equivalent to\nthe true MLE in which the density function is known. Our simulation studies\nshow that the proposed estimator outperforms the existing methods in terms of\nprediction accuracy, efficiency and robustness. Particularly, it is comparable\nto the true MLE, and even gets better as the sample size increases. This\nimplies that the adaptive and data-driven loss function from the estimated\ndensity may offer an additional avenue for capturing valuable information. We\nfurther apply the proposed method to four real data examples, resulting in\nsignificantly reduced out-of-sample prediction errors compared to existing\nmethods.",

            "summary": "Sequential recommendation (SRS) has become the technical foundation in many\napplications recently, which aims to recommend the next item based on the\nuser's historical interactions. However, sequential recommendation often faces\nthe problem of data sparsity, which widely exists in recommender systems.\nBesides, most users only interact with a few items, but existing SRS models\noften underperform these users. Such a problem, named the long-tail user\nproblem, is still to be resolved. Data augmentation is a distinct way to\nalleviate these two problems, but they often need fabricated training\nstrategies or are hindered by poor-quality generated interactions. To address\nthese problems, we propose a Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential\nRecommendation (DiffuASR) for a higher quality generation. The augmented\ndataset by DiffuASR can be used to train the sequential recommendation models\ndirectly, free from complex training procedures. To make the best of the\ngeneration ability of the diffusion model, we first propose a diffusion-based\npseudo sequence generation framework to fill the gap between image and sequence\ngeneration. Then, a sequential U-Net is designed to adapt the diffusion noise\nprediction model U-Net to the discrete sequence generation task. At last, we\ndevelop two guide strategies to assimilate the preference between generated and\norigin sequences. To validate the proposed DiffuASR, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets with three sequential recommendation\nmodels. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of DiffuASR. As\nfar as we know, DiffuASR is one pioneer that introduce the diffusion model to\nthe recommendation.",

The former would\noverlook intrinsic cross-modal correlations. The latter would discard\npathological information irrelevant to gene expression. To address these\nissues, we present a Cross-Modal Translation and Alignment (CMTA) framework to\nexplore the intrinsic cross-modal correlations and transfer potential\ncomplementary information. Specifically, we construct two parallel\nencoder-decoder structures for multi-modal data to integrate intra-modal\ninformation and generate cross-modal representation. Taking the generated\ncross-modal representation to enhance and recalibrate intra-modal\nrepresentation can significantly improve its discrimination for comprehensive\nsurvival analysis. To explore the intrinsic crossmodal correlations, we further\ndesign a cross-modal attention module as the information bridge between\ndifferent modalities to perform cross-modal interactions and transfer\ncomplementary information.

In this study, we explore the shear wave effects associated\nwith transcranial focused ultrasound propagation, both numerically and\nexperimentally. The intracranial acoustic pressure was measured at different\nincidence angles at the parietal and frontal regions in an ex vivo human skull.\nThe fluid-like skull model was then compared to the solid model comprising both\nlongitudinal and shear waves. The results consistently show a larger error and\nvariability for both models when considering an oblique incidence, reaching a\nmaximum of 125% mean deviation of the focal area when employing the fluid skull\nmodel. Statistical assessments further revealed that ignoring shear waves\nresults in an average ~40% overestimation of the intracranial acoustic pressure\nand inability to obtain an accurate intracranial acoustic pressure\ndistribution. Moreover, the solid model has a more stable performance, even\nwhen small variations in the skull-transducer relative position are introduced.\nOur results could contribute to the refinement of the transcranial ultrasound\npropagation modeling methods thus help improving the safety and outcome of\ntranscranial ultrasound therapy in the cortical brain areas.",

To this end, we propose AxOCS, a methodology\nfor designing approximate arithmetic operators through ML-based supersampling.\nSpecifically, we present a method to leverage the correlation of PPA and BEHAV\nmetrics across operators of varying bit-widths for generating larger bit-width\noperators. The proposed approach involves traversing the relatively smaller\ndesign space of smaller bit-width operators and employing its associated\nDesign-PPA-BEHAV relationship to generate initial solutions for\nmetaheuristics-based optimization for larger operators. The experimental\nevaluation of AxOCS for FPGA-optimized approximate operators shows that the\nproposed approach significantly improves the quality-resulting hypervolume for\nmulti-objective optimization-of 8x8 signed approximate multipliers.",

Many different\nstate-of-the-art deep neural networks yield similar neural predictions, but it\nremains unclear how to differentiate among models that perform equally well at\npredicting neural responses. To gain insight into this, we use a recent\ntheoretical framework that relates the generalization error from regression to\nthe spectral bias of the model activations and the alignment of the neural\nresponses onto the learnable subspace of the model. We extend this theory to\nthe case of regression between model activations and neural responses, and\ndefine geometrical properties describing the error embedding geometry. We test\na large number of deep neural networks that predict visual cortical activity\nand show that there are multiple types of geometries that result in low neural\nprediction error as measured via regression.

            "summary": "Background: View planning for the acquisition of cardiac magnetic resonance\n(CMR) imaging remains a demanding task in clinical practice. Purpose: Existing\napproaches to its automation relied either on an additional volumetric image\nnot typically acquired in clinic routine, or on laborious manual annotations of\ncardiac structural landmarks. This work presents a clinic-compatible,\nannotation-free system for automatic CMR view planning. Methods: The system\nmines the spatial relationship, more specifically, locates the intersecting\nlines, between the target planes and source views, and trains deep networks to\nregress heatmaps defined by distances from the intersecting lines. The\nintersection lines are the prescription lines prescribed by the technologists\nat the time of image acquisition using cardiac landmarks, and retrospectively\nidentified from the spatial relationship. As the spatial relationship is\nself-contained in properly stored data, the need for additional manual\nannotation is eliminated. In addition, the interplay of multiple target planes\npredicted in a source view is utilized in a stacked hourglass architecture to\ngradually improve the regression. Then, a multi-view planning strategy is\nproposed to aggregate information from the predicted heatmaps for all the\nsource views of a target plane, for a globally optimal prescription, mimicking\nthe similar strategy practiced by skilled human prescribers. Results: The\nexperiments include 181 CMR exams. Our system yields the mean angular\ndifference and point-to-plane distance of 5.68 degrees and 3.12 mm,\nrespectively. It not only achieves superior accuracy to existing approaches\nincluding conventional atlas-based and newer deep-learning-based in prescribing\nthe four standard CMR planes but also demonstrates prescription of the first\ncardiac-anatomy-oriented plane(s) from the body-oriented scout.",

            "summary": "Eyebrows play a critical role in facial expression and appearance. Although\nthe 3D digitization of faces is well explored, less attention has been drawn to\n3D eyebrow modeling. In this work, we propose EMS, the first learning-based\nframework for single-view 3D eyebrow reconstruction. Following the methods of\nscalp hair reconstruction, we also represent the eyebrow as a set of fiber\ncurves and convert the reconstruction to fibers growing problem. Three modules\nare then carefully designed: RootFinder firstly localizes the fiber root\npositions which indicates where to grow; OriPredictor predicts an orientation\nfield in the 3D space to guide the growing of fibers; FiberEnder is designed to\ndetermine when to stop the growth of each fiber. Our OriPredictor is directly\nborrowing the method used in hair reconstruction. Considering the differences\nbetween hair and eyebrows, both RootFinder and FiberEnder are newly proposed.\nSpecifically, to cope with the challenge that the root location is severely\noccluded, we formulate root localization as a density map estimation task.\nGiven the predicted density map, a density-based clustering method is further\nused for finding the roots. For each fiber, the growth starts from the root\npoint and moves step by step until the ending, where each step is defined as an\noriented line with a constant length according to the predicted orientation\nfield. To determine when to end, a pixel-aligned RNN architecture is designed\nto form a binary classifier, which outputs stop or not for each growing step.\nTo support the training of all proposed networks, we build the first 3D\nsynthetic eyebrow dataset that contains 400 high-quality eyebrow models\nmanually created by artists. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the proposed EMS pipeline on a variety of different eyebrow\nstyles and lengths, ranging from short and sparse to long bushy eyebrows.",

We further\ndemonstrate that a common choice of the terminal cost, i.e., as the solution to\nthe discrete-algebraic Riccati equation, renders the origin input-to-state\nstable for the closed-loop system. This choice of the terminal cost also\nensures that the exact long-term performance of the closed-loop system is\nindependent of the choice of ambiguity set the for DRMPC formulation. Thus, we\nestablish conditions under which DRMPC does not provide a long-term performance\nbenefit relative to stochastic MPC (SMPC). To solve the proposed DRMPC\noptimization problem, we propose a Newton-type algorithm that empirically\nachieves superlinear convergence by solving a quadratic program at each\niteration and guarantees the feasibility of each iterate. We demonstrate the\nimplications of the closed-loop guarantees and the scalability of the proposed\nalgorithm via two examples.",

            "summary": "Recently there has been an increasing interest in studying dynamical\nprocesses on networks exhibiting higher-order structures, such as simplicial\ncomplexes, where the dynamics acts above and beyond dyadic interactions. Using\nsimulations or heuristically derived epidemic spreading models it was shown\nthat new phenomena can emerge, such as bi-stability/multistability. Here, we\nshow that such new emerging phenomena do not require complex contact patterns,\nsuch as community structures, but naturally result from the higher-order\ncontagion mechanisms. We show this by deriving an exact higher-order SIS model\nand its limiting mean-field equivalent for fully connected simplicial\ncomplexes. Going beyond previous results, we also give the global bifurcation\npicture for networks with 3- and 4-body interactions, with the latter allowing\nfor two non-trivial stable endemic steady states. Differently from previous\napproaches, we are able to study systems featuring interactions of arbitrary\norder. In addition, we characterise the contributions from higher-order\ninfections to the endemic equilibrium as perturbations of the pairwise\nbaseline, finding that these diminish as the pairwise rate of infection\nincreases. Our approach represents a first step towards a principled\nunderstanding of higher-order contagion processes beyond triads and opens up\nfurther directions for analytical investigations.",

            "summary": "Methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) is one of the most abundant and widely spread\ninterstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs). Several studies found that, in\nhot corinos, methyl cyanide and methanol abundances are correlated suggesting a\nchemical link, often interpreted as a synthesis of them on the interstellar\ngrain surfaces. In this article, we present a revised network of the reactions\nforming methyl cyanide in the gas-phase. We carried out an exhaustive review of\nthe gas-phase CH$_3$CN formation routes, propose two new reactions and\nperformed new quantum mechanics computations of several reactions. We found\nthat 13 of the 15 reactions reported in the databases KIDA and UDfA have\nincorrect products and/or rate constants. The new corrected reaction network\ncontains 10 reactions leading to methyl cyanide. We tested the relative\nimportance of those reactions in forming CH$_3$CN using our astrochemical\nmodel. We confirm that the radiative association of CH${_3}{^+}$ and HCN,\nforming CH$_{3}$CNH$^{+}$, followed by the electron recombination of\nCH$_{3}$CNH$^{+}$, is the most important CH$_3$CN formation route in both cold\nand warm environments, notwithstanding that we significantly corrected the rate\nconstants and products of both reactions. The two newly proposed reactions play\nan important role in warm environments. Finally, we found a very good agreement\nbetween the CH$_3$CN predicted abundances with those measured in cold ($\\sim$10\nK) and warm ($\\sim$90 K) objects. Unexpectedly, we also found a chemical link\nbetween methanol and methyl cyanide via the CH$_{3}^{+}$ ion, which can explain\nthe observed correlation between the CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN abundances measured\nin hot corinos.",

This is because\nthe source domain supervision only considers the target domain samples as\nauxiliary data (e.g., by pseudo-labeling), yet the inherent distribution in the\ntarget domain -- where the valuable de-correlation clues hide -- is\ndisregarded. We propose to make the U in UDA matter by giving equal status to\nthe two domains. Specifically, we learn an invariant classifier whose\nprediction is simultaneously consistent with the labels in the source domain\nand clusters in the target domain, hence the spurious correlation inconsistent\nin the target domain is removed.

One example is population synthesis, which generates\nforward predictions of models for comparison with observations. The majority of\nstate-of-the-art rapid population synthesis methods are based on analytic\nfitting formulae to stellar evolution tracks that are computationally cheap to\nsample statistically over a continuous parameter range. The computational costs\nof running detailed stellar evolution codes, such as MESA, over wide and\ndensely sampled parameter grids are prohibitive, while stellar-age based\ninterpolation in-between sparsely sampled grid points leads to intolerably\nlarge systematic prediction errors. In this work, we provide two solutions for\nautomated interpolation methods that offer satisfactory trade-off points\nbetween cost-efficiency and accuracy. We construct a timescale-adapted\nevolutionary coordinate and use it in a two-step interpolation scheme that\ntraces the evolution of stars from ZAMS all the way to the end of core helium\nburning while covering a mass range from ${0.65}$ to $300 \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$.\nThe feedforward neural network regression model (first solution) that we train\nto predict stellar surface variables can make millions of predictions,\nsufficiently accurate over the entire parameter space, within tens of seconds\non a 4-core CPU. The hierarchical nearest-neighbor interpolation algorithm\n(second solution) that we hard-code to the same end achieves even higher\npredictive accuracy, the same algorithm remains applicable to all stellar\nvariables evolved over time, but it is two orders of magnitude slower. Our\nmethodological framework is demonstrated to work on the MIST (Choi et al. 2016)\ndata set.

The experimental results show that, under a smaller\ncomputational resource cost, AMPLIFY outperforms other Mixup methods in text\nclassification tasks on 7 benchmark datasets, providing new ideas and new ways\nto further improve the performance of pre-trained models based on the Attention\nmechanism, such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT.

            "summary": "Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications are widely\nrecognized as a promising candidate for the next-generation air interface. With\nholographic MIMO surface, the number of the spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs)\nconsiderably increases and also significantly varies as the user moves. To\nfully employ the large and varying number of spatial DoFs, the number of\nequipped RF chains has to be larger than or equal to the largest number of\nspatial DoFs. However, this causes much waste as radio frequency (RF) chains\n(especially the transmit RF chains) are costly and power-hungry. To avoid the\nheavy burden, this paper investigates green holographic MIMO communications\nwith a few transmit RF chains under an electromagnetic-based communication\nmodel. We not only look at the fundamental capacity limits but also propose an\neffective transmission, namely non-uniform holographic pattern modulation\n(NUHPM), to achieve the capacity limit in the high signal-to-noise (SNR)\nregime. The analytical result sheds light on the green evaluation of MIMO\ncommunications, which can be realized by increasing the size of the antenna\naperture without increasing the number of transmit RF chains. Numerical results\nare provided to verify our analysis and to show the great performance gain by\nemploying the additional spatial DoFs as modulation resources.",

Previous results indicate that static\nheterogeneous (i.e., degree-heterogeneous) networks promote cooperation in\nstationarity compared to static regular (i.e., degree-homogeneous) networks if\nequilibrium dynamics starting from many cooperators and defectors is employed.\nHowever, the above conclusion reverses if we employ non-equilibrium stochastic\nprocesses to measure the fixation probability for cooperation, i.e., the\nprobability that a single cooperator successfully invades a population. Here we\nresolve this conundrum by analyzing the fixation of cooperation on temporal\n(i.e., time-varying) networks. We theoretically prove and numerically confirm\nthat on both synthetic and empirical networks, contrary to the case of static\nnetworks, temporal heterogeneous networks can promote cooperation more than\ntemporal regular networks in terms of the fixation probability of cooperation.\nGiven that the same conclusion is known for the equilibrium fraction of\ncooperators on temporal networks, the present results provide a unified\nunderstanding of the effect of temporal degree heterogeneity on promoting\ncooperation across two main analytical frameworks, i.e., equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium ones.",

Understanding how\nthese professionals utilize visual representations in their analytic process\nmay shed light on best practices for visual sensemaking. We present results\nfrom an interview study involving 18 professional statisticians (19.7 years\naverage in the profession) on three aspects: (1) their use of visualization in\ntheir daily analytic work; (2) their mental models of inferential statistical\nprocesses; and (3) their design recommendations for how to best represent\nstatistical inferences. Interview sessions consisted of discussing inferential\nstatistics, eliciting participant sketches of suitable visual designs, and\nfinally, a design intervention with our proposed visual designs. We analyzed\ninterview transcripts using thematic analysis and open coding, deriving\nthematic codes on statistical mindset, analytic process, and analytic toolkit.\nThe key findings for each aspect are as follows: (1) statisticians make\nextensive use of visualization during all phases of their work (and not just\nwhen reporting results); (2) their mental models of inferential methods tend to\nbe mostly visually based; and (3) many statisticians abhor dichotomous\nthinking.

In this study, we\nintroduce QAL-BP, a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)\nformulation designed specifically for bin packing and suitable for quantum\ncomputation. QAL-BP utilizes the augmented Lagrangian method to incorporate the\nbin packing constraints into the objective function while also facilitating an\nanalytical estimation of heuristic, but empirically robust, penalty\nmultipliers. This approach leads to a more versatile and generalizable model\nthat eliminates the need for empirically calculating instance-dependent\nLagrangian coefficients, a requirement commonly encountered in alternative QUBO\nformulations for similar problems. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed\napproach, we conduct experiments on a set of bin-packing instances using a real\nQuantum Annealing device. Additionally, we compare the results with those\nobtained from two different classical solvers, namely simulated annealing and\nGurobi.

The\nemerging Transformer technology, renowned for its parallel computation\ncapabilities enabling the utilization of models with hundreds of millions of\nparameters, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply the\nTransformer architecture to traffic tasks, aiming to learn the diversity of\ntrajectories within vehicle populations. We analyze the Transformer's attention\nmechanism and its adaptability to the goals of traffic tasks, and subsequently,\ndesign specific pre-training tasks. To achieve this, we create a data structure\ntailored to the attention mechanism and introduce a set of noises that\ncorrespond to spatio-temporal demands, which are incorporated into the\nstructured data during the pre-training process. The designed pre-training\nmodel demonstrates excellent performance in capturing the spatial distribution\nof the vehicle population, with no instances of vehicle overlap and an RMSE of\n0.6059 when compared to the ground truth values. In the context of time series\nprediction, approximately 95% of the predicted trajectories' speeds closely\nalign with the true speeds, within a deviation of 7.5144m/s. Furthermore, in\nthe stability test, the model exhibits robustness by continuously predicting a\ntime series ten times longer than the input sequence, delivering smooth\ntrajectories and showcasing diverse driving behaviors. The pre-trained model\nalso provides a good basis for downstream fine-tuning tasks. The number of\nparameters of our model is over 50 million.",

In\napplications that leverage acceleration, the server CPU performs the role of\norchestrating computation and data movement and data-intensive applications\nstress the memory bandwidth. Applications that leverage disaggregation can be\nadversely affected by the increased PCIe and network bandwidth resulting from\ndisaggregation. In this paper, we advocate for a specialized cluster design for\nimportant data intensive applications, such as analytics, query processing and\nML training. This design, Lovelock, replaces each server in a cluster with one\nor more headless smart NICs. Because smart NICs are significantly cheaper than\nservers on bandwidth, the resulting cluster can run these applications without\nadversely impacting performance, while obtaining cost and energy savings.",

            "summary": "Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) models offer a powerful nonparametric approach\nfor Bayesian inference, but exact inference is typically intractable,\nmotivating the use of various approximations. However, existing approaches,\nsuch as mean-field Gaussian assumptions, limit the expressiveness and efficacy\nof DGP models, while stochastic approximation can be computationally expensive.\nTo tackle these challenges, we introduce Neural Operator Variational Inference\n(NOVI) for Deep Gaussian Processes. NOVI uses a neural generator to obtain a\nsampler and minimizes the Regularized Stein Discrepancy in L2 space between the\ngenerated distribution and true posterior. We solve the minimax problem using\nMonte Carlo estimation and subsampling stochastic optimization techniques. We\ndemonstrate that the bias introduced by our method can be controlled by\nmultiplying the Fisher divergence with a constant, which leads to robust error\ncontrol and ensures the stability and precision of the algorithm. Our\nexperiments on datasets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and the faster convergence rate of the proposed method. We\nachieve a classification accuracy of 93.56 on the CIFAR10 dataset,\noutperforming SOTA Gaussian process methods. Furthermore, our method guarantees\ntheoretically controlled prediction error for DGP models and demonstrates\nremarkable performance on various datasets. We are optimistic that NOVI has the\npotential to enhance the performance of deep Bayesian nonparametric models and\ncould have significant implications for various practical applications",

The overall similarity of the conversation was then quantified by\nthe average cosine similarity between the embeddings of adjacent utterances.\nResults showed that semantic similarity had a positive association with wives'\naffect during conflict (but not pleasant) conversations. Moreover, this\nassociation was not observed with husbands' affect regardless of conversation\ntypes. Two validation checks further provided support for the validity of the\nsimilarity measure and showed that the observed patterns were not mere\nartifacts of data.

However, current state-of-the-art methods exhibit\ninsufficient regularization, often yielding unreliable and noisy results during\ninterpolations. We find that this issue stems from broken gradient flow between\ninput coordinates and indexed hash-keys, where the chain rule attempts to model\ndiscrete hash-keys, rather than the continuous coordinates. To tackle this\nconcern, we introduce RHINO, in which a continuous analytical function is\nincorporated to facilitate regularization by connecting the input coordinate\nand the network additionally without modifying the architecture of current\nhash-based INRs. This connection ensures a seamless backpropagation of\ngradients from the network's output back to the input coordinates, thereby\nenhancing regularization. Our experimental results not only showcase the\nbroadened regularization capability across different hash-based INRs like DINER\nand Instant NGP, but also across a variety of tasks such as image fitting,\nrepresentation of signed distance functions, and optimization of 5D static / 6D\ndynamic neural radiance fields.

Recently, unsupervised\nrepresentation learning methods based on bisimulation metrics, contrast,\nprediction, and reconstruction have shown the ability for task-relevant\ninformation extraction. However, due to the lack of appropriate mechanisms for\nthe extraction of task information in the prediction, contrast, and\nreconstruction-related approaches and the limitations of bisimulation-related\nmethods in domains with sparse rewards, it is still difficult for these methods\nto be effectively extended to environments with distractions. To alleviate\nthese problems, in the paper, the action sequences, which contain\ntask-intensive signals, are incorporated into representation learning.\nSpecifically, we propose a Sequential Action--induced invariant Representation\n(SAR) method, in which the encoder is optimized by an auxiliary learner to only\npreserve the components that follow the control signals of sequential actions,\nso the agent can be induced to learn the robust representation against\ndistractions. We conduct extensive experiments on the DeepMind Control suite\ntasks with distractions while achieving the best performance over strong\nbaselines.

            "summary": "The advent of predictive methodologies has catalyzed the emergence of\ndata-driven decision support across various domains. However, developing models\ncapable of effectively handling input time series data presents an enduring\nchallenge. This study presents novel preference learning approaches to multiple\ncriteria sorting problems in the presence of temporal criteria. We first\nformulate a convex quadratic programming model characterized by fixed time\ndiscount factors, operating within a regularization framework. To enhance\nscalability and accommodate learnable time discount factors, we introduce a\nnovel monotonic Recurrent Neural Network (mRNN). It is designed to capture the\nevolving dynamics of preferences over time while upholding critical properties\ninherent to MCS problems, including criteria monotonicity, preference\nindependence, and the natural ordering of classes. The proposed mRNN can\ndescribe the preference dynamics by depicting marginal value functions and\npersonalized time discount factors along with time, effectively amalgamating\nthe interpretability of traditional MCS methods with the predictive potential\noffered by deep preference learning models. Comprehensive assessments of the\nproposed models are conducted, encompassing synthetic data scenarios and a\nreal-case study centered on classifying valuable users within a mobile gaming\napp based on their historical in-app behavioral sequences. Empirical findings\nunderscore the notable performance improvements achieved by the proposed models\nwhen compared to a spectrum of baseline methods, spanning machine learning,\ndeep learning, and conventional multiple criteria sorting approaches.",

            "summary": "Performative prediction is a recently proposed framework where predictions\nguide decision-making and hence influence future data distributions. Such\nperformative phenomena are ubiquitous in various areas, such as transportation,\nfinance, public policy, and recommendation systems. To date, work on\nperformative prediction has only focused on unconstrained scenarios, neglecting\nthe fact that many real-world learning problems are subject to constraints.\nThis paper bridges this gap by studying performative prediction under\ninequality constraints. Unlike most existing work that provides only\nperformative stable points, we aim to find the optimal solutions. Anticipating\nperformative gradients is a challenging task, due to the agnostic performative\neffect on data distributions. To address this issue, we first develop a robust\nprimal-dual framework that requires only approximate gradients up to a certain\naccuracy, yet delivers the same order of performance as the stochastic\nprimal-dual algorithm without performativity. Based on this framework, we then\npropose an adaptive primal-dual algorithm for location families. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that the proposed adaptive primal-dual algorithm attains\n$\\ca{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violations, using only $\\sqrt{T} + 2T$\nsamples, where $T$ is the time horizon. To our best knowledge, this is the\nfirst study and analysis on the optimality of the performative prediction\nproblem under inequality constraints. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of\nour algorithm and theoretical results through numerical simulations.",

            "summary": "In the realm of modern service-oriented architecture, ensuring Quality of\nService (QoS) is of paramount importance. The ability to predict QoS values in\nadvance empowers users to make informed decisions. However, achieving accurate\nQoS predictions in the presence of various issues and anomalies, including\noutliers, data sparsity, grey-sheep instances, and cold-start scenarios,\nremains a challenge. Current state-of-the-art methods often fall short when\naddressing these issues simultaneously, resulting in performance degradation.\nIn this paper, we introduce a real-time QoS prediction framework (called ARRQP)\nwith a specific emphasis on improving resilience to anomalies in the data.\nARRQP utilizes the power of graph convolution techniques to capture intricate\nrelationships and dependencies among users and services, even when the data is\nlimited or sparse. ARRQP integrates both contextual information and\ncollaborative insights, enabling a comprehensive understanding of user-service\ninteractions. By utilizing robust loss functions, ARRQP effectively reduces the\nimpact of outliers during the model training. Additionally, we introduce a\nsparsity-resilient grey-sheep detection method, which is subsequently treated\nseparately for QoS prediction. Furthermore, we address the cold-start problem\nby emphasizing contextual features over collaborative features.

            "summary": "Iron-based superconductors, a cornerstone of low-temperature physics, have\nbeen the subject of numerous theoretical models aimed at deciphering their\ncomplex behavior. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach that\namalgamates several existing models and incorporates experimental data to\nsimulate the superconducting phase diagrams of the principal 122-type\niron-based compounds. Our model considers a multitude of factors including the\nmomentum dependence of the superconducting gap, spin-orbital coupling,\nantiferromagnetism, spin density wave, induced XY potential on the tetrahedral\nstructure, and electron-phonon coupling. We have refined the electron-phonon\nscattering matrix using experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) data, ensuring that all electrons pertinent to iron-based\nsuperconductivity are accounted for. This innovative approach allows us to\ncalculate theoretical critical temperature Tc values for Ba1-xKxFe2As2,\nCaFe2As2 and SrFe2As2 as functions of pressure. These calculated values exhibit\nremarkable agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, our model\npredicts that MgFe2As2 remains non-superconducting irrespective of the applied\npressure. Given that 122-type superconductivity at low pressure or low doping\nconcentration has been experimentally validated, our combined model serves as a\npowerful predictive tool for generating superconducting phase diagrams at high\npressure. This study underscores that the high transition temperatures and the\nprecise doping and pressure dependence of iron-based superconductors are\nintrinsically linked to an intertwined mechanism involving a strong interplay\nbetween structural, magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom.",

            "summary": "Recent transportation research suggests that autonomous vehicles (AVs) have\nthe potential to improve traffic flow efficiency as they are able to maintain\nsmaller car-following distances. Nevertheless, being a unique class of ground\nrobots, AVs are susceptible to robotic errors, particularly in their perception\nmodule, leading to uncertainties in their movements and an increased risk of\ncollisions. Consequently, conservative operational strategies, such as larger\nheadway and slower speeds, are implemented to prioritize safety over traffic\ncapacity in real-world operations. To reconcile the inconsistency, this paper\nproposes an analytical model framework that delineates the endogenous\nreciprocity between traffic safety and efficiency that arises from robotic\nuncertainty in AVs. Car-following scenarios are extensively examined, with\nuncertain headway as the key parameter for bridging the single-lane capacity\nand the collision probability. A Markov chain is then introduced to describe\nthe dynamics of the lane capacity, and the resulting expected\ncollision-inclusive capacity is adopted as the ultimate performance measure for\nfully autonomous traffic. With the help of this analytical model, it is\npossible to support the settings of critical parameters in AV operations and\nincorporate optimization techniques to assist traffic management strategies for\nautonomous traffic.",

High intraday (same-day) performance has been reported.\nHowever, the interday performance (separating training and testing days) is\nsubstantially degraded due to the poor generalizability of conventional\napproaches over time, hindering the application of such techniques in real-life\npractices. There are limited recent studies on the feasibility of multi-day\nhand gesture recognition. The existing studies face a major challenge: the need\nfor long sEMG epochs makes the corresponding neural interfaces impractical due\nto the induced delay in myoelectric control. This paper proposes a compact\nViT-based network for multi-day dynamic hand gesture prediction. We tackle the\nmain challenge as the proposed model only relies on very short HD-sEMG signal\nwindows (i.e., 50 ms, accounting for only one-sixth of the convention for\nreal-time myoelectric implementation), boosting agility and responsiveness. Our\nproposed model can predict 11 dynamic gestures for 20 subjects with an average\naccuracy of over 71% on the testing day, 3-25 days after training. Moreover,\nwhen calibrated on just a small portion of data from the testing day, the\nproposed model can achieve over 92% accuracy by retraining less than 10% of the\nparameters for computational efficiency.",

This research\npaper introduces a machine learning framework designed to improve how we\neducate and reach out to people in the field of horticulture. The framework\nrelies on data from the Horticulture Online Help Desk (HOHD), which is like a\nbig collection of questions from people who love gardening and are part of the\nExtension Master Gardener Program (EMGP). This framework has two main parts.\nFirst, it uses special computer programs (machine learning models) to sort\nquestions into categories. This helps us quickly send each question to the\nright expert, so we can answer it faster. Second, it looks at when questions\nare asked and uses that information to guess how many questions we might get in\nthe future and what they will be about. This helps us plan on topics that will\nbe really important. It's like knowing what questions will be popular in the\ncoming months. We also take into account where the questions come from by\nlooking at the Zip Code. This helps us make research that fits the challenges\nfaced by gardeners in different places. In this paper, we demonstrate the\npotential of machine learning techniques to predict trends in horticulture by\nanalyzing textual queries from homeowners. We show that NLP, classification,\nand time series analysis can be used to identify patterns in homeowners'\nqueries and predict future trends in horticulture. Our results suggest that\nmachine learning could be used to predict trends in other agricultural sectors\nas well.

            "summary": "Existing research has shown the potential of classifying Alzheimers Disease\n(AD) from eye-tracking (ET) data with classifiers that rely on task-specific\nengineered features. In this paper, we investigate whether we can improve on\nexisting results by using a Deep-Learning classifier trained end-to-end on raw\nET data. This classifier (VTNet) uses a GRU and a CNN in parallel to leverage\nboth visual (V) and temporal (T) representations of ET data and was previously\nused to detect user confusion while processing visual displays. A main\nchallenge in applying VTNet to our target AD classification task is that the\navailable ET data sequences are much longer than those used in the previous\nconfusion detection task, pushing the limits of what is manageable by\nLSTM-based models. We discuss how we address this challenge and show that VTNet\noutperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in AD classification, providing\nencouraging evidence on the generality of this model to make predictions from\nET data.",

We discuss policy search methods based on path integral\ncontrol, efficient and stable sampling strategies, extensions to multi-agent\ndecision-making, and MPPI for the trajectory optimization on manifolds. For\ntutorial demonstrations, some PI-based controllers are implemented in Python,\nMATLAB and ROS2/Gazebo simulations for trajectory optimization.

            "summary": "To alleviate the expensive human labeling, semi-supervised semantic\nsegmentation employs a few labeled images and an abundant of unlabeled images\nto predict the pixel-level label map with the same size. Previous methods often\nadopt co-training using two convolutional networks with the same architecture\nbut different initialization, which fails to capture the sufficiently diverse\nfeatures. This motivates us to use tri-training and develop the triple-view\nencoder to utilize the encoders with different architectures to derive diverse\nfeatures, and exploit the knowledge distillation skill to learn the\ncomplementary semantics among these encoders. Moreover, existing methods simply\nconcatenate the features from both encoder and decoder, resulting in redundant\nfeatures that require large memory cost. This inspires us to devise a\ndual-frequency decoder that selects those important features by projecting the\nfeatures from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, where the\ndual-frequency channel attention mechanism is introduced to model the feature\nimportance. Therefore, we propose a Triple-view Knowledge Distillation\nframework, termed TriKD, for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, including\nthe triple-view encoder and the dual-frequency decoder. Extensive experiments\nwere conducted on two benchmarks, \\ie, Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, whose\nresults verify the superiority of the proposed method with a good tradeoff\nbetween precision and inference speed.",

            "summary": "The recent development of the accurate and efficient semilocal density\nfunctionals on the third rung of Jacob's ladder of density functional theory\nsuch as the revised regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed\n(r2SCAN) density functional could enable the rapid and highly reliable\nprediction of the elasticity and temperature dependence of thermophysical\nparameters of refractory elements and their intermetallic compounds using\nquasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Here, we present a comparative evaluation\nof the equilibrium cell volumes, cohesive energy, mechanical moduli, and\nthermophysical properties (Debye temperature and thermal expansion coefficient)\nfor 22 transition metals using semilocal density functionals, including local\ndensity approximation (LDA), the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and PBEsol\ngeneralized gradient approximations (GGA), and the r2SCAN meta-GGA. PBEsol and\nr2SCAN deliver the same level of accuracies for structural, mechanical and\nthermophysical properties. Otherwise, PBE and r2SCAN perform better than LDA\nand PBEsol for calculating cohesive energies of transition metals. Among the\ntested density functionals, r2SCAN provides an overall well-balanced\nperformance for reliably computing the cell volumes, cohesive energies,\nmechanical properties, and thermophysical properties of various 3d, 4d, and 5d\ntransition metals using QHA. Therefore, we recommend that r2SCAN could be\nemployed as a workhorse method to evaluate the thermophysical properties of\ntransition metal compounds and alloys in the high throughput workflows.",
