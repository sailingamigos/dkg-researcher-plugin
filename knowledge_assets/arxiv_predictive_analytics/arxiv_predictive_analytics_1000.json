            "summary": "Text ranking is a critical task in various information retrieval\napplications, and the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural\nlanguage processing has sparked interest in their application to text ranking.\nThese methods primarily involve combining query and candidate documents and\nleveraging prompt learning to determine query-document relevance using the\nLLM's output probabilities for specific tokens or by directly generating a\nranked list of candidate documents. Although these approaches have demonstrated\npromise, a noteworthy disparity arises between the training objective of LLMs,\nwhich typically centers around next token prediction, and the objective of\nevaluating query-document relevance. To address this gap and fully leverage LLM\npotential in text ranking tasks, we propose a progressive multi-stage training\nstrategy. Firstly, we introduce a large-scale weakly supervised dataset of\nrelevance texts to enable the LLMs to acquire the ability to predict relevant\ntokens without altering their original training objective. Subsequently, we\nincorporate supervised training to further enhance LLM ranking capability. Our\nexperimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our proposed method compared to previous competitive approaches,\nboth in in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.",

Comparison with the\nLeggett's upper bound $(\\langle n_{1D}\\rangle <1/n_{1D}>)^{-1}$, with $n_{1D}$\nthe 1D column density, explicitly shows that, differently from the case of a\ndilute interacting Bose gas, the bound significantly overestimates the value of\nthe superfluid fraction, except in the phonon regime of small $q$. Sum rule\narguments show that the combined knowledge of the Leggett bound and of the\nactual value of the superfluid fraction allows for the determination of\ncurvature effects providing the deviation of the dispersion of the\nAnderson-Bogoliubov mode from the linear phonon dependence. The comparison with\nthe predictions of the weakly interacting BCS Fermi gas points out the crucial\nrole of two-body interactions.

            "summary": "Dense prediction is a fundamental requirement for many medical vision tasks\nsuch as medical image restoration, registration, and segmentation. The most\npopular vision model, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has reached\nbottlenecks due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations. Recently,\ntransformers have been widely adopted for dense prediction for their capability\nto capture long-range visual dependence. However, due to the high computational\ncomplexity and large memory consumption of self-attention operations,\ntransformers are usually used at downsampled feature resolutions. Such usage\ncannot effectively leverage the tissue-level textural information available\nonly at the full image resolution. This textural information is crucial for\nmedical dense prediction as it can differentiate the subtle human anatomy in\nmedical images. In this study, we hypothesize that Multi-layer Perceptrons\n(MLPs) are superior alternatives to transformers in medical dense prediction\nwhere tissue-level details dominate the performance, as MLPs enable long-range\ndependence at the full image resolution. To validate our hypothesis, we develop\na full-resolution hierarchical MLP framework that uses MLPs beginning from the\nfull image resolution. We evaluate this framework with various MLP blocks on a\nwide range of medical dense prediction tasks including restoration,\nregistration, and segmentation. Extensive experiments on six public\nwell-benchmarked datasets show that, by simply using MLPs at full resolution,\nour framework outperforms its CNN and transformer counterparts and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on various medical dense prediction tasks.",

This was a\nresult of the deterioration of their financial and prudential indicators,\nalthough Mozambique had been adhering to the Basel Accords since 1994. The\nBasel Accords provides recommendations on banking sector supervision worldwide\nwith the aim to enhance financial system stability. While it does not predict\nbankruptcy, the prediction model can be used as an auxiliary tool to manage\nthat risk, but this has to be built in the national economic context. This\npaper develops for Mozambique banking sector a bankruptcy prediction model in\nthe Mozambican context through the linear discriminant analyses method,\nfollowing two assumptions: (i) composition of the sample and (ii) robustness of\nthe financial prediction indicators (the capital structure, profitability asset\nconcentration and asset quality) from 2012 to 2020. The developed model\nattained an accuracy level of 84% one year before Central Bank intervention\n(2015) with the entire population of 19 banks of the sector, which makes it\nrecommendable as a risk management tool for this sector.",

We also present examples where\nother choices may be more reasonable, with more terms in F, or more terms in V .\n  2) We glean out from the works of Bacaer a fixed point equation (8) for the\nextinction probabilities of a stochastic model associated to a deterministic\nODE model, which may be expressed in terms of the (F, V ) decomposition. The\nfact that both R0 and the extinction probabilities are functions of (F, V )\nunderlines the centrality of this pair, which may be viewed as more fundamental\nthan the famous next generation matrix FV^{-1}.\n  3) We suggest introducing a new concept of sufficient/minimal\ndisease/infection set (sufficient for determining R0). More precisely, our\nuniversal recipe of choosing \"new infections\" once the \"infections\" are\nspecified suggests focusing on the choice of the latter, which is also not\nunique. The maximal choice of choosing all compartments which become 0 at the\ngiven boundary point seems to always work, but is the least useful for analytic\ncomputations, therefore we propose to investigate the minimal one. As a bonus,\nthis idea seems useful for understanding the Jacobian factorization approach\nfor computing R0 . Last but not least, we offer Mathematica scripts and\nimplement them for a large variety of examples, which illustrate that our\nrecipe others always reasonable results, but that sometimes other reasonable\n(F, V ) decompositions are available as well.",

In addition, we\ndeveloped a way to score the predictions by combining attributes from both the\ndistributions' features and the way the distance function works. Finally, we\ngeneralize the results showing that they can be transferred to a wider range of\ndomains by applying the system discussed to a well-known and widely used\nbenchmark dataset for STS problems.",

Our method incorporates into Neural Radiance\nField (NeRF) pipelines the split sum approximation used with image-based\nlighting for real-time physical-based rendering. We propose modeling the\nscene's lighting with a single scene-specific MLP representing pre-integrated\nimage-based lighting at arbitrary resolutions. We achieve accurate modeling of\npre-integrated lighting by exploiting a novel regularizer based on efficient\nMonte Carlo sampling. Additionally, we propose a new method of supervising\nself-occlusion predictions by exploiting a similar regularizer based on Monte\nCarlo sampling. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of our approach in estimating scene geometry, material\nproperties, and lighting. Our method is capable of attaining state-of-the-art\nrelighting quality after only ${\\sim}1$ hour of training in a single NVIDIA\nA100 GPU.",

            "summary": "The quest for accurate prediction of drug molecule properties poses a\nfundamental challenge in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Drug Discovery\n(AIDD). An effective representation of drug molecules emerges as a pivotal\ncomponent in this pursuit. Contemporary leading-edge research predominantly\nresorts to self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to extract meaningful\nstructural representations from large-scale, unlabeled molecular data,\nsubsequently fine-tuning these representations for an array of downstream\ntasks. However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular\nreliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or\nSMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of\nvarious molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG,\na novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular\nproperties based on Image and Graph structures. MolIG model innovatively\nleverages the coherence and correlation between molecule graph and molecule\nimage to execute self-supervised tasks, effectively amalgamating the strengths\nof both molecular representation forms. This holistic approach allows for the\ncapture of pivotal molecular structural characteristics and high-level semantic\ninformation. Upon completion of pre-training, Graph Neural Network (GNN)\nEncoder is used for the prediction of downstream tasks. In comparison to\nadvanced baseline models, MolIG exhibits enhanced performance in downstream\ntasks pertaining to molecular property prediction within benchmark groups such\nas MoleculeNet Benchmark Group and ADMET Benchmark Group.",

We propose a new conjecture about the Harish-Chandra\ntheory of such pairs, involving two integers $e$ and $m$: namely, that the\nintersection of an $\\Phi_e$-Harish-Chandra series and a $\\Phi_m$-Harish-Chandra\nseries is parametrized by both a union of $\\Phi_m$-blocks of the $\\Phi_e$-Hecke\nalgebra and a union of $\\Phi_e$-blocks of the $\\Phi_m$-Hecke algebra, in a way\nthat matches blocks. We also conjecture that when blocks match, there is an\nequivalence of categories between their highest-weight covers. When $e = 1$, we\nprovide evidence that our bijections are essentially realized by bimodules that\nOblomkov-Yun construct from the cohomology of affine Springer fibers. This\nsuggests a strange analogy: Roughly, homogeneous affine Springer fibers are to\nroots of unity as tensor products of Deligne-Lusztig representations are to\nprime powers.\n  We predict the generic Hecke parameters for arbitrary $\\Phi$-cuspidal pairs\nof the groups $\\mathbb{G}\\mathbb{L}_n$ and $\\mathbb{G}\\mathbb{U}_n$, unifying\nthe known cases. We prove that they would imply our conjectural bijections for\nthese groups and coprime $e, m$. Then we show that the bijections for\n$\\mathbb{G}\\mathbb{L}_n$ are related by affine permutations to Uglov's\nbijections between bases of higher-level Fock spaces. This relates our\nconjectural equivalences of categories to those conjectured by Chuang-Miyachi,\nand proved by several authors, under the name of level-rank duality. Finally,\nfor many cases in exceptional types, we verify that the parameters predicted by\nBrou\\'e-Malle are compatible with our conjectures.",

In this regard, advanced data-driven\nsolutions, such as Deep Learning methods, are typically required to reflect the\nnon-linear behavior of these anomalies. As an ongoing research question related\nto Deep Learning, a model's applicability to limited data settings can be\nexplored by introducing prior knowledge in the network. This same strategy can\nalso lead to more interpretable predictions, hence facilitating the field\napplication of the approach. For that purpose, the aim of this paper is to\npropose the use of Physics-informed Denoising Autoencoders (PI-DAE) for missing\ndata imputation in commercial buildings. In particular, the presented method\nenforces physics-inspired soft constraints to the loss function of a Denoising\nAutoencoder (DAE). In order to quantify the benefits of the physical component,\nan ablation study between different DAE configurations is conducted. First,\nthree univariate DAEs are optimized separately on indoor air temperature,\nheating, and cooling data. Then, two multivariate DAEs are derived from the\nprevious configurations. Eventually, a building thermal balance equation is\ncoupled to the last multivariate configuration to obtain PI-DAE. Additionally,\ntwo commonly used benchmarks are employed to support the findings. It is shown\nhow introducing physical knowledge in a multivariate Denoising Autoencoder can\nenhance the inherent model interpretability through the optimized physics-based\ncoefficients. While no significant improvement is observed in terms of\nreconstruction error with the proposed PI-DAE, its enhanced robustness to\nvarying rates of missing data and the valuable insights derived from the\nphysics-based coefficients create opportunities for wider applications within\nbuilding systems and the built environment.",

The\nconfidence is part of the evaluation scheme, e.g., AP for the MSCOCO dataset,\nyet has been largely overlooked in the development of state-of-the-art methods.\nThis paper takes the first steps in addressing miscalibration in pose\nestimation. From a calibration point of view, the confidence should be aligned\nwith the pose accuracy. In practice, existing methods are poorly calibrated. We\nshow, through theoretical analysis, why a miscalibration gap exists and how to\nnarrow the gap. Simply predicting the instance size and adjusting the\nconfidence function gives considerable AP improvements. Given the black-box\nnature of deep neural networks, however, it is not possible to fully close this\ngap with only closed-form adjustments. As such, we go one step further and\nlearn network-specific adjustments by enforcing consistency between confidence\nand pose accuracy. Our proposed Calibrated ConfidenceNet (CCNet) is a\nlight-weight post-hoc addition that improves AP by up to 1.4% on off-the-shelf\npose estimation frameworks.

            "summary": "The development of causal prediction models is challenged by the fact that\nthe outcome is only observable for the applied (factual) intervention and not\nfor its alternatives (the so-called counterfactuals); in medicine we only know\npatients' survival for the administered drug and not for other therapeutic\noptions. Machine learning approaches for counterfactual reasoning have to deal\nwith both unobserved outcomes and distributional differences due to non-random\ntreatment administration. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses\nsimilar issues; one has to deal with unobserved outcomes -- the labels of the\ntarget domain -- and distributional differences between source and target\ndomain. We propose Adversarial Distribution Balancing for Counterfactual\nReasoning (ADBCR), which directly uses potential outcome estimates of the\ncounterfactuals to remove spurious causal relations. We show that ADBCR\noutcompetes state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, and\ndemonstrate that ADBCR's performance can be further improved if unlabeled\nvalidation data are included in the training procedure to better adapt the\nmodel to the validation domain.",

Unlike many prior investigations that heavily leaned on specialized\npoint-cloud cameras or abundant RGB visual data to gather 3D insights for\nobject-grasping missions, this paper introduces a pioneering approach called\nRGBGrasp. This method depends on a limited set of RGB views to perceive the 3D\nsurroundings containing transparent and specular objects and achieve accurate\ngrasping. Our method utilizes pre-trained depth prediction models to establish\ngeometry constraints, enabling precise 3D structure estimation, even under\nlimited view conditions. Finally, we integrate hash encoding and a proposal\nsampler strategy to significantly accelerate the 3D reconstruction process.\nThese innovations significantly enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of\nour algorithm in real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experimental\nvalidation, we demonstrate that RGBGrasp achieves remarkable success across a\nwide spectrum of object-grasping scenarios, establishing it as a promising\nsolution for real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Most works focus on extracting causally\nrelated clauses from documents. However, none of these works has considered\nthat the causal relationships among the extracted emotion and cause clauses can\nonly be valid under some specific context clauses. To highlight the context in\nsuch special causal relationships, we propose a new task to determine whether\nor not an input pair of emotion and cause has a valid causal relationship under\ndifferent contexts and extract the specific context clauses that participate in\nthe causal relationship. Since the task is new for which no existing dataset is\navailable, we conduct manual annotation on a benchmark dataset to obtain the\nlabels for our tasks and the annotations of each context clause's type that can\nalso be used in some other applications. We adopt negative sampling to\nconstruct the final dataset to balance the number of documents with and without\ncausal relationships. Based on the constructed dataset, we propose an\nend-to-end multi-task framework, where we design two novel and general modules\nto handle the two goals of our task. Specifically, we propose a context masking\nmodule to extract the context clauses participating in the causal\nrelationships. We propose a prediction aggregation module to fine-tune the\nprediction results according to whether the input emotion and causes depend on\nspecific context clauses.

Most existing MLC methods are based on\nthe assumption that the correlation of two labels in each label pair is\nsymmetric, which is violated in many real-world scenarios. Moreover, most\nexisting methods design learning processes associated with the number of\nlabels, which makes their computational complexity a bottleneck when scaling up\nto large-scale output space. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel MLC\nlearning method named Scalable Label Distribution Learning (SLDL) for\nmulti-label classification which can describe different labels as distributions\nin a latent space, where the label correlation is asymmetric and the dimension\nis independent of the number of labels. Specifically, SLDL first converts\nlabels into continuous distributions within a low-dimensional latent space and\nleverages the asymmetric metric to establish the correlation between different\nlabels. Then, it learns the mapping from the feature space to the latent space,\nresulting in the computational complexity is no longer related to the number of\nlabels. Finally, SLDL leverages a nearest-neighbor-based strategy to decode the\nlatent representations and obtain the final predictions. Our extensive\nexperiments illustrate that SLDL can achieve very competitive classification\nperformances with little computational consumption.",

            "summary": "The membership inference attack (MIA) is a popular paradigm for compromising\nthe privacy of a machine learning (ML) model. MIA exploits the natural\ninclination of ML models to overfit upon the training data. MIAs are trained to\ndistinguish between training and testing prediction confidence to infer\nmembership information. Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving ML\nparadigm that enables multiple clients to train a unified model without\ndisclosing their private data. In this paper, we propose an enhanced Membership\nInference Attack with the Batch-wise generated Attack Dataset (MIA-BAD), a\nmodification to the MIA approach. We investigate that the MIA is more accurate\nwhen the attack dataset is generated batch-wise. This quantitatively decreases\nthe attack dataset while qualitatively improving it. We show how training an ML\nmodel through FL, has some distinct advantages and investigate how the threat\nintroduced with the proposed MIA-BAD approach can be mitigated with FL\napproaches. Finally, we demonstrate the qualitative effects of the proposed\nMIA-BAD methodology by conducting extensive experiments with various target\ndatasets, variable numbers of federated clients, and training batch sizes.",

However, due to the lack of a cohesive framework, these\nobjectives often possess a narrow scope of applicability and are limited by\ntheir efficiency or accuracy. In this paper, we propose HandyPriors, a unified\nand general pipeline for pose estimation in human-object interaction scenes by\nleveraging recent advances in differentiable physics and rendering. Our\napproach employs rendering priors to align with input images and segmentation\nmasks along with physics priors to mitigate penetration and relative-sliding\nacross frames. Furthermore, we present two alternatives for hand and object\npose estimation. The optimization-based pose estimation achieves higher\naccuracy, while the filtering-based tracking, which utilizes the differentiable\npriors as dynamics and observation models, executes faster. We demonstrate that\nHandyPriors attains comparable or superior results in the pose estimation task,\nand that the differentiable physics module can predict contact information for\npose refinement. We also show that our approach generalizes to perception\ntasks, including robotic hand manipulation and human-object pose estimation in\nthe wild.",

Here, $n$ denotes the familiar\nLandau quantum number, while $m$ represents the eigen-value of the canonical\norbital angular momentum (OAM) operator $\\hat{L}^{can}_z$. On the other hand,\nthe eigen-states in the 1st Landau gauge are characterized by two integers $n$\nand $k_x$, here $n$ is the Landau quantum number, while $k_x$ is the\neigen-value of the canonical momentum operator $\\hat{p}^{can}_x$. Since the\ncanonical momentum and the canonical OAM are both gauge-variant quantities,\ntheir eigenvalues $k_x$ and $m$ are standardly believed not to correspond to\nobservables. However, this wide-spread view was suspected in a recent paper\nbased on the logical development of the gauge-potential-independent formulation\nof the Landau problem, which predicts the existence of two conserved momenta\n$\\hat{p}^{cons}_x$ and $\\hat{p}^{cons}_y$ and one conserved OAM\n$\\hat{L}^{cons}_z$. They are regarded as Noether charges of the Landau\nHamiltonian, the conservation of which is guaranteed {\\it independently} of the\nchoice of the {\\it auge potential}. In particular, on the basis of novel\ncovariant gauge transformation properties of these conserved operators, the\neigen-values of which are characterized by the quantum numbers $k_x$, $k_y$,\nand $m$, it was claimed that these quantum numbers correspond to observables at\nleast in principle.

This work proposes a method\nthat uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate patient-specific\nparameters of a reaction-diffusion PDE model of GBM growth from a single 3D\nstructural MRI snapshot. PINNs embed both the data and the PDE into a loss\nfunction, thus integrating theory and data. Key innovations include the\nidentification and estimation of characteristic non-dimensional parameters, a\npre-training step that utilizes the non-dimensional parameters and a\nfine-tuning step to determine the patient specific parameters. Additionally,\nthe diffuse domain method is employed to handle the complex brain geometry\nwithin the PINN framework.

Multiple\nmethods were investigated to assess model confidence and evaluated on their\nability to predict the models observed accuracy. The methods evaluated were\nIntrinsic Confidence, SC Agreement Frequency and CoT Response Length. SC\nAgreement Frequency correlated with observed accuracy, yielding a higher Area\nunder the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve compared to Intrinsic\nConfidence and CoT Length analysis. SC agreement is the most useful proxy for\nmodel confidence, especially for medical diagnosis.

Namely, the extraction of low-power data from\ntime-delayed coordinates of motor velocity and sparse regression on nonlinear\nterms was applied to data acquired from a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor, to\nidentify the underlying dynamics. The latter can be considered an extension of\nthe conventional linear motor model commonly used in many model-based\ncontrollers. The identified nonlinear model was then contrasted with a\nnonlinear model that included the LuGre friction model and a linear model\nwithout friction. A nonlinear grey box model estimation method was used to\ncalculate the optimum friction parameters for the LuGre model. The resulting\nnonlinear motor model with friction characteristics was then validated using a\nfeedback friction compensation algorithm. The novel model showed more than 90%\naccuracy in predicting the motor states in all considered input excitation\nsignals. In addition, the model-based friction compensation scheme showed a\nrelative increase in performance when compared with a system without friction\ncompensation.",

In particular, we observe abrupt changes in the\ndiffraction pattern at applied magnetic fields in which the current-carrying\nlocalized MBS are expected to enter the junction, and a lifting of the\nodd-numbered nodes consistent with a $4\\pi$-periodic sin$(\\phi/2)$-component in\nthe CPR. We also see that although the even-numbered nodes often remain\nfully-formed, we sometimes see deviations that are consistent with\nquasiparticle-induced fluctuations in the parity of the MBS pairs that encodes\nquantum information.",

            "summary": "Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) is an emerging learning paradigm that tackles\nthe task of training a machine learning (ML) model to predict missing\nparameters of an incomplete optimization problem, where the missing parameters\nare predicted. DFL trains an ML model in an end-to-end system, by integrating\nthe prediction and optimization tasks, providing better alignment of the\ntraining and testing objectives. DFL has shown a lot of promise and holds the\ncapacity to revolutionize decision-making in many real-world applications.\nHowever, very little is known about the performance of these models under\nadversarial attacks. We adopt ten unique DFL methods and benchmark their\nperformance under two distinctly focused attacks adapted towards the\nPredict-then-Optimize problem setting. Our study proposes the hypothesis that\nthe robustness of a model is highly correlated with its ability to find\npredictions that lead to optimal decisions without deviating from the\nground-truth label. Furthermore, we provide insight into how to target the\nmodels that violate this condition and show how these models respond\ndifferently depending on the achieved optimality at the end of their training\ncycles.",

            "summary": "Critical metrology relies on the precise preparation of a system in its\nground state near a quantum phase transition point where quantum correlations\nget very strong. Typically this increases the quantum Fisher information with\nrespect to changes in system parameters and thus improves the optimally\npossible measurement precision limited by the Cram\\'er-Rao bound. Hence\ncritical metrology involves encoding information about the unknown parameter in\nchanges of the system's ground state. Conversely, in conventional metrology\nmethods like Ramsey interferometry, the eigenstates of the system remain\nunchanged, and information about the unknown parameter is encoded in the\nrelative phases that excited system states accumulate during their time\nevolution. Here we introduce an approach combining these two methodologies into\na unified protocol applicable to closed and driven-dissipative systems. We show\nthat the quantum Fisher information in this case exhibits an additional\ninterference term originating from the interplay between eigenstate and\nrelative phase changes. We provide analytical expressions for the quantum and\nclassical Fisher information in such a setup, elucidating as well a\nstraightforward measurement approach that nearly attains the maximum precision\npermissible under the Cram\\'er-Rao bound.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a cohesive and scalable approach that consolidates multimodal (text,\nmusic, speech) and multi-part (hand, torso) human motion generation. Our\nmethodology unfolds in several steps: We begin by quantizing the motions of\ndiverse body parts into separate codebooks tailored to their respective\ndomains. Next, we harness the robust capabilities of pre-trained models to\ntranscode multimodal signals into a shared latent space. We then translate\nthese signals into discrete motion tokens by iteratively predicting subsequent\ntokens to form a complete sequence. Finally, we reconstruct the continuous\nactual motion from this tokenized sequence. Our method frames the multimodal\nmotion generation challenge as a token prediction task, drawing from\nspecialized codebooks based on the modality of the control signal. This\napproach is inherently scalable, allowing for the easy integration of new\nmodalities.

Several methods\nalleviated this issue by incorporating explicit text position and content as\nguidance on where and what text to render.

In this paper,\nwe present TextDiffuser-2, aiming to unleash the power of language models for\ntext rendering. Firstly, we fine-tune a large language model for layout\nplanning. The large language model is capable of automatically generating\nkeywords for text rendering and also supports layout modification through\nchatting. Secondly, we utilize the language model within the diffusion model to\nencode the position and texts at the line level. Unlike previous methods that\nemployed tight character-level guidance, this approach generates more diverse\ntext images. We conduct extensive experiments and incorporate user studies\ninvolving human participants as well as GPT-4V, validating TextDiffuser-2's\ncapacity to achieve a more rational text layout and generation with enhanced\ndiversity.

            "summary": "Plasma is prevalent throughout the universe. The cosmic plasma serves as not\nonly a crucial tracer for studying the evolution of the cosmos but also an\nideal laboratory for investigating the properties of plasma in extreme\nconditions. As one of the important contributors to the re-ionization of the\nuniverse, the variability in quasar (driven by the supermassive black hole)\nradiation presents a convenient opportunity to study the response of gases\nionized by them. Based on extensive statistical analysis using data from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), it has been demonstrated that the response of\ngases to quasar radiation exhibits asymmetry. Specifically, over 70\\% of broad\nabsorption lines (BALs) gas in quasar host galaxies exhibit a negative\nresponse. Through analytical calculations and photoionization simulations of C\nIV, we found that the response of gases to radiation is asymmetric for low and\nhigh ionization states. In high ionization states, the response time scale is\nshorter, leading to the detection of more negative responses. In actual case,\nthe observation time interval is mostly greater than 1 day, and hence the\nasymmetric effect of the C IV response gives a typical gas density of upper\nlimit of $\\rm 10^7\\ cm^{-3}$. Interestingly, this is consistent with the fact\nthat most of the measured BAL gas densities are below $\\rm 10^7\\ cm^{-3}$. In\nprinciple, the detection of this asymmetric effect becomes easier with lower\nplasma density or shorter observation time intervals.",

Considering that\neach user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as\nthe viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal\nperformance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the\nend, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and\nTrajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of\nviewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively\nutilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric\nvideo streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform\nRandom Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still\npreserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency\ndetection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for\ndetecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we\nintelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate\nviewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using\nstate-of-the-art volumetric video sequences.

We also demonstrate the correlation\nbetween the distance from the timestep to the action centre and the accuracy of\nthe predicted boundaries. Thus, we propose a novel network head to estimate the\ncloseness of timesteps to the action centre, which we call the centricity\nscore. This leads to increased confidence for proposals that exhibit more\nprecise boundaries. Our method can be integrated with other one-stage\nanchor-free architectures and we demonstrate this on three recent baselines on\nthe EPIC-Kitchens-100 action detection benchmark where we achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance. Detailed ablation studies showcase the benefits\nof fusing audio and our proposed centricity scores.

            "summary": "We propose a novel benchmark for cross-view knowledge transfer of dense video\ncaptioning, adapting models from web instructional videos with exocentric views\nto an egocentric view. While dense video captioning (predicting time segments\nand their captions) is primarily studied with exocentric videos (e.g.,\nYouCook2), benchmarks with egocentric videos are restricted due to data\nscarcity. To overcome the limited video availability, transferring knowledge\nfrom abundant exocentric web videos is demanded as a practical approach.\nHowever, learning the correspondence between exocentric and egocentric views is\ndifficult due to their dynamic view changes. The web videos contain mixed views\nfocusing on either human body actions or close-up hand-object interactions,\nwhile the egocentric view is constantly shifting as the camera wearer moves.\nThis necessitates the in-depth study of cross-view transfer under complex view\nchanges. In this work, we first create a real-life egocentric dataset (EgoYC2)\nwhose captions are shared with YouCook2, enabling transfer learning between\nthese datasets assuming their ground-truth is accessible. To bridge the view\ngaps, we propose a view-invariant learning method using adversarial training in\nboth the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. While the pre-training is\ndesigned to learn invariant features against the mixed views in the web videos,\nthe view-invariant fine-tuning further mitigates the view gaps between both\ndatasets. We validate our proposed method by studying how effectively it\novercomes the view change problem and efficiently transfers the knowledge to\nthe egocentric domain. Our benchmark pushes the study of the cross-view\ntransfer into a new task domain of dense video captioning and will envision\nmethodologies to describe egocentric videos in natural language.",

Its objective is to\npredict the occupancy status of each voxel in the 3D scene from partial image\ninputs.

To address\nthis, we propose DepthSSC, an advanced method for semantic scene completion\nsolely based on monocular cameras. DepthSSC combines the ST-GF (Spatial\nTransformation Graph Fusion) module with geometric-aware voxelization, enabling\ndynamic adjustment of voxel resolution and considering the geometric complexity\nof 3D space to ensure precise alignment between spatial and depth information.\nThis approach successfully mitigates spatial misalignment and distortion issues\nobserved in prior methods. Through evaluation on the SemanticKITTI dataset,\nDepthSSC not only demonstrates its effectiveness in capturing intricate 3D\nstructural details but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

PNODE can be inferred by a\nhypernetwork to reduce the potential difficulties in learning PNODE due to a\ncomplex multilayer perceptron (MLP). The framework uses an INR to decode the\nlatent dynamics and reconstruct accurate PDE solutions. Further, a\nphysics-informed loss is also introduced to correct the prediction of unseen\nparameter instances. Incorporating the physics-informed loss also enables the\nmodel to be fine-tuned in an unsupervised manner on unseen PDE parameters. A\nnumerical experiment is performed on a two-dimensional Burgers equation with a\nlarge variation of PDE parameters.

The correlation\nallows us to predict a galaxy's mean age from its HB morphology to a precision\nof $\\lesssim 1$~Gyr. We validate our method by recovering the correct ages of\nLocal Group galaxies that have robust MSTO-based ages and are not in our\ncalibration sample.

            "summary": "With the development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), many efforts have been\nmade to handle medical image segmentation. Traditional methods such as nnUNet\ntrain specific segmentation models on the individual datasets. Plenty of recent\nmethods have been proposed to adapt the foundational Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) to medical image segmentation. However, they still focus on discrete\nrepresentations to generate pixel-wise predictions, which are spatially\ninflexible and scale poorly to higher resolution. In contrast, implicit methods\nlearn continuous representations for segmentation, which is crucial for medical\nimage segmentation. In this paper, we propose I-MedSAM, which leverages the\nbenefits of both continuous representations and SAM, to obtain better\ncross-domain ability and accurate boundary delineation. Since medical image\nsegmentation needs to predict detailed segmentation boundaries, we designed a\nnovel adapter to enhance the SAM features with high-frequency information\nduring Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT). To convert the SAM features and\ncoordinates into continuous segmentation output, we utilize Implicit Neural\nRepresentation (INR) to learn an implicit segmentation decoder. We also propose\nan uncertainty-guided sampling strategy for efficient learning of INR.\nExtensive evaluations on 2D medical image segmentation tasks have shown that\nour proposed method with only 1.6M trainable parameters outperforms existing\nmethods including discrete and continuous methods.

            "summary": "Epithelial tissue elongation by convergent extension is a key motif of animal\nmorphogenesis. On a coarse scale, cell motion resembles laminar fluid flow; yet\nin contrast to a fluid, epithelial cells adhere to each other and maintain the\ntissue layer under actively generated internal tension. To resolve this\napparent paradox, we formulate a model in which tissue flow occurs through\nadiabatic remodelling of the cellular force balance causing local cell\nrearrangement. We propose that the gradual shifting of the force balance is\ncaused by positive feedback on myosin-generated cytoskeletal tension. Shifting\nforce balance within a tension network causes active T1s oriented by the global\nanisotropy of tension. Rigidity of cells against shape changes converts the\noriented internal rearrangements into net tissue deformation. Strikingly, we\nfind that the total amount of tissue extension depends on the initial magnitude\nof anisotropy and on cellular packing order. T1s degrade this order so that\ntissue flow is self-limiting. We explain these findings by showing that\ncoordination of T1s depends on coherence in local tension configurations,\nquantified by a certain order parameter in tension space. Our model reproduces\nthe salient tissue- and cell-scale features of germ band elongation during\nDrosophila gastrulation, in particular the slowdown of tissue flow after\napproximately twofold extension concomitant with a loss of order in tension\nconfigurations. This suggests local cell geometry contains morphogenetic\ninformation and yields predictions testable in future experiments. Furthermore,\nour focus on defining biologically controlled active tension dynamics on the\nmanifold of force-balanced states may provide a general approach to the\ndescription of morphogenetic flow.",

            "summary": "This article presents a method for learning well-coordinated Human-Robot\nInteraction (HRI) from Human-Human Interactions (HHI). We devise a hybrid\napproach using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as the latent space priors for a\nVariational Autoencoder to model a joint distribution over the interacting\nagents. We leverage the interaction dynamics learned from HHI to learn HRI and\nincorporate the conditional generation of robot motions from human observations\ninto the training, thereby predicting more accurate robot trajectories. The\ngenerated robot motions are further adapted with Inverse Kinematics to ensure\nthe desired physical proximity with a human, combining the ease of joint space\nlearning and accurate task space reachability. For contact-rich interactions,\nwe modulate the robot's stiffness using HMM segmentation for a compliant\ninteraction. We verify the effectiveness of our approach deployed on a Humanoid\nrobot via a user study. Our method generalizes well to various humans despite\nbeing trained on data from just two humans. We find that Users perceive our\nmethod as more human-like, timely, and accurate and rank our method with a\nhigher degree of preference over other baselines.",

            "summary": "Combining machine learning with physics is a trending approach for\ndiscovering unknown dynamics, and one of the most intensively studied\nframeworks is the physics-informed neural network (PINN). However, PINN often\nfails to optimize the network due to its difficulty in concurrently minimizing\nmultiple losses originating from the system's governing equations. This problem\ncan be more serious when the system's states are unmeasurable, like lithium-ion\nbatteries (LiBs). In this work, we introduce a robust method for training PINN\nthat uses fewer loss terms and thus constructs a less complex landscape for\noptimization. In particular, instead of having loss terms from each\ndifferential equation, this method embeds the dynamics into a loss function\nthat quantifies the error between observed and predicted system outputs. This\nis accomplished by numerically integrating the predicted states from the neural\nnetwork(NN) using known dynamics and transforming them to obtain a sequence of\npredicted outputs. Minimizing such a loss optimizes the NN to predict states\nconsistent with observations given the physics. Further, the system's\nparameters can be added to the optimization targets. To demonstrate the ability\nof this method to perform various modeling and control tasks, we apply it to a\nbattery model to concurrently estimate its states and parameters.",

            "summary": "This work analyzes bifurcation delay and front propagation in the\none-dimensional real Ginzburg-Landau equation (RGLE) with periodic boundary\nconditions on monotonically growing or shrinking domains. First, we obtain\nclosed-form expressions for the delay of primary bifurcations on a growing\ndomain and show that the additional domain growth before the appearance of a\npattern is independent of the growth time scale. We also quantify primary\nbifurcation delay on a shrinking domain; the time scale of domain compression\nis reflected in the additional compression before the pattern decays. For\nsecondary bifurcations such as the Eckhaus instability, we obtain a lower bound\non the delay of phase slips due to a time-dependent domain. We also construct a\nheuristic model to classify regimes with arrested phase slips, i.e. phase slips\nthat fail to develop. Then, we study how fronts are influenced by a\ntime-dependent domain. We derive expressions for the velocity and profile of\nhomogeneous fronts on a time-dependent domain. We also derive the natural\n``asymptotic'' velocity and front profile and show that these deviate from\npredictions based on the marginal stability criterion familiar from fixed\ndomain theory. This difference arises because the time-dependence of the domain\nlifts the degeneracy of the spatial eigenvalues associated with speed selection\nand represents a fundamental distinction from the fixed domain theory that we\nverify using direct numerical simulations. The effect of a growing domain on\npattern-spreading and Eckhaus front velocities is inspected qualitatively and\nfound to be similar to that of homogeneous fronts. These more complex fronts\ncan also experience delayed onset. Lastly, we show that dilution -- an effect\npresent when the order parameter is conserved -- increases bifurcation delay\nand amplifies changes in the homogeneous front velocity on time-dependent\ndomains.",

In this\npaper, we investigate SSL in the presence of spurious correlations and show\nthat the SSL training loss can be minimized by capturing only a subset of the\nconspicuous features relevant to those sensitive attributes, despite the\npresence of other important predictive features for the downstream tasks. To\naddress this issue, we investigate the learning dynamics of SSL and observe\nthat the learning is slower for samples that conflict with such correlations\n(e.g. elder patients without cancer). Motivated by these findings, we propose a\nlearning-speed aware SSL (LA-SSL) approach, in which we sample each training\ndata with a probability that is inversely related to its learning speed. We\nevaluate LA-SSL on three datasets that exhibit spurious correlations between\ndifferent attributes, demonstrating that it improves the robustness of\npretrained representations on downstream classification tasks.",

            "summary": "Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used for data-driven subgrid-scale\nparameterization in weather and climate models. While NNs are powerful tools\nfor learning complex nonlinear relationships from data, there are several\nchallenges in using them for parameterizations. Three of these challenges are\n1) data imbalance related to learning rare (often large-amplitude) samples; 2)\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) of the predictions to provide an accuracy\nindicator; and 3) generalization to other climates, e.g., those with higher\nradiative forcing. Here, we examine the performance of methods for addressing\nthese challenges using NN-based emulators of the Whole Atmosphere Community\nClimate Model (WACCM) physics-based gravity wave (GW) parameterizations as the\ntest case. WACCM has complex, state-of-the-art parameterizations for\norography-, convection- and frontal-driven GWs. Convection- and\norography-driven GWs have significant data imbalance due to the absence of\nconvection or orography in many grid points. We address data imbalance using\nresampling and/or weighted loss functions, enabling the successful emulation of\nparameterizations for all three sources. We demonstrate that three UQ methods\n(Bayesian NNs, variational auto-encoders, and dropouts) provide ensemble\nspreads that correspond to accuracy during testing, offering criteria on when a\nNN gives inaccurate predictions. Finally, we show that the accuracy of these\nNNs decreases for a warmer climate (4XCO2). However, the generalization\naccuracy is significantly improved by applying transfer learning, e.g.,\nre-training only one layer using ~1% new data from the warmer climate. The\nfindings of this study offer insights for developing reliable and generalizable\ndata-driven parameterizations for various processes, including (but not\nlimited) to GWs.",

            "summary": "In deep learning classifiers, the cost function usually takes the form of a\ncombination of SoftMax and CrossEntropy functions. The SoftMax unit transforms\nthe scores predicted by the model network into assessments of the degree\n(probabilities) of an object's membership to a given class. On the other hand,\nCrossEntropy measures the divergence of this prediction from the distribution\nof target scores. This work introduces the ISBE functionality, justifying the\nthesis about the redundancy of cross entropy computation in deep learning of\nclassifiers. Not only can we omit the calculation of entropy, but also, during\nback-propagation, there is no need to direct the error to the normalization\nunit for its backward transformation. Instead, the error is sent directly to\nthe model's network. Using examples of perceptron and convolutional networks as\nclassifiers of images from the MNIST collection, it is observed for ISBE that\nresults are not degraded with SoftMax only, but also with other activation\nfunctions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, or their hard variants HardSigmoid and\nHardTanh. Moreover, up to three percent of time is saved within the total time\nof forward and backward stages. The article is addressed mainly to programmers\nand students interested in deep model learning.

Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out at the\natomistic level through the nb-ZIF-FF force field that incorporates\nligand-metal reactivity and relies on dummy atoms to reproduce the correct\ntetrahedral topology around Zn$^{2+}$ centres. The force field is capable of\nreproducing the structure of ZIF-4, ZIF-zni and the amorphous (ZIF$\\_$a) and\nliquid (ZIF$\\_$liq) phases that respectively result when these crystalline\nmaterials are heated. Symmetry functions computed over a database of structures\nof the four phases, are used as inputs to train a neural network that predicts\nthe probabilities of belonging to each of the four phases at the local\nZn$^{2+}$ level with 90$\\%$ accuracy. We apply this methodology to follow the\ntime-evolution of the amorphization of ZIF-4 and the melting of ZIF-zni along a\nseries of molecular dynamics trajectories. We first computed the transition\ntemperature and determined associated thermodynamic state functions.\nSubsequently, we studied the mechanisms. Both processes consist of two steps:\n(i) for ZIF-4, a low-density amorphous phase is first formed, followed by the\nfinal ZIF$\\_$a phase while (ii) for ZIF-zni, a ZIF$\\_$a-like phase precedes the\nformation of the liquid phase. These processes involve connectivity changes in\nthe first neighbour ligands around the central Zn$^{2+}$ cations.

Decomposed\ninto a set of radial entanglement Hamiltonians, we show that the entanglement\nspectrum in each sector is identical to that of a hopping chain in a linear\npotential, with the angular momentum playing the role of the subsystem\nboundary. Furthermore, the eigenfunctions follow from a commuting differential\noperator that has exactly the form predicted by conformal field theory.\nRescaled by the radial Fermi velocity, this operator gives a perfect\napproximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian, except for large angular momenta\nthat belong to the edge regime in the analogous gradient chain. One thus finds\nthat the conformal field theory result becomes asymptotically exact only in one\ndimension.",

Here, we numerically investigate with a macrospin\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation solver the use of pMTJs driven by spin-orbit\ntorque to directly sample numbers from arbitrary probability distributions with\nthe help of a tunable probability tree. The tree operates by dynamically\nbiasing sequences of pMTJ relaxation events, called 'coinflips', via an\nadditional applied spin-transfer-torque current. Specifically, using a single,\nideal pMTJ device we successfully draw integer samples on the interval 0,255\nfrom an exponential distribution based on p-value distribution analysis. In\norder to investigate device-to-device variations, the thermal stability of the\npMTJs are varied based on manufactured device data. It is found that while\nrepeatedly using a varied device inhibits ability to recover the probability\ndistribution, the device variations average out when considering the entire set\nof devices as a 'bucket' to agnostically draw random numbers from. Further, it\nis noted that the device variations most significantly impact the highest level\nof the probability tree, iwth diminishing errors at lower levels. The devices\nare then used to draw both uniformly and exponentially distributed numbers for\nthe Monte Carlo computation of a problem from particle transport, showing\nexcellent data fit with the analytical solution.

Our architecture features several key ingredients making\nMLE work in this context. First, the hemispheres share a common core at the\nentrance of the network which accommodates for various forms of time variation\nin the error variance. Second, we introduce a volatility emphasis constraint\nthat breaks mean/variance indeterminacy in this class of overparametrized\nnonlinear models. Third, we conduct a blocked out-of-bag reality check to curb\noverfitting in both conditional moments. Fourth, the algorithm utilizes\nstandard deep learning software and thus handles large data sets - both\ncomputationally and statistically. Ergo, our Hemisphere Neural Network (HNN)\nprovides proactive volatility forecasts based on leading indicators when it\ncan, and reactive volatility based on the magnitude of previous prediction\nerrors when it must. We evaluate point and density forecasts with an extensive\nout-of-sample experiment and benchmark against a suite of models ranging from\nclassics to more modern machine learning-based offerings. In all cases, HNN\nfares well by consistently providing accurate mean/variance forecasts for all\ntargets and horizons. Studying the resulting volatility paths reveals its\nversatility, while probabilistic forecasting evaluation metrics showcase its\nenviable reliability.

At $10^{10-11}$\nM$_\\odot$, our f$_{\\mathrm{gas}}$, ranging from 0.32 to 0.48, agree well with\nother studies based on mass-complete samples down to $10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$, and\nare lower than expected according to other works more biased to individual\ndetections. At $10^{9-10}$ M$_\\odot$, we obtain 3$\\sigma$ upper limits for\nf$_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ ranging from 0.69 to 0.77. These upper limits are on the\nlevel of the extrapolations of scaling relations based on mass-complete samples\ndown to $10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$. As such, it suggests that the gas content of\nlow-mass galaxies is at most what is extrapolated from literature scaling\nrelations. The comparison of our results with previous works reflects how the\ninclusion of bluer, less obscured, and more MS-like objects progressively\npushes the gas level to lower values.",

Their\nexceptional properties, such as low mass and high quality factor, make them\nalso very appealing for force sensing experiments. In this Letter, we propose a\nmethod for detecting and ultimately controlling nuclear spins by directly\ncoupling them to high-frequency resonators via a magnetic field gradient.\nDynamical backaction between the sensor and an ensemble of nuclear spins\nproduces a shift in the sensor's resonance frequency, which can be measured to\nprobe the spin ensemble. Based on analytical as well as numerical results, we\npredict that the method will allow nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging with a\nrange of realistic devices. At the same time, this interaction paves the way\nfor new manipulation techniques, similar to those employed in cavity\noptomechanics, enriching both the sensor's and the spin ensemble's features.",

This observer is designed for systems with a given\nlinearized model and a stabilizing Luenberger observer gain. We utilize\ntwo-layer quadratic neural networks (QNN) for policy evaluation and derive a\nlinear correction term using the input and output data. This correction term\neffectively rectifies inaccuracies introduced by the linearized model employed\nwithin the observer design. A unique feature of the proposed methodology is\nthat the QNN is trained through convex optimization. The main advantage is that\nthe QNN's input-output mapping has an analytical expression as a quadratic\nform, which can then be used to obtain a linear correction term policy. This is\nin stark contrast to the available techniques in the literature that must train\na second neural network to obtain policy improvement. It is proven that the\nobtained linear correction term is optimal for linear systems, as both the\nvalue function and the QNN's input-output mapping are quadratic. The proposed\nmethod is applied to a simple pendulum, demonstrating an enhanced correction\nterm policy compared to relying solely on the linearized model. This shows its\npromise for addressing nonlinear systems.",

However, on zero-shot discriminative benchmarks, there\nis still a performance gap between models trained with generative and\ndiscriminative objectives. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by\nimproving the efficacy of generative training on classification tasks, without\nany finetuning processes or additional modules.\n  Specifically, we focus on narrowing the gap between the generative captioner\nand the CLIP classifier. We begin by analysing the predictions made by the\ncaptioner and classifier and observe that the caption generation inherits the\ndistribution bias from the language model trained with pure text modality,\nmaking it less grounded on the visual signal. To tackle this problem, we\nredesign the scoring objective for the captioner to alleviate the\ndistributional bias and focus on measuring the gain of information brought by\nthe visual inputs. We further design a generative training objective to match\nthe evaluation objective. We name our model trained and evaluated from the\nnovel procedures as Information Gain (IG) captioner. We pretrain the models on\nthe public Laion-5B dataset and perform a series of discriminative evaluations.\nFor the zero-shot classification on ImageNet, IG captioner achieves $> 18\\%$\nimprovements over the standard captioner, achieving comparable performances\nwith the CLIP classifier. IG captioner also demonstrated strong performance on\nzero-shot image-text retrieval tasks on MSCOCO and Flickr30K. We hope this\npaper inspires further research towards unifying generative and discriminative\ntraining procedures for visual-language models.",

We have shown that many of the key properties of\nQPE flares (period, luminosity, duration, emission temperature, alternating\nlong-short recurrence time behavior, source rates) are naturally reproduced by\na scenario involving twice-per-orbit collisions between a solar-type star on a\nmildly eccentric orbit, likely brought into the nucleus as an extreme\nmass-ratio inspiral (EMRI), and the gaseous accretion disk of a supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH). The flare is generated by the hot shocked debris expanding\noutwards from either side of the disk midplane, akin to dual miniature\nsupernovae. Here, we consider the conditions necessary for disk-star collisions\nto generate lower-temperature flares which peak in the ultraviolet (UV) instead\nof the X-ray band. We identify a region of parameter space at low SMBH mass\n$M_{\\bullet} \\sim 10^{5.5}M_{\\odot}$ and QPE periods $P \\gtrsim 10$ hr for\nwhich the predicted flares are sufficiently luminous $L_{\\rm UV} \\sim 10^{41}$\nerg s$^{-1}$ to outshine the quiescent disk emission at these wavelengths. The\nprospects to discover such ``UV QPEs'' with future satellite missions such as\nULTRASAT and UVEX depends on the prevalence of very low-mass SMBH and the\noccurrence rate of stellar EMRIs onto them. For gaseous disks produced by the\ntidal disruption of stars, we predict that X-ray QPEs will eventually shut off,\nonly to later reappear as UV-QPEs as the accretion rate continues to drop.",

Variability\nselection via long-term photometric ultraviolet, optical, or infrared (UVOIR)\nlight curves has proved effective and identifies lower-Eddington ratios\ncompared to broad and narrow optical spectral lines searches. In the\ninefficient accretion regime, X-ray and radio searches are effective, but they\nhave been limited to small samples. Therefore, differences between selection\ntechniques have remained uncertain. Here, we present the first large systematic\ninvestigation of the X-ray properties of a sample of known MBH candidates in\ndwarf galaxies. We extracted X-ray photometry and spectra of a sample of\n$\\sim200$ UVOIR variability-selected MBHs and significantly detected 17 of them\nin the deepest available \\emph{SRG}/eROSITA image, of which four are newly\ndiscovered X-ray sources and two are new secure MBHs. This implies that tens to\nhundreds of LSST MBHs will have SRG/eROSITA counterparts, depending on the\nseeding model adopted. Surprisingly, the stacked X-ray images of the many\nnon-detected MBHs are incompatible with standard disk-corona relations, typical\nof active galactic nuclei, inferred from both the optical and radio fluxes.\nThey are instead compatible with the X-ray emission predicted for normal\ngalaxies. After careful consideration of potential biases, we identified that\nthis X-ray weakness needs a physical origin. A possibility is that a canonical\nX-ray corona might be lacking in the majority of this population of\nUVOIR-variability selected low-mass galaxies or that unusual accretion modes\nand spectral energy distributions are in place for MBHs in dwarf galaxies.",

            "summary": "Two unresolved questions at galaxy centers, namely the formation of the\nnuclear star cluster (NSC) and the origin of the gamma-ray excess in the Milky\nWay (MW) and Andromeda (M31), are both related to the formation and evolution\nof globular clusters (GCs). They migrate towards the galaxy center due to\ndynamical friction, and get tidally disrupted to release the stellar mass\ncontent including millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which contribute to the NSC and\ngamma-ray excess. In this study, we propose a semi-analytical model of GC\nformation and evolution that utilizes the Illustris cosmological simulation to\naccurately capture the formation epochs of GCs and simulate their subsequent\nevolution. Our analysis confirms that our GC properties at z=0 are consistent\nwith observations, and our model naturally explains the formation of a massive\nNSC in a galaxy similar to the MW and M31. We also find a remarkable similarity\nin our model prediction with the gamma-ray excess signal in the MW. However,\nour predictions fall short by approximately an order of magnitude in M31,\nindicating distinct origins for the two gamma-ray excesses. Meanwhile, we\nutilize the catalog of Illustris halos to investigate the influence of galaxy\nassembly history. We find that the earlier a galaxy is assembled, the heavier\nand spatially more concentrated its GC system behaves at z=0. This results in a\nlarger NSC mass and brighter gamma-ray emission from deposited MSPs",

            "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a promising way for intelligent\nagents (e.g., autonomous vehicles) to learn to navigate complex scenarios.\nHowever, DRL with neural networks as function approximators is typically\nconsidered a black box with little explainability and often suffers from\nsuboptimal performance, especially for autonomous navigation in highly\ninteractive multi-agent environments. To address these issues, we propose three\nauxiliary tasks with spatio-temporal relational reasoning and integrate them\ninto the standard DRL framework, which improves the decision making performance\nand provides explainable intermediate indicators. We propose to explicitly\ninfer the internal states (i.e., traits and intentions) of surrounding agents\n(e.g., human drivers) as well as to predict their future trajectories in the\nsituations with and without the ego agent through counterfactual reasoning.\nThese auxiliary tasks provide additional supervision signals to infer the\nbehavior patterns of other interactive agents. Multiple variants of framework\nintegration strategies are compared. We also employ a spatio-temporal graph\nneural network to encode relations between dynamic entities, which enhances\nboth internal state inference and decision making of the ego agent. Moreover,\nwe propose an interactivity estimation mechanism based on the difference\nbetween predicted trajectories in these two situations, which indicates the\ndegree of influence of the ego agent on other agents. To validate the proposed\nmethod, we design an intersection driving simulator based on the Intelligent\nIntersection Driver Model (IIDM) that simulates vehicles and pedestrians. Our\napproach achieves robust and state-of-the-art performance in terms of standard\nevaluation metrics and provides explainable intermediate indicators (i.e.,\ninternal states, and interactivity scores) for decision making.",

            "summary": "Power systems must maintain the frequency within acceptable limits when\nsubjected to a disturbance. To ensure this, the most significant credible\ndisturbance in the system is normally used as a benchmark to allocate the\nPrimary Frequency Response (PFR) resources. However, the overall reduction of\nsystem inertia due to increased integration of Converter Interfaced Generation\n(CIG) implies that systems with high penetration of CIG require more frequency\ncontrol services, which are either costly or unavailable. In extreme cases of\ncost and scarcity, regulating the most significant disturbance magnitude can\noffer an efficient solution to this problem. This paper proposes a Machine\nLearning (ML) based technique to regulate the disturbance magnitude of the\npower system to comply with the frequency stability requirements i.e., Rate of\nChange of Frequency (RoCoF) and frequency nadir. Unlike traditional approaches\nwhich limit the disturbance magnitude by using the Centre Of Inertia (COI)\nbecause the locational frequency responses of the network are analytically hard\nto derive, the proposed method is able to capture such complexities using\ndata-driven techniques. The method does not rely on the computationally\nintensive RMS-Time Domain Simulations (TDS), once trained offline.\nConsequently, by considering the locational frequency dynamics of the system,\noperators can identify operating conditions (OC) that fulfil frequency\nrequirements at every monitored bus in the network, without the allocation of\nadditional frequency control services such as inertia. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is demonstrated on the modified IEEE 39 Bus network.",

The spectral state in Cygnus X-1 can be predicted with\ngreater than 95 per cent accuracy for both types of models explored across a\nrange of RP sizes based solely on the recurrence properties. The primary\nfeatures from the RP that distinguish between spectral states are the\ndeterminism, Shannon entropy, and average line length, all of which are\nsystematically higher in the hard state compared to the soft state.

            "summary": "Understanding how the 3D scene evolves is vital for making decisions in\nautonomous driving. Most existing methods achieve this by predicting the\nmovements of object boxes, which cannot capture more fine-grained scene\ninformation. In this paper, we explore a new framework of learning a world\nmodel, OccWorld, in the 3D Occupancy space to simultaneously predict the\nmovement of the ego car and the evolution of the surrounding scenes. We propose\nto learn a world model based on 3D occupancy rather than 3D bounding boxes and\nsegmentation maps for three reasons: 1) expressiveness. 3D occupancy can\ndescribe the more fine-grained 3D structure of the scene; 2) efficiency. 3D\noccupancy is more economical to obtain (e.g., from sparse LiDAR points). 3)\nversatility. 3D occupancy can adapt to both vision and LiDAR. To facilitate the\nmodeling of the world evolution, we learn a reconstruction-based scene\ntokenizer on the 3D occupancy to obtain discrete scene tokens to describe the\nsurrounding scenes. We then adopt a GPT-like spatial-temporal generative\ntransformer to generate subsequent scene and ego tokens to decode the future\noccupancy and ego trajectory. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes\nbenchmark demonstrate the ability of OccWorld to effectively model the\nevolution of the driving scenes. OccWorld also produces competitive planning\nresults without using instance and map supervision. Code:\nhttps://github.com/wzzheng/OccWorld.",

            "summary": "Recently, impressive results have been achieved in 3D scene editing with text\ninstructions based on a 2D diffusion model. However, current diffusion models\nprimarily generate images by predicting noise in the latent space, and the\nediting is usually applied to the whole image, which makes it challenging to\nperform delicate, especially localized, editing for 3D scenes. Inspired by\nrecent 3D Gaussian splatting, we propose a systematic framework, named\nGaussianEditor, to edit 3D scenes delicately via 3D Gaussians with text\ninstructions. Benefiting from the explicit property of 3D Gaussians, we design\na series of techniques to achieve delicate editing. Specifically, we first\nextract the region of interest (RoI) corresponding to the text instruction,\naligning it to 3D Gaussians. The Gaussian RoI is further used to control the\nediting process. Our framework can achieve more delicate and precise editing of\n3D scenes than previous methods while enjoying much faster training speed, i.e.\nwithin 20 minutes on a single V100 GPU, more than twice as fast as\nInstruct-NeRF2NeRF (45 minutes -- 2 hours).",

To mitigate these issues, an innovative machine learning\n(ML)-enhanced landing scheduling methodology is proposed, aiming to improve\nautomation and safety. Analyzing flight arrival delay scenarios reveals strong\nmultimodal distributions and clusters in arrival flight time durations. A\nmulti-stage conditional ML predictor enhances separation time prediction based\non flight events. ML predictions are then integrated as safety constraints in a\ntime-constrained traveling salesman problem formulation, solved using\nmixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Historical flight recordings and model\npredictions address uncertainties between successive flights, ensuring\nreliability. The proposed method is validated using real-world data from the\nAtlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC ZTL). Case studies demonstrate\nan average 17.2% reduction in total landing time compared to the\nFirst-Come-First-Served (FCFS) rule. Unlike FCFS, the proposed methodology\nconsiders uncertainties, instilling confidence in scheduling. The study\nconcludes with remarks and outlines future research directions.",

Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler\nor interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain\nconditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior -- in other cases, the\nissue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors\ncan be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed\nby automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically\ndetecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for\nnovices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising\nperformance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining\ncode. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with\nthe next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors\nrelate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to\nanalysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two\npopular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly\nexplanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of\nintroductory computing students $(n=964)$ solving the same error detection\ntask. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we\nobserve significant improvement in logic error identification between the\nprevious and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations\nsignificantly outperform students.

I show how the disc thermal-viscous instability model applied to\nboth cataclysmic variable stars and X-ray binary transients compels us to\nconclude that assuming the existence in these systems of a flat accretion disc\nextending down to the accretor's surface or to the last stable orbit and fed\nwith matter at its outer edge is too simple and inadequate a description of\nthese objects. It is also clear that, in most cases, these discs cannot driven\nby (anomalous) viscosity only. The origin of the superhumps observed in\ncataclysmic variables and X-ray binaries is, contrary to the common opinion,\nstill unknown. In accreting magnetic white dwarf systems outbursts not of the\ndwarf-nova type can be due to the magnetic gating instability and/or\nthermonuclear micronova explosions. Although the \"typical\" lightcvurves of\nX-ray transients can be described by analytical formulae (but their decay phase\nis not exponential), observations show that in many cases the light variations\nin these systems are much more complex. An elementary argument shows the\nimpossibility of magnetars in pulsing ultraluminous X-ray systems, but we still\ndo not have a complete, self-consistent description of supercritical accretion\nonto magnetized neutron stars and the resulting (necessarily beamed) emission.\nAlthough it is (almost) universally believed that active galactic nuclei\ncontain accretion discs of the same type as those observed in binary systems,\nthe evidence supporting this alleged truth is slim and the structure of\naccretion flows onto supermassive black holes is still to be determined.",

Light neutrino masses come from the tree-level type-I\nseesaw mechanism and from the one-loop scotogenic contribution accommodating\nviable dark matter candidates responsible for observed relic abundance of dark\nmatter (DM). Respectively, both these contributions restore the atmospheric and\nsolar neutrino mass scales. With only one right-handed neutrino, the model\nfeatures specific predictions with the normal ordering of light neutrino\nmasses, the lightest neutrino being massless, and only one relevant CP Majorana\nphase. The flavor symmetric setup helps us to realize the TM$_1$ mixing scheme\nwith concrete correlations and constraints on the mixing angles and associated\nCP phases. The framework predicts the atmospheric mixing angle to be in the\nupper octant with specific ranges $0.531 (0.580) \\leq \\sin^2\\theta_{23}\\leq\n0.544 (0.595)$ and the Dirac CP phase is restricted within the range\n$\\pm(1.44-1.12)$ radian. The Majorana phase is also tightly constrained with a\nrange of $0.82-0.95$ and $1.58-1.67$ radian, which is otherwise unconstrained\nfrom neutrino oscillations. Strict predictions on the Majorana phases also\nyield an accurate prediction for the effective mass parameter for neutrinoless\ndouble beta within the range of $1.61-3.85$ meV. The model offers a rich\nphenomenology regarding DM relic density and direct search constraints, and the\nfermionic DM scenario has been discussed in detail, estimating its possible\nconnection with the neutrino sector. As an example of the model studies at\ncolliders, the SM Higgs in the diphoton decay channel is examined. The model\npredicts strictly vanishing $\\tau \\to e\\gamma$, $\\tau \\rightarrow 3e$ decays\nand testable signals by MEG-II and SINDRUM/Mu3e experiments for the $\\mu \\to e\n\\gamma$ and $\\mu \\to 3 e$ decays, respectively.",

            "summary": "Anticipating future actions is inherently uncertain. Given an observed video\nsegment containing ongoing actions, multiple subsequent actions can plausibly\nfollow. This uncertainty becomes even larger when predicting far into the\nfuture. However, the majority of existing action anticipation models adhere to\na deterministic approach, neglecting to account for future uncertainties. In\nthis work, we rethink action anticipation from a generative view, employing\ndiffusion models to capture different possible future actions. In this\nframework, future actions are iteratively generated from standard Gaussian\nnoise in the latent space, conditioned on the observed video, and subsequently\ntransitioned into the action space. Extensive experiments on four benchmark\ndatasets, i.e., Breakfast, 50Salads, EpicKitchens, and EGTEA Gaze+, are\nperformed and the proposed method achieves superior or comparable results to\nstate-of-the-art methods, showing the effectiveness of a generative approach\nfor action anticipation. Our code and trained models will be published on\nGitHub.",

Prior studies focused on modeling the catastrophic forgetting and\nbackground shift challenges in continual learning.

In addition, prior\nmethods have yet to model the unknown classes well, thus resulting in producing\nnon-discriminative features among unknown classes. This paper presents a novel\nFairness Learning via Contrastive Attention Approach to continual learning in\nsemantic scene understanding. In particular, we first introduce a new Fairness\nContrastive Clustering loss to address the problems of catastrophic forgetting\nand fairness. Then, we propose an attention-based visual grammar approach to\neffectively model the background shift problem and unknown classes, producing\nbetter feature representations for different unknown classes.

            "summary": "Function is increasingly recognized as an important indicator of whole-person\nhealth, although it receives little attention in clinical natural language\nprocessing research. We introduce the first public annotated dataset\nspecifically on the Mobility domain of the International Classification of\nFunctioning, Disability and Health (ICF), aiming to facilitate automatic\nextraction and analysis of functioning information from free-text clinical\nnotes. We utilize the National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) research dataset\nto construct a pool of candidate sentences using keyword expansion. Our active\nlearning approach, using query-by-committee sampling weighted by density\nrepresentativeness, selects informative sentences for human annotation. We\ntrain BERT and CRF models, and use predictions from these models to guide the\nselection of new sentences for subsequent annotation iterations. Our final\ndataset consists of 4,265 sentences with a total of 11,784 entities, including\n5,511 Action entities, 5,328 Mobility entities, 306 Assistance entities, and\n639 Quantification entities. The inter-annotator agreement (IAA), averaged over\nall entity types, is 0.72 for exact matching and 0.91 for partial matching. We\nalso train and evaluate common BERT models and state-of-the-art Nested NER\nmodels. The best F1 scores are 0.84 for Action, 0.7 for Mobility, 0.62 for\nAssistance, and 0.71 for Quantification. Empirical results demonstrate\npromising potential of NER models to accurately extract mobility functioning\ninformation from clinical text. The public availability of our annotated\ndataset will facilitate further research to comprehensively capture functioning\ninformation in electronic health records (EHRs).",

Similar to other\ndual-use AI systems, BDTs present a wicked problem: how can regulators uphold\npublic safety without stifling innovation? We highlight how current regulatory\nproposals that are primarily tailored toward large language models may be less\neffective for BDTs, which require fewer computational resources to train and\nare often developed in an open-source manner.

            "summary": "Even though online social movements can quickly become viral on social media,\nlanguages can be a barrier to timely monitoring and analyzing the underlying\nonline social behaviors (OSB). This is especially true for under-resourced\nlanguages on social media like dialectal Arabic; the primary language used by\nArabs on social media. Therefore, it is crucial to provide solutions to\nefficiently exploit resources from high-resourced languages to solve\nlanguage-dependent OSB analysis in under-resourced languages. This paper\nproposes to localize content of resources in high-resourced languages into\nunder-resourced Arabic dialects. Content localization goes beyond content\ntranslation that converts text from one language to another; content\nlocalization adapts culture, language nuances and regional preferences from one\nlanguage to a specific language/dialect. Automating understanding of the\nnatural and familiar day-to-day expressions in different regions, is the key to\nachieve a wider analysis of OSB especially for smart cities. In this paper, we\nutilize content-localization based neural machine translation to develop\nsentiment and hate classifiers for two low-resourced Arabic dialects: Levantine\nand Gulf. Not only this but we also leverage unsupervised learning to\nfacilitate the analysis of sentiment and hate predictions by inferring hidden\ntopics from the corresponding data and providing coherent interpretations of\nthose topics in their native language/dialects. The experimental evaluations\nand proof-of-concept COVID-19 case study on real data have validated the\neffectiveness of our proposed system in precisely distinguishing sentiments and\naccurately identifying hate content in both Levantine and Gulf Arabic dialects.\nOur findings shed light on the importance of considering the unique nature of\ndialects within the same language and ignoring the dialectal aspect would lead\nto misleading analysis.",

            "summary": "Drug combination refers to the use of two or more drugs to treat a specific\ndisease at the same time. It is currently the mainstream way to treat complex\ndiseases. Compared with single drugs, drug combinations have better efficacy\nand can better inhibit toxicity and drug resistance. The computational model\nbased on deep learning concatenates the representation of multiple drugs and\nthe corresponding cell line feature as input, and the output is whether the\ndrug combination can have an inhibitory effect on the cell line. However, this\nstrategy of concatenating multiple representations has the following defects:\nthe alignment of drug representation and cell line representation is ignored,\nresulting in the synergistic relationship not being reflected positionally in\nthe embedding space. Moreover, the alignment measurement function in deep\nlearning cannot be suitable for drug synergy prediction tasks due to\ndifferences in input types. Therefore, in this work, we propose a graph\nconvolutional network with multi-representation alignment (GCNMRA) for\npredicting drug synergy. In the GCNMRA model, we designed a\nmulti-representation alignment function suitable for the drug synergy\nprediction task so that the positional relationship between drug\nrepresentations and cell line representation is reflected in the embedding\nspace. In addition, the vector modulus of drug representations and cell line\nrepresentation is considered to improve the accuracy of calculation results and\naccelerate model convergence. Finally, many relevant experiments were run on\nmultiple drug synergy datasets to verify the effectiveness of the above\ninnovative elements and the excellence of the GCNMRA model.",

Dimensionality reduction techniques can simplify the system\ndynamics by reducing the number of variables, but most existing methods do not\naccount for networked systems with separable coupling-dynamics, where the\ninteraction between nodes can be decomposed into a function of the node state\nand a function of the neighbor state. Here, we present a novel dimensionality\nreduction framework that can effectively capture the global dynamics of these\nnetworks by projecting them onto a low-dimensional system. We derive the\nreduced system's equation and stability conditions, and propose an error metric\nto quantify the reduction accuracy. We demonstrate our framework on two\nexamples of networked systems with separable coupling-dynamics: a modified\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible model with direct infection and a modified\nMichaelis-Menten model with activation and inhibition. We conduct numerical\nexperiments on synthetic and empirical networks to validate and evaluate our\nframework, and find a good agreement between the original and reduced systems.\nWe also investigate the effects of different network structures and parameters\non the system dynamics and the reduction error.

While\nin vacuum extremely accurate mass measurements are possible, in a liquid phase\nthe quantitative analysis is intricate due to the complex interplay of\nhydrodynamic and adhesion forces, varying with the physicochemical properties\nof adsorbent and the quartz resonator surfaces. In the present paper we dissect\nthe role of hydrodynamics for the analytically tractable scenario of a stiff\ncontact, whereas the adsorbed particles oscillate with the resonator as a whole\nwithout rotation. Under the assumption of the low surface coverage, we\ntheoretically study the excess shear force exerted on the resonator due to\npresence of a single adsorbed particle. The excess shear force has two\ncontributions: (i) the fluid-mediated force due to flow disturbance created by\nthe particle and (ii) the viscous force exerted on the particle by the fluid\nand transmitted to the resonator via contact. We found that for small enough\nparticles there is a mutual cancellation of the above dual components of the\nnet excess shear force, reducing the overall effect of the hydrodynamics to\nthat comparable in magnitude to the inertial force. These findings indicate\nthat the accurate account of hydrodynamics in the analysis of QCM-D response is\nas important as the inertial mass of the adsorbents (determining the frequency\nshift in the Sauerbrey equation). The resulting dimensionless frequency and\ndissipation shifts and the corresponding acoustic ratio computed numerically,\nshowing a fair agreement with previously published experimental results at low\noscillation frequencies.",

            "summary": "Computing the matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological\nparameters can be prohibitively slow in cosmological analyses, hence emulating\nthis calculation is desirable. Previous analytic approximations are\ninsufficiently accurate for modern applications, so black-box, uninterpretable\nemulators are often used. We utilise an efficient genetic programming based\nsymbolic regression framework to explore the space of potential mathematical\nexpressions which can approximate the power spectrum and $\\sigma_8$. We learn\nthe ratio between an existing low-accuracy fitting function for $P(k)$ and that\nobtained by solving the Boltzmann equations and thus still incorporate the\nphysics which motivated this earlier approximation. We obtain an analytic\napproximation to the linear power spectrum with a root mean squared fractional\nerror of 0.2% between $k = 9\\times10^{-3} - 9 \\, h{\\rm \\, Mpc^{-1}}$ and across\na wide range of cosmological parameters, and we provide physical\ninterpretations for various terms in the expression. We also provide a simple\nanalytic approximation for $\\sigma_8$ with a similar accuracy, with a root mean\nsquared fractional error of just 0.4% when evaluated across the same range of\ncosmologies. This function is easily invertible to obtain $A_{\\rm s}$ as a\nfunction of $\\sigma_8$ and the other cosmological parameters, if preferred. It\nis possible to obtain symbolic approximations to a seemingly complex function\nat a precision required for current and future cosmological analyses without\nresorting to deep-learning techniques, thus avoiding their black-box nature and\nlarge number of parameters. Our emulator will be usable long after the codes on\nwhich numerical approximations are built become outdated.",

In the absence of fully sampled\nacquisitions, which can serve as ground truth data, training deep learning\nalgorithms in a supervised manner to predict the underlying ground truth image\nbecomes an impossible task. To address this limitation, self-supervised methods\nhave emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging available subsampled k-space\ndata to train deep learning networks for MRI reconstruction. Nevertheless,\nthese self-supervised approaches often fall short when compared to supervised\nmethodologies. In this paper, we introduce JSSL (Joint Supervised and\nSelf-supervised Learning), a novel training approach for deep learning-based\nMRI reconstruction algorithms aimed at enhancing reconstruction quality in\nscenarios where target dataset(s) containing fully sampled k-space measurements\nare unavailable. Our proposed method operates by simultaneously training a\nmodel in a self-supervised learning setting, using subsampled data from the\ntarget dataset(s), and in a supervised learning manner, utilizing data from\nother datasets, referred to as proxy datasets, where fully sampled k-space data\nis accessible. To demonstrate the efficacy of JSSL, we utilized subsampled\nprostate parallel MRI measurements as the target dataset, while employing fully\nsampled brain and knee k-space acquisitions as proxy datasets. Our results\nshowcase a substantial improvement over conventional self-supervised training\nmethods, thereby underscoring the effectiveness of our joint approach.

            "summary": "Learning based image quality assessment (IQA) models have obtained impressive\nperformance with the help of reliable subjective quality labels, where mean\nopinion score (MOS) is the most popular choice. However, in view of the\nsubjective bias of individual annotators, the labor-abundant MOS (LA-MOS)\ntypically requires a large collection of opinion scores from multiple\nannotators for each image, which significantly increases the learning cost. In\nthis paper, we aim to learn robust IQA models from low-cost MOS (LC-MOS), which\nonly requires very few opinion scores or even a single opinion score for each\nimage. More specifically, we consider the LC-MOS as the noisy observation of\nLA-MOS and enforce the IQA model learned from LC-MOS to approach the unbiased\nestimation of LA-MOS. In this way, we represent the subjective bias between\nLC-MOS and LA-MOS, and the model bias between IQA predictions learned from\nLC-MOS and LA-MOS (i.e., dual-bias) as two latent variables with unknown\nparameters. By means of the expectation-maximization based alternating\noptimization, we can jointly estimate the parameters of the dual-bias, which\nsuppresses the misleading of LC-MOS via a gated dual-bias calibration (GDBC)\nmodule. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration of robust\nIQA model learning from noisy low-cost labels. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive experiments on four popular IQA datasets show that the proposed\nmethod is robust toward different bias rates and annotation numbers and\nsignificantly outperforms the other learning based IQA models when only LC-MOS\nis available. Furthermore, we also achieve comparable performance with respect\nto the other models learned with LA-MOS.",

            "summary": "Industrial simulations of turbulent flows often rely on Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, which contain numerous closure\ncoefficients that need to be calibrated. Although tuning these coefficients can\nproduce significantly improved predictive accuracy, their default values are\noften used. We believe users do not calibrate RANS models for several reasons:\nthere is no clearly recommended framework to optimize these coefficients; the\naverage user does not have the expertise to implement such a framework; and,\nthe optimization of the values of these coefficients can be a computationally\nexpensive process. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a\nsemi-automated calibration of these coefficients using a new framework based on\nBayesian optimization. We introduce the generalized error and default\ncoefficient preference (GEDCP) objective function, which can be used with\nintegral, sparse, or dense reference data. We demonstrate the computationally\nefficient performance of turbo-RANS for three example cases: predicting the\nlift coefficient of an airfoil; predicting the velocity and turbulent kinetic\nenergy fields for a separated flow; and, predicting the wall pressure\ncoefficient distribution for flow through a converging-diverging channel. In\nthe first two examples, we calibrate the $k$-$\\omega$ shear stress transport\n(SST) turbulence model and, in the last example, we calibrate user-specified\ncoefficients for the Generalized $k$-$\\omega$ (GEKO) model in Ansys Fluent. An\nin-depth hyperparameter tuning study is conducted to recommend efficient\nsettings for the turbo-RANS optimization procedure. Towards the goal of\nfacilitating RANS turbulence closure model calibration, we provide an\nopen-source implementation of the turbo-RANS framework that includes OpenFOAM,\nAnsys Fluent, and solver-agnostic templates for user application.",

            "summary": "A persistent trend in Deep Learning has been the applicability of machine\nlearning concepts to other areas than originally introduced for. As of today,\nstate-of-the-art activity recognition from wearable sensors relies on\nclassifiers being trained on fixed windows of data. Contrarily, video-based\nHuman Activity Recognition has followed a segment-based prediction approach,\nlocalizing activity occurrences from start to end. This paper is the first to\nsystematically demonstrate the applicability of state-of-the-art TAL models for\nwearable Human Activity Recongition (HAR) using raw inertial data as input. Our\nresults show that state-of-the-art TAL models are able to outperform popular\ninertial models on 4 out of 6 wearable activity recognition benchmark datasets,\nwith improvements ranging as much as 25% in F1-score. Introducing the TAL\ncommunity's most popular metric to inertial-based HAR, namely mean Average\nPrecision, our analysis shows that TAL models are able to produce more coherent\nsegments along with an overall higher NULL-class accuracy across all datasets.\nBeing the first to provide such an analysis, the TAL community offers an\ninteresting new perspective to inertial-based HAR with yet to be explored\ndesign choices and training concepts, which could be of significant value for\nthe inertial-based HAR community.",

We introduce Audio-based Joint-Embedding\nPredictive Architecture (A-JEPA), a simple extension method for self-supervised\nlearning from the audio spectrum. Following the design of I-JEPA, our A-JEPA\nencodes visible audio spectrogram patches with a curriculum masking strategy\nvia context encoder, and predicts the representations of regions sampled at\nwell-designed locations. The target representations of those regions are\nextracted by the exponential moving average of context encoder, \\emph{i.e.},\ntarget encoder, on the whole spectrogram. We find it beneficial to transfer\nrandom block masking into time-frequency aware masking in a curriculum manner,\nconsidering the complexity of highly correlated in local time and frequency in\naudio spectrograms. To enhance contextual semantic understanding and\nrobustness, we fine-tune the encoder with a regularized masking on target\ndatasets, instead of input dropping or zero. Empirically, when built with\nVision Transformers structure, we find A-JEPA to be highly scalable and sets\nnew state-of-the-art performance on multiple audio and speech classification\ntasks, outperforming other recent models that use externally supervised\npre-training.",

            "summary": "How protoplanetary discs evolve remains an unanswered question. Competing\ntheories of viscosity and magnetohydrodynamic disc winds have been put forward\nas the drivers of angular momentum transport in protoplanetary discs. These two\nmodels predict distinct differences in the disc mass, radius and accretion\nrates over time, that could be used to distinguish them. However that\nexpectation is built on models that do not include another important process -\nphotoevaporation, both internally by the host star and externally by\nneighbouring stars. In this work we produce numerical models of protoplanetary\ndiscs including viscosity, magnetohydrodynamic disc winds, and internal and\nexternal photoevaporation. We find that even weak levels of external\nphotoevaporation can significantly affect the evolution of protoplanetary\ndiscs, influencing the observable features such as disc radii, that might\notherwise distinguish between viscous and wind driven discs. Including internal\nphotoevaporation further suppresses differences in evolution between viscous\nand wind driven discs. This makes it much more difficult than previously\nanticipated, to use observations of nearby star forming regions to determine\nwhether discs are viscous or wind driven. Interestingly we find that evolved\nprotoplanetary discs in intermediate FUV environments may be the best cases for\ndifferentiating whether they evolve through viscosity or magnetohydrodynamic\ndisc winds. Ultimately this work demonstrates the importance of understanding\nwhat are the key evolutionary processes and including as many of those as\npossible when exploring the evolution of protoplanetary discs.",

            "summary": "Uncertainty estimation in Neural Networks (NNs) is vital in improving\nreliability and confidence in predictions, particularly in safety-critical\napplications. Bayesian Neural Networks (BayNNs) with Dropout as an\napproximation offer a systematic approach to quantifying uncertainty, but they\ninherently suffer from high hardware overhead in terms of power, memory, and\ncomputation. Thus, the applicability of BayNNs to edge devices with limited\nresources or to high-performance applications is challenging. Some of the\ninherent costs of BayNNs can be reduced by accelerating them in hardware on a\nComputation-In-Memory (CIM) architecture with spintronic memories and\nbinarizing their parameters. However, numerous stochastic units are required to\nimplement conventional dropout-based BayNN. In this paper, we propose the Scale\nDropout, a novel regularization technique for Binary Neural Networks (BNNs),\nand Monte Carlo-Scale Dropout (MC-Scale Dropout)-based BayNNs for efficient\nuncertainty estimation. Our approach requires only one stochastic unit for the\nentire model, irrespective of the model size, leading to a highly scalable\nBayesian NN. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Spintronic memory-based CIM\narchitecture for the proposed BayNN that achieves more than $100\\times$ energy\nsavings compared to the state-of-the-art. We validated our method to show up to\na $1\\%$ improvement in predictive performance and superior uncertainty\nestimates compared to related works.",

Our models\nincorporate a frequency-dependent turbulent effective viscosity acting on\nequilibrium tides (including its modification by rapid rotation consistent with\nhydrodynamical simulations) and inertial waves in convection zones, and\ninternal gravity waves in the thin radiative atmospheres. We consider a range\nof planetary evolutionary models for various masses and strengths of stellar\ninstellation. Dissipation of inertial waves is computed using a\nfrequency-averaged formalism fully accounting for planetary structures.\nDissipation of gravity waves in the radiation zone is computed assuming these\nwaves are launched adiabatically and are subsequently fully damped (by wave\nbreaking/radiative damping). We compute modified tidal quality factors $Q'$ and\nevolutionary timescales for these planets as a function of their ages. We find\ninertial waves to be the dominant mechanism of tidal dissipation in giant\nplanets whenever they are excited. Their excitation requires the tidal period\n($P_\\mathrm{tide}$) to be longer than half the planetary rotation\n($P_\\mathrm{rot}/2$), and we predict inertial waves to provide a typical\n$Q'\\sim 10^3 (P_\\mathrm{rot}/1 \\mathrm{d})^2$, with values between $10^5$ and\n$10^6$ for a 10-day period. We show correlations of observed exoplanet\neccentricities with tidal circularisation timescale predictions, highlighting\nthe key role of planetary tides. A major uncertainty in planetary models is the\nrole of stably-stratified layers resulting from compositional gradients, which\nwe do not account for here, but which could modify predictions for tidal\ndissipation rates.",

            "summary": "The even denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states $\\nu=5/2$ and\n$\\nu=7/2$, have been long predicted to host non-abelian quasiparticles (QPs).\nThe presence of energy-carrying neutral modes cripples customary conductance\nmeasurements and thus motivates thermal transport measurements, which already\nproved to be sensitive to all energy-carrying modes. Each state has a different\ncapacity to carry quanta of heat - as expressed by the so-called: 'central\ncharge' - identifying the state's topological order. While the 'two-terminal'\nthermal conductance measurements identified the topological orders of abelian\nand non-abelian QH states, they are prone to partial thermal equilibration\namong counter-propagating modes. Here, we report a 'four-terminal' thermal Hall\nconductance measurement, which separately measures the heat carried by the\ndownstream and upstream chiral modes. This measurement is insensitive to\nthermal equilibration among modes. We verify that the $\\nu=5/2$ and $\\nu=7/2$\nstates are non-abelian, supporting a single upstream Majorana mode, thus\nobeying the Particle-Hole Pfaffian topological order. While current numerical\nworks predict a different central charge, this contribution should motivate\nfurther theoretical work.",

            "summary": "Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a source model for a\ntarget domain, with only access to unlabeled target training data and the\nsource model pre-trained on a supervised source domain. Relying on pseudo\nlabeling and/or auxiliary supervision, conventional methods are inevitably\nerror-prone. To mitigate this limitation, in this work we for the first time\nexplore the potentials of off-the-shelf vision-language (ViL) multimodal models\n(e.g.,CLIP) with rich whilst heterogeneous knowledge. We find that directly\napplying the ViL model to the target domain in a zero-shot fashion is\nunsatisfactory, as it is not specialized for this particular task but largely\ngeneric. To make it task specific, we propose a novel Distilling multimodal\nFoundation model(DIFO)approach. Specifically, DIFO alternates between two steps\nduring adaptation: (i) Customizing the ViL model by maximizing the mutual\ninformation with the target model in a prompt learning manner, (ii) Distilling\nthe knowledge of this customized ViL model to the target model. For more\nfine-grained and reliable distillation, we further introduce two effective\nregularization terms, namely most-likely category encouragement and predictive\nconsistency. Extensive experiments show that DIFO significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art alternatives. Our source code will be released.",

The brane divides the space into two regions with different\nproperties of the vacuum state. We show that the only nonzero component of the\ncurrent density is along the azimuthal direction in both regions. In order to\ndevelop this analysis we calculate, for both regions, the positive frequency\nWightman functions. Both functions present a part associated with the AdS in\npresence of a cosmic string only, and the other part induced by the brane. In\nthis paper we consider only the contributions induced by the brane. We show\nthat in both regions the azimuthal current densities are odd functions of the\nmagnetic flux along the string.

This is referred to as quantitative imaging,\ni.e, correct recovery of physical parameters and not just a qualitative image.\nIn this chapter, we aim to give an overview on established reconstruction\ntechniques in photoacoustic tomography. We start with modelling of the optical\nand acoustic phenomena, necessary for a reliable recovery of quantitative\nvalues. Furthermore, we give an overview of approaches for the tomographic\nreconstruction problem with an emphasis on the recovery of quantitative values,\nfrom direct and fast analytic approaches to computationally involved\noptimisation based techniques and recent data-driven approaches.",

However, in light of these rapid advances, addressing the\nunderrepresentation of black communities and African countries in AI is\ncrucial. Boosting enthusiasm for AI can be effectively accomplished by\nshowcasing straightforward applications around tasks like identifying and\ncategorizing traditional symbols, such as Adinkra symbols, or familiar objects\nwithin the community. In this research endeavor, we dived into classical\nmachine learning and harnessed the power of deep learning models to tackle the\nintricate task of classifying and recognizing Adinkra symbols. The idea led to\na newly constructed ADINKRA dataset comprising 174,338 images meticulously\norganized into 62 distinct classes, each representing a singular and emblematic\nsymbol. We constructed a CNN model for classification and recognition using six\nconvolutional layers, three fully connected (FC) layers, and optional dropout\nregularization. The model is a simpler and smaller version of VGG, with fewer\nlayers, smaller channel sizes, and a fixed kernel size. Additionally, we tap\ninto the transfer learning capabilities provided by pre-trained models like VGG\nand ResNet. These models assist us in both classifying images and extracting\nfeatures that can be used with classical machine learning models. We assess the\nmodel's performance by measuring its accuracy and convergence rate and\nvisualizing the areas that significantly influence its predictions. These\nevaluations serve as a foundational benchmark for future assessments of the\nADINKRA dataset. We hope this application exemplar inspires ideas on the\nvarious uses of AI in organizing our traditional and modern lives.",

Although Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)\n[22] is a widely adpoted method for understanding model behaviors, it is\nunstable with respect to random seeds [35,24,3] and exhibits low local fidelity\n(i.e., how well the explanation approximates the model's local behaviors)\n[21,16]. Our study shows that this instability problem stems from small sample\nweights, leading to the dominance of regularization and slow convergence.\nAdditionally, LIME's sampling neighborhood is non-local and biased towards the\nreference, resulting in poor local fidelity and sensitivity to reference\nchoice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GLIME, an enhanced framework\nextending LIME and unifying several prior methods. Within the GLIME framework,\nwe derive an equivalent formulation of LIME that achieves significantly faster\nconvergence and improved stability. By employing a local and unbiased sampling\ndistribution, GLIME generates explanations with higher local fidelity compared\nto LIME. GLIME explanations are independent of reference choice.

            "summary": "Andreev reflection is a fundamental transport process occurring at the\njunction between a normal metal and a superconductor (a N-S junction), when an\nincident electron from the normal side can only be transmitted in the\nsuperconductor as a Cooper pair, with the reflection of a hole in the normal\nmetal. As a consequence of the spin singlet nature of the BCS Cooper pairs, the\ncurrent due to Andreev reflection at a N-S junction is always symmetric in\nspin. Using a Keldysh Nambu Floquet approach, combining analytical and\nnumerical calculations, we study in details the AC transport at a N-S junction,\nwhen the two spin components in the normal metal are driven by different\nperiodic drives. We show that, in the Andreev regime, i.e. when the\nsuperconducting gap is much larger than the frequency of the drives, the\nspin-resolved photo-assisted currents are always equal even if the two drives\nare different. In addition, we show that in this regime the excess noise\ndepends only on the sum of the periodic drives, and we consider in particular\nthe case of Lorentzian pulses (Levitons). We also show how these properties get\nmodified when going beyond the Andreev regime. Finally we give a simple\nanalytical proof of the special properties of the Andreev regime using an exact\nmapping to a particular N-N junction.",

Minimizing the coding cost implies\nmaximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural\nactivities. We analytically show that this mutual information can be written as\nthe sum of two terms that can be interpreted as (i) finding an appropriate\nrepresentation space, and, (ii) building a representation with the appropriate\nmetrics, based on the neural Fisher information on this space. One main\nconsequence is that category learning induces an expansion of neural space near\ndecision boundaries.

While a symmetry\nclassification of non-Hermitian systems leads to 38 universality classes, we\nshow that, under certain conditions, PT-symmetric systems are grouped into 24\nuniversality classes. We identify 14 of them in a coupled two-site\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and confirm the classification by spectral analysis\nusing exact diagonalization techniques. Intriguingly, in four of these 14\nuniversality classes, AIII$_\\nu$, BDI$^\\dagger_\\nu$, BDI$_{++\\nu}$, and\nCI$_{--\\nu}$, we identify a basis in which the SYK Hamiltonian has a block\nstructure in which some blocks are rectangular, with $\\nu \\in \\mathbb{N}$ the\ndifference between the number of rows and columns. We show analytically that\nthis feature leads to the existence of robust $\\nu$ purely real eigenvalues,\nwhose level statistics follow the predictions of Hermitian random matrix theory\nfor classes GUE, GOE, BDI, and CI, respectively. We have recently found that\nthis $\\nu$ is a topological invariant, so these classes are topological. By\ncontrast, non-topological real eigenvalues display a crossover between\nHermitian and non-Hermitian level statistics. Similarly to the case of\nLindbladian dynamics, the reduction of universality classes leads to unexpected\nresults, such as the absence of Kramers degeneracy in a given sector of the\ntheory. Another novel feature of the classification scheme is that different\nsectors of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian may have different symmetries.",

            "summary": "The formation process of the two Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, is still\ndebated with two main competing hypotheses: the capture of an asteroid or a\ngiant impact onto Mars. In order to reveal their origin, the Martian Moons\neXploration (MMX) mission by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans to\nmeasure Phobos' elemental composition by a gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer\ncalled MEGANE. This study provides a model of Phobos' bulk elemental\ncomposition, assuming the two formation hypotheses. Using the mixing model, we\nestablished a MEGANE data analysis flow to discriminate between the formation\nhypotheses by multivariate analysis. The mixing model expresses the composition\nof Phobos in 6 key lithophile elements that will be measured by MEGANE (Fe, Si,\nO, Ca, Mg, and Th) as a linear mixing of two mixing components: material from\nMars and material from an asteroid as represented by primitive meteorite\ncompositions. The inversion calculation includes consideration of MEGANE's\nmeasurement errors ($E_P$) and derives the mixing ratio for a given Phobos\ncomposition, based on which the formation hypotheses are judged. For at least\n65\\% of the modeled compositions, MEGANE measurements will determine the origin\nuniquely ($E_P$ = 30\\%), and this increases from 74 to 87\\% as $E_P$ decreases\nfrom 20 to 10\\%. Although the discrimination performance depends on $E_P$, the\ncurrent operation plan for MEGANE predicts an instrument performance for $E_P$\nof 20--30\\%, resulting in ~70\\% discrimination between the original hypotheses.\nMEGANE observations can also enable the determination of the asteroid type of\nthe captured body or the impactor. The addition of other measurements, such as\nMEGANE's measurements of the volatile element K, as well as observations by\nother MMX remote sensing instruments, will also contribute to the MMX mission's\ngoal to constrain the origin of Phobos.",

            "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) suffer from hallucination a lot,\ngenerating responses that apparently contradict to the image content\noccasionally. The key problem lies in its weak ability to comprehend detailed\ncontent in a multi-modal context, which can be mainly attributed to two factors\nin training data and loss function. The vision instruction dataset primarily\nfocuses on global description, and the auto-regressive loss function favors\ntext modeling rather than image understanding. In this paper, we bring more\ndetailed vision annotations and more discriminative vision models to facilitate\nthe training of LVLMs, so that they can generate more precise responses without\nencounter hallucination. On one hand, we generate image-text pairs with\ndetailed relationship annotations in panoptic scene graph dataset (PSG). These\nconversations pay more attention on detailed facts in the image, encouraging\nthe model to answer questions based on multi-modal contexts. On the other hand,\nwe integrate SAM and mask prediction loss as auxiliary supervision, forcing the\nLVLMs to have the capacity to identify context-related objects, so that they\ncan generate more accurate responses, mitigating hallucination. Moreover, to\nprovide a deeper evaluation on the hallucination in LVLMs, we propose a new\nbenchmark, RAH-Bench. It divides vision hallucination into three different\ntypes that contradicts the image with wrong categories, attributes or\nrelations, and introduces False Positive Rate as detailed sub-metric for each\ntype. In this benchmark, our approach demonstrates an +8.4% enhancement\ncompared to original LLaVA and achieves widespread performance improvements\nacross other models.",

Traditional traffic prediction methods rely only\non historical traffic data to predict traffic trends and face two main\nchallenges. 1) insensitivity to unusual events. 2) poor performance in\nlong-term prediction. In this work, we explore how generative models combined\nwith text describing the traffic system can be applied for traffic generation\nand name the task Text-to-Traffic Generation (TTG). The key challenge of the\nTTG task is how to associate text with the spatial structure of the road\nnetwork and traffic data for generating traffic situations. To this end, we\npropose ChatTraffic, the first diffusion model for text-to-traffic generation.\nTo guarantee the consistency between synthetic and real data, we augment a\ndiffusion model with the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract spatial\ncorrelations of traffic data. In addition, we construct a large dataset\ncontaining text-traffic pairs for the TTG task. We benchmarked our model\nqualitatively and quantitatively on the released dataset.

            "summary": "Computer-aided diagnosis of skin diseases is an important tool. However, the\ninterpretability of computer-aided diagnosis is currently poor. Dermatologists\nand patients cannot intuitively understand the learning and prediction process\nof neural networks, which will lead to a decrease in the credibility of\ncomputer-aided diagnosis. In addition, traditional methods need to be trained\nusing negative samples in order to predict the presence or absence of a lesion,\nbut medical data is often in short supply. In this paper, we propose a multiple\nhigh-order attention interaction model (MHA-UNet) for use in a highly\nexplainable skin lesion segmentation task. MHA-UNet is able to obtain the\npresence or absence of a lesion by explainable reasoning without the need for\ntraining on negative samples. Specifically, we propose a high-order attention\ninteraction mechanism that introduces squeeze attention to a higher level for\nfeature attention. In addition, a multiple high-order attention interaction\n(MHAblock) module is proposed by combining the different features of different\norders. For classifying the presence or absence of lesions, we conducted\nclassification experiments on several publicly available datasets in the\nabsence of negative samples, based on explainable reasoning about the\ninteraction of 5 attention orders of MHAblock. The highest positive detection\nrate obtained from the experiments was 81.0% and the highest negative detection\nrate was 83.5%. For segmentation experiments, comparison experiments of the\nproposed method with 13 medical segmentation models and external validation\nexperiments with 8 state-of-the-art models in three public datasets and our\nclinical dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our model.

            "summary": "A key challenge in space weather forecasting is accurately predicting the\nmagnetic field topology of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs),\nspecifically the north-south magnetic field component (Bz) for Earth-directed\nCMEs. Heliospheric MHD models typically use spheromaks to represent the\nmagnetic structure of CMEs. However, when inserted into the ambient\ninterplanetary magnetic field, spheromaks can experience a phenomenon\nreminiscent of the condition known as the \"spheromak tilting instability\",\ncausing its magnetic axis to rotate. From the perspective of space weather\nforecasting, it is crucial to understand the effect of this rotation on\npredicting Bz at 1 au while implementing the spheromak model for realistic\nevent studies. In this work, we study this by modelling a CME event on 2013\nApril 11 using the \"EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset\"\n(EUHFORIA). Our results show that a significant spheromak rotation up to 90\ndegrees has occurred by the time it reaches 1 au, while the majority of this\nrotation occurs below 0.3 au. This total rotation resulted in poor predicted\nmagnetic field topology of the ICME at 1 au. To address this issue, we further\ninvestigated the influence of spheromak density on mitigating rotation. The\nresults show that the spheromak rotation is less for higher densities.\nImportantly, we observe a substantial reduction in the uncertainties associated\nwith predicting Bz when there is minimal spheromak rotation. Therefore, we\nconclude that spheromak rotation adversely affects Bz prediction in the\nanalyzed event, emphasizing the need for caution when employing spheromaks in\nglobal MHD models for space weather forecasting.",

In\nsuch cases, fine tuning could reduce the efforts (up to two order of magnitude)\nto train a model with limited dataset and knowledge and still show a good\nagreement on the mean velocity profile.

Previous works tackle the problem\nby using adversarial training or self-supervised learning for feature extractor\nadaptation, but ensuring that features extracted from the target domain can be\ndistinguished by the source-supervised classifier remains challenging. In this\nwork, we propose a novel approach called progressive target-styled feature\naugmentation (PTSFA). Unlike previous works that focus on feature extractor\nadaptation, our PTSFA approach focuses on classifier adaptation. It aims to\nempower the classifier to recognize target-styled source features and\nprogressively adapt to the target domain. To enhance the reliability of\npredictions within the PTSFA framework and encourage discriminative feature\nextraction, we further introduce a new intermediate domain approaching (IDA)\nstrategy. We validate our method on the benchmark datasets, where our method\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/xiaoyao3302/PTSFA.",

            "summary": "Light field (LF) image super-resolution (SR) is a challenging problem due to\nits inherent ill-posed nature, where a single low-resolution (LR) input LF\nimage can correspond to multiple potential super-resolved outcomes. Despite\nthis complexity, mainstream LF image SR methods typically adopt a deterministic\napproach, generating only a single output supervised by pixel-wise loss\nfunctions. This tendency often results in blurry and unrealistic results.\nAlthough diffusion models can capture the distribution of potential SR results\nby iteratively predicting Gaussian noise during the denoising process, they are\nprimarily designed for general images and struggle to effectively handle the\nunique characteristics and information present in LF images. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce LFSRDiff, the first diffusion-based LF image SR\nmodel, by incorporating the LF disentanglement mechanism. Our novel\ncontribution includes the introduction of a disentangled U-Net for diffusion\nmodels, enabling more effective extraction and fusion of both spatial and\nangular information within LF images. Through comprehensive experimental\nevaluations and comparisons with the state-of-the-art LF image SR methods, the\nproposed approach consistently produces diverse and realistic SR results. It\nachieves the highest perceptual metric in terms of LPIPS. It also demonstrates\nthe ability to effectively control the trade-off between perception and\ndistortion.

Once BH+He star systems become UCXBs through mass transfer, they\nwould emit X-ray luminosities of $\\sim10^{38}~\\rm erg\\, s^{-1}$, making them\nideal multimessenger objects. If the initial He-star masses are $\\geq 0.7\nM_{\\odot}$, those systems are likely to experience two Roche lobe overflows,\nand the X-ray luminosity can reach a maximum of $3.5\\times 10^{39}~\\rm erg\\,\ns^{-1}$ in the second mass-transfer stage. The initial He-star masses and\ninitial orbital periods of progenitors of Galactic BH UCXB-LISA sources are in\nthe range of 0.32-2.9 $M_{\\odot}$ and 0.02-0.19 days, respectively. Nearly all\nBH+He star binaries in the above parameter space can evolve into GW sources\nwhose chirp masses can be accurately measured.

While the materials science community achieved much progress\nin developing property models that predict well on average with respect to the\ntraining distribution, this form of in-distribution performance measurement is\nnot directly coupled with the discovery reward. This is because an iterative\ndiscovery process has a shifting reward distribution that is\nover-proportionally determined by the model performance for exceptional\nmaterials. We demonstrate this problem using the example of bulk modulus\nmaximization among double perovskite oxides. We find that the in-distribution\npredictive performance suggests random forests as superior to Gaussian process\nregression, while the results are inverse in terms of the discovery rewards. We\nargue that the lack of proper performance estimation methods from pre-computed\ndata collections is a fundamental problem for improving data-driven materials\ndiscovery, and we propose a novel such estimator that, in contrast to na\\\"ive\nreward estimation, successfully predicts Gaussian processes with the \"expected\nimprovement\" acquisition function as the best out of four options in our\ndemonstrational study for double perovskites.

Moreover, the problem of distribution shift is\noften encountered in real clinical data, which may lead to a decline in the\nmodel prediction performance and reduce the reliability of the model's\napplication. In this paper, we propose a framework named Out-of-Distribution\nGeneralized Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Human Albumin Prediction\n(DyG-HAP), which is able to provide accurate albumin predictions for Intensity\nCare Unit (ICU) patients during hospitalization. We first model human albumin\nprediction as a dynamic graph regression problem to model the dynamics and\npatient relationship. Then, we propose a disentangled dynamic graph attention\nmechanism to capture and disentangle the patterns whose relationship to labels\nunder distribution shifts is invariant and variant respectively. Last, we\npropose an invariant dynamic graph regression method to encourage the model to\nrely on invariant patterns to make predictions.

            "summary": "Whole slide images are the foundation of digital pathology for the diagnosis\nand treatment of carcinomas. Writing pathology reports is laborious and\nerror-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve\nclinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given\nwhole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset\n(TCGA-PathoText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text\npairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports\nwhich narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the\nmultiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports\nfor gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of\nTCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology\nreports which contain multiple clinical clues. Furthermore, WSI-text prediction\ncan be seen as an approach of visual-language pre-training, which enables our\nmodel to be transferred to downstream diagnostic tasks like carcinoma grading\nand phenotyping. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology\nreports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping\nwithout adding extra parameters or tricky fine-tuning. Our collected dataset\nand related code will all be publicly available.",

Most existing methods\nexplore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models, in which the key is to\nadopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper,\nwe propose a simple encoder-decoder, named SED, for open-vocabulary semantic\nsegmentation, which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation\nand a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical\nencoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone, instead of\nplain transformer, to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to\nplain transformer, hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial\ninformation and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size.\nOur gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and\nthe feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate\ninference speed, we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder\nthat rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder,\nresulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation.\nExperiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation\ndatasets, which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using\nConvNeXt-B, our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6\\% on ADE20K with 150\ncategories at 82 millisecond ($ms$) per image on a single A6000.

In this paper, assuming that the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI)\ncontains a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a massive exotic compact\nobject (ECO) with a reflective surface, we compute the GWs from the generic\nEMRI orbits. Using the accurate and analytic flux formulas in the black hole\nspacetime, we adapted these formulas in the vicinity of the ECO surface by\nincorporating a reflectivity parameter. Under the adiabatic approximation, we\ncan evolve the orbital parameters and compute the EMRI waveforms. The effect of\ntidal heating for the spinning and non-spinning objects can be used to\nconstrain the reflectivity of the surface at the level of O(10^-4) by computing\nthe mismatch and Fisher information matrix.",

            "summary": "Image-to-image translation (I2I), and particularly its subfield of appearance\ntransfer, which seeks to alter the visual appearance between images while\nmaintaining structural coherence, presents formidable challenges. Despite\nsignificant advancements brought by diffusion models, achieving fine-grained\ntransfer remains complex, particularly in terms of retaining detailed\nstructural elements and ensuring information fidelity. This paper proposes an\ninnovative framework designed to surmount these challenges by integrating\nvarious aspects of semantic matching, appearance transfer, and latent\ndeviation. A pivotal aspect of our approach is the strategic use of the\npredicted $x_0$ space by diffusion models within the latent space of diffusion\nprocesses. This is identified as a crucial element for the precise and natural\ntransfer of fine-grained details. Our framework exploits this space to\naccomplish semantic alignment between source and target images, facilitating\nmask-wise appearance transfer for improved feature acquisition. A significant\nadvancement of our method is the seamless integration of these features into\nthe latent space, enabling more nuanced latent deviations without necessitating\nextensive model retraining or fine-tuning. The effectiveness of our approach is\ndemonstrated through extensive experiments, which showcase its ability to\nadeptly handle fine-grained appearance transfers across a wide range of\ncategories and domains.

To improve the utilization of wind power, this study\nproposes a new wind speed prediction model based on data noise reduction\ntechnology, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and gated recurrent unit\n(GRU). Firstly, an adaptive data noise reduction algorithm P-SSA is proposed\nbased on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and Pearson correlation coefficient.\nThe original wind speed is decomposed into multiple subsequences by SSA and\nthen reconstructed. When the Pearson correlation coefficient between the\nreconstructed sequence and the original sequence is greater than 0.99, other\nnoise subsequences are deleted to complete the data denoising. Then, the\nreceptive field of the samples is expanded through the causal convolution and\ndilated convolution of TCN, and the characteristics of wind speed change are\nextracted. Then, the time feature information of the sequence is extracted by\nGRU, and then the wind speed is predicted to form the wind speed sequence\nprediction model of P-SSA-TCN-GRU. The proposed model was validated on three\nwind farms in Shandong Province. The experimental results show that the\nprediction performance of the proposed model is better than that of the\ntraditional model and other models based on TCN, and the wind speed prediction\nof wind farms with high precision and strong stability is realized. The wind\nspeed predictions of this model have the potential to become the data that\nsupport the operation and management of wind farms. The code is available at\nlink.",

Recent\nwork utilizes pedestrian character information, \\textit{i.e.}, action and\nappearance, to improve the learned trajectory embedding and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. However, it neglects the invalid and negative\npedestrian character information, which is harmful to trajectory representation\nand thus leads to performance degradation. To address this issue, we present a\ntwo-stream sparse-character-based network~(TSNet) for pedestrian trajectory\nprediction. Specifically, TSNet learns the negative-removed characters in the\nsparse character representation stream to improve the trajectory embedding\nobtained in the trajectory representation stream. Moreover, to model the\nnegative-removed characters, we propose a novel sparse character graph,\nincluding the sparse category and sparse temporal character graphs, to learn\nthe different effects of various characters in category and temporal\ndimensions, respectively. Extensive experiments on two first-person view\ndatasets, PIE and JAAD, show that our method outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate different\neffects of various characters and prove that TSNet outperforms approaches\nwithout eliminating negative characters.",

            "summary": "The diversity of expressed genes plays a critical role in cellular\nspecialization, adaptation to environmental changes, and overall cell\nfunctionality. This diversity varies dramatically across cell types and is\norchestrated by intricate, dynamic, and cell type-specific gene regulatory\nnetworks (GRNs). Despite extensive research on GRNs, their governing\nprinciples, as well as the underlying forces that have shaped them, remain\nlargely unknown. Here, we investigated whether there is a tradeoff between the\ndiversity of expressed genes and the intensity of GRN interactions. We have\ndeveloped a computational framework that evaluates GRN interaction intensity\nfrom scRNA-seq data and used it to analyze simulated and real scRNA-seq data\ncollected from different tissues in humans, mice, fruit flies, and C. elegans.\nWe find a significant tradeoff between diversity and interaction intensity,\ndriven by stability constraints, where the GRN could be stable up to a critical\nlevel of complexity - a product of gene expression diversity and interaction\nintensity. Furthermore, we analyzed hematopoietic stem cell differentiation\ndata and find that the overall complexity of unstable transition states cells\nis higher than that of stem cells and fully differentiated cells. Our results\nsuggest that GRNs are shaped by stability constraints which limit the diversity\nof gene expression.",

            "summary": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, which aims to estimate the probability\nof a user clicking on an item, is a key task in online advertising. Numerous\nexisting CTR models concentrate on modeling the feature interactions within a\nsolitary domain, thereby rendering them inadequate for fulfilling the\nrequisites of multi-domain recommendations in real industrial scenarios. Some\nrecent approaches propose intricate architectures to enhance knowledge sharing\nand augment model training across multiple domains. However, these approaches\nencounter difficulties when being transferred to new recommendation domains,\nowing to their reliance on the modeling of ID features (e.g., item id). To\naddress the above issue, we propose the Universal Feature Interaction Network\n(UFIN) approach for CTR prediction. UFIN exploits textual data to learn\nuniversal feature interactions that can be effectively transferred across\ndiverse domains. For learning universal feature representations, we regard the\ntext and feature as two different modalities and propose an encoder-decoder\nnetwork founded on a Large Language Model (LLM) to enforce the transfer of data\nfrom the text modality to the feature modality. Building upon the above\nfoundation, we further develop a mixtureof-experts (MoE) enhanced adaptive\nfeature interaction model to learn transferable collaborative patterns across\nmultiple domains. Furthermore, we propose a multi-domain knowledge distillation\nframework to enhance feature interaction learning. Based on the above methods,\nUFIN can effectively bridge the semantic gap to learn common knowledge across\nvarious domains, surpassing the constraints of ID-based models. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on eight datasets show the effectiveness of UFIN, in both\nmultidomain and cross-platform settings. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/RUCAIBox/UFIN.",

Inspired\nby recent advances in powerful large language models, we adopt a sequence-based\napproach to autoregressively generate triangle meshes as sequences of\ntriangles. We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings, using\ngraph convolutions, which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry\nand topology. These embeddings are sequenced and decoded into triangles by a\ndecoder, ensuring that they can effectively reconstruct the mesh. A transformer\nis then trained on this learned vocabulary to predict the index of the next\nembedding given previous embeddings. Once trained, our model can be\nautoregressively sampled to generate new triangle meshes, directly generating\ncompact meshes with sharp edges, more closely imitating the efficient\ntriangulation patterns of human-crafted meshes. MeshGPT demonstrates a notable\nimprovement over state of the art mesh generation methods, with a 9% increase\nin shape coverage and a 30-point enhancement in FID scores across various\ncategories.",

Here, we\nrevisit quantum thermal machines operating with the quasi-static Carnot cycle\nand aim to unveil the role of strong coupling in maximum efficiency. Our\nanalysis builds upon definitions of excess work and heat derived from an exact\nformulation of the first law of thermodynamics for the working substance, which\ncaptures the non-Gibbsian thermal equilibrium state that emerges at strong\ncouplings during quasi-static isothermal processes. These excess definitions\ndiffer from conventional ones by an energetic cost for maintaining the\nnon-Gibbsian characteristics. With this distinction, we point out that one can\nintroduce two different yet thermodynamically allowed definitions for\nefficiency of both the heat engine and refrigerator modes. We dub them inside\nand outside definitions which differ in the way of defining the gain for the\nthermal machines at strong couplings by either just analyzing the energetics of\nthe working substance or instead evaluating the performance from an external\nsystem upon which the thermal machine acts, respectively. We analytically\ndemonstrate that the inside definition predicts that the Carnot limit remains\nthe upper bound for both operation modes at strong couplings, whereas the\noutside one reveals that strong coupling can suppress the maximum efficiency\nrendering the Carnot limit unattainable. These seemingly incompatible\npredictions thus indicate that it is imperative to first gauge the definition\nfor efficiency before elucidating the exact role of strong coupling, thereby\nshedding light on the on-going investigation on strong-coupling quantum thermal\nmachines.",

If a chain of\nbubbles is produced faster than it is able to rise, the dominance of viscous\ndrag over buoyancy results in a compressive stress that is alleviated by\nbuckling the bubble chain.

We present a new conditional diffusion framework called\nFLAIR for FVR. FLAIR ensures temporal consistency across frames in a\ncomputationally efficient fashion by converting a traditional image DPM into a\nvideo DPM. The proposed conversion uses a recurrent video refinement layer and\na temporal self-attention at different scales. FLAIR also uses a conditional\niterative refinement process to balance the perceptual and distortion quality\nduring inference. This process consists of two key components: a\ndata-consistency module that analytically ensures that the generated video\nprecisely matches its degraded observation and a coarse-to-fine image\nenhancement module specifically for facial regions. Our extensive experiments\nshow superiority of FLAIR over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) for video\nsuper-resolution, deblurring, JPEG restoration, and space-time frame\ninterpolation on two high-quality face video datasets.",

When diverse loads are connected in the distribution\nsystem, their interactions complicate establishing analytical models for the\nrelationship between harmonic voltages and currents. To solve this, our paper\npresents a data-driven model using MCReSANet to construct the highly nonlinear\nbetween harmonic voltage and current. Two datasets from PCCs in Finland and\nGermany are utilized, which demonstrates that MCReSANet is capable of\nestablishing accurate nonlinear mappings, even in the presence of various\nnetwork characteristics for selected Finland and Germany datasets. The model\nbuilt by MCReSANet can improve the MAE by 10% and 14% compared to the CNN, and\nby 8% and 17% compared to the MLP for both Finnish and German datasets, also\nshowing much lower model uncertainty than others. This is a crucial\nprerequisite for more precise SHAP value-based feature importance analysis,\nwhich is a method for the model interpretability analysis in this paper. The\nresults by feature importance analysis show the detailed relationships between\neach order of harmonic voltage and current in the distribution system. There is\nan interactive impact on each order of harmonic current, but some orders of\nharmonic voltages have a dominant influence on harmonic current emissions:\npositive sequence and zero sequence harmonics have the dominant importance in\nthe Finnish and German networks, respectively, which conforms to the pattern of\nconnected load types in two selected Finnish and German datasets.

            "summary": "Equilibrium problems in Bayesian auction games can be described as systems of\ndifferential equations. Depending on the model assumptions, these equations\nmight be such that we do not have a rigorous mathematical solution theory. The\nlack of analytical or numerical techniques with guaranteed convergence for the\nequilibrium problem has plagued the field and limited equilibrium analysis to\nrather simple auction models such as single-object auctions. Recent advances in\nequilibrium learning led to algorithms that find equilibrium under a wide\nvariety of model assumptions. We analyze first- and second-price auctions where\nsimple learning algorithms converge to an equilibrium. The equilibrium problem\nin auctions is equivalent to solving an infinite-dimensional variational\ninequality (VI). Monotonicity and the Minty condition are the central\nsufficient conditions for learning algorithms to converge to an equilibrium in\nsuch VIs. We show that neither monotonicity nor pseudo- or quasi-monotonicity\nholds for the respective VIs. The second-price auction's equilibrium is a\nMinty-type solution, but the first-price auction is not. However, the\nBayes--Nash equilibrium is the unique solution to the VI within the class of\nuniformly increasing bid functions, which ensures that gradient-based\nalgorithms attain the {equilibrium} in case of convergence, as also observed in\nnumerical experiments.",

            "summary": "The Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) theory rests on the basic hypothesis that\nthe macroscopic empty space is scale invariant. This hypothesis is applied in\nthe context of the Integrable Weyl Geometry, where it leads to considerable\nsimplifications in the scale covariant cosmological equations. After an initial\nexplosion and a phase of braking, the cosmological models show a continuous\nacceleration of the expansion. Several observational tests of the SIV cosmology\nare performed: on the relation between $H_0$ and the age of the Universe, on\nthe $m-z$ diagram for SNIa data and its extension to $z=7$ with quasars and\nGRBs, and on the $H(z)$ vs. $z$ relation. All comparisons show a very good\nagreement between SIV predictions and observations. Predictions for the future\nobservations of the redshift drifts are also given. In the weak field\napproximation, the equation of motion contains, in addition to the classical\nNewtonian term, an acceleration term (usually very small) depending on the\nvelocity. The two-body problem is studied, showing a slow expansion of the\nclassical conics. The new equation has been applied to clusters of galaxies, to\nrotating galaxies (some proximities with Modifies Newtonian Dynamics, MOND, are\nnoticed), to the velocity dispersion vs. the age of the stars in the Milky Way,\nand to the growth of the density fluctuations in the Universe. We point out the\nsimilarity of the mechanical effects of the SIV hypothesis in cosmology and in\nthe Newtonian approximation. In both cases, it results in an additional\nacceleration in the direction of motions. In cosmology, these effects are\ncurrently interpreted in terms of the dark energy hypothesis, while in the\nNewtonian approximation they are accounted for in terms of the dark matter (DM)\nhypothesis. These hypotheses appear no longer necessary in the SIV context.",

            "summary": "A novel cold neutron source employing chess-board or staircase assemblies of\nhigh-aspect ratio rectangular \\hpara moderators is proposed. It is demonstrated\nthat this design can generate neutron beams with higher intensity and\nbrightness, up to approximately 2.5 times more than any \\hpara-based cold\nneutron source with an equal cold neutron beam cross-section made of a single\nmoderator (flat or voluminous). Two limiting factors for this gain are\nidentified: the limited volume of the high-density thermal neutron region\nsurrounding the reactor core or spallation target, which imposes constraints on\nthe total length of the moderator assembly, and the finite width of moderator\nwalls.\n  An analytic approach for calculating the brightness of \\hpara moderators is\nintroduced. Because brightness gain originates from a near-the-surface effect\nresulting from the prevailing single collision process during thermal-to-cold\nneutron conversion, high-aspect ratio rectangular cold moderators offer a\nsignificant increase, up to a factor of 10, in cold neutron brightness. The\nobtained results are in excellent agreement with MCNP calculations.\n  The concept of 'low-dimensionality' in moderators is explored, demonstrating\nthat achieving a substantial increase in brightness necessitates moderators to\nbe low-dimensional both geometrically, implying a high aspect ratio, and\nphysically, requiring the moderator's smallest dimension to be smaller than the\ncharacteristic scale of moderator medium (about the mean free path for thermal\nneutrons). This explains why additional compression of the moderator along the\nlongest direction, effectively giving it a tube-like shape, does not result in\na significant brightness increase comparable to the flattening of moderator.",

In\nthis article, we present a new technique to generate model perturbations. The\ntechnique is termed Additive Model-uncertainty perturbations scaled by Physical\nTendencies (AMPT). The generated perturbations are independent between\ndifferent model variables and scaled by the local-area-averaged modulus of\nphysical tendency. The previously developed Stochastic Pattern Generator is\nused to generate space and time-correlated pseudo-random fields. AMPT attempts\nto address some weak points of the popular model perturbation scheme known as\nStochastically Perturbed Parametrization Tendencies (SPPT). Specifically, AMPT\ncan produce non-zero perturbations even at grid points where the physical\ntendency is zero and avoids perfect correlations in the perturbation fields in\nthe vertical and between different variables. Due to a non-local link from\nphysical tendency to the local perturbation magnitude, AMPT can generate\nsignificantly greater perturbations than SPPT without causing instabilities.\nRelationships between biases and spreads caused by AMPT and SPPT were studied\nin an ensemble of forecasts. The non-hydrostatic, convection-permitting\nforecast model COSMO was used. In ensemble prediction experiments, AMPT\nperturbations led to statistically significant improvements (compared to SPPT)\nin probabilistic performance scores such as spread-skill relationship, CRPS,\nBrier Score, and ROC area for near-surface temperature. AMPT had similar but\nweaker effects on near-surface wind speed and mixed effects on precipitation.",

Instead of\ncorrelating loss with membership, as is traditionally done, we have leveraged\nthe fact that training examples generally exhibit higher confidence values when\nclassified into their actual class. During training, the model is essentially\nbeing 'fit' to the training data and might face particular difficulties in\ngeneralization to unseen data. This asymmetry leads to the model achieving\nhigher confidence on the training data as it exploits the specific patterns and\nnoise present in the training data. Our proposed approach leverages the\nconfidence values generated by the machine learning model. These confidence\nvalues provide a probabilistic measure of the model's certainty in its\npredictions and can further be used to infer the membership of a given data\npoint.

To reduce labeling requirement, the \"pre-train,\nprompt\" paradigms have become increasingly common. However, existing study of\nprompting on graphs is limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to\ndifferent downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel\npre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies\npre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template but also employs\na learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant\nknowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. To further\nenhance GraphPrompt in these two stages, we extend it into GraphPrompt+ with\ntwo major enhancements. First, we generalize several popular graph pre-training\ntasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with our task\ntemplate. Second, we propose a more generalized prompt design that incorporates\na series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder,\nin order to capitalize on the hierarchical information across different layers\nbeyond just the readout layer. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on\nfive public datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt and GraphPrompt+.",

            "summary": "Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training, known as CLIP, has shown promising\neffectiveness in addressing downstream image recognition tasks. However, recent\nworks revealed that the CLIP model can be implanted with a downstream-oriented\nbackdoor. On downstream tasks, one victim model performs well on clean samples\nbut predicts a specific target class whenever a specific trigger is present.\nFor injecting a backdoor, existing attacks depend on a large amount of\nadditional data to maliciously fine-tune the entire pre-trained CLIP model,\nwhich makes them inapplicable to data-limited scenarios. In this work,\nmotivated by the recent success of learnable prompts, we address this problem\nby injecting a backdoor into the CLIP model in the prompt learning stage. Our\nmethod named BadCLIP is built on a novel and effective mechanism in backdoor\nattacks on CLIP, i.e., influencing both the image and text encoders with the\ntrigger. It consists of a learnable trigger applied to images and a\ntrigger-aware context generator, such that the trigger can change text features\nvia trigger-aware prompts, resulting in a powerful and generalizable attack.\nExtensive experiments conducted on 11 datasets verify that the clean accuracy\nof BadCLIP is similar to those of advanced prompt learning methods and the\nattack success rate is higher than 99% in most cases. BadCLIP is also\ngeneralizable to unseen classes, and shows a strong generalization capability\nunder cross-dataset and cross-domain settings.",

However, this comes at the cost of an increased optical loss rate.\nTherefore, microcavity-based optomechanical systems are placed in the\nunresolved-sideband regime, preventing sideband-based ground-state cooling. A\npathway to reduce optical loss in such systems is to engineer the cavity\nmirrors, i.e., the optical modes that interact with the mechanical resonator.\nIn our work, we analyze such an optomechanical system, whereby one of the\nmirrors is strongly frequency-dependent, i.e., a suspended Fano mirror. This\noptomechanical system consists of two optical modes that couple to the motion\nof the suspended Fano mirror. We formulate a quantum-coupled-mode description\nthat includes both the standard dispersive optomechanical coupling as well as\ndissipative coupling. We solve the Langevin equations of the system dynamics in\nthe linear regime showing that ground-state cooling from room temperature can\nbe achieved even if the cavity is per se not in the resolved-sideband regime,\nbut achieves effective sideband resolution through strong optical mode\ncoupling. Importantly, we find that the cavity output spectrum needs to be\nproperly analyzed with respect to the effective laser detuning to infer the\nphonon occupation of the mechanical resonator.

Yet, stringent data protection laws prohibit the\ndirect exchange of raw data. To facilitate data collaboration, federated\nLearning (FL) emerges as a viable solution, which enables multiple clients to\ncollaboratively train a machine learning (ML) model under the supervision of a\ncentral server while ensuring the confidentiality of their raw data. However,\nexisting studies have unveiled two main risks: (i) the potential for the server\nto infer sensitive information from the client's uploaded updates (i.e., model\ngradients), compromising client input privacy, and (ii) the risk of malicious\nclients uploading malformed updates to poison the FL model, compromising input\nintegrity. Recent works utilize secure aggregation with zero-knowledge proofs\n(ZKP) to guarantee input privacy and integrity in FL. Nevertheless, they suffer\nfrom extremely low efficiency and, thus, are impractical for real deployment.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel and highly efficient solution RiseFL for\nsecure and verifiable data collaboration, ensuring input privacy and integrity\nsimultaneously.Firstly, we devise a probabilistic integrity check method that\nsignificantly reduces the cost of ZKP generation and verification. Secondly, we\ndesign a hybrid commitment scheme to satisfy Byzantine robustness with improved\nperformance. Thirdly, we theoretically prove the security guarantee of the\nproposed solution. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets\nsuggest that our solution is effective and is highly efficient in both client\ncomputation and communication. For instance, RiseFL is up to 28x, 53x and 164x\nfaster than three state-of-the-art baselines ACORN, RoFL and EIFFeL for the\nclient computation.",

In particular, we investigate the\nimpact of angular momentum, dynamical friction and triaxial collapse on the\npredicted mass functions for UDMHs. We perform the calculations for four\nprimordial power spectra with different amplified features that allow for (PBH\nand) UDHM formation in a wide mass range.

Comparison of the results with the current observational bounds\non PBHs also implies that the UDMHs are expected to significantly outnumber\nPBHs in broad mass intervals, with the details depending on the primordial\npower spectrum.",

We propose a novel method for efficient detection of eye diseases from\nOCT images. Our technique enables the classification of patients into disease\nfree (normal eyes) or affected by specific conditions such as Choroidal\nNeovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), or Drusen. In this\nwork, we introduce an end to end web application that utilizes machine learning\nand deep learning techniques for efficient eye disease prediction. The\napplication allows patients to submit their raw OCT scanned images, which\nundergo segmentation using a trained custom UNet model. The segmented images\nare then fed into an ensemble model, comprising InceptionV3 and Xception\nnetworks, enhanced with a self attention layer. This self attention approach\nleverages the feature maps of individual models to achieve improved\nclassification accuracy. The ensemble model's output is aggregated to predict\nand classify various eye diseases. Extensive experimentation and optimization\nhave been conducted to ensure the application's efficiency and optimal\nperformance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nin accurate eye disease prediction. The developed web application holds\nsignificant potential for early detection and timely intervention, thereby\ncontributing to improved eye healthcare outcomes.",

As this may lead to wider\nsocietal issues, we argue that understanding how partisan news sharing impacts\nusers' communication is crucial for better governance of online communities. In\nthis paper, we perform a measurement study of partisan news sharing. We aim to\ncharacterize the role of such sharing in influencing users' communications. Our\nanalysis covers an eight-month dataset across six Reddit communities related to\nthe Russian invasion. We first perform an analysis of the temporal evolution of\npartisan news sharing. We confirm that the invasion stimulates discussion in\nthe observed communities, accompanied by an increased volume of partisan news\nsharing. Next, we characterize users' response to such sharing. We observe that\npartisan bias plays a role in narrowing its propagation. More biased media is\nless likely to be spread across multiple subreddits. However, we find that\npartisan news sharing attracts more users to engage in the discussion, by\ngenerating more comments. We then built a predictive model to identify users\nlikely to spread partisan news. The prediction is challenging though, with\n61.57% accuracy on average. Our centrality analysis on the commenting network\nfurther indicates that the users who disseminate partisan news possess lower\nnetwork influence in comparison to those who propagate neutral news.",

FNO seems to enjoy an edge in popularity due to its ease of use,\nespecially with high dimensional data. However, a lesser-acknowledged feature\nof DeepONet is its modularity. This feature allows the user the flexibility of\nchoosing the kind of neural network to be used in the trunk and/or branch of\nthe DeepONet. This is beneficial because it has been shown many times that\ndifferent types of problems require different kinds of network architectures\nfor effective learning. In this work, we will take advantage of this feature by\ncarefully designing a more efficient neural operator based on the DeepONet\narchitecture. We introduce U-Net enhanced DeepONet (U-DeepONet) for learning\nthe solution operator of highly complex CO2-water two-phase flow in\nheterogeneous porous media. The U-DeepONet is more accurate in predicting gas\nsaturation and pressure buildup than the state-of-the-art U-Net based Fourier\nNeural Operator (U-FNO) and the Fourier-enhanced Multiple-Input Operator\n(Fourier-MIONet) trained on the same dataset. In addition, the proposed\nU-DeepONet is significantly more efficient in training times than both the\nU-FNO (more than 18 times faster) and the Fourier-MIONet (more than 5 times\nfaster), while consuming less computational resources. We also show that the\nU-DeepONet is more data efficient and better at generalization than both the\nU-FNO and the Fourier-MIONet.",

In contrast, the two-dimensional (2D)\nsuperconductor is predicted to turn fragile and resistive away from the limit I\n-> 0, B -> 0, in the pinning-free regime. It is intriguing to note that the\nvery vortices responsible for achieving superconductivity by pairing,\ncondensation, and, thereby reducing the classical dissipation, render the state\nresistive driven by quantum fluctuations in the T -> 0. While cleaner systems\nare being explored for technological improvements, the 2D superconductor\nturning resistive when influenced by weak electric and magnetic fields has\nprofound consequences for quantum technologies. A metallic ground state in 2D\nis beyond the consensus of both Bosonic and Fermionic systems, and its origin\nand nature warrant a comprehensive theoretical understanding supplemented by\nin-depth experiments. A real-time observation of the influence of vortex\ndynamics on transport properties so far has been elusive. We explore the nature\nand fate of a low-viscous, clean, 2D superconducting state formed on an\nionic-liquid gated few-layered MoS$_2$ sample. The vortex-core being\ndissipative, the elastic depinning, intervortex interaction, and the subsequent\ndynamics of the vortex-lattice cause the system to behave like an overdamped\nharmonic oscillator, leaving transient signatures in the transport\ncharacteristics. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transient\nnature and the noise characteristics of the magnetoresistance confirm that\nquantum fluctuations are solely responsible for the Bose metal state and the\nfragility of the superconducting state.",

The radiative\ncouplings $g_{D^*D\\gamma}$ encoding nonperturbative QCD effects are calculated\nin the framework of the covariant confined quark model developed by us.

The\ncouplings (in $\\textrm{GeV}^{-1}$) $|g_{D^{*+}D^+\\gamma}| = 0.45(9)$ and\n$|g_{D^{*0}D^0\\gamma}| = 1.72(34)$ calculated in our model agree with the\nexperimental data $|g_{D^{*+}D^+\\gamma}|=0.47(7)$ and\n$|g_{D^{*0}D^0\\gamma}|=1.77(16)$. The most interesting case is the decay\n$D^*_s\\to D_s\\gamma$, for which the recent prediction based on light-cone sum\nrules at next-to-leading order $|g_{D^*_s D_s\\gamma}|=0.60(19)$ deviates from\nthe first (and so far the only) lattice QCD result $|g_{D^*_s\nD_s\\gamma}|=0.11(2)$ at nearly $3\\sigma$. Our calculation yields $|g_{D^*_s\nD_s\\gamma}|=0.29(6)$, which falls somehow between the two mentioned results,\nbut is larger than those predicted in other studies using quark models or QCD\nsum rules.",

In this study, we delve into the\nthermodynamic response and collective excitations of both IQAH and FQAH states\nwithin the paradigmatic correlated flat band model on the checkerboard lattice.\nOur key findings include: i) In both $\\nu = 1$ IQAH and $\\nu = 1/3$ FQAH\nstates, it is the charge-neutral collective excitations that determine the\nonset temperature of these topological states, a value significantly smaller\nthan the charge gap, aligning with recent experimental observations; ii) The\nlowest collective excitations manifest as the zero-momentum excitons in the\nIQAH state, whereas in the FQAH state, they take the form of magneto-rotons\nwith finite momentum; iii) The excitons and rotons exhibit distinct\nexperimental signatures, which we propose to detect in future experiments.",

However, the complexity of human behavior\nand the diverse contexts in which these interactions occur make it challenging.\nIntuitively, human-centric visual cues, such as the involved participants, the\nbody language, and the surrounding environment, play crucial roles in shaping\nthese interactions. These cues are particularly vital in interpreting unseen\ninteractions. In this paper, we propose three prompts with VLM to generate\nhuman-centric visual cues within an image from multiple perspectives of humans.\nTo capitalize on these rich Human-Centric Visual Cues, we propose a novel\napproach named HCVC for HOI detection. Particularly, we develop a\ntransformer-based multimodal fusion module with multitower architecture to\nintegrate visual cue features into the instance and interaction decoders. Our\nextensive experiments and analysis validate the efficacy of leveraging the\ngenerated human-centric visual cues for HOI detection.

            "summary": "Machine learning has great potential for efficient reconstruction and\nprediction of flow fields. However, existing datasets may have highly\ndiversified labels for different flow scenarios, which are not applicable for\ntraining a model. To this end, we make a first attempt to apply the\nself-supervised learning (SSL) technique to fluid dynamics, which disregards\ndata labels for pre-training the model. The SSL technique embraces a large\namount of data ($8000$ snapshots) at Reynolds numbers of $Re=200$, $300$,\n$400$, $500$ without discriminating between them, which improves the\ngeneralization of the model. The Transformer model is pre-trained via a\nspecially designed pretext task, where it reconstructs the complete flow fields\nafter randomly masking $20\\%$ data points in each snapshot. For the downstream\ntask of flow reconstruction, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned separately\nwith $256$ snapshots for each Reynolds number. The fine-tuned models accurately\nreconstruct the complete flow fields based on less than $5\\%$ random data\npoints within a limited window even for $Re=250$ and $600$, whose data were not\nseen in the pre-trained phase. For the other downstream task of flow\nprediction, the pre-training model is fine-tuned separately with $128$\nconsecutive snapshot pairs for each corresponding Reynolds number. The\nfine-tuned models then correctly predict the evolution of the flow fields over\nmany periods of cycles. We compare all results generated by models trained via\nSSL and models trained via supervised learning, where the former has\nunequivocally superior performance. We expect that the methodology presented\nhere will have wider applications in fluid mechanics",

            "summary": "This paper presents one-bit supervision, a novel setting of learning with\nfewer labels, for image classification. Instead of training model using the\naccurate label of each sample, our setting requires the model to interact with\nthe system by predicting the class label of each sample and learn from the\nanswer whether the guess is correct, which provides one bit (yes or no) of\ninformation. An intriguing property of the setting is that the burden of\nannotation largely alleviates in comparison to offering the accurate label.\nThere are two keys to one-bit supervision, which are (i) improving the guess\naccuracy and (ii) making good use of the incorrect guesses. To achieve these\ngoals, we propose a multi-stage training paradigm and incorporate negative\nlabel suppression into an off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning algorithm.\nTheoretical analysis shows that one-bit annotation is more efficient than\nfull-bit annotation in most cases and gives the conditions of combining our\napproach with active learning. Inspired by this, we further integrate the\none-bit supervision framework into the self-supervised learning algorithm which\nyields an even more efficient training schedule. Different from training from\nscratch, when self-supervised learning is used for initialization, both hard\nexample mining and class balance are verified effective in boosting the\nlearning performance. However, these two frameworks still need full-bit labels\nin the initial stage. To cast off this burden, we utilize unsupervised domain\nadaptation to train the initial model and conduct pure one-bit annotations on\nthe target dataset. In multiple benchmarks, the learning efficiency of the\nproposed approach surpasses that using full-bit, semi-supervised supervision.",

First, a\nmodified defect power law is constructed to describe the total stress profiles\nof equilibrium PG TBLs. Crucially, a PG-induced characteristic stress is\nidentified to determine the total stress variation. Second, four length\nfunctions are formulated with their dilation symmetry properties to quantify\nthe Reynolds shear and normal stresses profiles. With a defect-power-law\nexponent, a nominal von K\\'{a}rm\\'{a}n constant, and a buffer layer thickness\nin the length functions, all dependently of PG, the entire profiles of the mean\nvelocity, Reynolds shear and wall-normal normal stresses are accurately\ndescribed for several equilibrium APG TBLs covering wide ranges of Reynolds\nnumber (Re) and PG. The streamwise and spanwise normal stresses are subjected\nto anormalous scaling modifications induced by APG with different mechanisms.\nWith the modifications, the entire profiles of the streamwise and spanwise\nReynolds normal stresses are accurately described. In particular, the\nouter-layer similarity among different Reynolds stress components is well\ncaptured. The study presents a novel approach for describing and predicting the\nmean-flow profiles of equilibrium PG TBLs with a limited number of empirical\nparameters, sound physical interpretations, and great accuracy, which paves a\nway to quantify the PG, Re, and other boundary-layer effects for a deep\nunderstanding of the flows.",

We use Point-E as our generative\nmodel and introduce methods including quantified position prediction and Top-K\nestimation to mitigate the false negative problems caused by ambiguous language\ndescription. Moreover, we evaluate the ability of our model by demonstrating\nthe diversity of generated objects, the effectiveness of instruction, and\nquantitative metric results, which collectively indicate that our model is\ncapable of generating realistic in-door objects.

To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-stream contrastive\npredictive network (DCPNet), which consists of two asymmetric task designs and\nthe false negative sample elimination module. The first task is to construct\npositive sample pairs, guiding the core encoder to learn more general\nrepresentations. The second task is to encourage adaptive capture of the\ncorrespondence between deep features and handcrated features, achieving\nknowledge transfer within the model, and effectively improving the redundancy\ncaused by the feature fusion.

Accurate\nprediction of protein-ligand binding mode is important for precise scoring and\nrational molecular optimization. Notwithstanding its significance, modelling\nprecise and physically plausible binding conformations is a largely unsolved\nproblem in the real-world docking scenario. Flexible docking is a daunting task\nas modeling protein conformation changes upon ligand binding is extremely\ncomputationally expensive and inaccurate. Currently available deep learning\ndocking methods ignore protein flexibility and fail to ensure the physical\nplausibility and detailed interactions. In this study, we present DiffBind, a\ncomprehensive full-atom diffusion-based semi-flexible docking model that\noperates over the product space of ligand movements (translation, rotation, and\ntorsion) and pocket side chain torsion changes. Evaluations reveal that\nDiffBind has considerably higher accuracy in producing native-like binding\nstructures with physically plausible and detailed interactions than traditional\ndocking methods and other deep learning-based approaches. Even in the\nAlphaFold2 modeled structures, DiffBind still demonstrates superior advantages\nin accurate pose prediction and structure refinement.

We investigate this developmental change in two neural\nnetwork models that learn the successor function on the pairs (N, N+1) for N in\n(0, 98). The first uses a one-hot encoding of the input and output values and\ncorresponds to children memorizing a count list, while the second model uses a\nplace-value encoding and corresponds to children learning the language rules\nfor naming numbers. The place-value model showed a predicted drop in\nrepresentational similarity across tens boundaries. Counting across a tens\nboundary can be understood as a vector operation in 2D space, where the numbers\nwith the same tens place are organized in a linearly separable manner, whereas\nthose with the same ones place are grouped together. A curriculum learning\nsimulation shows that, in the expanding numerical environment of the developing\nchild, representations of smaller numbers continue to be sharpened even as\nlarger numbers begin to be learned. These models set the stage for future work\nusing recurrent architectures to move beyond learning the successor function to\nsimulating the counting process more generally, and point towards a deeper\nunderstanding of what it means to understand the countably infinite.",

The rate at which general user requirements are adopted by\ndevelopers, or user contribution, is a very valuable metric that can be an\nimportant tool for app developers or software engineering researchers to\nmeasure or gain insight into the evolution of app requirements and predict the\nevolution of app software. Regrettably, the landscape lacks refined\nquantitative analysis approaches and tools for this pivotal indicator. To\naddress this problem, this paper exploratively proposes a quantitative analysis\napproach based on the temporal correlation perception that exists in the app\nupdate log and user reviews, which provides a feasible solution for\nquantitatively obtaining the user contribution. The main idea of this scheme is\nto consider valid user reviews as user requirements and app update logs as\ndeveloper responses, and to mine and analyze the pairwise and chronological\nrelationships existing between the two by text computing, thus constructing a\nfeasible approach for quantitatively calculating user contribution. To\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the approach, this paper collects data from four\nChinese apps in the App Store in mainland China and one English app in the U.S.\nregion, including 2,178 update logs and 4,236,417 user reviews, and from the\nresults of the experiment, it was found that 16.6%-43.2% of the feature of\nthese apps would be related to the drive from the online popular user\nrequirements.",

            "summary": "Recent methods for dynamic human reconstruction have attained promising\nreconstruction results. Most of these methods rely only on RGB color\nsupervision without considering explicit geometric constraints. This leads to\nexisting human reconstruction techniques being more prone to overfitting to\ncolor and causes geometrically inherent ambiguities, especially in the sparse\nmulti-view setup.\n  Motivated by recent advances in the field of monocular geometry prediction,\nwe consider the geometric constraints of estimated depth and normals in the\nlearning of neural implicit representation for dynamic human reconstruction. As\na geometric regularization, this provides reliable yet explicit supervision\ninformation, and improves reconstruction quality. We also exploit several\nbeneficial physical priors, such as adding noise into view direction and\nmaximizing the density on the human surface. These priors ensure the color\nrendered along rays to be robust to view direction and reduce the inherent\nambiguities of density estimated along rays. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat depth and normal cues, predicted by human-specific monocular estimators,\ncan provide effective supervision signals and render more accurate images.\nFinally, we also show that the proposed physical priors significantly reduce\noverfitting and improve the overall quality of novel view synthesis.

            "summary": "Fingerprints are widely recognized as one of the most unique and reliable\ncharacteristics of human identity. Most modern fingerprint authentication\nsystems rely on contact-based fingerprints, which require the use of\nfingerprint scanners or fingerprint sensors for capturing fingerprints during\nthe authentication process. Various types of fingerprint sensors, such as\noptical, capacitive, and ultrasonic sensors, employ distinct techniques to\ngather and analyze fingerprint data. This dependency on specific hardware or\nsensors creates a barrier or challenge for the broader adoption of fingerprint\nbased biometric systems. This limitation hinders the widespread adoption of\nfingerprint authentication in various applications and scenarios. Border\ncontrol, healthcare systems, educational institutions, financial transactions,\nand airport security face challenges when fingerprint sensors are not\nuniversally available. To mitigate the dependence on additional hardware, the\nuse of contactless fingerprints has emerged as an alternative. Developing\nprecise fingerprint segmentation methods, accurate fingerprint extraction\ntools, and reliable fingerprint matchers are crucial for the successful\nimplementation of a robust contactless fingerprint authentication system. This\npaper focuses on the development of a deep learning-based segmentation tool for\ncontactless fingerprint localization and segmentation. Our system leverages\ndeep learning techniques to achieve high segmentation accuracy and reliable\nextraction of fingerprints from contactless fingerprint images. In our\nevaluation, our segmentation method demonstrated an average mean absolute error\n(MAE) of 30 pixels, an error in angle prediction (EAP) of 5.92 degrees, and a\nlabeling accuracy of 97.46%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nnovel contactless fingerprint segmentation and extraction tools.",

The RAIL method, along with the development of\nthe SAT approach, is designed to enhance the efficiency of traditional\nfull-rank implicit solvers from method-of-lines discretizations of\ntime-dependent PDEs, while maintaining accuracy and stability. We consider\nspectral methods for spatial discretization, and diagonally implicit\nRunge-Kutta (DIRK) and implicit-explicit (IMEX) RK methods for time\ndiscretization. The efficiency gain is achieved by investigating low-rank\nstructures within solutions at each RK stage using a singular value\ndecomposition (SVD). In particular, we develop a reduced augmentation procedure\nto predict the basis functions to construct projection subspaces. This\nprocedure balances algorithm accuracy and efficiency by incorporating as many\nbases as possible from previous RK stages and predictions, and by optimizing\nthe basis representation through SVD truncation. As such, one can form implicit\nschemes for updating basis functions in a dimension-by-dimension manner,\nsimilar in spirit to the K-L step in the DLR framework. We also apply a\nglobally mass conservative post-processing step at the end of each RK stage. We\nvalidate the RAIL method through numerical simulations of advection-diffusion\nproblems and a Fokker-Planck model, showcasing its ability to efficiently\nhandle time-dependent PDEs while maintaining global mass conservation. Our\napproach generalizes and bridges the DLR and SAT approaches, offering a\ncomprehensive framework for efficiently and accurately solving time-dependent\nPDEs with implicit treatment.",

            "summary": "Given the increasing prevalence of wildland fires in the Western US, there is\na critical need to develop tools to understand and accurately predict burn\nseverity. We develop a machine learning model to predict post-fire burn\nseverity using pre-fire remotely sensed data. Hydrological, ecological, and\ntopographical variables collected from four regions of California - the sites\nof the Kincade fire (2019), the CZU Lightning Complex fire (2020), the Windy\nfire (2021), and the KNP Fire (2021) - are used as predictors of the difference\nnormalized burn ratio. We hypothesize that a Super Learner (SL) algorithm that\naccounts for spatial autocorrelation using Vecchia's Gaussian approximation\nwill accurately model burn severity. In all combinations of test and training\nsets explored, the results of our model showed the SL algorithm outperformed\nstandard Linear Regression methods. After fitting and verifying the performance\nof the SL model, we use interpretable machine learning tools to determine the\nmain drivers of severe burn damage, including greenness, elevation and fire\nweather variables. These findings provide actionable insights that enable\ncommunities to strategize interventions, such as early fire detection systems,\npre-fire season vegetation clearing activities, and resource allocation during\nemergency responses. When implemented, this model has the potential to minimize\nthe loss of human life, property, resources, and ecosystems in California.",

            "summary": "Single cell analysis of human skeletal muscle (SM) tissue cross-sections is a\nfundamental tool for understanding many neuromuscular disorders. For this\nanalysis to be reliable and reproducible, identification of individual fibres\nwithin microscopy images (segmentation) of SM tissue should be automatic and\nprecise. Biomedical scientists in this field currently rely on custom tools and\ngeneral machine learning (ML) models, both followed by labour intensive and\nsubjective manual interventions to fine-tune segmentation. We believe that\nfully automated, precise, reproducible segmentation is possible by training ML\nmodels. However, in this important biomedical domain, there are currently no\ngood quality, publicly available annotated imaging datasets available for ML\nmodel training. In this paper we release NCL-SM: a high quality bioimaging\ndataset of 46 human SM tissue cross-sections from both healthy control subjects\nand from patients with genetically diagnosed muscle pathology. These images\ninclude $>$ 50k manually segmented muscle fibres (myofibres). In addition we\nalso curated high quality myofibre segmentations, annotating reasons for\nrejecting low quality myofibres and low quality regions in SM tissue images,\nmaking these annotations completely ready for downstream analysis. This, we\nbelieve, will pave the way for development of a fully automatic pipeline that\nidentifies individual myofibres within images of tissue sections and, in\nparticular, also classifies individual myofibres that are fit for further\nanalysis.",

However, they lack interpretability which hinders human trust and\nthereby deployment to settings with high-stakes decisions. A line of\ninterpretable methods approach this by discovering a small set of relevant\nconcepts as subgraphs in the last GNN layer that together explain the\nprediction. This can yield oversimplified explanations, failing to explain the\ninteraction between GNN layers. To address this oversight, we provide HELP\n(Hierarchical Explainable Latent Pooling), a novel, inherently interpretable\ngraph pooling approach that reveals how concepts from different GNN layers\ncompose to new ones in later steps. HELP is more than 1-WL expressive and is\nthe first non-spectral, end-to-end-learnable, hierarchical graph pooling method\nthat can learn to pool a variable number of arbitrary connected components. We\nempirically demonstrate that it performs on-par with standard GCNs and popular\npooling methods in terms of accuracy while yielding explanations that are\naligned with expert knowledge in the domains of chemistry and social networks.\nIn addition to a qualitative analysis, we employ concept completeness scores as\nwell as concept conformity, a novel metric to measure the noise in discovered\nconcepts, quantitatively verifying that the discovered concepts are\nsignificantly easier to fully understand than those from previous work. Our\nwork represents a first step towards an understanding of graph neural networks\nthat goes beyond a set of concepts from the final layer and instead explains\nthe complex interplay of concepts on different levels.",

However, there remains a lack of datasets balanced along\ndemographic traits that can be used to evaluate the downstream fairness of\nthese models. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models can be\nleveraged to create such a dataset. We first use a diffusion model to generate\na large set of images depicting various occupations. Subsequently, each image\nis edited using inpainting to generate multiple variants, where each variant\nrefers to a different perceived race. Using this dataset, we benchmark several\nvision-language models on a multi-class occupation classification task. We find\nthat images generated with non-Caucasian labels have a significantly higher\noccupation misclassification rate than images generated with Caucasian labels,\nand that several misclassifications are suggestive of racial biases. We measure\na model's downstream fairness by computing the standard deviation in the\nprobability of predicting the true occupation label across the different\nperceived identity groups. Using this fairness metric, we find significant\ndisparities between the evaluated vision-and-language models. We hope that our\nwork demonstrates the potential value of diffusion methods for fairness\nevaluations.",

            "summary": "In optimal transport (OT), a Monge map is known as a mapping that transports\na source distribution to a target distribution in the most cost-efficient way.\nRecently, multiple neural estimators for Monge maps have been developed and\napplied in diverse unpaired domain translation tasks, e.g. in single-cell\nbiology and computer vision. However, the classic OT framework enforces mass\nconservation, which makes it prone to outliers and limits its applicability in\nreal-world scenarios. The latter can be particularly harmful in OT domain\ntranslation tasks, where the relative position of a sample within a\ndistribution is explicitly taken into account. While unbalanced OT tackles this\nchallenge in the discrete setting, its integration into neural Monge map\nestimators has received limited attention. We propose a theoretically grounded\nmethod to incorporate unbalancedness into any Monge map estimator. We improve\nexisting estimators to model cell trajectories over time and to predict\ncellular responses to perturbations. Moreover, our approach seamlessly\nintegrates with the OT flow matching (OT-FM) framework. While we show that\nOT-FM performs competitively in image translation, we further improve\nperformance by incorporating unbalancedness (UOT-FM), which better preserves\nrelevant features. We hence establish UOT-FM as a principled method for\nunpaired image translation.",

            "summary": "In this paper, beam training and beam tracking are investigated for extremely\nlarge-scale multiple-input-multiple-output communication systems with\npartially-connected hybrid combining structures. Firstly, we propose a\ntwo-stage hybrid-field beam training scheme for both the near field and the far\nfield. In the first stage, each subarray independently uses multiple far-field\nchannel steering vectors to approximate near-field ones for analog combining.\nTo find the codeword best fitting for the channel, digital combiners in the\nsecond stage are designed to combine the outputs of the analog combiners from\nthe first stage. Then, based on the principle of stationary phase and the\ntime-frequency duality, the expressions of subarray signals after analog\ncombining are analytically derived and a beam refinement based on phase shifts\nof subarrays~(BRPSS) scheme with closed-form solutions is proposed for\nhigh-resolution channel parameter estimation. Moreover, a low-complexity\nnear-field beam tracking scheme is developed, where the kinematic model is\nadopted to characterize the channel variations and the extended Kalman filter\nis exploited for beam tracking. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of\nthe proposed schemes.",

            "summary": "Background: Discovering potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is a\nlong-standing challenge in clinical treatments and drug developments. Recently,\ndeep learning techniques have been developed for DDI prediction. However, they\ngenerally require a huge number of samples, while known DDIs are rare.\n  Methods: In this work, we present KnowDDI, a graph neural network-based\nmethod that addresses the above challenge. KnowDDI enhances drug\nrepresentations by adaptively leveraging rich neighborhood information from\nlarge biomedical knowledge graphs. Then, it learns a knowledge subgraph for\neach drug-pair to interpret the predicted DDI, where each of the edges is\nassociated with a connection strength indicating the importance of a known DDI\nor resembling strength between a drug-pair whose connection is unknown. Thus,\nthe lack of DDIs is implicitly compensated by the enriched drug representations\nand propagated drug similarities.\n  Results: We evaluate KnowDDI on two benchmark DDI datasets. Results show that\nKnowDDI obtains the state-of-the-art prediction performance with better\ninterpretability. We also find that KnowDDI suffers less than existing works\ngiven a sparser knowledge graph. This indicates that the propagated drug\nsimilarities play a more important role in compensating for the lack of DDIs\nwhen the drug representations are less enriched.\n  Conclusions: KnowDDI nicely combines the efficiency of deep learning\ntechniques and the rich prior knowledge in biomedical knowledge graphs. As an\noriginal open-source tool, KnowDDI can help detect possible interactions in a\nbroad range of relevant interaction prediction tasks, such as protein-protein\ninteractions, drug-target interactions and disease-gene interactions,\neventually promoting the development of biomedicine and healthcare.",

Early identification and intervention\nare crucial to prevent negative long-term outcomes impacting the academic,\nsocial, and emotional development of children. The study aims to develop an\nautomated method for the identification of DLD using artificial intelligence,\nspecifically a neural network machine learning algorithm. This protocol is\napplied for the first time in Cypriot Greek children, which is generally\nconsidered underresearched in the context of DLD. The neural network model was\ntrained using perceptual and production data elicited from children with DLD\nand healthy controls. The k-fold technique was used to crossvalidate the\nalgorithm. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as\naccuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC/AUC curve to assess its ability\nto make accurate predictions on a set of unseen data. The results demonstrated\nhigh classification values for all metrics (between 0.92 and 0.98), indicating\nthe high accuracy of the neural model in classifying children with DLD.\nAdditionally, the variable importance analysis revealed that the language\nproduction skills of children had a more significant impact on the performance\nof the model compared to perception skills. Neural networks represent powerful\ntools for detecting DLD, providing early and quick assessments of the disorder,\nand having the potential to improve clinical outcomes.",

            "summary": "7 Tesla (7T) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps derived from\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrate improved image quality and spatial\nresolution over 3 Tesla (3T) ADC maps. However, 7T magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) currently suffers from limited clinical unavailability, higher cost, and\nincreased susceptibility to artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a\nhybrid CNN-transformer model to synthesize high-resolution 7T ADC maps from\nmulti-modal 3T MRI. The Vision CNN-Transformer (VCT), composed of both Vision\nTransformer (ViT) blocks and convolutional layers, is proposed to produce\nhigh-resolution synthetic 7T ADC maps from 3T ADC maps and 3T T1-weighted (T1w)\nMRI. ViT blocks enabled global image context while convolutional layers\nefficiently captured fine detail. The VCT model was validated on the publicly\navailable Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset, comprising 3T T1w, 3T\nDWI, and 7T DWI brain scans. The Diffusion Imaging in the Python library was\nused to compute ADC maps from the DWI scans. A total of 171 patient cases were\nrandomly divided: 130 training cases, 20 validation cases, and 21 test cases.\nThe synthetic ADC maps were evaluated by comparing their similarity to the\nground truth volumes with the following metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio\n(PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and mean squared error\n(MSE). The results are as follows: PSNR: 27.0+-0.9 dB, SSIM: 0.945+-0.010, and\nMSE: 2.0+-0.4E-3. Our predicted images demonstrate better spatial resolution\nand contrast compared to 3T MRI and prediction results made by ResViT and\npix2pix. These high-quality synthetic 7T MR images could be beneficial for\ndisease diagnosis and intervention, especially when 7T MRI scanners are\nunavailable.",

This study proposes a\ntask-adaptive learning quasi-stiffness control framework for powered prostheses\nthat generalizes across tasks, including the torque-angle relationship\nreconstruction part and the quasi-stiffness controller design part.\nQuasi-stiffness is defined as the slope of the human joint's torque-angle\nrelationship. To accurately obtain the torque-angle relationship in a new task,\na Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model is introduced to predict the target\nfeatures of the human joint's angle and torque in the task. Then a Kernelized\nMovement Primitives (KMP) is employed to reconstruct the torque-angle\nrelationship of a new task from multiple human demonstrations and estimated\ntarget features. Based on the torque-angle relationship of the new task, a\nquasi-stiffness control approach is designed for a powered prosthesis.

Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein\nTelescope, are predicted to have a higher detection rate given the increased\nsensitivity and lower cut-off frequency. However, this increased sensitivity\nraises challenges concerning parameter estimation due to the foreseeable\noverlap of signals from multiple sources. Overlapping signals (OSs), if not\nproperly identified, may introduce biases in estimating post-Newtonian (PN)\ncoefficients in parameterized tests of general relativity (GR). We investigate\nhow OSs affect $-1$PN to 2PN terms in parameterized GR tests, examining their\npotential to falsely suggest GR deviations. We estimate the prevalence of such\nmisleading signals in next-generation detectors, and their collective influence\non GR tests. We compare the effects of OSs on coefficients at different PN\norders, concluding that overall the 1PN coefficient suffers the most. Our\nfindings also reveal that while a non-negligible portion of OSs exhibit biases\nin PN coefficients that might individually prefer to conclude deviations from\nGR, collectively, the direction to deviate is random and a statistical\ncombination will still be in favor of GR.",

Being a major\nelectrical performance limiter, the TMD crystal grain size strongly differs\nbetween the various CVD precursor chemistries from nano- to millimeter-sized\ncrystals. However, it remains unclear how the CVD precursor chemistry affects\nthe nucleation density and resulting TMD crystal grain size. This work\npostulates guiding principles to design a CVD process for highly crystalline\nTMD deposition using a quantitative analytical model benchmarked against\nliterature. The TMD nucleation density reduces favorably under low\nsupersaturation conditions, where the metal precursor sorption on the starting\nsurface is reversible and the corresponding metal precursor desorption rate\nexceeds the overall deposition rate. Such reversible precursor adsorption\nguarantees efficient long-range gas-phase lateral diffusion of precursor\nspecies in addition to short-range surface diffusion, which vitally increases\ncrystal grain size. As such, the proposed model explains the large spread in\nexperimentally observed TMD nucleation densities and crystal grain sizes for\nstate-of-the-art CVD chemistries. Ultimately, it empowers the reader to\ninterpret and modulate precursor adsorption and diffusion reactions through\ndesigning CVD precursor chemistries compatible with temperature sensitive\napplication schemes.",

However, due to the randomness and\nnonlinearity of the wind fields that generate ocean waves and the complex\ninteraction between wave and wind fields, current forecasts of numerical ocean\nwaves have biases. In this study, a spatiotemporal deep-learning method was\nemployed to correct gridded SWH forecasts from the ECMWF-IFS. This method was\nbuilt on the trajectory gated recurrent unit deep neural network,and it\nconducts real-time rolling correction for the 0-240h SWH forecasts from\nECMWF-IFS. The correction model is co-driven by wave and wind fields, providing\nbetter results than those based on wave fields alone. A novel pixel-switch loss\nfunction was developed. The pixel-switch loss function can dynamically\nfine-tune the pre-trained correction model, focusing on pixels with large\nbiases in SWH forecasts. According to the seasonal characteristics of SWH, four\ncorrection models were constructed separately, for spring, summer, autumn, and\nwinter. The experimental results show that, compared with the original ECMWF\nSWH predictions, the correction was most effective in spring, when the mean\nabsolute error decreased by 12.972~46.237%. Although winter had the worst\nperformance, the mean absolute error decreased by 13.794~38.953%.

In our study,\nwe utilize a dataset with years of Sentinel-3 satellite imagery for marine\nsurveillance, along with shellfish biotoxin contamination data from various\nproduction areas along Portugal's western coastline, collected by Portuguese\nofficial control. Our goal is to evaluate the integration of satellite data in\nforecasting models for predicting toxin concentrations in shellfish given\nforecasting horizons up to four weeks, which implies extracting a small set of\nuseful features and assessing their impact on the predictive models. We framed\nthis challenge as a time-series forecasting problem, leveraging historical\ncontamination levels and satellite images for designated areas. While\ncontamination measurements occurred weekly, satellite images were accessible\nmultiple times per week. Unsupervised feature extraction was performed using\nautoencoders able to handle non-valid pixels caused by factors like cloud\ncover, land, or anomalies. Finally, several Artificial Neural Networks models\nwere applied to compare univariate (contamination only) and multivariate\n(contamination and satellite data) time-series forecasting. Our findings show\nthat incorporating these features enhances predictions, especially beyond one\nweek in lagoon production areas (RIAV) and for the 1-week and 2-week horizons\nin the L5B area (oceanic). The methodology shows the feasibility of integrating\ninformation from a high-dimensional data source like remote sensing without\ncompromising the model's predictive ability.",

            "summary": "The increasing demand for latency-sensitive applications has necessitated the\ndevelopment of sophisticated algorithms that efficiently manage packets with\nend-to-end delay targets traversing the networked infrastructure. Network\ncomponents must consider minimizing the packets' end-to-end delay violation\nprobabilities (DVP) as a guiding principle throughout the transmission path to\nensure timely deliveries. Active queue management (AQM) schemes are commonly\nused to mitigate congestion by dropping packets and controlling queuing delay.\nToday's established AQM schemes are threshold-driven, identifying congestion\nand trigger packet dropping using a predefined criteria which is unaware of\npackets' DVPs. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Delta, that combines\nend-to-end delay characterization with AQM for minimizing DVP. In a queuing\ntheoretic environment, we show that such a policy is feasible by utilizing a\ndata-driven approach to predict the queued packets' DVPs. That enables Delta\nAQM to effectively handle links with arbitrary stationary service time\nprocesses. The implementation is described in detail, and its performance is\nevaluated and compared with state of the art AQM algorithms. Our results show\nthe Delta outperforms current AQM schemes substantially, in particular in\nscenarios where high reliability, i.e. high quantiles of the tail latency\ndistribution, are of interest.",

The\narchitecture comprises a 1st-order-pre-trainer, a 2nd-order-improver, and a\ndiscriminator network, designed to boost the order accuracy of charge density\nin Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations. We acquire our training data from our\nself-developed 3-D PIC code, JefiPIC. The training procedure starts with the\n1st-order-pre-trainer, which is trained on a large dataset to predict charge\ndensities based on the provided article positions. Subsequently, we fine-tune\nthe 1st-order-pre-trainer, whose predictions then serve as inputs to the\n2nd-order-improver. Meanwhile, we train the 2nd-order-improver and\ndiscriminator network using a smaller volume of 2nd-order data, thereby\nachieving to generate charge density with 2nd-order accuracy. In the concluding\nphase, we replace JefiPIC's conventional particle interpolation process with\nour trained neural network. Our results demonstrate that the neural\nnetwork-enhanced PIC simulation can effectively simulate plasmas with 2\nnd-order accuracy. This highlights the advantage of our proposed neural\nnetwork: it can achieve higher-accuracy data with fewer real labels.",

            "summary": "With the growing concerns regarding user data privacy, Federated Recommender\nSystem (FedRec) has garnered significant attention recently due to its\nprivacy-preserving capabilities. Existing FedRecs generally adhere to a\nlearning protocol in which a central server shares a global recommendation\nmodel with clients, and participants achieve collaborative learning by\nfrequently communicating the model's public parameters. Nevertheless, this\nlearning framework has two drawbacks that limit its practical usability: (1) It\nnecessitates a global-sharing recommendation model; however, in real-world\nscenarios, information related to the recommender model, including its\nalgorithm and parameters, constitutes the platforms' intellectual property.\nHence, service providers are unlikely to release such information actively. (2)\nThe communication costs of model parameter transmission are expensive since the\nmodel parameters are usually high-dimensional matrices. With the model size\nincreasing, the communication burden will be the bottleneck for such\ntraditional FedRecs.\n  Given the above limitations, this paper introduces a novel parameter\ntransmission-free federated recommendation framework that balances the\nprotection between users' data privacy and platforms' model privacy, namely\nPTF-FedRec. Specifically, participants in PTF-FedRec collaboratively exchange\nknowledge by sharing their predictions within a privacy-preserving mechanism.\nThrough this way, the central server can learn a recommender model without\ndisclosing its model parameters or accessing clients' raw data, preserving both\nthe server's model privacy and users' data privacy. Besides, since clients and\nthe central server only need to communicate prediction scores which are just a\nfew real numbers, the overhead is significantly reduced compared to traditional\nFedRecs.",

We carefully study the jet images during the saturation and MAD regimes\nat various frequencies and from different observational angles. We reveal the\npresence of U-shaped brighter lines near the jet surface boundaries, which can\nbe attributed to the photons whose trajectories skim over the jet surface. The\nexistence of these brighter lines is a unique feature of a geometrically thin\njet. Moreover, we notice that the jet images are relatively insensitive to the\nobserved frequencies of interest.

While reconstruction in our\nlocal Universe exploits the observations of galaxy surveys with large volumes,\nobservations of high-redshift galaxies are performed with a small field of view\nand therefore can hardly be used for reconstruction. Here we propose to\nreconstruct the initial density field using the H I 21 cm and CO line intensity\nmaps from the epoch of reionization. Observations of these two intensity maps\nprovide complementary information of the density field -- the H I 21 cm field\nis a proxy of matter distributions in the neutral regions, while the CO line\nintensity maps are sensitive to the high-density, star-forming regions that\nhost the sources for reionization. Technically, we employ the conjugate\ngradient method and develop the machinery for minimizing the cost function for\nthe intensity mapping observations. Analytical expressions for the gradient of\ncost function are derived explicitly. We show that the resimulated intensity\nmaps match the input maps of mock observations using semi-numerical simulations\nof reionization with an rms error $\\lesssim 7\\%$ at all stages of reionization.\nThis reconstruction is also robust at the same level of accuracy when a noise\nat the level of $\\lesssim 1\\%$ of the standard deviation is applied to each\nmap.

            "summary": "Modern enterprises rely on data management systems to collect, store, and\nanalyze vast amounts of data related with their operations. Nowadays, clusters\nand hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) have become a necessity to scale\nwith the data processing demands in many applications related to social media,\nbioinformatics, surveillance systems, remote sensing, and medical informatics.\nGiven this new scenario, the architecture of data analytics engines must evolve\nto take advantage of these new technological trends. In this paper, we present\nArcaDB: a disaggregated query engine that leverages container technology to\nplace operators at compute nodes that fit their performance profile. In ArcaDB,\na query plan is dispatched to worker nodes that have different computing\ncharacteristics. Each operator is annotated with the preferred type of compute\nnode for execution, and ArcaDB ensures that the operator gets picked up by the\nappropriate workers. We have implemented a prototype version of ArcaDB using\nJava, Python, and Docker containers. We have also completed a preliminary\nperformance study of this prototype, using images and scientific data. This\nstudy shows that ArcaDB can speed up query performance by a factor of 3.5x in\ncomparison with a shared-nothing, symmetric arrangement.",

            "summary": "This paper develops a sequencing-enabled hierarchical connected automated\nvehicle (CAV) cooperative on-ramp merging control framework. The proposed\nframework consists of a two-layer design: the upper level control sequences the\nvehicles to harmonize the traffic density across mainline and on-ramp segments\nwhile enhancing lower-level control efficiency through a mixed-integer linear\nprogramming formulation. Subsequently, the lower-level control employs a\nlongitudinal distributed model predictive control (MPC) supplemented by a\nvirtual car-following (CF) concept to ensure asymptotic local stability, l_2\nnorm string stability, and safety. Proofs of asymptotic local stability and l_2\nnorm string stability are mathematically derived. Compared to other prevalent\nasymptotic local-stable MPC controllers, the proposed distributed MPC\ncontroller greatly expands the initial feasible set. Additionally, an auxiliary\nlateral control is developed to maintain lane-keeping and merging smoothness\nwhile accommodating ramp geometric curvature. To validate the proposed\nframework, multiple numerical experiments are conducted. Results indicate a\nnotable outperformance of our upper-level controller against a distance-based\nsequencing method. Furthermore, the lower-level control effectively ensures\nsmooth acceleration, safe merging with adequate spacing, adherence to proven\nlongitudinal local and string stability, and rapid regulation of lateral\ndeviations.",

            "summary": "Predicting pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety and\neffectiveness of autonomous driving and mobile robots. However, this task is\nnontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally\nrequires the predictor to generate multi-model prediction. Previous works have\nused various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory\nprediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from problems, including\nmode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction\ndue to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability.\nHowever, current diffusion-based methods are straightforward without fully\nleveraging input information and usually require many denoising iterations\nleading to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization.\nTo address these challenges and promote the application of diffusion models in\ntrajectory prediction, we propose a novel scene-aware multi-modal pedestrian\ntrajectory prediction framework called GBD. GBD combines goal prediction with\nthe diffusion network. First, the goal predictor produces multiple goals, and\nthen the diffusion network generates multi-modal trajectories conditioned on\nthese goals. Furthermore, we introduce a new diffusion sampling algorithm named\ntree sampling (TS), which leverages common feature to reduce the inference time\nand improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our GBD-TS method achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nreal-time inference speed.",

            "summary": "Explicit Caption Editing (ECE) -- refining reference image captions through a\nsequence of explicit edit operations (e.g., KEEP, DETELE) -- has raised\nsignificant attention due to its explainable and human-like nature. After\ntraining with carefully designed reference and ground-truth caption pairs,\nstate-of-the-art ECE models exhibit limited generalization ability beyond the\noriginal training data distribution, i.e., they are tailored to refine content\ndetails only in in-domain samples but fail to correct errors in out-of-domain\nsamples. To this end, we propose a new Diffusion-based Explicit Caption editing\nmethod: DECap. Specifically, we reformulate the ECE task as a denoising process\nunder the diffusion mechanism, and introduce innovative edit-based noising and\ndenoising processes. Thanks to this design, the noising process can help to\neliminate the need for meticulous paired data selection by directly introducing\nword-level noises for training, learning diverse distribution over input\nreference caption. The denoising process involves the explicit predictions of\nedit operations and corresponding content words, refining reference captions\nthrough iterative step-wise editing. To further efficiently implement our\ndiffusion process and improve the inference speed, DECap discards the prevalent\nmulti-stage design and directly generates edit operations and content words\nsimultaneously. Extensive ablations have demonstrated the strong generalization\nability of DECap in various scenarios. More interestingly, it even shows great\npotential in improving the quality and controllability of caption generation.",

Understanding such\nnonlinear behavior has been a key challenge in predicting whether all\noscillators in such a system will eventually synchronize. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that, surprisingly, such nonlinear behavior of coupled oscillators\ncan be effectively linearized in certain latent dynamic spaces. The key insight\nis that there is a small number of `latent dynamics filters', each with a\nspecific association with synchronizing and non-synchronizing dynamics on\nsubgraphs so that any observed dynamics on subgraphs can be approximated by a\nsuitable linear combination of such elementary dynamic patterns. Taking an\nensemble of subgraph-level predictions provides an interpretable predictor for\nwhether the system on the whole graph reaches global synchronization. We\npropose algorithms based on supervised matrix factorization to learn such\nlatent dynamics filters.

            "summary": "Characterizing the performance of no-regret dynamics in multi-player games is\na foundational problem at the interface of online learning and game theory.\nRecent results have revealed that when all players adopt specific learning\nalgorithms, it is possible to improve exponentially over what is predicted by\nthe overly pessimistic no-regret framework in the traditional adversarial\nregime, thereby leading to faster convergence to the set of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE). Yet, despite considerable recent progress, the fundamental\ncomplexity barriers for learning in normal- and extensive-form games are poorly\nunderstood. In this paper, we make a step towards closing this gap by first\nshowing that -- barring major complexity breakthroughs -- any polynomial-time\nlearning algorithms in extensive-form games need at least $2^{\\log^{1/2 - o(1)}\n|\\mathcal{T}|}$ iterations for the average regret to reach below even an\nabsolute constant, where $|\\mathcal{T}|$ is the number of nodes in the game.\nThis establishes a superpolynomial separation between no-regret learning in\nnormal- and extensive-form games, as in the former class a logarithmic number\nof iterations suffices to achieve constant average regret. Furthermore, our\nresults imply that algorithms such as multiplicative weights update, as well as\nits \\emph{optimistic} counterpart, require at least $2^{(\\log \\log m)^{1/2 -\no(1)}}$ iterations to attain an $O(1)$-CCE in $m$-action normal-form games.\nThese are the first non-trivial -- and dimension-dependent -- lower bounds in\nthat setting for the most well-studied algorithms in the literature. From a\ntechnical standpoint, we follow a beautiful connection recently made by Foster,\nGolowich, and Kakade (ICML '23) between sparse CCE and Nash equilibria in the\ncontext of Markov games. Consequently, our lower bounds rule out\npolynomial-time algorithms well beyond the traditional online learning\nframework.",

Compared to\nlight duty vehicles, HDEVs exhibit unique travel and charging patterns over\nlong distances. In this paper, we formulate an analytically tractable model\nthat considers the routing decisions for the HDEVs and their charging\nimplications on the power grid. Our model captures the impacts of increased\nvehicle electrification on the transmission grid, with particular focus on\nHDEVs. We jointly model transportation and power networks coupling them through\nthe demand generated for charging requirements of HDEVs. In particular, the\nvoltage constraint violation is explicitly accounted for in the proposed model\ngiven the signifcant amount of charging power imposed by HDEVs. We obtain\noptimal routing schedules and generator dispatch satisfying mobility\nconstraints of HDEVs while minimizing voltage violations in electric\ntransmission network. Case study based on an IEEE 24-bus system is presented\nusing realistic data of transit data of HDEVs. The numerical results suggest\nthat the proposed model and algorithm effectively mitigate the voltage\nviolation when a significant amount of HDEVs are integrated to the power\ntransmission network. Such mitigation includes reduction in the voltage\nmagnitude, geographical dispersion of voltage violations and worst-case voltage\nviolations at critical nodes.",

            "summary": "An increasing number of studies use gender information to understand\nphenomena such as gender bias, inequity in access and participation, or the\nimpact of the Covid pandemic response. Unfortunately, most datasets do not\ninclude self-reported gender information, making it necessary for researchers\nto infer gender from other information, such as names or names and country\ninformation. An important limitation of these tools is that they fail to\nappropriately capture the fact that gender exists on a non-binary scale,\nhowever, it remains important to evaluate and compare how well these tools\nperform in a variety of contexts. In this paper, we compare the performance of\na generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT with three commercially\navailable list-based and machine learning-based gender inference tools (Namsor,\nGender-API, and genderize.io) on a unique dataset. Specifically, we use a large\nOlympic athlete dataset and report how variations in the input (e.g., first\nname and first and last name, with and without country information) impact the\naccuracy of their predictions. We report results for the full set, as well as\nfor the subsets: medal versus non-medal winners, athletes from the largest\nEnglish-speaking countries, and athletes from East Asia. On these sets, we find\nthat Namsor is the best traditional commercially available tool. However,\nChatGPT performs at least as well as Namsor and often outperforms it,\nespecially for the female sample when country and/or last name information is\navailable. All tools perform better on medalists versus non-medalists and on\nnames from English-speaking countries. Although not designed for this purpose,\nChatGPT may be a cost-effective tool for gender prediction. In the future, it\nmight even be possible for ChatGPT or other large scale language models to\nbetter identify self-reported gender rather than report gender on a binary\nscale.",

However, high-fidelity CHT models are computationally\nintensive, which limits their use in applications such as design optimization,\nwhere hundreds to thousands of model evaluations are required. In this work, we\ndevelop a modular deep convolutional encoder-decoder hierarchical (DeepEDH)\nneural network, a novel deep-learning-based surrogate modeling methodology for\ncomputationally intensive CHT models. Leveraging convective temperature\ndependencies, we propose a two-stage temperature prediction architecture that\ncouples velocity and temperature models. The proposed DeepEDH methodology is\ndemonstrated by modeling the pressure, velocity, and temperature fields for a\nliquid-cooled cold-plate-based battery thermal management system with variable\nchannel geometry. A computational model of the cold plate is developed and\nsolved using the finite element method (FEM), generating a dataset of 1,500\nsimulations. The FEM results are transformed and scaled from unstructured to\nstructured, image-like meshes to create training and test datasets. The DeepEDH\nmethodology's performance is examined in relation to data scaling, training\ndataset size, and network depth. Our performance analysis covers the impact of\nthe novel architecture, separate field models, output geometry masks,\nmulti-stage temperature models, and optimizations of the hyperparameters and\narchitecture. Furthermore, we quantify the influence of the CHT thermal\nboundary condition on surrogate model performance, highlighting improved\ntemperature model performance with higher heat fluxes. Compared to other deep\nlearning neural network surrogate models, such as U-Net and DenseED, the\nproposed DeepEDH methodology for CHT models exhibits up to a 65% enhancement in\nthe coefficient of determination ($R^{2}$).",

They have wide applications in\ntasks such as dynamic emotion understanding and expressive text-to-speech\nsynthesis. Existing methods that predict the dimensional emotion representation\nfrom speech cast it as a supervised regression task. These methods face data\nscarcity issues, as dimensional annotations are much harder to acquire than\ncategorical labels. In this work, we propose to learn the AV representation\nfrom categorical emotion labels of speech. We start by learning a rich and\nemotion-relevant high-dimensional speech feature representation using\nself-supervised pre-training and emotion classification fine-tuning. This\nrepresentation is then mapped to the 2D AV space according to psychological\nfindings through anchored dimensionality reduction. Experiments show that our\nmethod achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) performance\ncomparable to state-of-the-art supervised regression methods on IEMOCAP without\nleveraging ground-truth AV annotations during training. This validates our\nproposed approach on AV prediction. Furthermore, visualization of AV\npredictions on MEAD and EmoDB datasets shows the interpretability of the\nlearned AV representations.",

This paper provides a\ncomprehensive review of the literature on the estimation, inference, and model\nselection approaches for the cross-sectional matrix exponential spatial models.\nWe discuss summary measures for the marginal effects of regressors and detail\nthe matrix-vector product method for efficient estimation. Our aim is not only\nto summarize the main findings from the spatial econometric literature but also\nto make them more accessible to applied researchers. Additionally, we\ncontribute to the literature by introducing some new results. We propose an\nM-estimation approach for models with heteroskedastic error terms and\ndemonstrate that the resulting M-estimator is consistent and has an asymptotic\nnormal distribution. We also consider some new results for model selection\nexercises. In a Monte Carlo study, we examine the finite sample properties of\nvarious estimators from the literature alongside the M-estimator.",

Here we define new web models\ncorresponding to each of the rank-two spiders considered by Kuperberg\n[arXiv:q-alg/9712003]. These models are based on the $A_2$, $G_2$ and $B_2$ Lie\nalgebras, and their local vertex configurations are intertwiners of the\ncorresponding $q$-deformed quantum algebras. In all three cases we define a\ncorresponding model on the hexagonal lattice, and in the case of $B_2$ also on\nthe square lattice. For specific root-of-unity choices of $q$, we show the\nequivalence to a number of three- and four-state spin models on the dual\nlattice.\n  The main result of this paper is to exhibit integrable manifolds in the\nparameter spaces of each web model. For $q$ on the unit circle, these models\nare critical and we characterise the corresponding conformal field theories via\nnumerical diagonalisation of the transfer matrix.\n  In the $A_2$ case we find two integrable regimes. The first one contains a\ndense and a dilute phase, for which we have analytic control via a Coulomb gas\nconstruction, while the second one is more elusive and likely conceals\nnon-compact physics. Three particular points correspond to a three-state spin\nmodel with plaquette interactions, of which the one in the second regime\nappears to present a new universality class. In the $G_2$ case we identify four\nregimes numerically. The $B_2$ case is too unwieldy to be studied numerically\nin the general case, but it found analytically to contain a simpler sub-model\nbased on generators of the dilute Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra.",

            "summary": "A fundamental prediction of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmology are\nthe centrally-divergent cuspy density profiles of dark matter haloes. These\ndensity cusps render CDM haloes resilient to tides, and protect dwarf galaxies\nembedded in them from full tidal disruption. The hierarchical assembly history\nof the Milky Way may therefore give rise to a population of \"micro galaxies\";\ni.e., heavily-stripped remnants of early accreted satellites which may reach\narbitrarily low luminosity. Assuming that the progenitor systems are dark\nmatter dominated, we use an empirical formalism for tidal stripping to predict\nthe evolution of the luminosity, size and velocity dispersion of such remnants,\ntracing their tidal evolution across multiple orders of magnitude in mass and\nsize. The evolutionary tracks depend sensitively on the progenitor distribution\nof stellar binding energies. We explore two cases that likely bracket most\nrealistic models of dwarf galaxies: one where the energy distribution of the\nmost tightly bound stars follows that of the dark matter, and another where\nstars are less tightly bound and have a well-defined finite density core. The\ntidal evolution in the size-velocity dispersion plane is quite similar for\nthese two models, although their remnants may differ widely in luminosity.\nMicro galaxies are therefore best distinguished from globular clusters by the\npresence of dark matter; either directly, by measuring their velocity\ndispersion, or indirectly, by examining their tidal resilience. Our work\nhighlights the need for further theoretical and observational constraints on\nthe stellar energy distribution in dwarf galaxies.",

            "summary": "In-context segmentation aims at segmenting novel images using a few labeled\nexample images, termed as \"in-context examples\", exploring content similarities\nbetween examples and the target. The resulting models can be generalized\nseamlessly to novel segmentation tasks, significantly reducing the labeling and\ntraining costs compared with conventional pipelines. However, in-context\nsegmentation is more challenging than classic ones due to its meta-learning\nnature, requiring the model to learn segmentation rules conditioned on a few\nsamples, not just the segmentation. Unlike previous work with ad-hoc or\nnon-end-to-end designs, we propose SEGIC, an end-to-end segment-in-context\nframework built upon a single vision foundation model (VFM). In particular,\nSEGIC leverages the emergent correspondence within VFM to capture dense\nrelationships between target images and in-context samples. As such,\ninformation from in-context samples is then extracted into three types of\ninstructions, i.e. geometric, visual, and meta instructions, serving as\nexplicit conditions for the final mask prediction. SEGIC is a straightforward\nyet effective approach that yields state-of-the-art performance on one-shot\nsegmentation benchmarks. Notably, SEGIC can be easily generalized to diverse\ntasks, including video object segmentation and open-vocabulary segmentation.\nCode will be available at \\url{https://github.com/MengLcool/SEGIC}.",

It implies an excess of\nbright galaxies at z>~10 compared to the standard models based on the low SFE\nat later epochs, an excess that is indicated by JWST observations. Here we\nprovide observable predictions based on the analytic FFB scenario, to be\ncompared with simulations and JWST observations. We use the model to\napproximate the SFE as a function of redshift and mass, assuming a maximum SFE\nof 0.2~1 in the FFB regime. From this, we derive the evolution of the galaxy\nmass and luminosity functions as well as the evolution of stellar and\nstar-formation densities. We then predict the star-formation history (SFH),\ngalaxy sizes, outflows, gas fractions, metallicities and dust attenuation, all\nas functions of mass and redshift in the FFB regime. The major distinguishing\nfeature is the occurrence of FFBs above a mass threshold that declines with\nredshift. The luminosities and star formation rates in bright galaxies are\npredicted to be in excess of extrapolations of standard empirical models and\ncosmological simulations, an excess that grows from z~9 to higher redshifts.\nThe FFB phase of ~100Myr is predicted to show a characteristic SFH that\nfluctuates on a timescale of ~10Myr. The stellar systems are compact (Re~0.3kpc\nat z~10 and declining with z). The galactic gas consists of a steady wind\ndriven by supernovae from earlier generations, with high outflow velocities\n(FWHM~1400-6700km/s), low gas fractions (<0.1), low metallicities (<~0.1solar),\nand low dust attenuation ($A_{UV}$~0.5 at z~10 and declining with z).

The orbits of 45 globular clusters in the\ncentral galactic region with a radius of 3.5 kpc were analyzed using spectral\ndynamics methods in order to identify objects captured by the bar. To form the\n6D phase space required for orbit integration, the most accurate astrometric\ndata to date from the Gaia satellite (EDR3), as well as new refined average\ndistances to globular clusters, were used. Since the parameters of the Milky\nWay bar are known with very great uncertainty, the orbits were constructed and\ntheir frequency analysis was carried out with varying the mass, length and\nangular velocity of rotation of the bar in a wide range of values with a fairly\nsmall step. The integration of orbits was carried out at 2.5 billion years ago.\nAs a result, bar-supporting globular clusters were identified for each set of\nbar parameters. For the first time, an analytical expression has been obtained\nfor the dependence of the dominant frequency $f_X$ on the angular velocity of\nrotation of the bar. In addition, the probabilities of capturing globular\nclusters by the bar were determined when the bar parameters were varied in\ncertain ranges of values according to a random distribution law. A list of 14\nglobular clusters with the most significant capture probabilities is given,\nwith five GCs - NGC6266, NGC6569, Terzan 5, NGC6522, NGC6540 - showing the\nprobability capture by bar $\\geq 0.2$. A conclusion is made about the\nregularity of the orbits of globular clusters based on the calculation of\napproximations of the maximum characteristic Lyapunov exponents.",

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric\nmixture model for clustering high-dimensional mixed-type (e.g., continuous,\ndiscrete and categorical) longitudinal features. We employ a sparse factor\nmodel on the joint distribution of random effects and the key idea is to induce\nclustering at the latent factor level instead of the original data to escape\nthe curse of dimensionality. The number of clusters is estimated through a\nDirichlet process prior. An efficient Gibbs sampler is developed to estimate\nthe posterior distribution of the model parameters. Analysis of real and\nsimulated data is presented and discussed. Our study demonstrates that the\nproposed model serves as a useful analytical tool for clustering\nhigh-dimensional longitudinal data.",

Additionally, training these models requires manually\nannotating domain-specific datasets, a process that is expensive,\ntime-consuming, and difficult to generalize to new environments and scenarios.\nThe recent emergence of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers potential\nsolutions to these limitations due to their superior visual understanding and\ncausal reasoning capabilities, which can be harnessed through semi-supervised\ntraining. GPT-4V(ision), the latest iteration of the state-of-the-art\nLarge-Language Model GPTs, now incorporates vision input capabilities. This\nreport provides a comprehensive evaluation of the potential of GPT-4V for\npedestrian behavior prediction in autonomous driving using publicly available\ndatasets: JAAD, PIE, and WiDEVIEW. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations\ndemonstrate GPT-4V(ision)'s promise in zero-shot pedestrian behavior prediction\nand driving scene understanding ability for autonomous driving.

We utilize 15 years of Fermi-LAT data to search for\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from Ursa Major III. Finding no excess, we set strong\nconstraints on dark matter annihilation. Intriguingly, if the high J-factor of\nUrsa Major III is confirmed, standard thermal dark matter annihilation to\n$b\\bar{b}$ final states would be ruled out for dark matter masses up to 4 TeV.\nThe discovery of Ursa Major III, combined with recent tentative measurements of\nother high J-factor systems, suggests the exciting possibility that near-future\ndata could produce transformative constraints on thermal dark matter.",

Given that\nsuch crises may introduce a shift in market dynamics, this study aims to\ninvestigate whether the training data from market dynamics prior to the crisis\nare compatible with the data during the crisis period. To this end, two\ndistinct learning environments are designed to evaluate and reconcile the\neffects of possibly different market dynamics. These environments differ\nprincipally based on the role assigned to the pre-crisis data. In both\nenvironments, a set of non-dominated architectures are identified to satisfy\nthe multi-criteria co-evolution problem, which simultaneously addresses the\nselection issues related to features and hidden layer topology. To test the\nhypothesis of pre-crisis data incompatibility, the day-ahead movement\nprediction of the NASDAQ index is considered during two recent and major market\ndisruptions; the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The results\nof a detailed comparative evaluation convincingly support the incompatibility\nhypothesis and highlight the need to select re-training windows carefully.",

Built on an inventory of key physical\nproperties of UFDs, this model is also validated against existing mobilization\nstudies. Our model generates stability curves that delineate flow conditions\nleading to their mobilization. We further enhance the reliability of our model\nby incorporating a Monte Carlo-based probabilistic framework that accounts for\nuncertainties and interdependencies among the input parameters. These\nprobabilistic stability curves enable us to estimate the likelihood of\nmobilization for specific categories of UFDs under certain flow conditions.\nWhen integrated with flood maps or two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic models,\nour stability curves can guide urban planning efforts to predict and mitigate\nthe impacts of UFDs during extreme flood events.",

            "summary": "A random forest prediction can be computed by the scalar product of the\nlabels of the training examples and a set of weights that are determined by the\nleafs of the forest into which the test object falls; each prediction can hence\nbe explained exactly by the set of training examples for which the weights are\nnon-zero. The number of examples used in such explanations is shown to vary\nwith the dimensionality of the training set and hyperparameters of the random\nforest algorithm. This means that the number of examples involved in each\nprediction can to some extent be controlled by varying these parameters.\nHowever, for settings that lead to a required predictive performance, the\nnumber of examples involved in each prediction may be unreasonably large,\npreventing the user to grasp the explanations. In order to provide more useful\nexplanations, a modified prediction procedure is proposed, which includes only\nthe top-weighted examples. An investigation on regression and classification\ntasks shows that the number of examples used in each explanation can be\nsubstantially reduced while maintaining, or even improving, predictive\nperformance compared to the standard prediction procedure.",

            "summary": "In the realm of few-shot learning, foundation models like CLIP have proven\neffective but exhibit limitations in cross-domain robustness especially in\nfew-shot settings. Recent works add text as an extra modality to enhance the\nperformance of these models. Most of these approaches treat text as an\nauxiliary modality without fully exploring its potential to elucidate the\nunderlying class visual features distribution. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach that leverages text-derived statistics to predict the mean and\ncovariance of the visual feature distribution for each class. This predictive\nframework enriches the latent space, yielding more robust and generalizable\nfew-shot learning models. We demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating both\nmean and covariance statistics in improving few-shot classification performance\nacross various datasets. Our method shows that we can use text to predict the\nmean and covariance of the distribution offering promising improvements in\nfew-shot learning scenarios.",

            "summary": "Global 21-cm experiments are built to study the evolution of the Universe\nbetween the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. FlexKnot is a function\nparameterised by freely moving knots stringed together by splines. Adopting the\nFlexKnot function as the signal model has the potential to separate the global\n21-cm signal from the foregrounds and systematics while being capable of\nrecovering the crucial features given by theoretical predictions. In this\npaper, we implement the FlexKnot method by integrating twice over a function of\nfreely moving knots interpolated linearly. The function is also constrained at\nthe lower frequencies corresponding to the dark ages by theoretical values. The\nFlexKnot model is tested in the framework of the realistic data analysis\npipeline of the REACH global signal experiment using simulated antenna\ntemperature data. We demonstrate that the FlexKnot model performs better than\nexisting signal models, e.g. the Gaussian signal model, at reconstructing the\nshape of the true signals present in the simulated REACH data, especially for\ninjected signals with complex structures. The capabilities of the FlexKnot\nsignal model is also tested by introducing various systematics and simulated\nglobal signals of different types. These tests show that four to five knots are\nsufficient to recover the general shape of most realistic injected signals,\nwith or without sinusoidal systematics. We show that true signals whose\nabsorption trough of amplitude between 120 to 450 mK can be well recovered with\nsystematics up to about 50 mK.",

While the focus of research so far was on\npurely scalar source terms we also study the effect of including first order\ntensor perturbations as an additional source. This gives rise to two additional\nsource terms: a term quadratic in the tensor perturbations and a cross term\ninvolving mixed scalar and tensor perturbations. We present full analytical\nexpressions for the spectral density of these new source terms and discuss\ntheir general behaviour. To illustrate the generation mechanism we study two\ntoy models containing a peak on small scales.

To achieve\ncontrollable multi-view image generation, we leverage MVDream as our base\nmodel, and train a new neural network module as additional plugin for\nend-to-end task-specific condition learning. To precisely control the shapes\nand views of generated images, we innovatively propose a new conditioning\nmechanism that predicts an embedding encapsulating the input spatial and view\nconditions, which is then injected to the network globally. Once MVControl is\ntrained, score-distillation (SDS) loss based optimization can be performed to\ngenerate 3D content, in which process we propose to use a hybrid diffusion\nprior. The hybrid prior relies on a pre-trained Stable-Diffusion network and\nour trained MVControl for additional guidance.

            "summary": "Designing terahertz sensors with high sensitivity to detect nanoscale thin\nfilms and single biomolecule presents a significant challenge, and addressing\nthese obstacles is crucial for unlocking their full potential in scientific\nresearch and advanced applications. This work presents a strategy for the\ndesign optimization of metamaterial sensors employed in the detection of small\namounts of dielectric materials. The sensors usually utilize the shift of the\nresonance frequency as an indicator of the presence of the analyte. The amount\nof shifting depends on intrinsic properties (electric field distribution,\nquality factor, and mode volume) of the bare cavity, as well as the overlap\nvolume of its high-electric-field zone(s) and the analyte. Guided by the\nsimplified dielectric perturbation theory, interdigitated electric split-ring\nresonators (ID-eSRR) are devised to significantly enhance the detection\nsensitivity for thin-film analytes compared to eSRRs without interdigitated\nfingers in the SRR gap region. The fingers of the ID-eSRR metamaterial sensor\nredistribute the electric field, creating strongly localized field enhancements\nthat substantially boost the interaction with the analyte. Additionally, the\nperiodic change of the orientation of the inherent anti-phase electric field in\nthe interdigitated structure reduces radiation loss, leading to a higher\nQ-factor. Experiments with e-beam-fabricated ID-eSRR sensors operating at\naround 300 GHz demonstrate a remarkable frequency shift of 33.5 GHz upon\ndeposition of a SiO2 layer with a thickness of 150 nm as an analyte simulant.\nThe figure of merit (FOM) improves by over 50 times compared to structures\nwithout interdigitated fingers. This rational design option opens a promising\navenue for highly sensitive detection of thin films and trace biomolecules.",

The numerical implementation of\nthis constrained GRHMC process exploits the sparsity of the randomized\ntransition kernel and the specific structure of the constraints so that the\nproposed approach is numerically accurate, computationally fast and operational\neven in high-dimensional applications. We illustrate this approach with\nposterior distributions of several Bayesian models with challenging parameter\ndomain constraints in applications to real-word data sets. Building on the\ncapability of GRHMC processes to efficiently explore otherwise challenging and\nhigh-dimensional posteriors, the proposed method expands the set of Bayesian\nmodels that can be analyzed by using the standard Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo\n(MCMC) methodology, As such, it can advance the development and use of Bayesian\nmodels with useful constrained priors, which are difficult to handle with\nexisting methods.

It has recently been established that the\npseudo-binary chalcogenides (ACh)m(Pn2Ch3)n (A = Ge, Mn, Pb, etc.; Pn = Sb or\nBi; Ch = Te, Se) may host novel topological quantum states such as the quantum\nanomalous Hall effect and topological axion states. Here we map out the phase\ndiagram of one member in this series, the topological insulator candidate\nGeSb4Te7 up to pressures of ~35 GPa, through a combination of electrical\nresistance measurements, Raman spectroscopy, as well as first-principles\ncalculations. Three distinct superconducting phases emerge under the pressure\nabove ~11, ~17, and ~31 GPa, which are accompanied by concomitant structural\ntransitions, evidenced from the changes in the Raman modes. The\nfirst-principles calculations validate the existence of a topological\ninsulating state at ambient pressure and predict two possible structural\ntransitions at 10 and 17 GPa, in agreement with the experimental observations.\nOverall, our results establish the GeSb4Te7 family of materials as a fertile\narena for further exploring various topological phenomena, including\ntopological phase transitions and putative topological superconductivity.",

            "summary": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is an irreplaceable modelling\nstep in many engineering designs, but it is often computationally expensive.\nSome graph neural network (GNN)-based CFD methods have been proposed. However,\nthe current methods inherit the weakness of traditional numerical simulators,\nas well as ignore the cell characteristics in the mesh used in the finite\nvolume method, a common method in practical CFD applications. Specifically, the\ninput nodes in these GNN methods have very limited information about any object\nimmersed in the simulation domain and its surrounding environment. Also, the\ncell characteristics of the mesh such as cell volume, face surface area, and\nface centroid are not included in the message-passing operations in the GNN\nmethods. To address these weaknesses, this work proposes two novel geometric\nrepresentations: Shortest Vector (SV) and Directional Integrated Distance\n(DID). Extracted from the mesh, the SV and DID provide global geometry\nperspective to each input node, thus removing the need to collect this\ninformation through message-passing. This work also introduces the use of\nFinite Volume Features (FVF) in the graph convolutions as node and edge\nattributes, enabling its message-passing operations to adjust to different\nnodes. Finally, this work is the first to demonstrate how residual training,\nwith the availability of low-resolution data, can be adopted to improve the\nflow field prediction accuracy. Experimental results on two datasets with five\ndifferent state-of-the-art GNN methods for CFD indicate that SV, DID, FVF and\nresidual training can effectively reduce the predictive error of current\nGNN-based methods by as much as 41%.",

CT-xCOV adopts an end-to-end\napproach from lung segmentation to COVID-19 detection and explanations of the\ndetection model's prediction. For lung segmentation, we used the well-known\nU-Net model. For COVID-19 detection, we compared three different CNN\narchitectures: a standard CNN, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. After the detection,\nvisual and textual explanations are provided. For visual explanations, we\napplied three different XAI techniques, namely, Grad-Cam, Integrated Gradient\n(IG), and LIME. Textual explanations are added by computing the percentage of\ninfection by lungs. To assess the performance of the used XAI techniques, we\npropose a ground-truth-based evaluation method, measuring the similarity\nbetween the visualization outputs and the ground-truth infections. The\nperformed experiments show that the applied DL models achieved good results.\nThe U-Net segmentation model achieved a high Dice coefficient (98%). The\nperformance of our proposed classification model (standard CNN) was validated\nusing 5-fold cross-validation (acc of 98.40% and f1-score 98.23%). Lastly, the\nresults of the comparison of XAI techniques show that Grad-Cam gives the best\nexplanations compared to LIME and IG, by achieving a Dice coefficient of 55%,\non COVID-19 positive scans, compared to 29% and 24% obtained by IG and LIME\nrespectively.

            "summary": "General purpose segmentation models are able to generate (semantic)\nsegmentation masks from a variety of prompts, including visual (points, boxed,\netc.) and textual (object names) ones. In particular, input images are\npre-processed by an image encoder to obtain embedding vectors which are later\nused for mask predictions. Existing adversarial attacks target the end-to-end\ntasks, i.e. aim at altering the segmentation mask predicted for a specific\nimage-prompt pair. However, this requires running an individual attack for each\nnew prompt for the same image. We propose instead to generate prompt-agnostic\nadversarial attacks by maximizing the $\\ell_2$-distance, in the latent space,\nbetween the embedding of the original and perturbed images. Since the encoding\nprocess only depends on the image, distorted image representations will cause\nperturbations in the segmentation masks for a variety of prompts. We show that\neven imperceptible $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded perturbations of radius\n$\\epsilon=1/255$ are often sufficient to drastically modify the masks predicted\nwith point, box and text prompts by recently proposed foundation models for\nsegmentation.

This\nso-called maximum-$J$-property has several positive implications such as good\nfast-particle confinement, magnetohydrodynamic stability, and suppression of\ncertain trapped-particle instabilities. This property cannot be attained in\nquasisymmetric stellarators, in which deeply trapped particles experience\naverage bad curvature and therefore precess in the diamagnetic direction close\nto the magnetic axis. However, quasi-isodynamic stellarators offer greater\nflexibility and allow the average curvature to be favourable and the precession\nto be reversed. We find that it is possible to design such stellarators so that\nthe maximum-$J$ condition is satisfied for the great majority of all particles,\neven when the plasma pressure vanishes. The qualitative properties of such a\nstellarator field can be derived analytically by examining the most deeply and\nthe most shallowly trapped particles, although some small fraction of the\nlatter will inevitably not behave as desired. However, through numerical\noptimisation, we construct a vacuum field in which 99.6% of all trapped\nparticles satisfy the maximum-$J$ condition.",

            "summary": "Current cosmological tensions show that it is crucial to test the predictions\nfrom the canonical $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm at different cosmic times. One very\nappealing test of structure formation in the universe is the growth rate of\nstructure in our universe $f$, usually parameterized via the growth index\n$\\gamma$, with $f\\equiv \\Omega_m(a)^\\gamma$ and $\\gamma \\simeq 0.55$ in the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM case. Recent studies have claimed a suppression of the\ngrowth of structure from a variety of cosmological observations, characterized\nby $\\gamma>0.55$. By employing different self-consistent growth\nparameterizations schemes, we show here that $\\gamma<0.55$, obtaining instead\n\\emph{an enhanced growth of structure today}. This preference reaches the\n$3\\sigma$ significance using Cosmic Microwave Background observations,\nSupernova Ia and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements. The addition of\nCosmic Microwave Background lensing data relaxes such a preference to the\n$2\\,\\sigma$ level, since a larger lensing effect can always be compensated with\na smaller structure growth, or, equivalently, with $\\gamma>0.55$. We have also\nincluded the lensing amplitude $A_{\\rm L}$ as a free parameter in our data\nanalysis, showing that the preference for $A_{\\rm L}>1$ still remains, except\nfor some particular parameterizations when lensing observations are included.\nWe also not find any significant preference for a multipole dependence of\n$A_{\\rm L}$. To further reassess the effects of a non-standard growth, we have\ncomputed by means of N-body simulations the dark matter density fields, the\ndark matter halo mass functions and the halo density profiles for different\nvalues of $\\gamma$. Future observations from the Square Kilometer Array,\nreducing by a factor of three the current errors on the $\\gamma$ parameter,\ncould finally settle the issue.",

We formalise and solve this problem\nby maximising social welfare under a budget constraint. The personalised\nincentives depend on the alternatives available to each individual and on her\npreferences. A polynomial time approximation algorithm computes a policy within\nfew seconds. We analytically prove that it is boundedly close to the optimum.\nWe efficiently calculate the curve of social welfare achievable for each value\nof budget within a given range. This curve can be useful for the regulator to\ndecide the appropriate amount of budget to invest. We extend our formulation to\nenforcement, taxation and non-personalised-incentive policies. We analytically\nshow that our personalised-incentive policy is also optimal within this class\nof policies and construct close-to-optimal enforcement and proportional\ntax-subsidy policies. We then compare analytically and numerically our policy\nwith other state-of-the-art policies. Finally, we simulate a large-scale\napplication to mode choice to reduce CO2 emissions.",

They are\naccurate for broad model parameter ranges relevant for real molecular\njunctions. Within this theoretical framework we show that: (i) by varying the\ntemperature, the tunneling current can vary by several orders of magnitude,\nthus debunking the myth that a strong temperature dependence of the current is\nevidence for a hopping mechanism, (ii) real molecular junctions can undergo a\ngradual (Sommerfeld-Arrhenius) transition from a weakly temperature dependent\nto a strongly (``exponential'') temperature dependent current that can be tuned\nby the applied bias, and (iii) important insight into large area molecular\njunctions with eutectic gallium indium alloy (EGaIn) top electrodes can be\ngained.

At pathologically high shear rates the protein unfolds and\nbinds to the arterial wall, enabling the rapid deposition of platelets from the\nblood. We present a novel continuum model for VWF dynamics in flow based on a\nmodified viscoelastic fluid model that incorporates a single constitutive\nrelation to describe the propensity of VWF to unfold as a function of the\nscalar shear rate. Using experimental data of VWF unfolding in pure shear flow,\nwe fix the parameters for VWF's unfolding propensity and the maximum VWF\nlength, so that the protein is half unfolded at a shear rate of approximately\n5,000 s$^{-1}$. We then use the theoretical model to predict VWF's behaviour in\ntwo complex flows where experimental data is challenging to obtain: pure\nelongational flow and stenotic arterial flow.\n  In pure elongational flow, our model predicts that VWF is 50% unfolded at\napproximately 2,000 s$^{-1}$, matching the established hypothesis that VWF\nunfolds at lower shear rates in elongational flow than in shear flow. We\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of this elongational flow prediction to the value\nof maximum VWF length used in the model, which varies significantly across\nexperimental studies, predicting that VWF can unfold between 600 - 3,200\ns$^{-1}$ depending on the selected value. Finally, we examine VWF dynamics in a\nrange of idealised arterial stenoses, predicting the relative extension of VWF\nin elongational flow structures in the centre of the artery compared to\nhigh-shear regions near the arterial walls.",

Here we report the instant\nmultiband observations of a type II supernova (SN 2023ixf) in the galaxy M101\n(at a distance of 6.85+/-0.15 Mpc), beginning at about 1.4 hours after the\nexplosion. The exploding star was a red supergiant with a radius of 450 solar\nradii. The light curves evolved rapidly, on timescales of 1-2 hours, and\nappeared unusually fainter and redder than predicted by models within the first\nfew hours, which we attribute to an optically thick dust shell before it was\ndisrupted by the shockwave.

In this work we analyse the ground state emerging from\nthe competition between a periodic potential and a Wigner crystal in one\ndimension, consisting of a selforganized chain of particles with the same\ncharge. This system is a paradigmatic realization of the Frenkel-Kontorova\nmodel with Coulomb interactions. We derive the action of a Coulomb soliton in\nthe continuum limit and demonstrate the mapping to a massive (1+1) Thirring\nmodel with long-range interactions. Here, the solitons are charged fermionic\nexcitations over an effective Dirac sea. The mismatch between the periodicities\nof potential and chain, giving rise to frustration, is a chemical potential\nwhose amplitude is majorly determined by the Coulomb self-energy. The\nmean-field limit is a long-range antiferromagnetic spin chain with uniform\nmagnetic field and predicts that the commensurate, periodic structures form a\ncomplete devil's staircase as a function of the charge density. Each step of\nthe staircase correspond to the interval of stability of a stable commensurate\nphase and scales with the number $N$ of charges as $1/\\ln N$. This implies that\nthere is no commensurate-incommensurate phase transition in the thermodynamic\nlimit.

            "summary": "In this paper, we present an analytic solution for pulse wave propagation in\na flexible arterial model with tapering, physiological boundary conditions and\nvariable wall properties (wall elasticity and thickness). The change of wall\nproperties follows a profile that is proportional to $r^\\alpha$, where $r$\nrepresents the lumen radius and $\\alpha$ is a material coefficient. The\ncross-sectionally averaged velocity and pressure are obtained by solving a\nhyperbolic system derived from the mass and momentum conservations, and they\nare expressed in Bessel functions of order $(4-\\alpha)/(3-\\alpha)$ and\n$1/(3-\\alpha)$, respectively. The solution is successfully validated by\ncomparing it with numerical results from 3D fluid-structure interaction\nsimulations. Subsequently, the solution is employed to study pulse wave\npropagation in an arterial model, revealing that the wall properties and the\nphysiological outlet boundary conditions, such as the RCR model, play a crucial\nrole in characterizing the input impedance and reflection coefficient. At\nlow-frequency range, the input impedance is found to be insensitive to the wall\nproperties and is primarily determined by the RCR parameters. At high-frequency\nrange, the input impedance oscillates around the local characteristic\nimpedance, and the oscillation amplitude varies non-monotonically with\n$\\alpha$. Expressions for the input impedance at both low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency limits are presented. This analytic solution is also\nsuccessfully applied to model flow inside a patient-specific arterial tree,\nwith the maximum relative errors in pressure and flow rate never exceeding\n$1.6\\%$ and $9.0\\%$ when compared to results from 3D numerical simulation.",

This yields a measurement-only dynamics, which is driven by the\ncompetition between local Pauli measurements and stabilizer measurements. The\nsetup differs from the conventional surface code for which errors are caused by\ndecoherence and their positions are unknown. Yet, our setting allows us to\nexamine the dynamics of the encoded logical qubit by using a combination of\nanalytical arguments based on percolation theory and numerical simulations.\nFirstly, we show that for a single round of Pauli measurements only, the\nthreshold corresponding to the irreversible loss of the logical qubit depends\nonly on the rate of $ \\hat X$- and $\\hat Z$-measurements, and that this loss of\nlogical quantum information is equivalent to the bond percolation transition in\na 2D square lattice. Local $\\hat Y$-measurements, which affect both $X$ and $Z$\nstabilizers, erase the logical qubit only if all physical qubits along one of\nthe diagonals are measured, and are thus negligible at large code distance.\nSecondly, we examine the dynamics in the code by considering the interplay\nbetween rounds of Pauli measurements and rounds of stabilizer measurements.\nFocusing on the lifetime of the logical qubit, we obtain a rich phase diagram\nfeaturing different dynamical regimes. We argue that the loss of the logical\nqubit in this setting can still be understood by percolation theory and\nunderpin our arguments with numerical simulations.",

Existing logit-based KDs apply the constant\ntemperature scaling to all samples in dataset, limiting the utilization of\nknowledge inherent in each sample individually. In our approach, we classify\nthe dataset into two categories (i.e., low energy and high energy samples)\nbased on their energy score. Through experiments, we have confirmed that low\nenergy samples exhibit high confidence scores, indicating certain predictions,\nwhile high energy samples yield low confidence scores, meaning uncertain\npredictions. To distill optimal knowledge by adjusting non-target class\npredictions, we apply a higher temperature to low energy samples to create\nsmoother distributions and a lower temperature to high energy samples to\nachieve sharper distributions. When compared to previous logit-based and\nfeature-based methods, our energy-based KD (Energy KD) achieves better\nperformance on various datasets. Especially, Energy KD shows significant\nimprovements on CIFAR-100-LT and ImageNet datasets, which contain many\nchallenging samples. Furthermore, we propose high energy-based data\naugmentation (HE-DA) for further improving the performance. We demonstrate that\nmeaningful performance improvement could be achieved by augmenting only 20-50%\nof dataset, suggesting that it can be employed on resource-limited devices.

To this end, we propose an end-to-end\ndata-driven MIMO solution without the conventional channel feedback procedure.\nData-driven MIMO can alleviate the drawbacks of feedback including overheads\nand delay, and can provide customized precoding design for different BSs based\non their historical channel data. It essentially learns a mapping from\ngeolocation to MIMO transmission parameters. We first present a codebook-based\napproach, which selects transmission parameters from the statistics of discrete\nchannel state information (CSI) values and utilizes integer interpolation for\nspatial inference. We further present a non-codebook-based approach, which 1)\nderives the optimal precoder from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the\nchannel; 2) utilizes variational autoencoder (VAE) to select the representative\nprecoder from the latent Gaussian representations; and 3) exploits Gaussian\nprocess regression (GPR) to predict unknown precoders in the space domain.\nExtensive simulations are performed on a link-level 5G simulator using\nrealistic ray-tracing channel data.

We use four data sets of different sizes\nto test the algorithm's accuracy. We compare the results with traditional link\nprediction models involving both static and temporal networks. Among our\nfindings, we note that the proposed algorithm is superior to conventional\nmethods, with the average accuracy improved by approximately 2% - 5%. We\nidentify different evolution patterns of four network topologies -- a proximity\nnetwork, a communication network, transportation data, and a collaboration\nnetwork. We found that: (1) timescale similarity contributes more to the\nevolution of the human contact network and the human communication network; (2)\nsuch contribution is not observed through a transportation network whose\nevolution pattern is more dependent on network structure than on the behavior\nof regional agents; (3) both timescale similarity and local structural\nsimilarity contribute to the collaboration network.",

            "summary": "3D whole-body human mesh recovery aims to reconstruct the 3D human body,\nface, and hands from a single image. Although powerful deep learning models\nhave achieved accurate estimation in this task, they require enormous memory\nand computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed\non resource-limited edge devices. In this work, we propose a Binarized Dual\nResidual Network (BiDRN), a novel quantization method to estimate the 3D human\nbody, face, and hands parameters efficiently. Specifically, we design a basic\nunit Binarized Dual Residual Block (BiDRB) composed of Local Convolution\nResidual (LCR) and Block Residual (BR), which can preserve full-precision\ninformation as much as possible. For LCR, we generalize it to four kinds of\nconvolutional modules so that full-precision information can be propagated even\nbetween mismatched dimensions. We also binarize the face and hands\nbox-prediction network as Binaried BoxNet, which can further reduce the model\nredundancy. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of BiDRN, which has a significant improvement over\nstate-of-the-art binarization algorithms. Moreover, our proposed BiDRN achieves\ncomparable performance with full-precision method Hand4Whole while using just\n22.1% parameters and 14.8% operations. We will release all the code and\npretrained models.",

Despite the proliferation of KD techniques,\nthe student model continues to fall short of achieving a similar level as\nteachers. In response, we introduce a novel and effective KD method capable of\nachieving results on par with or superior to the teacher models performance. We\nutilize teacher and student predictions about multiple samples for each\ncategory (i.e., batch predictions) and apply cosine similarity, a commonly used\ntechnique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for measuring the resemblance\nbetween text embeddings. This metric's inherent scale-invariance property,\nwhich relies solely on vector direction and not magnitude, allows the student\nto dynamically learn from the teacher's knowledge, rather than being bound by a\nfixed distribution of the teacher's knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a method\ncalled cosine similarity weighted temperature (CSWT) to improve the\nperformance. CSWT reduces the temperature scaling in KD when the cosine\nsimilarity between the student and teacher models is high, and conversely, it\nincreases the temperature scaling when the cosine similarity is low. This\nadjustment optimizes the transfer of information from the teacher to the\nstudent model. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method\nserves as a viable alternative to existing methods. We anticipate that this\napproach will offer valuable insights for future research on model compression.",

In this work, we design a novel pipeline for\nzero-shot 3D part segmentation, called ZeroPS. It high-quality transfers\nknowledge from 2D pretrained foundational models to 3D point clouds. The main\nidea of our approach is to explore the natural relationship between multi-view\ncorrespondences and the prompt mechanism of foundational models and build\nbridges on it. Our pipeline consists of two components: 1) a self-extension\ncomponent that extends 2D groups from a single viewpoint to spatial\nglobal-level 3D groups; 2) a multi-modal labeling component that introduces a\ntwo-dimensional checking mechanism to vote each 2D predicted bounding box to\nthe best matching 3D part, and a Class Non-highest Vote Penalty function to\nrefine the Vote Matrix. Additionally, a merging algorithm is included to merge\npart-level 3D groups. Extensive evaluation of three zero-shot segmentation\ntasks on PartnetE datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant\nimprovements (+19.6%, +5.2% and +4.9%, respectively) over existing methods. Our\nproposed approach does not need any training, fine-tuning or learnable\nparameters. It is hardly affected by domain shift. The code will be released.",

However, the\nexisting DyGNNs fail to handle distribution shifts, which naturally exist in\ndynamic graphs, mainly because the patterns exploited by DyGNNs may be variant\nwith respect to labels under distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose\nDisentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks with\nInvariance Promotion (I-DIDA) to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in\ndynamic graphs by discovering and utilizing invariant patterns, i.e.,\nstructures and features whose predictive abilities are stable across\ndistribution shifts. Specifically, we first propose a disentangled\nspatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant\npatterns. By utilizing the disentangled patterns, we design a spatio-temporal\nintervention mechanism to create multiple interventional distributions and an\nenvironment inference module to infer the latent spatio-temporal environments,\nand minimize the variance of predictions among these intervened distributions\nand environments, so that our model can make predictions based on invariant\npatterns with stable predictive abilities under distribution shifts. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art\nbaselines under distribution shifts.

However, these predicted outcomes are often used directly\nin subsequent statistical analyses, ignoring imprecision and heterogeneity\nintroduced by the prediction procedure. This will likely result in false\npositive findings and invalid scientific conclusions. In this work, we\nintroduce an assumption-lean and data-adaptive Post-Prediction Inference\n(POP-Inf) procedure that allows valid and powerful inference based on\nML-predicted outcomes. Its \"assumption-lean\" property guarantees reliable\nstatistical inference without assumptions on the ML-prediction, for a wide\nrange of statistical quantities. Its \"data-adaptive'\" feature guarantees an\nefficiency gain over existing post-prediction inference methods, regardless of\nthe accuracy of ML-prediction.

            "summary": "Data science projects often involve various machine learning (ML) methods\nthat depend on data, code, and models. One of the key activities in these\nprojects is the selection of a model or algorithm that is appropriate for the\ndata analysis at hand. ML model selection depends on several factors, which\ninclude data-related attributes such as sample size, functional requirements\nsuch as the prediction algorithm type, and non-functional requirements such as\nperformance and bias. However, the factors that influence such selection are\noften not well understood and explicitly represented. This paper describes\nongoing work on extending an adaptive variability-aware model selection method\nwith bias detection in ML projects. The method involves: (i) modeling the\nvariability of the factors that affect model selection using feature models\nbased on heuristics proposed in the literature; (ii) instantiating our\nvariability model with added features related to bias (e.g., bias-related\nmetrics); and (iii) conducting experiments that illustrate the method in a\nspecific case study to illustrate our approach based on a heart failure\nprediction project. The proposed approach aims to advance the state of the art\nby making explicit factors that influence model selection, particularly those\nrelated to bias, as well as their interactions. The provided representations\ncan transform model selection in ML projects into a non ad hoc, adaptive, and\nexplainable process.",

            "summary": "Coherent X-ray scattering (CXS) techniques are capable of interrogating\ndynamics of nano- to mesoscale materials systems at time scales spanning\nseveral orders of magnitude. However, obtaining accurate theoretical\ndescriptions of complex dynamics is often limited by one or more factors -- the\nability to visualize dynamics in real space, computational cost of\nhigh-fidelity simulations, and effectiveness of approximate or phenomenological\nmodels. In this work, we develop a data-driven framework to uncover mechanistic\nmodels of dynamics directly from time-resolved CXS measurements without solving\nthe phase reconstruction problem for the entire time series of diffraction\npatterns. Our approach uses neural differential equations to parameterize\nunknown real-space dynamics and implements a computational scattering forward\nmodel to relate real-space predictions to reciprocal-space observations. This\nmethod is shown to recover the dynamics of several computational model systems\nunder various simulated conditions of measurement resolution and noise.\nMoreover, the trained model enables estimation of long-term dynamics well\nbeyond the maximum observation time, which can be used to inform and refine\nexperimental parameters in practice. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental\nproof-of-concept by applying our framework to recover the probe trajectory from\na ptychographic scan. Our proposed framework bridges the wide existing gap\nbetween approximate models and complex data.",

We run one simulation at the start of each orbital period from\n20 to 72 orbital periods, which covers two complete disc tearing events. The\nresulting trends in observables are found to be dependent on the relative\nposition of the observer and the tearing disc. The $\\rm H\\alpha$ equivalent\nwidth, $V$ magnitude, and polarization can all increase or decrease in any\ncombination depending on the viewpoint of the observer. The $\\rm H\\alpha$ line\nprofile also displays changes in strength and peak separation throughout the\ntearing process. We show how the outer disc of the torn system can have a large\neffect on the $\\rm H\\alpha$ line profile, and also contributes to a\nwavelength-dependent polarization position angle, resulting in a similar\nsawtooth shape to the polarization percentage. Finally, we compare our\npredictions to Pleione (28 Tau) where evidence has suggested that a disc\ntearing event has occurred in the past. We find that our tearing disc model can\nbroadly match the trends seen in Pleione's observables, as well as produce the\ntwo-component $\\rm H\\alpha$ lines observed in Pleione. This is the strongest\nevidence, thus far, of Pleione's disc having indeed experienced a tearing\nevent.",

As this hyperparameter is scalar, it can be easily selected via\nrandom or grid search optimizing a cross-validation criterion. However, using a\nscalar hyperparameter limits the algorithm's flexibility and potential for\nbetter generalization. In this paper, we address the problem of linear\nregression with l2-regularization, where a different regularization\nhyperparameter is associated with each input variable. We optimize these\nhyperparameters using a gradient-based approach, wherein the gradient of a\ncross-validation criterion with respect to the regularization hyperparameters\nis computed analytically through matrix differential calculus. Additionally, we\nintroduce two strategies tailored for sparse model learning problems aiming at\nreducing the risk of overfitting to the validation data. Numerical examples\ndemonstrate that our multi-hyperparameter regularization approach outperforms\nLASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression. Moreover, the analytical computation\nof the gradient proves to be more efficient in terms of computational time\ncompared to automatic differentiation, especially when handling a large number\nof input variables.

            "summary": "Depletion interactions are thought to significantly contribute to the\norganization of intracellular structures in the crowded cytosol. The strength\nof depletion interactions depends on physical parameters like the depletant\nnumber density and the depletant size ratio. Cells are known to dynamically\nregulate these two parameters by varying the copy number of proteins of a wide\ndistribution of sizes. However, mammalian cells are also known to keep the\ntotal protein mass density remarkably constant, to within 0.5% throughout the\ncell cycle. We thus ask how the strength of depletion interactions varies when\nthe total depletant mass is held fixed, a.k.a. fixed-mass depletion. We answer\nthis question via scaling arguments, as well as by studying depletion effects\non networks of reconstituted semiflexible actin $\\textit{in silico}$ and\n$\\textit{in vitro}$. We examine the maximum strength of the depletion\ninteraction potential $U^*$ as a function of $q$, the size ratio between the\ndepletant and the matter being depleted. We uncover a scaling relation $U^*\n\\sim q^{-\\zeta}$ for two cases: fixed volume fraction $\\phi$ and fixed mass\ndensity $\\rho$. For fixed volume fraction, we report $\\zeta < 0$. For the fixed\nmass density case, we report $\\zeta > 0$, which suggests the depletion\ninteraction strength increases as the depletant size ratio is increased. To\ntest this prediction, we prepared our filament networks at fixed mass\nconcentrations with varying sizes of the depletant molecule poly(ethylene\nglycol) (PEG). We characterize the depletion interaction strength in our\nsimulations via the mesh size. In experiments, we observe two distinct actin\nnetwork morphologies, which we call weakly bundled and strongly bundled. We\nidentify a mass concentration where different PEG depletant sizes leads to\nweakly bundled or strongly bundled morphologies...[more in main text].",

We aim to find\nconditions at which quantum advantage can be realized in single-parameter phase\nsensing with nonlinear interferometers. Here, we calculate analytical\nexpressions for the QFI of nonlinear interferometers under lossy conditions and\nwith coherent-state seeding. We normalize the results based on the number of\nphotons going through the phase-inducing element, which eliminates some of the\npreviously declared metrological advantages. We analyze the performance of\nnonlinear interferometers in a variety of geometries and robustness of the\nquantum advantage with respect to internal and external loss through direct\ncomparison with a linear interferometer. We find the threshold on the internal\nloss at which the quantum advantage vanishes, specify when and how much\ncoherent-state seeding optimally counters internal loss, and show that a\nsufficient amount of squeezing confers to the quantum advantages robustness\nagainst external loss and inefficient detection.",

In this study, we present\ncompelling evidence of coexistence of both phenomena in a superconducting spin\nvalve system.

GigaPose first leverages discriminative\ntemplates, rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane\nrotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining\nparameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom\nspace instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates\nusing fast nearest neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup\nfactor of 38x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is\nsignificantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on\nthe seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with a refinement\nmethod. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models\npredicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the\nneed for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.\nOur source code and trained models are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/nv-nguyen/gigaPose",

The proposed DA method, named Tube-NeRF, leverages Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRFs) to generate novel synthetic images, and uses properties of the\nrobust MPC (the tube) to select relevant views and to efficiently compute the\ncorresponding actions. We tailor our approach to the task of localization and\ntrajectory tracking on a multirotor, by learning a visuomotor policy that\ngenerates control actions using images from the onboard camera as only source\nof horizontal position. Our evaluations numerically demonstrate learning of a\nrobust visuomotor policy with an 80-fold increase in demonstration efficiency\nand a 50% reduction in training time over current IL methods.

The function of the protein\ncorrelates with its structure, emphasizing the need of understanding protein\nfolding for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that occur within\nbiological systems. Understanding protein structures and enzymes plays a\ncritical role in target based drug designing, elucidating protein-related\ndisease mechanisms, and innovating novel enzymes. While recent advancements in\nAI based protein structure prediction methods have solved the protein folding\nproblem to an extent, their precision in determining the structure of the\nprotein with low sequence similarity is limited. Classical methods face\nchallenges in generating extensive conformational samplings, making\nquantum-based approaches advantageous for solving protein folding problems. In\nthis work we developed a novel turn based encoding algorithm that can be run on\na gate based quantum computer for predicting the structure of smaller protein\nsequences using the HP model as an initial framework, which can be extrapolated\nin its application to larger and more intricate protein systems in future. The\nHP model best represents a major step in protein folding phenomena - the\nhydrophobic collapse which brings the hydrophobic amino acid to the interior of\na protein. The folding problem is cast in a 3D cubic lattice with degrees of\nfreedom along edges parallel to the orthogonal axes, as well as along diagonals\nparallel to the axial planes. While, the original formulation with higher order\nterms can be run on gate based quantum hardwares, the QUBO formulation can give\nresults on both classical softwares employing annealers and IBM CPLEX as well\nas quantum hardwares.",

To assess and rank forecasting methods, researchers compute the mean\ncrps over given sets of forecast situations, based on the respective predictive\ndistributions and outcomes. We propose a new, isotonicity-based decomposition\nof the mean crps into interpretable components that quantify miscalibration\n(MSC), discrimination ability (DSC), and uncertainty (UNC), respectively. In a\ndetailed theoretical analysis, we compare the new approach to empirical\ndecompositions proposed earlier, generalize to population versions, analyse\ntheir properties and relationships, and relate to a hierarchy of notions of\ncalibration. The isotonicity-based decomposition guarantees the nonnegativity\nof the components and quantifies calibration in a sense that is stronger than\nfor other types of decompositions, subject to the nondegeneracy of empirical\ndecompositions. We illustrate the usage of the isotonicity-based decomposition\nin case studies from weather prediction and machine learning.",

We develop MINTY, a method that learns rules in the form of\ndisjunctions between variables that act as replacements for each other when one\nor more is missing. This results in a sparse linear rule model, regularized to\nhave small dependence on features with missing values, that allows a trade-off\nbetween goodness of fit, interpretability, and robustness to missing values at\ntest time.

            "summary": "A major challenge in deploying the smallest of Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)\nplatforms (< 100 g) is their inability to carry sensors that provide\nhigh-resolution metric depth information (e.g., LiDAR or stereo cameras).\nCurrent systems rely on end-to-end learning or heuristic approaches that\ndirectly map images to control inputs, and struggle to fly fast in unknown\nenvironments. In this work, we ask the following question: using only a\nmonocular camera, optical odometry, and offboard computation, can we create\nmetrically accurate maps to leverage the powerful path planning and navigation\napproaches employed by larger state-of-the-art robotic systems to achieve\nrobust autonomy in unknown environments? We present MonoNav: a fast 3D\nreconstruction and navigation stack for MAVs that leverages recent advances in\ndepth prediction neural networks to enable metrically accurate 3D scene\nreconstruction from a stream of monocular images and poses. MonoNav uses\noff-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth estimation and fusion techniques to\nconstruct a map, then searches over motion primitives to plan a collision-free\ntrajectory to the goal. In extensive hardware experiments, we demonstrate how\nMonoNav enables the Crazyflie (a 37 g MAV) to navigate fast (0.5 m/s) in\ncluttered indoor environments. We evaluate MonoNav against a state-of-the-art\nend-to-end approach, and find that the collision rate in navigation is\nsignificantly reduced (by a factor of 4). This increased safety comes at the\ncost of conservatism in terms of a 22% reduction in goal completion.",

The\napparent brightness of a satellite seen in the sky is not constant and depends\non the Sun-satellite-observer geometry. To capture this, we designed the survey\nto create an all-geometries set of measurements to fully characterize the\nbrightness of each population of satellites as seen in the sky. We visualize\nthe data with sky-plots that show the correlation of apparent brightness with\non-sky position and relative Sun-satellite-observer geometry. The sky-plots\nshow where in the sky the satellites are brightest. In addition to visual\nmagnitudes, we also present two new metrics: the expected photon flux and the\neffective albedo. The expected photon flux metric assesses the potential impact\non astronomy sensors by predicting the flux for a satellite trail in an image\nfrom a theoretical 1 m class telescope and sensor.

            "summary": "Mutation validation (MV) is a recently proposed approach for model selection,\ngarnering significant interest due to its unique characteristics and potential\nbenefits compared to the widely used cross-validation (CV) method. In this\nstudy, we empirically compared MV and $k$-fold CV using benchmark and\nreal-world datasets. By employing Bayesian tests, we compared generalization\nestimates yielding three posterior probabilities: practical equivalence, CV\nsuperiority, and MV superiority. We also evaluated the differences in the\ncapacity of the selected models and computational efficiency. We found that\nboth MV and CV select models with practically equivalent generalization\nperformance across various machine learning algorithms and the majority of\nbenchmark datasets. MV exhibited advantages in terms of selecting simpler\nmodels and lower computational costs. However, in some cases MV selected overly\nsimplistic models leading to underfitting and showed instability in\nhyperparameter selection. These limitations of MV became more evident in the\nevaluation of a real-world neuroscientific task of predicting sex at birth\nusing brain functional connectivity.",

Specifically, we investigate Dissipative Particle Dynamics and\nLangevin Dynamics, as paradigmatic examples that do and do not display\ntranslational symmetry, with distinct results: For identical parameters, the\nfriction forces can differ by many orders of magnitude. For slow driving, a\nGoldstone mode traverses the entire system, resulting in friction of the driven\nbead that grows arbitrarily large (Langevin) or gets arbitrarily small\n(Dissipative Particle Dynamics) with system size. For a long chain, the\nfriction for DPD is shown to be bound, while it shows a singularity (i.e. can\nbe arbitrarily large) for Langevin damping. For long underdamped chains, a\nradiation mode is recovered in either case, with friction independent of\ndamping mechanism. For medium length chains, the chain shows the expected\nresonant behavior. At the resonance, friction is non-analytic in damping\nparameter $\\gamma$, depending on it as $\\gamma^{-1}$.

In\nthis paper, we first propose an interactive dual-conformer (IDC) module, in\nwhich a cross-interaction mechanism is applied to effectively exploit the\ninformation from soft labels.

Therefore, we further propose SIM-V2, which employs a\nword embedding model for adaptive SIM estimation. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed IDC module can effectively utilize the information from soft\nlabels, and the integration of SIM-V1 can further improve the accuracy. In\naddition, the impact of different word embedding dimensions on SIM-V2 is\nexplored, and the results show that the appropriate dimension can enable SIM-V2\nachieve superior performance than SIM-V1.

Moreover, using\nshock properties at SolO, we forecast an arrival time 2h30 too late for a shock\nthat is just 5h31 away hours from Wind. Predicting the north-south component of\nthe magnetic field at Wind from SolO measurements leads to a relative error of\n55 %. These results show that even angular separations as low as 2.2{\\deg} (or\n0.03 au in arclength) between spacecraft can have a large impact on the\nobserved CME properties, rising up the issue of the resolutions of current CME\nmodels and potentially affecting our forecasting capabilities.",

            "summary": "This work addresses the development of a physics-informed neural network\n(PINN) with a loss term derived from a discretized time-dependent reduced-order\nsystem. In this work, first, the governing equations are discretized using a\nfinite difference scheme (whereas, any other discretization technique can be\nadopted), then projected on a reduced or latent space using the Proper\nOrthogonal Decomposition (POD)-Galerkin approach and next, the residual arising\nfrom discretized reduced order equation is considered as an additional loss\npenalty term alongside the data-driven loss term using different variants of\ndeep learning method such as Artificial neural network (ANN), Long Short-Term\nMemory based neural network (LSTM). The LSTM neural network has been proven to\nbe very effective for time-dependent problems in a purely data-driven\nenvironment. The current work demonstrates the LSTM network's potential over\nANN networks in physics-informed neural networks (PINN) as well. The potential\nof using discretized governing equations instead of continuous form lies in the\nflexibility of input to the PINN. Different sizes of data ranging from small,\nmedium to big datasets are used to assess the potential of\ndiscretized-physics-informed neural networks when there is very sparse or no\ndata available. The proposed methods are applied to a pitch-plunge airfoil\nmotion governed by rigid-body dynamics and a one-dimensional viscous Burgers'\nequation. The current work also demonstrates the prediction capability of\nvarious discretized-physics-informed neural networks outside the domain where\nthe data is available or governing equation-based residuals are minimized.",

This approach allows us to select representative CEMs and\nextrapolate the radial gradients to the nuclear regions of the galaxies in our\nsample, inferring in this way the central N/O and O/H abundances. The nuclear\nabundance predictions for theoretical galaxies from the selected CEMs, at\ndistinct evolutionary stages, are used as input parameters in AGN\nphotoionization models built with the Cloudy code. We found that standard BPT\ndiagnostic diagrams are able to classify AGNs with oxygen abundances 12+logO/H\n> 8.0 [(Z/Zsolar) > 0.2) preferably found at redshift z > 4.

The integration\nof machine learning (ML) methods within the remote sensing domain has\nsignificantly improved performance on a wide range of EO tasks, including cloud\ndetection and filtering, but there is still much room for improvement. A key\nbottleneck is that ML methods typically depend on large amounts of annotated\ndata for training, which is often difficult to come by in EO contexts. This is\nespecially true for the task of cloud optical thickness (COT) estimation. A\nreliable estimation of COT enables more fine-grained and application-dependent\ncontrol compared to using pre-specified cloud categories, as is commonly done\nin practice. To alleviate the COT data scarcity problem, in this work we\npropose a novel synthetic dataset for COT estimation, where top-of-atmosphere\nradiances have been simulated for 12 of the spectral bands of the\nMulti-Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensor onboard Sentinel-2 platforms. These data\npoints have been simulated under consideration of different cloud types, COTs,\nand ground surface and atmospheric profiles. Extensive experimentation of\ntraining several ML models to predict COT from the measured reflectivity of the\nspectral bands demonstrates the usefulness of our proposed dataset.\nGeneralization to real data is also demonstrated on two satellite image\ndatasets -- one that is publicly available, and one which we have collected and\nannotated.

Among various OOD detection approaches,\npost-hoc detectors have gained significant popularity, primarily due to their\nease of use and implementation. However, the effectiveness of most post-hoc OOD\ndetectors has been constrained as they rely solely either on extreme\ninformation, such as the maximum logit, or on the collective information (i.e.,\ninformation spanned across classes or training samples) embedded within the\noutput layer. In this paper, we propose ExCeL that combines both extreme and\ncollective information within the output layer for enhanced accuracy in OOD\ndetection. We leverage the logit of the top predicted class as the extreme\ninformation (i.e., the maximum logit), while the collective information is\nderived in a novel approach that involves assessing the likelihood of other\nclasses appearing in subsequent ranks across various training samples. Our idea\nis motivated by the observation that, for in-distribution (ID) data, the\nranking of classes beyond the predicted class is more deterministic compared to\nthat in OOD data. Experiments conducted on CIFAR100 and ImageNet-200 datasets\ndemonstrate that ExCeL consistently is among the five top-performing methods\nout of twenty-one existing post-hoc baselines when the joint performance on\nnear-OOD and far-OOD is considered (i.e., in terms of AUROC and FPR95).\nFurthermore, ExCeL shows the best overall performance across both datasets,\nunlike other baselines that work best on one dataset but has a performance drop\nin the other.",

We also show that\nsuch properties are highly transferable across datasets and fidelities,\nproviding fundamental evidence for the success of multi-fidelity and transfer\nlearning methods. These findings are made possible by developing a dedicated\nFLA framework that incorporates a combination of visual and quantitative\nmeasures. We further demonstrate the potential of this framework by analyzing\nthe NAS-Bench-101 landscape, and we believe it is able to faciliate fundamental\nunderstanding of a broader range of AutoML tasks.",

In practical applications, users aspire for\nsolutions that converge to the region of interest (ROI) along the Pareto front\n(PF). While the conventional approach involves approximating a fitness function\nor an objective function to reflect user preferences, this paper explores an\nalternative avenue. Specifically, we aim to discover a method that sidesteps\nthe need for calculating the fitness function, relying solely on human\nfeedback. Our proposed approach entails conducting direct preference learning\nfacilitated by an active dueling bandit algorithm. The experimental phase is\nstructured into three sessions. Firstly, we assess the performance of our\nactive dueling bandit algorithm. Secondly, we implement our proposed method\nwithin the context of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Finally,\nwe deploy our method in a practical problem, specifically in protein structure\nprediction (PSP). This research presents a novel interactive preference-based\nMOEA framework that not only addresses the limitations of traditional\ntechniques but also unveils new possibilities for optimization problems.",

To overcome the time-consuming 3D\nsimulations, we construct a surrogate model, more precisely, a data-driven\nstatistical model. It is trained on 3D simulation data and predicts the\napproximate output much faster. Given the computational cost related to the\nsimulations, there are limitations in the number of training samples that can\nbe generated. In addition, certain applications require a wide range of\nparameters to be sampled, such as the electrical conductivity parameters in a\nsaltwater intrusion case. This chapter is therefore limited to a two-layer\nmodel. We construct a surrogate model that predicts the discrepancy between a\n1D two-layered subsurface model and a deviation of the 1D assumption. The\nlatter response is quickly computed with a semi-analytical 1D forward model.\nThe results are encouraging even with few training samples, but obtaining a\nhigh accuracy is difficult with relatively simple data fit models. We propose\nto view the performance in terms of learning gain, representing the gain from\nthe surrogate model whilst still acknowledging a residual discrepancy.",

Traditional software assurance techniques rely on\nfixed code and do not directly apply to ML models since these algorithms are\nadaptable and learn from curated datasets through a training process.

Brain\nrhythms observed in EEG can also be observed in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) NN\nmodels. Such models allow to study the relationship between waves and neuronal\ncircuit functions, which could lead to fundamental insights to discriminating\nwaves. To address this and other questions, we explore the emergence of high\ngamma rhythms in an E/I balanced neural population of integrated and fire\nneurons with short-term synaptic plasticity. This model generates a rich\nrepertoire of EEG-like rhythms, including high-frequency excitatory and\ninhibitory oscillations. Using the integrated information decomposition\nframework (Phi-ID), we explore the information dynamics of the network and its\nrelationship with excitatory and inhibitory activity and high-frequency\nrhythms. In regions where high gamma rhythms emerge only in the excitatory\npopulation, we see informational properties in the network more favorable for\ncomputation and processing information, corresponding then to functional\nregimes. However, regions where high gamma rhythms also emerge in the\ninhibitory population present lower mutual information in general, and the\nsystem becomes less predictable, a fact that can be linked to a less functional\nor ``pathological\" regime. In the second case, we observe that both excitatory\nand inhibitory populations oscillate with the same dominant frequency, which is\nhigher than in the first case. Higher frequency oscillations and\nsynchronization are commonly associated with epileptic seizures so adopting an\ninformation dynamics approach could help differentiate between high-frequency\noscillations related to cognitive functions from those related to neuronal\ndisorders such as epilepsy.",

Group-based trajectory\nmodelling with dynamic time warping and k-means clustering identified distinct\ntrajectory patterns in dynamic SOFA scores.

Recent observations showed that the radiative\ncores of low mass main sequence stars and red giants rotate orders of magnitude\nslower than classical stellar evolution models predictions and that their\nsurface light elements abundances are too small. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence can enhance the transport in radiative stellar interiors but its\nefficiency is still largely uncertain. Here we explore the transport of AM and\nchemical elements due to azimuthal magnetorotational instability (AMRI) using\n3D MHD direct numerical simulations in a spherical shell. First, we provide\nevidence of AMRI in the parameter regime expected from local and global linear\nstability studies and then we analyze its nonlinear evolution. For unstratified\nflow, we observe AMRI-driven dynamo action at values of the magnetic Prandtl\nnumber Pm in the range $0.6-1$, the smallest ever reported in a global setup.\nWhen considering stable stratification (under the Boussinesq approximation) at\n$\\text{Pm}=1$, the turbulence is instead transitional and becomes less\nhomogeneous and isotropic upon increasing buoyancy effects. We find that the\ntransport of AM occurs radially outwards and is dominated by the Maxwell\nstresses when stratification is large enough. The associated turbulent\nviscosity decreases when buoyancy effects strengthen and scales with the square\nroot of the ratio of the rotation rate to the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency,\npredicting that, for example, red giant cores may reach a state of uniform\nrotation in a few thousand years. A passive scalar allows us to study the\ntransport of chemical elements. The chemical turbulent diffusion coefficient\nscales with stratification similarly to the turbulent viscosity but is lower in\namplitude as suggested by recent stellar evolution models of low mass stars.",

            "summary": "The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying\nmachine learning models in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe that\nthe singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features\nare quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant\nsingular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples\nare largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose\n\\texttt{RankFeat}, a simple yet effective \\emph{post hoc} approach for OOD\ndetection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value\nand the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature.\n\\texttt{RankFeat} achieves \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance and reduces the\naverage false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90\\% compared with the previous best\nmethod. The success of \\texttt{RankFeat} motivates us to investigate whether a\nsimilar phenomenon would exist in the parameter matrices of neural networks. We\nthus propose \\texttt{RankWeight} which removes the rank-1 weight from the\nparameter matrices of a single deep layer. Our \\texttt{RankWeight}is also\n\\emph{post hoc} and only requires computing the rank-1 matrix once. As a\nstandalone approach, \\texttt{RankWeight} has very competitive performance\nagainst other methods across various backbones. Moreover, \\texttt{RankWeight}\nenjoys flexible compatibility with a wide range of OOD detection methods. The\ncombination of \\texttt{RankWeight} and \\texttt{RankFeat} refreshes the new\n\\emph{state-of-the-art} performance, achieving the FPR95 as low as 16.13\\% on\nthe ImageNet-1k benchmark. Extensive ablation studies and comprehensive\ntheoretical analyses are presented to support the empirical results.",

Specifically, the energy\nof the system as a function of ionic separation is determined by solving the\nDyson equation for the positron in the field of the two anions, using a\npositron-anion self energy as constructed in [J. Hofierka, B. Cunningham, C. M.\nRawlins, C. H. Patterson and D. G.

Calculations are performed for a positron\ninteracting with H$_{2}^{2-}$, F$_{2}^{2-}$, and Cl$_{2}^{2-}$, and are found\nto be in good agreement with previous theory. In particular, we confirm the\npresence of two minima in the potential energy of the [H$^-;e^+$;H$^-$] system\nwith respect to ionic separation: one a positronically-bonded [H$^-;e^+$;H$^-$]\nlocal minimum at ionic separations $r\\sim3.4$~\\AA\\phantom{}, and a global\nminimum at smaller ionic separations $r\\lesssim1.6$~\\AA\\phantom{} that gives\noverall instability of the system with respect to dissociation into a H$_2$\nmolecule and a positronium negative ion, Ps$^-$. The first predictions are made\nfor positronic bonding in dianions consisting of molecular anionic fragments,\nspecifically for (CN)$_{2}^{2-}$, and (NCO)$_{2}^{2-}$.

            "summary": "Graph clustering has been popularly studied in recent years. However, most\nexisting graph clustering methods focus on node-level clustering, i.e.,\ngrouping nodes in a single graph into clusters. In contrast, graph-level\nclustering, i.e., grouping multiple graphs into clusters, remains largely\nunexplored. Graph-level clustering is critical in a variety of real-world\napplications, such as, properties prediction of molecules and community\nanalysis in social networks. However, graph-level clustering is challenging due\nto the insufficient discriminability of graph-level representations, and the\ninsufficient discriminability makes deep clustering be more likely to obtain\ndegenerate solutions (cluster collapse). To address the issue, we propose a\nnovel deep graph-level clustering method called Uniform Deep Graph Clustering\n(UDGC). UDGC assigns instances evenly to different clusters and then scatters\nthose clusters on unit hypersphere, leading to a more uniform cluster-level\ndistribution and a slighter cluster collapse. Specifically, we first propose\nAugmentation-Consensus Optimal Transport (ACOT) for generating uniformly\ndistributed and reliable pseudo labels for partitioning clusters. Then we adopt\ncontrastive learning to scatter those clusters. Besides, we propose Center\nAlignment Optimal Transport (CAOT) for guiding the model to learn better\nparameters, which further promotes the cluster performance. Our empirical study\non eight well-known datasets demonstrates that UDGC significantly outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art models.",

Most SFOD\nmethods follow the same self-training paradigm using mean-teacher (MT)\nframework where the student model is guided by only one single teacher model.\nHowever, such paradigm can easily fall into a training instability problem that\nwhen the teacher model collapses uncontrollably due to the domain shift, the\nstudent model also suffers drastic performance degradation. To address this\nissue, we propose the Periodically Exchange Teacher-Student (PETS) method, a\nsimple yet novel approach that introduces a multiple-teacher framework\nconsisting of a static teacher, a dynamic teacher, and a student model. During\nthe training phase, we periodically exchange the weights between the static\nteacher and the student model. Then, we update the dynamic teacher using the\nmoving average of the student model that has already been exchanged by the\nstatic teacher. In this way, the dynamic teacher can integrate knowledge from\npast periods, effectively reducing error accumulation and enabling a more\nstable training process within the MT-based framework. Further, we develop a\nconsensus mechanism to merge the predictions of two teacher models to provide\nhigher-quality pseudo labels for student model.

However, existing\nstudies mainly focus on learning and predicting the commonality of facial\nattractiveness, with little attention given to Personalized Facial Beauty\nPrediction (PFBP). PFBP aims to develop a machine that can adapt to individual\naesthetic preferences with only a few images rated by each user. In this paper,\nwe formulate this task from a meta-learning perspective that each user\ncorresponds to a meta-task. To address such PFBP task, we draw inspiration from\nthe human aesthetic mechanism that visual aesthetics in society follows a\nGaussian distribution, which motivates us to disentangle user preferences into\na commonality and an individuality part. To this end, we propose a novel\nMetaFBP framework, in which we devise a universal feature extractor to capture\nthe aesthetic commonality and then optimize to adapt the aesthetic\nindividuality by shifting the decision boundary of the predictor via a\nmeta-learning mechanism. Unlike conventional meta-learning methods that may\nstruggle with slow adaptation or overfitting to tiny support sets, we propose a\nnovel approach that optimizes a high-order predictor for fast adaptation. In\norder to validate the performance of the proposed method, we build several PFBP\nbenchmarks by using existing facial beauty prediction datasets rated by\nnumerous users. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed MetaFBP method.",

            "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and people's daily\nlives in unprecedented ways. To make appropriate decisions, it is necessary to\ndiagnose COVID-19 rapidly and accurately. Clinical decision making is\ninfluenced by data collected from patients. With the aid of artificial\nintelligence, COVID-19 has been diagnosed quickly by analyzing symptoms,\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR), computed tomography scans, chest X-rays,\nroutine laboratory blood tests and even cough sounds. Furthermore, these data\ncan be used to predict a patient's morality, although there is a question about\nwhich data makes the most accurate predictions. Therefore, this study consists\nof two parts. Our first objective is to examine whether machine learning\nalgorithms can predict the outcome of COVID-19 cases (recovery or death), based\non the features present in the dataset. In the second part of the research, we\ninvestigated the impact of clinical and RT-PCR on prediction of recovery and\ndecease to determine which one is more reliable. We defined four stages with\ndifferent feature sets and use six machine learning methods to build prediction\nmodel. With an accuracy of 78.7%, random forest showed promising results for\npredicting death and recovery of patients. Based on this, it appears that\nrecovery and decease of patients are predictable using machine learning. For\nsecond objective, results indicate that clinical alone (without using RT-PCR),\ntrained with AdaBoost algorithm, is the most accurate with an accuracy of\n82.1%. This study can provide guidance for medical professionals in the event\nof a crisis or outbreak similar to COVID-19.",

            "summary": "We present a novel methodology for deriving high-order quadrature rules\n(HOSQ) designed for the integration of scalar functions over regular embedded\nmanifolds. To construct the rules, we introduce square-squeezing--a\nhomeomorphic multilinear hypercube-simplex transformation--reparametrizing an\ninitial flat triangulation of the manifold to a hypercube mesh. By employing\nsquare-squeezing, we approximate the integrand and the volume element for each\nhypercube domain of the reparameterized mesh through interpolation in\nChebyshev-Lobatto grids. This strategy circumvents the Runge phenomenon,\nreplacing the initial integral with a closed-form expression that can be\nprecisely computed by high-order quadratures. We prove novel bounds of the\nintegration error in terms of the $r^\\text{th}$-order total variation of the\nintegrand and the surface parameterization, predicting high algebraic\napproximation rates that scale solely with the interpolation degree and not, as\nis common, with the average simplex size. For smooth integrals whose total\nvariation is constantly bounded with increasing $r$, the estimates prove the\nintegration error to decrease even exponentially, while mesh refinements are\nlimited to achieve algebraic rates. The resulting approximation power is\ndemonstrated in several numerical experiments, particularly showcasing\n$p$-refinements to overcome the limitations of $h$-refinements for highly\nvarying smooth integrals.",

            "summary": "Compositional zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen state-object\ncompositions by leveraging known primitives (state and object) during training.\nHowever, effectively modeling interactions between primitives and generalizing\nknowledge to novel compositions remains a perennial challenge. There are two\nkey factors: object-conditioned and state-conditioned variance, i.e., the\nappearance of states (or objects) can vary significantly when combined with\ndifferent objects (or states). For instance, the state \"old\" can signify a\nvintage design for a \"car\" or an advanced age for a \"cat\". In this paper, we\nargue that these variances can be mitigated by predicting composition\ncategories based on pre-observed primitive. To this end, we propose Progressive\nLanguage-based Observations (PLO), which can dynamically determine a better\nobservation order of primitives. These observations comprise a series of\nconcepts or languages that allow the model to understand image content in a\nstep-by-step manner. Specifically, PLO adopts pre-trained vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) to empower the model with observation capabilities. We further\ndevise two variants: 1) PLO-VLM: a two-step method, where a pre-observing\nclassifier dynamically determines the observation order of two primitives. 2)\nPLO-LLM: a multi-step scheme, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to\ncraft composition-specific prompts for step-by-step observing. Extensive\nablations on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of PLO\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods, affirming its abilities in\ncompositional recognition.",

PointPCA+ employs PCA\nonly on the geometry data while enriching existing geometry and texture\ndescriptors, that are computed more efficiently. Similarly to PointPCA, a total\nquality score is obtained through a learning-based fusion of individual\npredictions from geometry and texture descriptors that capture local shape and\nappearance properties, respectively. Before feature fusion, a feature selection\nmodule is introduced to choose the most effective features from a proposed\nsuper-set.

Next, we obtain deterministic\nequivalents (DEs) for the OLP and the minimum SINR, which are then used to\noptimise the PBM.

We first analyze the linear\nstability of the film, providing an analytical dispersion relation. When the\nviscosity of the outer bath is much larger than that of the film, $\\lambda \\gg\n1$, the most amplified wavenumber decreases as $k_{\\textrm{m}} \\sim\n\\lambda^{-1/3}$, indicating that very slender dewetting structures are expected\nwhen $\\lambda$ becomes large. We then perform fully nonlinear simulations of\nthe complete Stokes equations to investigate the spatial structure of the flow\nclose to rupture revealing that the flow becomes self-similar with the minimum\nfilm thickness scaling as $h_{min} = K(\\lambda) \\tau^{1/3}$ when $\\tau \\to 0$,\nwhere $\\tau$ is the time remaining before the singularity. It is demonstrated\nthat the presence of an outer liquid bath affects the self-similar structure\nthrough the prefactor of the film thinning law, $K(\\lambda)$, and the opening\nangle of the self-similar film shape, which is shown to decrease with\n$\\lambda$.",

The configuration is known to be unstable due to the competition of\nthe destabilizing van der Waals (vdW) forces and the stabilizing surface\ntension force. The governing equations of motion written in the Stokes limit of\nnegligible liquid inertia and an accompanying lubrication model are linearised\nabout the zero-velocity base state and decomposed into normal modes in order to\nobtain the temporal dispersion relation. Discrete unstable modes are identified\nand tracked as a function of a capillary number $Ca$ measuring the relative\nimportance of surface tension to vdW forces and the film aspect ratio $\\eta =\nR/h_o$. For small enough values of the capillary number only the first polar\nmode is unstable, and the corresponding maximum growth rate is shown to be a\nuniversal function of $\\eta$. Lubrication theory is seen to provide a good\nquantitative prediction of the film stability properties for $\\eta\\gg 1$.",

This begs the\nfollowing question: How can we effectively transfer text-level semantic\ndependencies to help image compression, which is only available to the decoder?\nIn this work, we propose a novel deep image compression method with text-guided\nside information to achieve a better rate-perception-distortion tradeoff.\nSpecifically, we employ the CLIP text encoder and an effective Semantic-Spatial\nAware block to fuse the text and image features. This is done by predicting a\nsemantic mask to guide the learned text-adaptive affine transformation at the\npixel level. Furthermore, we design a text-conditional generative adversarial\nnetworks to improve the perceptual quality of reconstructed images.

Although\nvarious model averaging methods have been developed, there are few literatures\non the theoretical properties of model averaging from the perspective of\nstability, and the majority of these methods constrain model weights to a\nsimplex. The aim of this paper is to introduce stability from statistical\nlearning theory into model averaging. Thus, we define the stability, asymptotic\nempirical risk minimizer, generalization, and consistency of model averaging\nand study the relationship among them. Our results indicate that stability can\nensure that model averaging has good generalization performance and consistency\nunder reasonable conditions, where consistency means model averaging estimator\ncan asymptotically minimize the mean squared prediction error. We also propose\na L2-penalty model averaging method without limiting model weights and prove\nthat it has stability and consistency. In order to reduce the impact of tuning\nparameter selection, we use 10-fold cross-validation to select a candidate set\nof tuning parameters and perform a weighted average of the estimators of model\nweights based on estimation errors. The Monte Carlo simulation and an\nillustrative application demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.",

            "summary": "Extreme quantiles are critical for understanding the behavior of data in the\ntail region of a distribution. It is challenging to estimate extreme quantiles,\nparticularly when dealing with limited data in the tail. In such cases, extreme\nvalue theory offers a solution by approximating the tail distribution using the\nGeneralized Pareto Distribution (GPD). This allows for the extrapolation beyond\nthe range of observed data, making it a valuable tool for various applications.\nHowever, when it comes to conditional cases, where estimation relies on\ncovariates, existing methods may require computationally expensive GPD fitting\nfor different observations. This computational burden becomes even more\nproblematic as the volume of observations increases, sometimes approaching\ninfinity. To address this issue, we propose an interpolation-based algorithm\nnamed EMI. EMI facilitates the online prediction of extreme conditional\nquantiles with finite offline observations. Combining quantile regression and\nGPD-based extrapolation, EMI formulates as a bilevel programming problem,\nefficiently solvable using classic optimization methods. Once estimates for\noffline observations are obtained, EMI employs B-spline interpolation for\ncovariate-dependent variables, enabling estimation for online observations with\nfinite GPD fitting. Simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the\neffectiveness of EMI across various scenarios.",

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to\nprocess such signals effectively. However, previous research has primarily\nfocused on classifying medical time series rather than attempting to regress\nthe continuous-valued physiological parameters central to diagnosis. One\nsignificant challenge in this regard is the imbalanced nature of the dataset,\nas a low prevalence of abnormal conditions can lead to heavily skewed data that\nresults in inaccurate predictions and a lack of certainty in such predictions\nwhen deployed. To address these challenges, we propose HypUC, a framework for\nimbalanced probabilistic regression in medical time series, making several\ncontributions. (i) We introduce a simple kernel density-based technique to\ntackle the imbalanced regression problem with medical time series. (ii)\nMoreover, we employ a probabilistic regression framework that allows\nuncertainty estimation for the predicted continuous values. (iii) We also\npresent a new approach to calibrate the predicted uncertainty further.

We identify that the bispectrum\nconsists of a fixed contribution following from the power spectrum and a linear\ncombination of terms depending on five free parameters defining the cubic\nperturbations to the DHOST model. The former peaks in the squeezed limit, while\nthe latter is maximised in the equilateral limit. We directly confront the\nmodel predictions to the CMB bispectrum statistics via the public code CMB-BEST\nand marginalize over the free parameters. We explicitly show that there are\nviable DHOST inflationary models satisfying both power spectrum and bispectrum\nconstraints from Planck. However, rather surprisingly, the constraints exclude\ncertain models at the $6\\sigma$-level even though they pass the conventional\nfudge factor tests. In this case and despite having a handful of free\nparameters, the model's large squeezed bispectrum cannot be cancelled out\nwithout introducing a large bispectrum in other limits which are strongly\nconstrained by Planck's non-detection of primordial non-Gaussianity. We\nemphasize that first-order approximations such as fudge factors, albeit\ncommonly used in the literature, may be misleading and provide weaker\nconstraints.

However, a major challenge in\ncurrent inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational\nand/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for\ndesigning micro-scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear\nmechanical behaviors. Here, we introduce a new end-to-end scientific ML\nframework, leveraging deep neural operators (DeepONet), to directly learn the\nrelationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of\narchitected metamaterials from sparse but high-quality in situ experimental\ndata. The approach facilitates the inverse design of structures tailored to\nspecific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from spinodal\nmicrostructures, printed using two-photon lithography, reveal that the\nprediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 - 10%. Our\nwork underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced\nmicro-mechanics experimental techniques, the design of complex\nmicro-architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in\nscenarios constrained by data scarcity. Our work marks a significant\nadvancement in the field of materials-by-design, potentially heralding a new\nera in the discovery and development of next-generation metamaterials with\nunparalleled mechanical characteristics derived directly from experimental\ninsights.",

This\nstudy introduces the Automated Model Training (AMT) Graphical User Interface\n(GUI), specifically crafted for the use of researchers and scientists without a\nprogramming background to design the next set of experiments either in a\nchemistry lab or on the computer. The GUI integrates diverse machine learning\nmodels, such as XG-Boost, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Linear\nRegression, Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Stack Regressors, offering a\nrobust toolkit for data analysis. It facilitates the exploration of complex\nrelationships, non-linear patterns, and predictive accuracy optimization. To\nfurther enhance its utility, the GUI integrates the Particle Swarm Optimization\n(PSO) technique, allowing researchers to systematically explore vast parameter\nspaces and identify optimal experimental conditions. This synergy between\nmachine learning and PSO empowers material scientists through a user-friendly\nplatform for data-driven discovery.

To address this issue, we propose treating active recognition as a\nsequential evidence-gathering process, providing by-step uncertainty\nquantification and reliable prediction under the evidence combination theory.\nAdditionally, the reward function developed in this paper effectively\ncharacterizes the merit of actions when operating in open-world environments.\nTo evaluate the performance, we collect a dataset from an indoor simulator,\nencompassing various recognition challenges such as distance, occlusion levels,\nand visibility.

To\nenhance energy aggregation in TECs, we propose an FL-assisted distributed\nConsensus + Innovations approach.

            "summary": "We have revisited the spin dynamics in intermediate-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions based on the improved spin- and isospin-dependent\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, particularly with the constraint\nof rigorous angular momentum conservation incorporated. We have studied the\nspin polarization of free nucleons and tritons/$^3$He as well as the spin\nalignment of deuterons, and predicted the flow splittings for their different\nspin states. We have also demonstrated that the spin-dependent potential may\nenhance dissipations and thus have a non-negligible effect on the spin-averaged\ntransverse flow at low collision energies. When rigorous angular momentum\nconservation in each spin-dependent nucleon-nucleon collision is incorporated,\nit affects the overall dynamics, the flow, and also the spin polarization,\nwhile the effects of the spin-orbit potential on the spin-related observables\nare still appreciable. The well-developed SIBUU model could be further extended\nto include hyperons or vector mesons, or used as a hadronic afterburner for\nspin-related studies in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, with more inelastic\nchannels incorporated in the future.",

In this work, we present the first implementation of a microstructural\nDST model in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation. The scalar model\nwas implemented in an SPH scheme and tested in two flow geometries. Three\ndistinct ratios of local to non-local microstructural effects were probed:\nweak, moderate, and strong non-locality. Strong and moderate cases yielded\nexcellent agreement with flow curves constructed via the Wyart--Cates (WC)\nmodel, with the moderate case exhibiting banding patterns. Weak non-locality\nproduced stress-splitting instability, resulting in discontinuous stress fields\nand poor agreement with the WC model. The mechanism of the stress-splitting has\nbeen explored and contextualised by the interaction of local microstructure\nevolution and the stress-control scheme. Velocity profiles obtained in body\nforce-driven channel flow were found to be in excellent agreement with the\nanalytical solution, yielding an upward inflection corresponding to the typical\nS-curve. Simulations carried out at increasing driving forces exhibited a\ndecrease in flow. We showed that even the simple scalar model can capture some\nof the key properties of DST materials, laying the foundation for further SPH\nstudy of instabilities and pattern formation.",

These attacks are done to compromise the confidentiality of the\nmodel by going through the sensitive training data from the model's\npredictions. By analyzing the model's responses, attackers aim to reconstruct\nsensitive information. In this way, the model's data privacy is compromised.\nAdversarial attacks, mainly employed on computer vision models, are made to\ncorrupt models into confidently making incorrect predictions through malicious\ntesting data.

Reindeer herders are used to coping with adverse weather, climate, and\ngrazing conditions through autonomous adaptation. However, todays rapidly\nchanging Arctic environment poses new challenges to the management of herding\nactivities. Finding means for combining traditional and scientific knowledge\nwithout depriving any of the systems of its fundamental strengths is hence\ndeemed necessary. We apply a transdisciplinary framework for knowledge\nco-production involving international researchers and reindeer herders from\ndifferent cooperatives in northern Finland. Through climate change adaptation\nstories, we co-explore how climate predictions can inform herders decision\nmaking during the herding season. Relevant decisions include the anticipation\nof summer harvest time, the inopportune periods of cold weather in spring, and\ninsect harassment in summer. The analysis of two different adaptation stories\nshows that seasonal predictions of temperature for May and June can\nsuccessfully advise about the likelihood of having an earlier than normal\nharvest. Likewise, sub-seasonal predictions of temperature during April and May\ncan be useful to anticipate the occurrence of backwinter episodes, which can\nsupport herders in deciding whether to feed reindeer in pens for longer,\navoiding putting the survival of calves at risk. This study, which would\nbenefit from co-evaluation in real world settings and consideration of\nadditional adaptation stories, sets the basis for a successful co-production of\nclimate services with Arctic reindeer herders. This research shows the\npotential to enhance the resilience of Polar regions, offering opportunities\nfor adaptation while supporting the sustainability and culture of traditional\npractices of Arctic communities.",

            "summary": "In this survey, we review the recent advances in control design methods for\nrobotic multi-agent systems (MAS), focussing on learning-based methods with\nsafety considerations. We start by reviewing various notions of safety and\nliveness properties, and modeling frameworks used for problem formulation of\nMAS. Then we provide a comprehensive review of learning-based methods for safe\ncontrol design for multi-robot systems. We start with various types of\nshielding-based methods, such as safety certificates, predictive filters, and\nreachability tools. Then, we review the current state of control barrier\ncertificate learning in both a centralized and distributed manner, followed by\na comprehensive review of multi-agent reinforcement learning with a particular\nfocus on safety. Next, we discuss the state-of-the-art verification tools for\nthe correctness of learning-based methods. Based on the capabilities and the\nlimitations of the state of the art methods in learning and verification for\nMAS, we identify various broad themes for open challenges: how to design\nmethods that can achieve good performance along with safety guarantees; how to\ndecompose single-agent based centralized methods for MAS; how to account for\ncommunication-related practical issues; and how to assess transfer of\ntheoretical guarantees to practice.",

            "summary": "This study employs Bayesian methodologies to explore the influence of player\nor positional factors in predicting the probability of a shot resulting in a\ngoal, measured by the expected goals (xG) metric. Utilising publicly available\ndata from StatsBomb, Bayesian hierarchical logistic regressions are\nconstructed, analysing approximately 10,000 shots from the English Premier\nLeague to ascertain whether positional or player-level effects impact xG. The\nfindings reveal positional effects in a basic model that includes only distance\nto goal and shot angle as predictors, highlighting that strikers and attacking\nmidfielders exhibit a higher likelihood of scoring. However, these effects\ndiminish when more informative predictors are introduced. Nevertheless, even\nwith additional predictors, player-level effects persist, indicating that\ncertain players possess notable positive or negative xG adjustments,\ninfluencing their likelihood of scoring a given chance. The study extends its\nanalysis to data from Spain's La Liga and Germany's Bundesliga, yielding\ncomparable results. Additionally, the paper assesses the impact of prior\ndistribution choices on outcomes, concluding that the priors employed in the\nmodels provide sound results but could be refined to enhance sampling\nefficiency for constructing more complex and extensive models feasibly.",

Such states, however, are\nrarely observed in the lowest-energy Landau level, namely at filling factors\n$\\nu<1$. Here we report evidence for an even-denominator FQHS at $\\nu=1/4$ in\nultra-high-quality two-dimensional hole systems confined to modulation-doped\nGaAs quantum wells. We observe a deep minimum in the longitudinal resistance at\n$\\nu=1/4$, superimposed on a highly insulating background, suggesting a close\ncompetition between the $\\nu=1/4$ FQHS and the magnetic-field-induced, pinned\nWigner solid states. Our experimental observations are consistent with the very\nrecent theoretical calculations which predict that substantial Landau level\nmixing, caused by the large hole effective mass, can induce composite fermion\npairing and lead to a non-Abelian FQHS at $\\nu=1/4$. Our results demonstrate\nthat Landau level mixing can provide a very potent means for tuning the\ninteraction between composite fermions and creating new non-Abelian FQHSs.",

In this model, the opinion of each agent can take the\nthree discrete values, the extreme ones $\\pm 1$, and also the intermediate\nvalue 0, and it can evolve through kinetic exchange when interacting with\nanother agent, or independently, by stochastic choice (noise). The probability\nof change by pairwise interactions depends on the age that the agent has\nremained in the same state, according to a given kernel. We particularly\ndevelop the cases where the probability decays either algebraically or\nexponentially with the age, and we also consider the anti-aging scenario where\nthe probability increases with the age, meaning that it is more likely to\nchange mind the longer the persistence in the current state. For the opinion\ndynamics in a complete graph, we obtain analytical predictions for the critical\ncurves of the order parameters, in perfect agreement with agent-based\nsimulations. We observe that sufficiently weak aging (slow change of the kernel\nwith the age) favors partial consensus with respect to the aging-insensitive\nscenario, while for sufficiently strong aging, as well as for anti-aging, the\nopposite trend is observed.",

By injecting Gaussian noise into the PC inference\nprocedure we re-envision it as an overdamped Langevin sampling, which\nfacilitates optimisation with respect to a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO).\nWe improve the resultant encoder-free training method by incorporating an\nencoder network to provide an amortised warm-start to our Langevin sampling and\ntest three different objectives for doing so. Finally, to increase robustness\nto the sampling step size and reduce sensitivity to curvature, we validate a\nlightweight and easily computable form of preconditioning, inspired by Riemann\nManifold Langevin and adaptive optimizers from the SGD literature. We compare\nagainst VAEs by training like-for-like generative models using our technique\nagainst those trained with standard reparameterisation-trick-based ELBOs.

State-of-the-art numerical\nsimulations successfully reproduce many observed properties of galaxies and can\nbe used as a source of mock observations and predictions. Many gravitational\nlensing studies aim at constraining the nature of dark matter, discriminating\nbetween cold dark matter and alternative models. However, many past results are\nbased on the comparison to simulations that did not include baryonic physics.\nHere we show that the presence of baryons can significantly alter the\npredictions: we look at the structural properties (profiles and shapes) of\nelliptical galaxies and at the inner density slope of subhaloes. Our results\ndemonstrate that future simulations must model the interplay between baryons\nand alternative dark matter, to generate realistic predictions that could\nsignificantly modify the current constraints.",

We evaluate the performance of\nfrequently used models, such as the standard NFW, the Einasto, and a smoothly\ntruncated version of the NFW profile. We find that these models do not perform\nwell for the majority of subhaloes, with the NFW profile giving the worst fit\nin most cases. This is primarily due to mismatches in the inner and outer\nlogarithmic slopes, which are significantly steeper for a large number of\nsubhaloes in the presence of baryons. To address this issue, we propose new\nthree-parameter models and show that they significantly improve the goodness of\nfit independently of the subhalo's specific properties. Our best-performing\nmodel is a modified version of the NFW profile with an inner log-slope of -2\nand a variable truncation that is sharper and steeper than the slope transition\nin the standard NFW profile. Additionally, we investigate how both the\nparameter values of the best density profile model and the average density\nprofiles vary with subhalo mass, $V_\\mathrm{max}$, distance from the host halo\ncentre, baryon content and infall time, and we also present explicit scaling\nrelations for the mean parameters of the individual profiles. The newly\nproposed fit and the scaling relations are useful to predict the properties of\nrealistic subhaloes in the mass range $10^8$ M$_\\odot$ $\\leq M_\\mathrm{sh}\n\\leq$ $10^{13}$ M$_\\odot$ that can be influenced by the presence of baryons.",

This information comes in two\nguises: it bounds the maximal spin of exchanged particles of a given mass; it\nleads to sum rules obeyed by the discontinuity of the amplitude, which express\nthe softness of scattering at high energies. We assume that the leading Regge\ntrajectory is linear, and we derive bounds on the low-energy Wilson\ncoefficients using the dual and primal approaches. For the graviton-graviton\nscattering in four dimensions, the maximal spin constraint leads to slightly\nmore stringent bounds than those that follow from general constraints of\nanalyticity, crossing, and unitarity. The exponential softness at high energies\nis manifest in our primal approach and is not used in our implementation of the\ndual approach. Nevertheless, we observe the agreement between the bounds\nobtained from both. We conclude that high-energy superpolynomial softness does\nnot leave an obvious imprint on the low-energy observables. We exhibit a\nunitary three-parameter deformation of the Veneziano amplitude for the open\nstring case. It has a novel, exponentially soft behavior at high energies and\nfixed angles.

            "summary": "Modern learning-based approaches to 3D-aware image synthesis achieve high\nphotorealism and 3D-consistent viewpoint changes for the generated images.\nExisting approaches represent instances in a shared canonical space. However,\nfor in-the-wild datasets a shared canonical system can be difficult to define\nor might not even exist. In this work, we instead model instances in view\nspace, alleviating the need for posed images and learned camera distributions.\nWe find that in this setting, existing GAN-based methods are prone to\ngenerating flat geometry and struggle with distribution coverage. We hence\npropose WildFusion, a new approach to 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent\ndiffusion models (LDMs). We first train an autoencoder that infers a compressed\nlatent representation, which additionally captures the images' underlying 3D\nstructure and enables not only reconstruction but also novel view synthesis. To\nlearn a faithful 3D representation, we leverage cues from monocular depth\nprediction. Then, we train a diffusion model in the 3D-aware latent space,\nthereby enabling synthesis of high-quality 3D-consistent image samples,\noutperforming recent state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. Importantly, our\n3D-aware LDM is trained without any direct supervision from multiview images or\n3D geometry and does not require posed images or learned pose or camera\ndistributions. It directly learns a 3D representation without relying on\ncanonical camera coordinates. This opens up promising research avenues for\nscalable 3D-aware image synthesis and 3D content creation from in-the-wild\nimage data.

Though\ninterpretable, such modular design tends to introduce a substantial amount of\nredundancy. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLM) and diffusion\ntechniques have demonstrated their superior performance on comprehension and\ngeneration ability. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of\ninterleaved vision-action pair, which unifies the format of visual features and\ncontrol signals. Based on the vision-action pairs, we construct a general world\nmodel based on MLLM and diffusion model for autonomous driving, termed\nADriver-I. It takes the vision-action pairs as inputs and autoregressively\npredicts the control signal of the current frame. The generated control signals\ntogether with the historical vision-action pairs are further conditioned to\npredict the future frames. With the predicted next frame, ADriver-I performs\nfurther control signal prediction. Such a process can be repeated infinite\ntimes, ADriver-I achieves autonomous driving in the world created by itself.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes and our large-scale private\ndatasets.

            "summary": "Recent advances in cold atom platforms, providing experimental accessibility\nto real-time dynamics, have renewed interest in the motion of superfluid\nvortices in two-dimensional domains. Motivated by this development, we study\nthe dynamics of a vortex in a two-dimensional incompressible superfluid inside\nan elliptical boundary. Employing the Joukowsky conformal map from a circle to\nan ellipse, we derive an analytical expression for the complex potential\ndescribing the hydrodynamic flow around the vortex. We integrate the resulting\nequations of motion, finding that the vortex moves along a nearly (but not\nexactly) elliptical trajectory. In addition, we obtain a simple closed\nexpression for the vortex self-energy, which serves as the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem.",

Specifically, we consider a\nnested sequences of function subspaces $\\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0} \\subseteq\n\\cdots \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_L$, where $\\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)}$ is a family\nof functions spanned by B-spline basis functions of order $p$, $f_l^*$ is the\nprojection of $f$ on $\\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)}$ and encoded as low-pass coefficients\n$F_l^*$, and $g_l^*$ is the residual function in orthogonal subspace\n$\\mathcal{G}_l^{(p)}$ (where $\\mathcal{G}_l^{(p)} \\oplus \\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)} =\n\\mathcal{F}_{l+1}^{(p)}$) and encoded as high-pass coefficients $G_l^*$.

For the prediction, we formalize RAHT(1) linear\nprediction in MPEG-PCC in a theoretical framework, and propose a new nonlinear\npredictor using a polynomial of bilateral filter. We derive equations to\nefficiently compute the critically sampled high-pass coefficients $G_l^*$\namenable to encoding. We optimize parameters in our resulting feed-forward\nnetwork on a large training set of point clouds by minimizing a rate-distortion\nLagrangian.

            "summary": "In this paper, we introduce DiffusionMat, a novel image matting framework\nthat employs a diffusion model for the transition from coarse to refined alpha\nmattes. Diverging from conventional methods that utilize trimaps merely as\nloose guidance for alpha matte prediction, our approach treats image matting as\na sequential refinement learning process. This process begins with the addition\nof noise to trimaps and iteratively denoises them using a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel, which incrementally guides the prediction towards a clean alpha matte.\nThe key innovation of our framework is a correction module that adjusts the\noutput at each denoising step, ensuring that the final result is consistent\nwith the input image's structures. We also introduce the Alpha Reliability\nPropagation, a novel technique designed to maximize the utility of available\nguidance by selectively enhancing the trimap regions with confident alpha\ninformation, thus simplifying the correction task. To train the correction\nmodule, we devise specialized loss functions that target the accuracy of the\nalpha matte's edges and the consistency of its opaque and transparent regions.\nWe evaluate our model across several image matting benchmarks, and the results\nindicate that DiffusionMat consistently outperforms existing methods.

            "summary": "We investigate the approximations needed to efficiently predict the\nlarge-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos in beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM\nscenarios. We examine the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model,\nthe Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model, a slowly evolving dark energy, an interacting dark\nenergy model and massive neutrinos. For each, we test approximations for the\nperturbative kernel calculations, including the omission of screening terms and\nthe use of perturbative kernels based on the Einstein-de Sitter universe; we\nexplore different infrared-resummation schemes, tracer bias models and a linear\ntreatment of massive neutrinos; we employ two models for redshift space\ndistortions, the Taruya-Nishimishi-Saito prescription and the Effective Field\nTheory of Large-Scale Structure. This work further provides a preliminary\nvalidation of the codes being considered by Euclid for the spectroscopic\nclustering probe in beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM scenarios. We calculate and compare the\n$\\chi^2$ statistic to assess the different modelling choices. This is done by\nfitting the spectroscopic clustering predictions to measurements from numerical\nsimulations and perturbation theory-based mock data. We compare the behaviour\nof this statistic in the beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM cases, as a function of the\nmaximum scale included in the fit, to the baseline $\\Lambda$CDM case. We find\nthat the Einstein-de Sitter approximation without screening is surprisingly\naccurate for all cases when comparing to the halo clustering monopole and\nquadrupole obtained from simulations. Our results suggest that the inclusion of\nmultiple redshift bins, higher-order multipoles, higher-order clustering\nstatistics (such as the bispectrum) and photometric probes such as weak\nlensing, will be essential to extract information on massive neutrinos,\nmodified gravity and dark energy.",

            "summary": "Data entry forms use completeness requirements to specify the fields that are\nrequired or optional to fill for collecting necessary information from\ndifferent types of users.\n  However, some required fields may not be applicable for certain types of\nusers anymore. Nevertheless, they may still be incorrectly marked as required\nin the form; we call such fields obsolete required fields.\n  Since obsolete required fields usually have not-null validation checks before\nsubmitting the form, users have to enter meaningless values in such fields in\norder to complete the form submission. These meaningless values threaten the\nquality of the filled data. To avoid users filling meaningless values, existing\ntechniques usually rely on manually written rules to identify the obsolete\nrequired fields and relax their completeness requirements. However, these\ntechniques are ineffective and costly. In this paper, we propose LACQUER, a\nlearning-based automated approach for relaxing the completeness requirements of\ndata entry forms. LACQUER builds Bayesian Network models to automatically learn\nconditions under which users had to fill meaningless values. To improve its\nlearning ability, LACQUER identifies the cases where a required field is only\napplicable for a small group of users, and uses SMOTE, an oversampling\ntechnique, to generate more instances on such fields for effectively mining\ndependencies on them. Our experimental results show that LACQUER can accurately\nrelax the completeness requirements of required fields in data entry forms with\nprecision values ranging between 0.76 and 0.90 on different datasets. LACQUER\ncan prevent users from filling 20% to 64% of meaningless values, with negative\npredictive values between 0.72 and 0.91. Furthermore, LACQUER is efficient; it\ntakes at most 839 ms to predict the completeness requirement of an instance.",

            "summary": "Transiting planets with orbital periods longer than 40 d are extremely rare\namong the 5000+ planets discovered so far. The lack of discoveries of this\npopulation poses a challenge to research into planetary demographics,\nformation, and evolution. Here, we present the detection and characterization\nof HD88986b, a potentially transiting sub-Neptune, possessing the longest\norbital period among known transiting small planets (< 4 R$_{\\oplus}$) with a\nprecise mass measurement ($\\sigma_M/M$ > 25%). Additionally, we identified the\npresence of a massive companion in a wider orbit around HD88986. Our analysis\nreveals that HD88986b, based on two potential single transits on sector 21 and\nsector 48 which are both consistent with the predicted transit time from the RV\nmodel, is potentially transiting. The joint analysis of RV and photometric data\nshow that HD88986b has a radius of 2.49$\\pm$0.18 R$_{\\oplus}$, a mass of\n17.2$^{+4.0}_{-3.8}$ M$_{\\oplus}$, and it orbits every 146.05$^{+0.43}_{-0.40}$\nd around a subgiant HD88986 which is one of the closest and brightest exoplanet\nhost stars (G2V type, R=1.543 $\\pm$0.065 R$_{\\odot}$, V=$6.47\\pm 0.01$ mag,\ndistance=33.37$\\pm$0.04 pc). The nature of the outer, massive companion is\nstill to be confirmed; a joint analysis of RVs, Hipparcos, and Gaia astrometric\ndata shows that with a 3$\\sigma$ confidence interval, its semi-major axis is\nbetween 16.7 and 38.8 au and its mass is between 68 and 284 M$_{Jup}$.\nHD88986b's wide orbit suggests the planet did not undergo significant mass loss\ndue to extreme-ultraviolet radiation from its host star. Therefore, it probably\nmaintained its primordial composition, allowing us to probe its formation\nscenario. Furthermore, the cold nature of HD88986b (460$\\pm$8 K), thanks to its\nlong orbital period, will open up exciting opportunities for future studies of\ncold atmosphere composition characterization.",

            "summary": "In the current landscape of large models, the Transformer stands as a\ncornerstone, playing a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of modern models.\nHowever, its application encounters challenges attributed to the substantial\ncomputational intricacies intrinsic to its attention mechanism. Moreover, its\nreliance on high-precision floating-point operations presents specific hurdles,\nparticularly evident in computation-intensive scenarios such as edge computing\nenvironments. These environments, characterized by resource-constrained devices\nand a preference for lower precision, necessitate innovative solutions.\n  To tackle the exacting data processing demands posed by edge devices, we\nintroduce the Bitformer model, an inventive extension of the Transformer\nparadigm. Central to this innovation is a novel attention mechanism that\nadeptly replaces conventional floating-point matrix multiplication with bitwise\noperations. This strategic substitution yields dual advantages. Not only does\nit maintain the attention mechanism's prowess in capturing intricate long-range\ninformation dependencies, but it also orchestrates a profound reduction in the\ncomputational complexity inherent in the attention operation. The transition\nfrom an $O(n^2d)$ complexity, typical of floating-point operations, to an\n$O(n^2T)$ complexity characterizing bitwise operations, substantiates this\nadvantage. Notably, in this context, the parameter $T$ remains markedly smaller\nthan the conventional dimensionality parameter $d$.\n  The Bitformer model in essence endeavors to reconcile the indomitable\nrequirements of modern computing landscapes with the constraints posed by edge\ncomputing scenarios. By forging this innovative path, we bridge the gap between\nhigh-performing models and resource-scarce environments, thus unveiling a\npromising trajectory for further advancements in the field.",

The predicted surface\nheat transfer reveals areas of elevated heat loads at the ribs between facets\nand at the aeroshell shoulder, due to local boundary layer thinning. The\nincrease in heat transfer at the ribs depends on the sharpness of the rib: more\nrounded shapes result in lower heat fluxes. Comparison with high-speed wind\ntunnel tests shows good agreement with experimental data. Stanton number and\ntemperature profiles agree within 8% and 2%, respectively. The discrepancies\nbetween experiments and simulations are largest at the sharp ribs of the\naeroshell.

            "summary": "Formality plays a significant role in language communication, especially in\nlow-resource languages such as Hindi, Japanese and Korean. These languages\nutilise formal and informal expressions to convey messages based on social\ncontexts and relationships. When a language translation technique is used to\ntranslate from a source language that does not pertain the formality (e.g.\nEnglish) to a target language that does, there is a missing information on\nformality that could be a challenge in producing an accurate outcome. This\nresearch explores how this issue should be resolved when machine learning\nmethods are used to translate from English to languages with formality, using\nHindi as the example data. This was done by training a bilingual model in a\nformality-controlled setting and comparing its performance with a pre-trained\nmultilingual model in a similar setting. Since there are not a lot of training\ndata with ground truth, automated annotation techniques were employed to\nincrease the data size. The primary modeling approach involved leveraging\ntransformer models, which have demonstrated effectiveness in various natural\nlanguage processing tasks. We evaluate the official formality accuracy(ACC) by\ncomparing the predicted masked tokens with the ground truth. This metric\nprovides a quantitative measure of how well the translations align with the\ndesired outputs. Our study showcases a versatile translation strategy that\nconsiders the nuances of formality in the target language, catering to diverse\nlanguage communication needs and scenarios.",

We discuss the properties of the spin density matrix under C, P and T\ntransformations, and combinations thereof, as also the predictions of these for\nthe corresponding leptonic asymmetries. The specific transformations P, CP, T\nand CPT are of special importance and we discuss the consequences of these\nsymmetries or their absence for the leptonic asymmetries. A specific issue\nwhich has been given attention to is the role of beam polarization, and how one\ncan infer on general grounds which asymmetries get enhanced by the use of beam\npolarization.

However,\nboth formulations present a large discrepancy with experimental data for cases\nin which cavitation is induced by acoustic waves. The present study aims to\nidentify a more suitable cavitation threshold for such cases. The methodology\nadopted in this work consists of a combination of visualization with high-speed\ncameras and direct measurements using a hydrophone. The data collected\nconfirmed that the vapor pressure is not a proper indicator of cavitation\noccurrence for an acoustic system characterized by high frequencies. The main\nreason behind the inability of vapor pressure to predict incipient cavitation\nin acoustic systems is that they evolve very quickly toward strong gradients in\npressure, and the quasi-static assumptions used by traditional models are not\nvalid. Instead, the system evolves towards a metastable state [Brennen, 2013],\nwhere the liquid exhibits an elastic behavior and can withstand negative\npressures. A new cavitation number accounting for the tensile strength of the\nliquid was defined. An acoustic analogy is also proposed for the description,\nwith the same framework, of an impulsive cavitation phenomenon.",

The MRGazer consisted of eyeballs extraction module and a\nresidual network-based eye gaze prediction. Compared to the previous method,\nthe proposed framework skips the fMRI co-registration step, simplifies the\nprocessing protocol and achieves end-to-end eye gaze regression. The proposed\nmethod achieved superior performance in a variety of eye movement tasks than\nthe co-registration-based method, and delivered objective results within a\nshorter time (~ 0.02 Seconds for each volume) than prior method (~0.3 Seconds\nfor each volume).",

Additionally, using only facts for legal\njudgment prediction with different transformer models yielded results inferior\nto the state-of-the-art outcomes reported in the \"ILDC for CJPE\" study.",

            "summary": "Age of information (AoI) and reliability are two critical metrics to support\nreal-time applications in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). These metrics\nreflect different concepts of timely delivery of sensor information. Monitoring\ntraffic serves to maintain fresh status updates, expressed in a low AoI, which\nis important for proper control and actuation actions. On the other hand,\nsafety-critical information, e.g., emergency alarms, is generated sporadically\nand must be delivered with high reliability within a predefined deadline. In\nthis work, we investigate the AoI-reliability trade-off in a real-time\nmonitoring scenario that supports two traffic flows, namely AoI-oriented\ntraffic and deadline-oriented traffic. Both traffic flows are transmitted to a\ncentral controller over an unreliable shared channel. We derive expressions of\nthe average AoI for the AoI-oriented traffic and reliability, represented by\nPacket Loss Probability (PLP), for the deadline-oriented traffic using\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC). We also conduct discrete-event simulations\nin MATLAB to validate the analytical results and evaluate the interaction\nbetween the two types of traffic flows. The results clearly demonstrate the\ntradeoff between the AoI and PLP in such heterogeneous IIoT networks and give\ninsights on how to configure the network to achieve a target pair of AoI and\nPLP.",

The reports are delivered over a\nblock-fading channel to a common Access Point (AP) in slotted ALOHA fashion,\nwhich leverages the imbalances in the received powers among the contending\nusers and applies successive interference cancellation (SIC) to decode user\npackets from the collisions. We provide an extensive analytical treatment of\nthe setup, deriving the Age of Information (AoI), throughput and deadline\nviolation probability, when the AP has access to both the perfect as well as\nthe imperfect channel-state information. We show that adopting SIC improves all\nthe performance parameters with respect to the standard slotted ALOHA, as well\nas to an age-dependent access method.

A deep generative model based on\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), conditioned simultaneously by two target\nproperties, is developed to inverse design stable magnetic materials. Structure\nof the physics informed, property embedded latent space of the model is\nanalyzed using graph theory, based on the idea of similarity index. The graph\nidea is shown to be useful for generating new materials that are likely to\nsatisfy target properties. An impressive ~96% of the generated materials is\nfound to satisfy the target properties as per predictions from the target\nlearning branches. This is a huge improvement over approaches that do not\ncondition the VAE latent space by target properties, or do not consider\nconnectivity of the parent materials perturbing which the new materials are\ngenerated. In such models, the fraction of materials satisfying targets can be\nas low as ~5%. This impressive feat is achieved using a simple real-space only\nrepresentation called Invertible Real-space Crystallographic Representation\n(IRCR), that can be directly read from material cif files. Model predictions\nare finally validated by performing DFT calculations on a randomly chosen\nsubset of materials. Performance of the present model using IRCR is comparable\nor superior to that of the models reported earlier. This model for magnetic\nmaterial generation, MagGen, is applied to the problem of designing rare earth\nfree permanent magnets with promising results.",

Jets are reconstructed from charged particles\nproduced in the midrapidity region ($|\\eta| < 0.9$) using the sequential\nrecombination anti-$k_{\\rm T}$ algorithm with jet resolution parameters $R$ =\n0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 for the transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) interval 5$-$110\nGeV/$c$. High-multiplicity events are selected by the forward V0 scintillator\ndetectors. The mean charged-particle multiplicity inside the leading jet cone\nrises monotonically with increasing jet $p_{\\rm T}$ in qualitative agreement\nwith previous measurements at lower energies. The distributions of jet\nfragmentation functions $z^{\\rm ch}$ and $\\xi^{\\rm ch}$ are measured for\ndifferent jet-$p_{\\rm T}$ intervals. Jet-$p_{\\rm T}$ independent fragmentation\nof leading jets is observed for wider jets except at high- and low-$z^{\\rm\nch}$. The observed \"hump-backed plateau\" structure in the $\\xi^{\\rm ch}$\ndistribution indicates suppression of low-$p_{\\rm T}$ particles. In\nhigh-multiplicity events, an enhancement of the fragmentation probability of\nlow-$z^{\\rm ch}$ particles accompanied by a suppression of high-$z^{\\rm ch}$\nparticles is observed compared to minimum-bias events. This behavior becomes\nmore prominent for low-$p_{\\rm T}$ jets with larger jet radius.

The search for\nmagnetic signatures in pulsating stars, such as $\\gamma$ Doradus or Slowly\nPulsation B stars, requires to adapt the formalism developed for the slowly\nrotating red giants to rapidly rotating stars. We perform a theoretical\nanalysis of the effects of an arbitrary magnetic field on high radial order\ngravity and Rossby modes in a rapidly rotating star. The magnetic effects are\ntreated as a perturbation. For high radial order modes, the contribution of the\nradial component of the magnetic field is likely to dominate over the azimuthal\nand latitudinal components. The rotation is taken into account through the\ntraditional approximation of rotation. General expressions of the frequency\nshift induced by an arbitrary radial magnetic field are derived. Approximate\nanalytical forms are obtained in the high-order high-spin-parameter limits for\nthe modes most frequently observed in $\\gamma$ Dor stars. We propose simple\nmethods to detect seismic magnetic signatures and measure possible magnetic\nfields in such stars.

This phenomenon is\nknown as diffusiophoresis. In systems with multiple salts and 'crossed' salt\ngradients, a nonlocal component of the electric field associated with a\ncirculating (solenoidal) ion current can arise. This is in addition to the\nconventional local component that depends only on the local salt gradients.\nHere we report experimental observations verifying the existence of this\nnonlocal contribution. To our knowledge this is the first observation of\nnonlocal diffusiophoresis. The current develops quasi-instantaneously on the\ntime scale of salt diffusion. Therefore, in systems with multiple salts and\ncrossed salt gradients, one can expect a nonlocal contribution to\ndiffusiophoresis which is dependent on the geometry of the system as a whole\nand appears as a kind of instantaneous 'action-at-a-distance' effect. The\ninterpretation is aided by a magnetostatic analogy. Our experiments are\nfacilitated by a judicious particle-dependent choice of salt (potassium\nacetate) for which the two local contributions to diffusiophoresis almost\ncancel, effectively eliminating conventional diffusiophoresis. This enables us\nto clearly identify the novel, nonlocal effect and may be useful in other\ncontexts, for example in sorting particle mixtures.",

Using the BigIdeasLab_STEP dataset, which\nincludes heart rate time series annotated with specific tasks performed by\nindividuals, we sought to determine if general classification was achievable.\nOur analyses showed that the accuracy is sensitive to the choice of\nwindow/stride size. Moreover, we found variable classification performances\nbetween subjects due to differences in the physical structure of their hearts.\nVarious techniques were used to minimize this variability. First of all,\nnormalization proved to be a crucial step and significantly improved the\nperformance. Secondly, grouping subjects and performing classification inside a\ngroup helped to improve performance and decrease inter-subject variability.\nFinally, we show that including handcrafted features as input to a deep\nlearning (DL) network improves the classification performance further.\nTogether, these findings indicate that heart rate time series can be utilized\nfor classification tasks like predicting activity. However, normalization or\ngrouping techniques need to be chosen carefully to minimize the issue of\nsubject variability.",

The evolution of pure initial quantum states is characterized by a\nfractal (in the space of states), formed by the border of different convergence\nregions. We examine how the ideal evolution is distorted in the presence of\nboth coherent error and incoherent initial noise, which are typical\nimperfections in current implementations of quantum computers. It is known that\nunder the influence of initial noise only, the fractal is preserved, moreover,\nits dimension remains constant below a critical noise level. We systematically\nanalyze the effect of coherent Hadamard gate errors by determining fixed points\nand cycles of the evolution. We combine analytic and numerical methods to\nexplore to what extent the dynamics is altered by coherent errors in the\npresence of preparation noise as well. We show that the main features of the\ndynamics, and especially the fractal borders, are robust against the discussed\nnoise, they will only be slightly distorted. We identify a range of error\nparameters, for which the characteristic properties of the dynamics are not\nsignificantly altered. Hence, our results allow to identify reliable regimes of\noperation of iterative protocols.",

            "summary": "Matrix factorization (MF) is a simple collaborative filtering technique that\nachieves superior recommendation accuracy by decomposing the user-item rating\nmatrix into user and item latent matrices. This approach relies on learning\nfrom user-item interactions, which may not effectively capture the underlying\nshared dependencies between users or items. Therefore, there is scope to\nexplicitly capture shared dependencies to further improve recommendation\naccuracy and the interpretability of learning results by summarizing user-item\ninteractions. Based on these insights, we propose \"Hierarchical Matrix\nFactorization\" (HMF), which incorporates clustering concepts to capture the\nhierarchy, where leaf nodes and other nodes correspond to users/items and\nclusters, respectively. Central to our approach, called hierarchical\nembeddings, is the additional decomposition of the user and item latent\nmatrices (embeddings) into probabilistic connection matrices, which link the\nhierarchy, and a root cluster latent matrix. Thus, each node is represented by\nthe weighted average of the embeddings of its parent clusters. The embeddings\nare differentiable, allowing simultaneous learning of interactions and\nclustering using a single gradient descent method. Furthermore, the obtained\ncluster-specific interactions naturally summarize user-item interactions and\nprovide interpretability. Experimental results on rating and ranking\npredictions demonstrated the competitiveness of HMF over vanilla and\nhierarchical MF methods, especially its robustness in sparse interactions.\nAdditionally, it was confirmed that the clustering integration of HMF has the\npotential for faster learning convergence and mitigation of overfitting\ncompared to MF, and also provides interpretability through a cluster-centered\ncase study.",

The molecular mapping technique uses the\ndifference between the planetary and stellar spectra. While traditional\npost-processing techniques are quickly limited by speckle noise at short\nangular separation, it efficiently suppresses speckles. Its performance depends\non multiple parameters such as the star magnitude, the adaptive optics residual\nhalo, the companion spectrum, the telluric absorption, as well as the telescope\nand instrument properties. Exploring this parameter space through end-to-end\nsimulations to predict potential science cases and to optimize future\ninstrument designs is very time-consuming, making it difficult to draw\nconclusions. We propose to define an efficient methodology for such an\nanalysis. Explicit expressions of the estimates of signal and noise are\nderived, and they are validated through comparisons with end-to-end\nsimulations. They provide an understanding of the instrumental dependencies,\nand help to discuss optimal instrumental choices with regard to the targets of\ninterest. They are applied in the case of ELT/HARMONI, as a tool to predict the\ncontrast performance in various observational cases. We confirm the potential\nof molecular mapping for high-contrast detections, especially for cool planets\nat short separations. We provide guidelines based on quantified estimates for\ndesign trade-offs of future instruments. We discuss the planet detection\nperformances of HARMONI observing modes. While they nicely cover the\nappropriate requirements for high detection capability of warm exoplanets, a\ntransmission extended down to J band would be beneficial.

            "summary": "Copy-move forgery detection aims at detecting duplicated regions in a\nsuspected forged image, and deep learning based copy-move forgery detection\nmethods are in the ascendant. These deep learning based methods heavily rely on\nsynthetic training data, and the performance will degrade when facing new\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-style copy-move forgery\ndetection network named as CMFDFormer, and provide a novel PCSD (Pooled Cube\nand Strip Distillation) continual learning framework to help CMFDFormer handle\nnew tasks. CMFDFormer consists of a MiT (Mix Transformer) backbone network and\na PHD (Pluggable Hybrid Decoder) mask prediction network. The MiT backbone\nnetwork is a Transformer-style network which is adopted on the basis of\ncomprehensive analyses with CNN-style and MLP-style backbones. The PHD network\nis constructed based on self-correlation computation, hierarchical feature\nintegration, a multi-scale cycle fully-connected block and a mask\nreconstruction block. The PHD network is applicable to feature extractors of\ndifferent styles for hierarchical multi-scale information extraction, achieving\ncomparable performance. Last but not least, we propose a PCSD continual\nlearning framework to improve the forgery detectability and avoid catastrophic\nforgetting when handling new tasks. Our continual learning framework restricts\nintermediate features from the PHD network, and takes advantage of both cube\npooling and strip pooling. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets\ndemonstrate the good performance of CMFDFormer and the effectiveness of the\nPCSD continual learning framework.",

Automatic evaluation could improve\ndiagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features\nand clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying\ninvasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells\nand in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop\nan AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast\ncancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin\nand eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists'\nannotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural\nnetwork, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue\nmicroarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients\nwere used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived\nfrom four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth\ncohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice\nscore of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial\ncells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring\n(0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive\nepithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in\nsitu lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in\nHE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate\ndivision between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists'\nannotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths.

            "summary": "State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) still have limited performance\nin structural knowledge extraction, such as relations between objects. In this\nwork, we present ViStruct, a training framework to learn VLMs for effective\nvisual structural knowledge extraction. Two novel designs are incorporated.\nFirst, we propose to leverage the inherent structure of programming language to\ndepict visual structural information. This approach enables explicit and\nconsistent representation of visual structural information of multiple\ngranularities, such as concepts, relations, and events, in a well-organized\nstructured format. Second, we introduce curriculum-based learning for VLMs to\nprogressively comprehend visual structures, from fundamental visual concepts to\nintricate event structures. Our intuition is that lower-level knowledge may\ncontribute to complex visual structure understanding. Furthermore, we compile\nand release a collection of datasets tailored for visual structural knowledge\nextraction. We adopt a weakly-supervised approach to directly generate visual\nevent structures from captions for ViStruct training, capitalizing on abundant\nimage-caption pairs from the web. In experiments, we evaluate ViStruct on\nvisual structure prediction tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving\nthe understanding of visual structures.

            "summary": "In this paper, we address the challenges of online Continual Learning (CL) by\nintroducing a density distribution-based learning framework. CL, especially the\nClass Incremental Learning, enables adaptation to new test distributions while\ncontinuously learning from a single-pass training data stream, which is more in\nline with the practical application requirements of real-world scenarios.\nHowever, existing CL methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and\nhigher computing costs due to complex algorithm designs, limiting their\npractical use. Our proposed framework overcomes these limitations by achieving\nsuperior average accuracy and time-space efficiency, bridging the performance\ngap between CL and classical machine learning. Specifically, we adopt an\nindependent Generative Kernel Density Estimation (GKDE) model for each CL task.\nDuring the testing stage, the GKDEs utilize a self-reported max probability\ndensity value to determine which one is responsible for predicting incoming\ntest instances. A GKDE-based learning objective can ensure that samples with\nthe same label are grouped together, while dissimilar instances are pushed\nfarther apart. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple CL datasets validate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our method outperforms popular CL\napproaches by a significant margin, while maintaining competitive time-space\nefficiency, making our framework suitable for real-world applications.

The computations related to the proposed prediction\nstrategy involve low-dimensional linear problems that are computationally\ninexpensive and highly parallelizable. The mathematical building blocks for\nthis new concept are first developed on an abstract Hilbert space level, before\nthey are employed within the specific context of $hp$-type finite element\ndiscretizations. For this particular framework, we discuss an explicit\nconstruction of $p$-enrichments and $hp$-refinements by means of an appropriate\nconstraint coefficient technique that can be employed in any dimensions.

            "summary": "Radiative transfer (RT) simulations are a powerful tool that enables the\ncalculation of synthetic images of a wide range of astrophysical objects. These\nsimulations are often based on the Monte Carlo (MC) method, as it provides the\nneeded versatility that allows the consideration of the diverse and often\ncomplex conditions found in those objects. However, this method faces\nfundamental problems in the regime of high optical depths which may result in\nnoisy images and underestimated flux values. In this study, we propose an\nadvanced MCRT method, i.e., an enforced minimum scattering order that is aimed\nat providing a minimum quality of determined flux estimates. For that purpose,\nwe extended our investigations of the scattering order problem and derived an\nanalytic expression for the minimum number of interactions that depends on the\nalbedo and optical depth of the system, which needs to be considered to achieve\na certain coverage of the scattering order distribution. The method is based on\nthe utilization of this estimated minimum scattering order and enforces the\nconsideration of a sufficient number of interactions during a simulation.\nMoreover, we identified two notably distinct cases that shape the kind of\ncomplexity that arises in MCRT simulations: the albedo-dominated and the\noptical depth-dominated case. Based on that, we analyzed implications regarding\nthe best usage of a stretching method as a means to alleviate the scattering\norder problem. We find that its most suitable application requires taking into\naccount the albedo and the optical depth. Then, we argue that the derived\nminimum scattering order can be used to assess the performance of a stretching\nmethod with regard to the scattering orders its usage promotes. Finally, we\nstress the need for developing advanced pathfinding techniques to fully solve\nthe problem of MCRT simulations in the regime of high optical depths.",

However, if the\ndroplets also contain nanoparticles or any other non-volatile solute, then the\ndroplets can become thermodynamically stable. We show that the equilibrium\ndroplet size depends strongly on the amount and solubility of the nanoparticles\nwithin, i.e. on the nature of the particle interactions with the liquid, and of\ncourse also on the vapour temperature and chemical potential. We develop a\nsimple thermodynamic model for such droplets and compare predictions with\nresults from a lattice density functional theory that takes as input the same\nparticle interaction properties, finding very good agreement.

However, existing methods (1) only model the\nunidirectional guidance from intent to slot, while there are bidirectional\ninter-correlations between intent and slot; (2) adopt homogeneous graphs to\nmodel the interactions between the slot semantics nodes and intent label nodes,\nwhich limit the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model termed\nCo-guiding Net, which implements a two-stage framework achieving the mutual\nguidances between the two tasks. In the first stage, the initial estimated\nlabels of both tasks are produced, and then they are leveraged in the second\nstage to model the mutual guidances. Specifically, we propose two heterogeneous\ngraph attention networks working on the proposed two heterogeneous semantics\nlabel graphs, which effectively represent the relations among the semantics\nnodes and label nodes. Besides, we further propose Co-guiding-SCL Net, which\nexploits the single-task and dual-task semantics contrastive relations. For the\nfirst stage, we propose single-task supervised contrastive learning, and for\nthe second stage, we propose co-guiding supervised contrastive learning, which\nconsiders the two tasks' mutual guidances in the contrastive learning\nprocedure. Experiment results on multi-intent SLU show that our model\noutperforms existing models by a large margin, obtaining a relative improvement\nof 21.3% over the previous best model on MixATIS dataset in overall accuracy.\nWe also evaluate our model on the zero-shot cross-lingual scenario and the\nresults show that our model can relatively improve the state-of-the-art model\nby 33.5% on average in terms of overall accuracy for the total 9 languages.",

Around such a\nmonopole, the OAM is locked isotopically parallel or antiparallel to the\ndirection of the electron's momentum, which could be used to generate large and\ncontrollable OAM currents. However, OAM monopoles have not yet been directly\nobserved in chiral crystals, and no handle to control their polarity has been\ndiscovered. Here, we use circular dichroism in angle-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy (CD-ARPES) to image OAM monopoles in the chiral topological\nsemimetals PtGa and PdGa. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the polarity of\nthe monopole can be controlled via the structural handedness of the host\ncrystal by imaging OAM monopoles and anti-monopoles in the two enantiomers of\nPdGa, respectively. For most photon energies used in our study, we observe a\nsign change in the CD-ARPES spectrum when comparing positive and negative\nmomenta along the light direction near the topological degeneracy. This is\nconsistent with the conventional view that CD-ARPES measures the projection of\nthe OAM monopole along the photon momentum. For some photon energies, however,\nthis sign change disappears, which can be understood from our numerical\nsimulations as the interference of polar atomic OAM contributions, consistent\nwith the presence of OAM monopoles. Our results highlight the potential of\nchiral crystals for orbitronic device applications, and our methodology could\nenable the discovery of even more complicated nodal OAM textures that could be\nexploited for orbitronics.",

            "summary": "Epitaxial strain has emerged as a powerful tool to tune magnetic and\nferroelectric properties in functional materials such as in multiferroic\nperovskite oxides. Here, we use first-principles calculations to explore the\nevolution of magnetic interactions in the antiferromagnetic multiferroic\nBiFeO$_3$ (BFO), one of the most promising multiferroics for future technology.\nThe epitaxial strain in BFO(001) oriented film is varied between\n$\\varepsilon_{xx,yy}$ $\\in$ $[-2\\%, +2\\%]$. We find that both strengths of the\nexchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) decrease\nlinearly from compressive to tensile strain whereas the uniaxial\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy follows a parabolic behavior which lifts the\nenergy degeneracy of the (111) easy plane of bulk BFO. From the trends of the\nmagnetic interactions we can explain the destruction of cycloidal order in\ncompressive strain as observed in experiments due to the increasing anisotropy\nenergy. For tensile strain, we predict that the ground state remains unchanged\nas a function of strain. By using the domain wall (DW) energy, we envision the\nregion where isolated chiral magnetic texture might occur as function of strain\ni.e. where the DW and the spin spiral energy are equal. This transition between\n$-1.5\\%$ and $-0.5\\%$ of strain should allow topologically stable magnetic\nstates such as antiferromagnetic skyrmions and merons to occur. Hence, our work\nshould trigger experimental and theoretical investigations in this range of\nstrain.",

            "summary": "The passive superconducting harmonic cavity (PSHC) scheme is adopted by\nseveral existing and future synchrotron light source storage rings, as it has a\nrelatively smaller R/Q and a relatively larger quality factor (Q), which can\neffectively reduce the beam-loading effect and suppress the mode-one\ninstability. Based on the mode-zero Robinson instability equation of uniformly\nfilled rigid bunches and a search algorithm for minimum, we have revealed that\nthe PSHC fundamental mode with a large loaded-Q possibly triggers the D-mode\nRobinson instability [T. He, et al., Mode-zero Robinson instability in the\npresence of passive superconducting harmonic cavities, PRAB 26, 064403 (2023)].\nThis D-mode Robinson instability is unique because it is anti-damped by the\nradiation-damping effect. In this paper, analytical formulas for the frequency\nand growth rate of the D-mode Robinson instability are derived with several\nappropriate approximations. These analytical formulas will facilitate analyzing\nand understanding the D-mode Robinson instability.

First, we analytically calculate the holographic\npseudo entropy in the AdS/BCFT model with a brane localized scalar field and\nshow the entanglement phase transition behavior where the time evolution of\nentropy changes from the linear growth to the trivial one via a critical\nlogarithmic evolution. In this model, the imaginary valued scalar field\nlocalized on the brane controls the phase transition, which is analogous to the\namount of projections in the measurement induced phase transition. Next, we\nstudy the AdS/BCFT model with a brane localized gauge field, where the phase\ntransition looks different in that there is no logarithmically evolving\ncritical point. Finally, we discuss a bulk analog of the above model by\nconsidering a double Wick rotation of the Janus solution.

            "summary": "The Differentiable Rendering and Implicit Function-based model (DRIFu) draws\nits roots from the Pixel-aligned Implicit Function (PIFU), a pioneering 3D\ndigitization technique initially designed for clothed human bodies. PIFU excels\nin capturing nuanced body shape variations within a low-dimensional space and\nhas been extensively trained on human 3D scans. However, the application of\nPIFU to live animals poses significant challenges, primarily due to the\ninherent difficulty in obtaining the cooperation of animals for 3D scanning. In\nresponse to this challenge, we introduce the DRIFu model, specifically tailored\nfor animal digitization. To train DRIFu, we employ a curated set of synthetic\n3D animal models, encompassing diverse shapes, sizes, and even accounting for\nvariations such as baby birds. Our innovative alignment tools play a pivotal\nrole in mapping these diverse synthetic animal models onto a unified template,\nfacilitating precise predictions of animal shape and texture. Crucially, our\ntemplate alignment strategy establishes a shared shape space, allowing for the\nseamless sampling of new animal shapes, posing them realistically, animating\nthem, and aligning them with real-world data. This groundbreaking approach\nrevolutionizes our capacity to comprehensively understand and represent avian\nforms.

            "summary": "This paper investigates Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR), a\npromising method that uses information from multiple domains (more than three)\nto generate accurate and diverse recommendations, and takes into account the\nsequential nature of user interactions. The effectiveness of these systems\noften depends on the complex interplay among the multiple domains. In this\ndynamic landscape, the problem of negative transfer arises, where heterogeneous\nknowledge between dissimilar domains leads to performance degradation due to\ndifferences in user preferences across these domains. As a remedy, we propose a\nnew CDSR framework that addresses the problem of negative transfer by assessing\nthe extent of negative transfer from one domain to another and adaptively\nassigning low weight values to the corresponding prediction losses. To this\nend, the amount of negative transfer is estimated by measuring the marginal\ncontribution of each domain to model performance based on a cooperative game\ntheory. In addition, a hierarchical contrastive learning approach that\nincorporates information from the sequence of coarse-level categories into that\nof fine-level categories (e.g., item level) when implementing contrastive\nlearning was developed to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the potentially\nlow relevance between domains at the fine-level, there may be higher relevance\nat the category level due to its generalised and broader preferences. We show\nthat our model is superior to prior works in terms of model performance on two\nreal-world datasets across ten different domains.",

            "summary": "Recommendation with side information has drawn significant research interest\ndue to its potential to mitigate user feedback sparsity. However, existing\nmodels struggle with generalization across diverse domains and types of side\ninformation. In particular, three challenges have not been addressed, and they\nare (1) the diverse formats of side information, including text sequences. (2)\nThe diverse semantics of side information that describes items and users from\nmulti-level in a context different from recommendation systems. (3) The diverse\ncorrelations in side information to measure similarity over multiple objects\nbeyond pairwise relations. In this paper, we introduce GENET (Generalized\nhypErgraph pretraiNing on sidE informaTion), which pre-trains user and item\nrepresentations on feedback-irrelevant side information and fine-tunes the\nrepresentations on user feedback data. GENET leverages pre-training as a means\nto prevent side information from overshadowing critical ID features and\nfeedback signals. It employs a hypergraph framework to accommodate various\ntypes of diverse side information. During pre-training, GENET integrates tasks\nfor hyperlink prediction and self-supervised contrast to capture fine-grained\nsemantics at both local and global levels. Additionally, it introduces a unique\nstrategy to enhance pre-training robustness by perturbing positive samples\nwhile maintaining high-order relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nGENET exhibits strong generalization capabilities, outperforming the SOTA\nmethod by up to 38% in TOP-N recommendation and Sequential recommendation tasks\non various datasets with different side information.",

            "summary": "This project tackles the pressing issue of human trafficking in online C2C\nmarketplaces through advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We\nintroduce a novel methodology for generating pseudo-labeled datasets with\nminimal supervision, serving as a rich resource for training state-of-the-art\nNLP models. Focusing on tasks like Human Trafficking Risk Prediction (HTRP) and\nOrganized Activity Detection (OAD), we employ cutting-edge Transformer models\nfor analysis. A key contribution is the implementation of an interpretability\nframework using Integrated Gradients, providing explainable insights crucial\nfor law enforcement. This work not only fills a critical gap in the literature\nbut also offers a scalable, machine learning-driven approach to combat human\nexploitation online. It serves as a foundation for future research and\npractical applications, emphasizing the role of machine learning in addressing\ncomplex social issues.",

Thus, unlike other dimension measures - such\nas the dimension of the linear space or the maximum number of (jointly or\npairwise) perfectly discriminable states - which examine the correlation space\nonly along a single direction, the signaling dimension does not depend on the\narbitrary choice of a specific operational task. In this sense, the signaling\ndimension summarizes the structure of the entire set of input/output\ncorrelations consistent with a given system in a single scalar quantity. For\nquantum theory, it was recently proved by Frenkel and Weiner in a seminal\nresult that the signaling dimension coincides with the Hilbert space dimension.\n  Here, we derive analytical and algorithmic techniques to compute the\nsignaling dimension for any given system of any given generalized probabilistic\ntheory. We prove that it suffices to consider extremal measurements with\nray-extremal effects, and we bound the number of elements of any such\nmeasurement in terms of the linear dimension. For systems with a finite number\nof extremal effects, we recast the problem of characterizing the extremal\nmeasurements with ray-extremal effects as the problem of deriving the vertex\ndescription of a polytope given its face description, which can be conveniently\nsolved by standard techniques. For each such measurement, we recast the\ncomputation of the signaling dimension as a linear program, and we propose a\ncombinatorial branch and bound algorithm to reduce its size. We apply our\nresults to derive the extremal measurements with ray-extremal effects of a\ncomposition of two square bits (or squits) and prove that their signaling\ndimension is five, even though each squit has a signaling dimension equal to\ntwo.",

A Lyapunov-based stability\nanalysis is performed which guarantees the tracking, observer, and parameter\nestimation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), with stronger\nperformance guarantees when the DNN's Jacobian satisfies the persistence of\nexcitation (PE) condition.

A peaked density or radius profile of\n$s^2$ has been predicted for massive NSs using various NS Equation of State\n(EOS) models. However, the nature, cause, location and size of the peak in\n$s^2$ profiles are still very EOS model dependent. In this work, we investigate\nsystematically $s^2$ profiles in massive NSs in a new approach that is\nindependent of the nuclear EOS model and without any presumption about the NS\nstructure or composition. In terms of the small quantities (reduced radius, the\nenergy density and pressure scaled by their central values), we perform\ndouble-element perturbative expansions in solving perturbatively the scaled\nTolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and analyzing $s^2$ profiles from\nthe Newtonian limit to the general relativistic (GR) case. The GR term in the\nTOV equations plays a twofold role: it compresses NS matter and modifies the\npressure/energy density ratio from small values in Newtonian stars showing no\n$s^2$ peak to large ones for massive NSs possessing a peak in their $s^2$\nprofiles, and eventually takes away the peak in extremely compact/massive NSs\napproaching the causality limit.

            "summary": "Analytic Langlands correspondence was proposed by Etingof, Frenkel and\nKazhdan. On one side of this correspondence there are certain operators on\n$L^2(\\operatorname{Bun}_G)$, called Hecke operators, where\n$\\operatorname{Bun}_G$ is the variety of stable $G$-bundles on $X$ and\n$L^2(\\operatorname{Bun}_G)$ is a Hilbert space of square-integrable\nhalf-densities. The compactness conjecture says that Hecke operators are\nbounded and, moreover, compact. In arXiv:2106.05243 Etingof, Frenkel and\nKazhdan prove this and other conjectures in the case of\n$G=\\operatorname{PGL}_2$ and $X=\\mathbb{P}^1$ with parabolic structures. We\ninvestigate the case of $G=\\operatorname{PGL}_2$ and genus one curve over\ncomplex numbers with parabolic structures. We obtain an explicit formula for\nHecke operators and prove the compactness conjecture in this case.",

            "summary": "The meaning of polysemous words often varies in a highly productive yet\npredictable way. Generalizing the regularity between conventional senses to\nderive novel word meaning is crucial for automated processing of non-literal\nlanguage uses such as figurative expressions. We introduce a novel task called\nsystematic word meta-sense extension (SWORME) to test and improve language\nmodels' ability to extend word meaning to denote new semantic domains (also\ncalled meta-senses) that bear regular semantic relations with existing senses.\nWe found that language models prefer incremental lexical semantic change toward\nconceptually similar meta-senses such as logical metonymy, and are much worse\nat predicting highly non-literal meaning extensions such as metaphors. We\npropose a novel analogy-based method of word meaning extension, and show that\nit effectively improves language model systematicity in making both gradual and\nradical types of meta-sense extension. We further demonstrate that learning\nsystematic meta-sense extensions benefits language models on multiple\nbenchmarks of figurative language understanding.",

            "summary": "Capillarity-driven transport in nanoporous solids is ubiquitous in nature and\nis of increasing importance for the functionality of modern liquid-infused\nengineering materials. During imbibition, highly curved menisci are driven by\nnegative Laplace pressures of several hundred atmospheres, exerting an enormous\ncontractile load on an increasing portion of the porous matrix. Due to the\nchallenge of simultaneously monitoring imbibition and deformation with high\nspatial resolution, the resulting coupling of solid elasticity to liquid\ncapillarity has remained largely unexplored. Here, we study water imbibition in\nmesoporous silica using optical imaging, gravimetry, and high-resolution\ndilatometry. In contrast to an expected Laplace pressure-induced contraction,\nwe find a square-root-of-time expansion and an additional abrupt length\nincrease when the menisci reach the top surface. The final expansion is absent\nwhen we stop the imbibition front inside the porous medium in a dynamic\nimbibition-evaporation equilibrium, as is typical for water transport and\ntranspiration in plants. These peculiar deformation behaviors are validated by\nsingle-nanopore molecular dynamics simulations and described by a continuum\nmodel that highlights the importance of expansive surface stresses at the pore\nwalls (Bangham effect) and the buildup or release of contractile Laplace\npressures as nanoscale menisci collectively advance, arrest, or disappear. Our\nmodel predicts that these observations are valid not only for water imbibition\nin silica, but for any imbibition process in nanopores, regardless of the\nliquid/solid combination. This also suggests that simple deformation\nmeasurements can be used to quantify surface stresses and Laplace pressures or\ntransport in a wide variety of natural and artificial porous media.",

            "summary": "The cosmological 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen, which is considered as a\npromising tool, is being used to observe and study the cosmic dawn (CD) and\nepoch of reionization (EoR). A significant part of this thesis focuses on the\nsemi-analytical modeling of the global HI 21-cm signal from CD considering\nseveral physical processes. Further, it investigates the nature of galaxies\nthat dominate during CD and EoR using current available observations. In our\nwork, we study the redshift evolution of the primordial magnetic field (PMF)\nduring the dark ages and cosmic dawn, and prospects of constraining it in light\nof EDGES 21-cm signal in the `colder IGM' background. We find that the IGM\nheating rate due to the PMF enhances compared to the standard scenario.\nHowever, PMF is an unlikely candidate for explaining the rise of the EDGES\nabsorption signal at lower redshift. We further consider, in detail, the\nheating of the IGM owing to cosmic ray protons generated by the supernovae from\nboth early Pop~III and Pop~II stars. We show that the EDGES signal can be well\nfitted by the cosmic ray heating along with the Lyman-$\\alpha$ coupling and the\ndark matter-baryon interaction. We, further, explore the conditions by which\nthe EDGES detection is consistent with current reionization and\npost-reionization observations. By coupling a physically motivated source model\nderived from radiative transfer hydrodynamic simulations of reionization to a\nMCMC sampler, we find that high contribution from low-mass halos along with\nhigh photon escape fractions are required to simultaneously reproduce the\nexisting constraints. With the extreme effort in building more advanced and\nsophisticated telescopes, the future 21-cm signal detection would be able to\nprovide better constraints on the amplitude of PMF and the efficiencies on\ncosmic ray protons, and consequently on early star formation rates.",

            "summary": "Prediction of mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is an important\ntask in critical care medicine. Prior work in creating mortality risk models\nfalls into two major categories: domain-expert-created scoring systems, and\nblack box machine learning (ML) models. Both of these have disadvantages: black\nbox models are unacceptable for use in hospitals, whereas manual creation of\nmodels (including hand-tuning of logistic regression parameters) relies on\nhumans to perform high-dimensional constrained optimization, which leads to a\nloss in performance. In this work, we bridge the gap between accurate black box\nmodels and hand-tuned interpretable models. We build on modern interpretable ML\ntechniques to design accurate and interpretable mortality risk scores. We\nleverage the largest existing public ICU monitoring datasets, namely the MIMIC\nIII and eICU datasets. By evaluating risk across medical centers, we are able\nto study generalization across domains. In order to customize our risk score\nmodels, we develop a new algorithm, GroupFasterRisk, which has several\nimportant benefits: (1) it uses hard sparsity constraint, allowing users to\ndirectly control the number of features; (2) it incorporates group sparsity to\nallow more cohesive models; (3) it allows for monotonicity correction on models\nfor including domain knowledge; (4) it produces many equally-good models at\nonce, which allows domain experts to choose among them. GroupFasterRisk creates\nits risk scores within hours, even on the large datasets we study here.\nGroupFasterRisk's risk scores perform better than risk scores currently used in\nhospitals, and have similar prediction performance to black box ML models\n(despite being much sparser). Because GroupFasterRisk produces a variety of\nrisk scores and handles constraints, it allows design flexibility, which is the\nkey enabler of practical and trustworthy model creation.",

Integrating COAS, ACAS, and\nEDAS techniques into the system enables the selection of the channel with the\nbest conditions, thus increasing the error performance of the proposed system.\nAlso, using RIS increases the error performance of the system by controlling\nthe transmitted signal to a certain extent. The analytical ABER results of the\nproposed AS-RIS-RSM systems are derived and shown to overlap with simulation\nresults. For the proposed systems, an optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detector\nand a sub-optimal low-complexity greedy detector (GD) are offered. Also,\ncapacity analyses of the proposed AS-RIS-RSM systems are derived and it is\nobserved that they have higher capacity compared to RIS-QAM/PSK and RIS-RSM\nsystems.

This piece of\ninformation is helpful to investors as far as confidence risk and return boost\nare concerned. Generative adversarial networks of a time series nature are used\nto provide new ways of modeling and learning the proper and suitable\ndistribution for the financial time series data under complex setups. Ideally,\nthese traditional models are liable to producing high forecasting errors, and\nthey need to be more robust to capture dependency structures and other stylized\nfacts like volatility in stock markets.

Yet,\nit is highly susceptible to the presence of ouliers or biased interference in\nthe original dataset to which it is applied. Described recently, the concept of\nsimilarity means has been preliminary found to have marked robustness to those\nsame effects, especially when adopting the Jaccard similarity index. The\npresent work is aimed at investigating further the properties of similarity\nmeans, especially regarding their range, translating and scaling properties,\nsensitivity and robustness to outliers. Several interesting contributions are\nreported, including an effective algorithm for obtaining the similarity mean,\nthe analytic and experimental identification of a number of properties, as well\nas the confirmation of the potential stability of the similarity mean to the\npresence of outliers. The present work also describes an application\ncase-example in which the Jaccard similarity is succesfully employed to study\ncycles of sunspots, with interesting results.",

            "summary": "In collaborative human-robot manipulation, a robot must predict human intents\nand adapt its actions accordingly to smoothly execute tasks. However, the\nhuman's intent in turn depends on actions the robot takes, creating a\nchicken-or-egg problem. Prior methods ignore such inter-dependency and instead\ntrain marginal intent prediction models independent of robot actions. This is\nbecause training conditional models is hard given a lack of paired human-robot\ninteraction datasets.\n  Can we instead leverage large-scale human-human interaction data that is more\neasily accessible? Our key insight is to exploit a correspondence between human\nand robot actions that enables transfer learning from human-human to\nhuman-robot data. We propose a novel architecture, InteRACT, that pre-trains a\nconditional intent prediction model on large human-human datasets and\nfine-tunes on a small human-robot dataset. We evaluate on a set of real-world\ncollaborative human-robot manipulation tasks and show that our conditional\nmodel improves over various marginal baselines. We also introduce new\ntechniques to tele-operate a 7-DoF robot arm and collect a diverse range of\nhuman-robot collaborative manipulation data, which we open-source.",

In this work,\nwe study the implications of this scenario for the properties of local\nEarly-Type galaxies (ETG), as inferred from dynamical, photometric and\nspectroscopic studies. We implement a library of CR-IGIMF shapes in the\nframework of the Galaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model. Our realization\nincludes a derivation of synthetic spectral energy distribution for each model\ngalaxy, allowing a direct derivation of the mass fraction in the mean IMF of\nlow-mass stars (i.e. the dwarf-to-giant ratio - $\\rm f_{dg}$) and a comparison\nwith IMF sensitive spectral features. The predictions of the GAEA model\nimplementing the CR-IGIMF confirm our previous findings: it correctly\nreproduces both the observed excess of z$\\sim$0 dynamical mass (mass-to-light\nratios) with respect to spectroscopic (photometric) estimates assuming a\nuniversal, MW-like, IMF, and the observed increase of [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios with\nstellar mass in spheroidal galaxies. Moreover, this realization reproduces the\nincreasing trends of $\\rm f_{dg}$, and IMF-sensitive line-strengths with\nvelocity dispersion, although the predicted relations are significantly\nshallower than the observed ones. Our results show that the CR-IGIMF is a\npromising scenario that reproduces at the same time dynamical, photometric and\nspectroscopic indications of a varying IMF in local ETGs. The shallow relations\nfound for spectral indices suggest that either a stronger variability as a\nfunction of galaxy properties or additional dependences (e.g. as a function of\nstar forming gas metallicity) might be required to match the strength of the\nobserved trends.",

First, we present a dense\nordinal shading formulation using a shift- and scale-invariant loss in order to\nestimate ordinal shading cues without restricting the predictions to obey the\nintrinsic model. We then combine low- and high-resolution ordinal estimations\nusing a second network to generate a shading estimate with both global\ncoherency and local details. We encourage the model to learn an accurate\ndecomposition by computing losses on the estimated shading as well as the\nalbedo implied by the intrinsic model.

The initial cloud is\nassumed to have mass density randomly distributed throughout three-dimensional\nspace. The dark matter particles in the initial cloud are in the kinetic\nregime, i.e., their de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the halo size.\n  It is shown that Bose stars are indeed formed in the numerical simulation\npresented here. The presence of angular momentum and self-interaction in the\ninitial cloud can significantly influence the star formation time in a\nnon-trivial fashion. Furthermore, the plots of the vorticity magnitude profile\nafter the star formation time indicate that the formed star may not have any\nintrinsic angular momentum for the cases when the self-interaction among the\nparticles is either negligible or attractive. These results are in agreement\nwith the earlier analytical studies of an isolated rotating Bose star. However,\nfor the case of repulsive self-interaction, the vorticity magnitude analysis\nshows a possibility that the star formed in the numerical simulations may\npossess intrinsic angular momentum. It is also shown that the average mass and\nradius diagrams of the star are strongly influenced by the presence of angular\nmomentum in the initial cloud.",

However, error\ncorrection imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that\ncan make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly\nthan on idealized hardware. In this work, we identify that programming\nabstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce\npolynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program. If not mitigated, this\nslowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm.\n  To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model,\nusing which a developer can analyze the T-complexity of a program under quantum\nerror correction and pinpoint the sources of slowdown. We also present a set of\nprogram-level optimizations, using which a developer can rewrite a program to\nreduce its T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program\nusing the cost model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a\nstraightforward strategy.\n  We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the\nTower quantum compiler. Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control\nflow, we show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire's optimizations\nrecover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime\nT-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on\nidealized hardware.\n  Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit\ncan yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit\nand then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work. For our\nbenchmarks, only 2 of 8 existing circuit optimizers recover circuits with\nasymptotically efficient T-complexity. Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire\nuses 54x to 2400x less compile time.",

While the longest-lived mode can be extracted in a stable\nmanner, the higher overtones damp more quickly and hence the fitting of\novertones tends to end up with the overfit. To improve the extraction of\novertones, we propose an iterative procedure consisting of fitting and\nsubtraction of the longest-lived mode of the ringdown waveform in the time\ndomain.

However, challenges arise when considering the\ncomputational demands of implementing AI models, such as those employed in\ndigital twins, in real-time information exchange scenarios. This work proposes\na digital twin framework for optimal and autonomous decision-making applied to\na gas-lift process in the oil and gas industry, focusing on enhancing the\nrobustness and adaptability of the DT.

Existing methods usually require 3D\noccupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However, it is very laborious\nto annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper, we propose\nSelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video\nsequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g., bird's eye\nview) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints\non the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can\nthen render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals\nto learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to\ndirectly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our\nSelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single\nframe as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that\nproduces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on nuScenes.

NIM seamlessly integrates traditional physics-based meshfree\ndiscretization techniques with deep learning architectures. It employs a hybrid\napproximation scheme, NeuroPU, to effectively represent the solution by\ncombining continuous DNN representations with partition of unity (PU) basis\nfunctions associated with the underlying spatial discretization. This\nneural-numerical hybridization not only enhances the solution representation\nthrough functional space decomposition but also reduces both the size of DNN\nmodel and the need for spatial gradient computations based on automatic\ndifferentiation, leading to a significant improvement in training efficiency.\nUnder the NIM framework, we propose two truly meshfree solvers: the strong\nform-based NIM (S-NIM) and the local variational form-based NIM (V-NIM). In the\nS-NIM solver, the strong-form governing equation is directly considered in the\nloss function, while the V-NIM solver employs a local Petrov-Galerkin approach\nthat allows the construction of variational residuals based on arbitrary\noverlapping subdomains. This ensures both the satisfaction of underlying\nphysics and the preservation of meshfree property. We perform extensive\nnumerical experiments on both stationary and transient benchmark problems to\nassess the effectiveness of the proposed NIM methods in terms of accuracy,\nscalability, generalizability, and convergence properties. Moreover,\ncomparative analysis with other physics-informed machine learning methods\ndemonstrates that NIM, especially V-NIM, significantly enhances both accuracy\nand efficiency in end-to-end predictive capabilities.",

            "summary": "We present here a Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum for the magic angle twisted\nbilayer graphene obtained using an ab initio based multi-million atom\ntight-binding model. We incorporate a hexagonal boron nitride substrate and\nout-of-plane atomic relaxation. The effects of a magnetic field are introduced\nvia the Peierls modification of the long-range tight-binding matrix elements\nand the Zeeman spin splitting effects. A nanoribbon geometry is studied, and\nthe quantum size effects for the sample widths up to 1 $\\mu$m are analyzed both\nfor a large energy window and for the flatband around the Fermi level. For\nsufficiently wide ribbons, where the role of the finite geometry is minimized,\nwe obtain and plot the Hofstadter spectrum and identify the in-gap Chern\nnumbers by counting the total number of chiral edge states crossing these gaps.\nSubsequently, we examine the Wannier diagrams to identify the insulating states\nat charge neutrality. We establish the presence of three types of electronic\nstates: moir\\'e, mixed, and conventional. These states describe both the bulk\nLandau levels and the edge states crossing gaps in the spectrum. The evolution\nof the bulk moir\\'e flatband wavefunctions in the magnetic field is\ninvestigated, predicting a decay of the electronic density from the moir\\'e\ncenters as the magnetic flux increases. Furthermore, the spatial properties of\nthe three types of edge states are studied, illustrating the evolution of their\nlocalization as a function of the nanoribbon momentum.",

            "summary": "In solid state systems, group representation theory is powerful in\ncharacterizing the behavior of quasiparticles, notably the energy degeneracy.\nWhile conventional group theory is effective in answering yes-or-no questions\nrelated to symmetry breaking, its application to determining the magnitude of\nenergy splitting resulting from symmetry lowering is limited. Here, we propose\na theory on quasi-symmetry and near degeneracy, thereby expanding the\napplicability of group theory to address questions regarding large-or-small\nenergy splitting. Defined within the degenerate subspace of an unperturbed\nHamiltonian, quasi-symmetries form an enlarged symmetry group eliminating the\nfirst-order splitting. This framework ensures that the magnitude of splitting\narises as a second-order effect of symmetry-lowering perturbations, such as\nexternal fields and spin-orbit coupling. We systematically tabulate the\nsubspaces supporting crystallographic quasi-symmetry groups and demonstrate\nthat $Z_{n}$, $U(1)$, and $D_{\\infty}$ can serve as the quotient group of\nunitary quasi-symmetry group in doubly degenerate subspace. Applying our theory\nto the realistic material AgLa, we predict a \"quasi-Dirac semimetal\" phase\ncharacterized by two tiny-gap band anticrossings. Our research not only\nbroadens the scope of group theory but also opens new avenues for material\ndesign, particularly in the realm of superior Berry curvature-related\nproperties.",

This study offers a comprehensive assessment of these patterns by\nleveraging around 70 years of data, taking into account climate zones and\ngeographical types. We analyzed surface water quality indicators, including pH,\ndissolved oxygen, specific conductance, and water temperature, based on field\nresults from approximately 5,000 water quality stations in California Water\nQuality Data (CWQD). Machine learning (ML) models were developed to establish\nrelationships between spatial and temporal variables, climate zones,\ngeographical types, and water quality indicators. Applying these models to\nspatially interpolate and temporally predict the four water quality indicators\nover California for the next 50 years, the research results indicate an uneven\ndistribution of water quality indicators in California, suggesting the presence\nof potential pollution zones, seawater erosion, and effects of climate change.",

Given a collection of features\navailable for inclusion in a predictive model, it may be of interest to\nquantify the relative importance of a subset of features for the prediction\ntask at hand. In particular, in HIV vaccine trials, participant baseline\ncharacteristics are used to predict the probability of infection over the\nintended follow-up period, and investigators may wish to understand how much\ncertain types of predictors, such as behavioral factors, contribute toward\noverall predictiveness. Time-to-event outcomes such as time to infection are\noften subject to right censoring, and existing methods for assessing variable\nimportance are typically not intended to be used in this setting. We describe a\nbroad class of algorithm-agnostic variable importance measures for prediction\nin the context of survival data. We propose a nonparametric efficient\nestimation procedure that incorporates flexible learning of nuisance\nparameters, yields asymptotically valid inference, and enjoys\ndouble-robustness.

In an analogy\nto adversarial attacks on image classifiers, we call such inputs\n\\textbf{adversarial perception errors} and show they can be systematically\nconstructed using a simple boundary-attack algorithm. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this algorithm by finding attacks for two different black-box\nplanners in several urban and highway driving scenarios using the CARLA\nsimulator.

As a demonstration, we show that AZfP can derive the\nhigh-frequency expansion in the Floquet systems. AZfP may have the possibility\nof developing a new theoretical framework in physics.",

To better define the statistical\nprocesses underlying perceptual decision-making, here we characterize the\nchoices of human participants visualizing a system of nonequilibrium stationary\nphysical dynamics and compare such choices to the performance of an optimal\nagent computing Wald's sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Participants\nviewed movies of a particle endowed with drifted Brownian dynamics and had to\njudge the motion as leftward or rightward. Overall, the results uncovered\nfundamental performance limits, consistent with recently established\nthermodynamic trade-offs involving speed, accuracy, and dissipation.\nSpecifically, decision times are sensitive to entropy production rates.\nMoreover, to achieve a given level of observed accuracy, participants require\nmore time than predicted by SPRT, indicating suboptimal integration of\navailable information. In view of such suboptimality, we develop an alternative\naccount based on evidence integration with a memory time constant. Setting the\ntime constant proportionately to the deviation from equilibrium in the stimuli\nsignificantly improved trial-by-trial predictions of decision metrics with\nrespect to SPRT. This study shows that perceptual psychophysics using stimuli\nrooted in nonequilibrium physical processes provides a robust platform for\nunderstanding how the brain takes decisions on stochastic information inputs.",

To address these issues, fairness-aware machine learning\njointly optimizes two (or more) metrics aiming at predictive effectiveness and\nlow unfairness. However, the inherent under-representation of minorities in the\ndata makes the disparate treatment of subpopulations less noticeable and\ndifficult to deal with during learning.

To\nbalance the data distribution between the majority and the minority groups, our\napproach deemphasizes samples from the majority group. To minimize empirical\nrisk, our method prefers samples from the majority group that are close to the\nminority group as evaluated by the Wasserstein distance.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays\na crucial role in understanding their intricate molecular arrangements and is\nessential in assessing and verifying the molecular structure of organic\nmolecules. An important part of this process is to predict the NMR chemical\nshift from the molecular structure. This work introduces a novel approach that\nleverages E(3) equivariant graph neural networks to predict carbohydrate NMR\nspectra. Notably, our model achieves a substantial reduction in mean absolute\nerror, up to threefold, compared to traditional models that rely solely on\ntwo-dimensional molecular structure. Even with limited data, the model excels,\nhighlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities. The implications\nare far-reaching and go beyond an advanced understanding of carbohydrate\nstructures and spectral interpretation. For example, it could accelerate\nresearch in pharmaceutical applications, biochemistry, and structural biology,\noffering a faster and more reliable analysis of molecular structures.\nFurthermore, our approach is a key step towards a new data-driven era in\nspectroscopy, potentially influencing spectroscopic techniques beyond NMR.",

            "summary": "Graph pooling has been increasingly recognized as crucial for Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to facilitate hierarchical graph representation learning.\nExisting graph pooling methods commonly consist of two stages: selecting\ntop-ranked nodes and discarding the remaining to construct coarsened graph\nrepresentations. However, this paper highlights two key issues with these\nmethods: 1) The process of selecting nodes to discard frequently employs\nadditional Graph Convolutional Networks or Multilayer Perceptrons, lacking a\nthorough evaluation of each node's impact on the final graph representation and\nsubsequent prediction tasks. 2) Current graph pooling methods tend to directly\ndiscard the noise segment (dropped) of the graph without accounting for the\nlatent information contained within these elements. To address the first issue,\nwe introduce a novel Graph Explicit Pooling (GrePool) method, which selects\nnodes by explicitly leveraging the relationships between the nodes and final\nrepresentation vectors crucial for classification. The second issue is\naddressed using an extended version of GrePool (i.e., GrePool+), which applies\na uniform loss on the discarded nodes. This addition is designed to augment the\ntraining process and improve classification accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments across 12 widely used datasets to validate our\nproposed method's effectiveness, including the Open Graph Benchmark datasets.\nOur experimental results uniformly demonstrate that GrePool outperforms 14\nbaseline methods for most datasets. Likewise, implementing GrePool+ enhances\nGrePool's performance without incurring additional computational costs.",

However, such very large energies are unreachable by\ncurrent experiments on Earth. Current and future Cherenkov telescope facilities\nmay have the capability to measure the accumulated deformation from Lorentz\nsymmetry for photons traveling over large distances via energy-dependent time\ndelays. One of the best natural laboratories to test Lorentz Invariance\nViolation~(LIV) signatures are Gamma-ray bursts~(GRBs). The calculation of time\ndelays due to the LIV effect depends on the cosmic expansion history. In most\nof the previous works calculating time lags due to the LIV effect, the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM (or concordance) cosmological model is assumed. In this paper, we\ninvestigate whether the LIV signature is significantly different when assuming\nalternatives to the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. Specifically, we consider\ncosmological models with a non-trivial dark-energy equation of state ($w \\neq\n-1$), such as the standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder~(CPL) parameterization,\nthe quadratic parameterization of the dark-energy equation of state, and the\nPade parameterizations.

In such strategies, unknown quantum\nstates are first measured (or ``learned''), to obtain classical data that can\nbe used to later infer (or ``predict'') some desired properties of the quantum\nstates. Even if the used measurement procedure is fixed, surprisingly,\nestimations of an exponential number of vastly different quantities can be\nobtained from a polynomial amount of measurement data. This raises the question\nof just how powerful ``measure-first'' strategies are, and in particular, if\nall quantum machine learning problems can be solved with a measure-first,\nanalyze-later scheme. This paper explores the potential and limitations of\nthese measure-first protocols in learning from quantum data. We study a natural\nsupervised learning setting where quantum states constitute data points, and\nthe labels stem from an unknown measurement. We examine two types of machine\nlearning protocols: ``measure-first'' protocols, where all the quantum data is\nfirst measured using a fixed measurement strategy, and ``fully-quantum''\nprotocols where the measurements are adapted during the training process. Our\nmain result is a proof of separation. We prove that there exist learning\nproblems that can be efficiently learned by fully-quantum protocols but which\nrequire exponential resources for measure-first protocols. Moreover, we show\nthat this separation persists even for quantum data that can be prepared by a\npolynomial-time quantum process, such as a polynomially-sized quantum circuit.\nOur proofs combine methods from one-way communication complexity and\npseudorandom quantum states. Our result underscores the role of quantum data\nprocessing in machine learning and highlights scenarios where quantum\nadvantages appear.",

The precision achieved in the\nexperiments of A.

As it was predicted theoretically, a great impact of effects arising\nbeyond the resonance approximation was found experimentally. These findings\nmarked the beginning of the upcoming epoch in the resonant atomic spectroscopy\nwhen many commonly understood ideas became invalid. For example, the atomic\ntransition may be characterized by several different but equally acceptable\nfrequencies. Furthermore, we show that the picture becomes even more\ncomplicated when the observed spectral line profile is \"identified\" with one of\nthe processes - emission or absorption. Precise determination of the transition\nfrequency requires a description of the absorption line profile inseparable\nfrom the emission process and vice versa. The theoretical aspects discussed in\nthis work provide prerequisites for more accurate and yet simpler experiments\nthan those reported in Science 358, 79 (2017).

This issue\nis known as deciding what to decide or Trustworthy AI. However, the AI system\nitself is often considered an opaque black box. We propose a new approach to\naddress this issue by introducing a novel framework of Trustworthy AI (TAI)\nencompassing three crucial components of AI: representation space, loss\nfunction, and optimizer. Each component is loosely coupled with four TAI\nproperties. Altogether, the framework consists of twelve TAI properties. We aim\nto use this framework to conduct the TAI experiments by quantitive and\nqualitative research methods to satisfy TAI properties for the decision-making\ncontext. The framework allows us to formulate an optimal prediction model\ntrained by the given dataset for applying the strategic investment decision of\ncredit default swaps (CDS) in the technology sector.

            "summary": "To assist surgeons in the operating theatre, surgical phase recognition is\ncritical for developing computer-assisted surgical systems, which requires\ncomprehensive understanding of surgical videos. Although existing studies made\ngreat progress, there are still two significant limitations worthy of\nimprovement. First, due to the compromise of resource consumption, frame-wise\nvisual features are extracted by 2D networks and disregard spatial and temporal\nknowledge of surgical actions, which hinders subsequent inter-frame modeling\nfor phase prediction. Second, these works simply utilize ordinary\nclassification loss with one-hot phase labels to optimize the phase\npredictions, and cannot fully explore surgical videos under inadequate\nsupervision. To overcome these two limitations, we propose a Surgical Temporal\nAction-aware Network with sequence Regularization, named STAR-Net, to recognize\nsurgical phases more accurately from input videos. Specifically, we propose an\nefficient multi-scale surgical temporal action (MS-STA) module, which\nintegrates visual features with spatial and temporal knowledge of surgical\nactions at the cost of 2D networks. Moreover, we devise the dual-classifier\nsequence regularization (DSR) to facilitate the training of STAR-Net by the\nsequence guidance of an auxiliary classifier with a smaller capacity. Our\nSTAR-Net with MS-STA and DSR can exploit visual features of surgical actions\nwith effective regularization, thereby leading to the superior performance of\nsurgical phase recognition. Extensive experiments on a large-scale gastrectomy\nsurgery dataset and the public Cholec80 benchmark prove that our STAR-Net\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-arts of surgical phase recognition.",

            "summary": "Humans rely on their visual and tactile senses to develop a comprehensive 3D\nunderstanding of their physical environment. Recently, there has been a growing\ninterest in exploring and manipulating objects using data-driven approaches\nthat utilise high-resolution vision-based tactile sensors. However, 3D shape\nreconstruction using tactile sensing has lagged behind visual shape\nreconstruction because of limitations in existing techniques, including the\ninability to generalise over unseen shapes, the absence of real-world testing,\nand limited expressive capacity imposed by discrete representations. To address\nthese challenges, we propose TouchSDF, a Deep Learning approach for tactile 3D\nshape reconstruction that leverages the rich information provided by a\nvision-based tactile sensor and the expressivity of the implicit neural\nrepresentation DeepSDF. Our technique consists of two components: (1) a\nConvolutional Neural Network that maps tactile images into local meshes\nrepresenting the surface at the touch location, and (2) an implicit neural\nfunction that predicts a signed distance function to extract the desired 3D\nshape. This combination allows TouchSDF to reconstruct smooth and continuous 3D\nshapes from tactile inputs in simulation and real-world settings, opening up\nresearch avenues for robust 3D-aware representations and improved multimodal\nperception in robotics.

The isolated\nelliptical NGC 5812 is another object to investigate a possible role of\nisolation. We use globular clusters (GCs) and the galaxy light itself as\ndynamical tracers to constrain its mass profile. We employ Gemini/GMOS mask\nspectroscopy, apply the GMOS reduction procedures provided within IRAF, measure\nGC velocities by cross correlation methods and extract the line-of-sight\nkinematics of galaxy spectra using the tool pPXF. We identify 28 GCs with an\noutermost galactocentric distance of 20 kpc, for which velocities could be\nobtained. Furthermore, 16 spectra of the integrated galaxy light out to 6 kpc\nhave been used to model the central kinematics. These spectra provide evidence\nfor a disturbed velocity field. We construct spherical Jeans models for the\ngalaxy light and apply tracer mass estimators for the globular clusters. With\nthe assumptions inherent to the mass estimators, MOND is compatible with the\nmass out to 20 kpc. However, a dark matter free galaxy is not excluded. We find\none globular cluster with an estimated mass of 1.6x10**7 solar masses, the\nfirst Ultra Compact Dwarf in an isolated elliptical. We put NGC 5812 into the\ngeneral context of dark matter or alternative ideas in elliptical galaxies. The\ncase for a MONDian phenomenology also among early-type galaxies has become so\nstrong that deviating cases appear astrophysically more interesting than\nagreements. The baryonic Tully Fisher relation (BTFR) as predicted by MOND is\nobserved in some samples of early-type galaxies, in others not. However, in\ncases of galaxies that deviate from the MONDian prediction, data quality and\ndata completeness are often problematic. (abridged)",

            "summary": "Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) aims to maximally boost model adaptation in a\nnew target domain by actively selecting a limited number of target data to\nannotate.This setting neglects the more practical scenario where training data\nare collected from multiple sources. This motivates us to target a new and\nchallenging setting of knowledge transfer that extends ADA from a single source\ndomain to multiple source domains, termed Multi-source Active Domain Adaptation\n(MADA). Not surprisingly, we find that most traditional ADA methods cannot work\ndirectly in such a setting, mainly due to the excessive domain gap introduced\nby all the source domains and thus their uncertainty-aware sample selection can\neasily become miscalibrated under the multi-domain shifts. Considering this, we\npropose a Dynamic integrated uncertainty valuation framework(Detective) that\ncomprehensively consider the domain shift between multi-source domains and\ntarget domain to detect the informative target samples. Specifically, the\nleverages a dynamic Domain Adaptation(DA) model that learns how to adapt the\nmodel's parameters to fit the union of multi-source domains. This enables an\napproximate single-source domain modeling by the dynamic model. We then\ncomprehensively measure both domain uncertainty and predictive uncertainty in\nthe target domain to detect informative target samples using evidential deep\nlearning, thereby mitigating uncertainty miscalibration. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a contextual diversity-aware calculator to enhance the diversity of\nthe selected samples. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms\nexisting methods by a considerable margin on three domain adaptation\nbenchmarks.",

The ROIE enhances the target\nobject region of the image by using the predicted score map of the first UNet.\nThe features learned by the first UNet and the enhanced image help the second\nUNet obtain a better score map. Finally, the results are fine-tuned by the\nthird UNet. We evaluate our algorithm on a publicly available dataset of skin\nlesion segmentation.

Yet, it is still not clear how we can use the superior pattern\nmatching abilities of machine learning models for scientific discovery. This is\nbecause the goals of machine learning and science are generally not aligned. In\naddition to being accurate, scientific theories must also be causally\nconsistent with the underlying physical process and allow for human analysis,\nreasoning, and manipulation to advance the field. In this paper, we present a\ncase study on discovering a new symbolic model for oceanic rogue waves from\ndata using causal analysis, deep learning, parsimony-guided model selection,\nand symbolic regression. We train an artificial neural network on causal\nfeatures from an extensive dataset of observations from wave buoys, while\nselecting for predictive performance and causal invariance. We apply symbolic\nregression to distill this black-box model into a mathematical equation that\nretains the neural network's predictive capabilities, while allowing for\ninterpretation in the context of existing wave theory. The resulting model\nreproduces known behavior, generates well-calibrated probabilities, and\nachieves better predictive scores on unseen data than current theory.

            "summary": "We study time harmonic acoustic scattering on large deviation rough random\nscatterers. Therein, the roughness of the scatterers is caused by a low Sobolev\nregularity in the covariance function of their deformation field. The\nmotivation for this study arises from physical phenomena where small-scale\nmaterial defects can potentially introduce non-smooth deviations from a\nreference domain. The primary challenge in this scenario is that the scattered\nwave is also random, which makes computational predictions unreliable.\nTherefore, it is essential to quantify these uncertainties to ensure robust and\nwell-informed design processes. While existing methods for uncertainty\nquantification typically rely on domain mapping or perturbation approaches, it\nturns out that large and rough random deviations are not satisfactory covered.\nTo close this gap, and although counter intuitive at first, we show that the\n$p$-multilevel Monte Carlo method can provide an efficient tool for uncertainty\nquantification in this setting. To this end, we discuss the stable\nimplementation of higher-order polynomial approximation of the deformation\nfield by means of barycentric interpolation and provide a cost-to-accuracy\nanalysis.

By employing effective\nbackground discrimination techniques, our results show a remarkably high degree\nof local polarization in the outskirt region, exceeding 60% (55%) with a\nprobability of 95% (99%), which approaches the upper limit predicted by the\nsynchrotron emission mechanism. The high degree of polarization suggests that\nthe turbulent magnetic energy is at most 33% of the ordered one. In addition,\nthe X-ray polarization map exhibits a toroidal magnetic field pattern that is\nconsistent with the field revealed by radio observations across the entire\nnebula. This consistency reveals that the observed X-ray and radio emissions\nare radiated by electrons from the same magnetic field. Different from the Crab\nPWN, the consistency observed in the Vela PWN may be attributed to the\ninteraction between the reverse shock of supernova blast wave and the PWN,\nwhich leads to a displacement between the synchrotron-cooled nebula and the\nfresh nebula close to the pulsar. These findings deepen our understanding of\nthe structure and evolution of the Vela PWN, and the magnetohydrodynamic\ninteraction in PWNe.",

Our algorithm, DistillNet, is\na DNN that is trained to learn about the provenance of particles, as provided\nby the soft labels that are the GNN outputs, to predict whether or not a\nparticle originates from the primary interaction vertex. The results indicate\nthat for this problem, which is one of the main challenges at the HL-LHC, there\nis minimal loss during the transfer of knowledge to the small student network,\nwhile improving significantly the computational resource needs compared to the\nteacher. This is demonstrated for the distilled student network on a CPU, as\nwell as for a quantized and pruned student network deployed on an FPGA. Our\nstudy proves that knowledge transfer between networks of different complexity\ncan be used for fast artificial intelligence (AI) in high-energy physics that\nimproves the expressiveness of observables over non-AI-based reconstruction\nalgorithms.

            "summary": "We present the first observation of the singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay\n$\\Lambda_c^+ \\rightarrow \\Lambda K^+\\pi^0$ with a significance of $5.7\\sigma$\nand the first evidence of $\\Lambda_c^+ \\rightarrow \\Lambda K^+\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decay\nwith a significance of $3.1\\sigma$, based on $e^+e^-$ annihilation data\nrecorded by the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. The data correspond to\nan integrated luminosity of $6.4~{\\rm fb^{-1}}$, in the center-of-mass energy\nrange from $4.600~{\\rm GeV}$ to $4.950~{\\rm GeV}$. We determine the branching\nfractions of $\\Lambda_c^+ \\rightarrow \\Lambda K^+\\pi^0$ and $\\Lambda_c^+\n\\rightarrow \\Lambda K^+\\pi^+\\pi^-$ relative to their Cabibbo-favored\ncounterparts to be $\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\rightarrow \\Lambda\nK^+\\pi^0)}{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\rightarrow \\Lambda \\pi^+\\pi^0)} =\n(2.09\\pm0.39_{\\mathrm{stat.}}\\pm0.07_{\\mathrm{syst.}}) \\times 10^{-2}$ and\n$\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\rightarrow \\Lambda\nK^+\\pi^+\\pi^-)}{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\rightarrow \\Lambda \\pi^+\\pi^+\\pi^-)} =\n(1.13\\pm0.41_{\\mathrm{stat.}}\\pm0.06_{\\mathrm{syst.}}) \\times 10^{-2}$,\nrespectively. Moreover, by combining our measured result with the world average\nof $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda^+_c\\to \\Lambda\\pi^+\\pi^0)$, we obtain the branching\nfraction $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\to \\Lambda K^+\\pi^0) =\n(1.49\\pm0.27_{\\mathrm{stat.}}\\pm0.05_{\\mathrm{syst.}}\\pm0.08_{\\mathrm{ref.}})\n\\times 10^{-3}$. This result significantly departs from theoretical predictions\nbased on quark $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry, which is underpinned by the presumption\nof meson pair $S$-wave amplitude dominance.",

            "summary": "Nuclear reactors are a source of electron antineutrinos due to the presence\nof unstable fission products that undergo $\\beta^-$ decay. They will be\nexploited by the JUNO experiment to determine the neutrino mass ordering and to\nget very precise measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters. This\nrequires the reactor antineutrino spectrum to be characterized as precisely as\npossible both through high resolution measurements, as foreseen by the TAO\nexperiment, and detailed simulation models. In this paper we present a\nbenchmark analysis utilizing Serpent Monte Carlo simulations in comparison with\nreal pressurized water reactor spent fuel data. Our objective is to study the\naccuracy of fission fraction predictions as a function of different reactor\nsimulation approximations. Then, utilizing the BetaShape software, we construct\nfissile antineutrino spectra using the summation method, thereby assessing the\ninfluence of simulation uncertainties on reactor antineutrino spectrum.",

            "summary": "Safe and smooth motion control is essential for mobile robots when performing\nvarious automation tasks around obstacles, especially in the presence of people\nand other mobile robots. The total turning and space used by a mobile robot\nwhile moving towards a specified goal position play a crucial role in\ndetermining the required control effort and complexity. In this paper, we\nconsider a standard unicycle control approach based on angular feedback\nlinearization and provide an explicit analytical measure for determining the\ntotal turning effort during unicycle control in terms of unicycle state and\ncontrol gains. We show that undesired spiral oscillatory motion around the goal\nposition can be avoided by choosing a higher angular control gain compared to\nthe linear control gain. Accordingly, we establish an accurate, explicit\ntriangular motion range bound on the closed-loop unicycle trajectory using the\ntotal turning effort. The improved accuracy in motion range prediction results\nfrom a stronger dependency on the unicycle state and control parameters. To\ncompare alternative circular, conic, and triangular motion range prediction\napproaches, we present an application of the proposed unicycle motion control\nand motion prediction methods for safe unicycle path following around obstacles\nin numerical simulations.",

            "summary": "Neural operators extend the capabilities of traditional neural networks by\nallowing them to handle mappings between function spaces for the purpose of\nsolving partial differential equations (PDEs). One of the most notable methods\nis the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which is inspired by Green's function\nmethod and approximate operator kernel directly in the frequency domain. In\nthis work, we focus on predicting multiscale dynamic spaces, which is\nequivalent to solving multiscale PDEs. Multiscale PDEs are characterized by\nrapid coefficient changes and solution space oscillations, which are crucial\nfor modeling atmospheric convection and ocean circulation. To solve this\nproblem, models should have the ability to capture rapid changes and process\nthem at various scales. However, the FNO only approximates kernels in the\nlow-frequency domain, which is insufficient when solving multiscale PDEs. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical neural operator that\nintegrates improved Fourier layers with attention mechanisms, aiming to capture\nall details and handle them at various scales. These mechanisms complement each\nother in the frequency domain and encourage the model to solve multiscale\nproblems. We perform experiments on dynamic spaces governed by forward and\nreverse problems of multiscale elliptic equations, Navier-Stokes equations and\nsome other physical scenarios, and reach superior performance in existing PDE\nbenchmarks, especially equations characterized by rapid coefficient variations.",

On the other hand, Mott Hubbard physics and\nthe concomitant formation of local moments is dominated by the local effective\nHubbard interaction. Using quantum Monte Carlo methods combined with stochastic\nanalytical continuation, we compute the single particle spectral function of\nfermions on the honeycomb lattice for a realistic interaction that includes\nboth the Hubbard interaction and long-ranged Coulomb repulsion. To a first\napproximation, we find that the generic high-energy features such as the\nformation of the upper Hubbard band are independent of the long-ranged Coulomb\nrepulsion and determined mostly by the local effective Hubbard interaction. The\nsub-leading effects of adding the long-range interaction include an enhancement\nof the bandwidth and a decrease of the spin-polaron quasi-particle weight and\nlifetime.",

            "summary": "In an era of increasing pressure to achieve sustainable agriculture, the\noptimization of livestock feed for enhancing yield and minimizing environmental\nimpact is a paramount objective. This study presents a pioneering approach\ntowards this goal, using rumen microbiome data to predict the efficacy of feed\nadditives in dairy cattle.\n  We collected an extensive dataset that includes methane emissions from 2,190\nHolstein cows distributed across 34 distinct sites. The cows were divided into\ncontrol and experimental groups in a double-blind, unbiased manner, accounting\nfor variables such as age, days in lactation, and average milk yield. The\nexperimental groups were administered one of four leading commercial feed\nadditives: Agolin, Kexxtone, Allimax, and Relyon. Methane emissions were\nmeasured individually both before the administration of additives and over a\nsubsequent 12-week period. To develop our predictive model for additive\nefficacy, rumen microbiome samples were collected from 510 cows from the same\nherds prior to the study's onset. These samples underwent deep metagenomic\nshotgun sequencing, yielding an average of 15.7 million reads per sample.\nUtilizing innovative artificial intelligence techniques we successfully\nestimated the efficacy of these feed additives across different farms. The\nmodel's robustness was further confirmed through validation with independent\ncohorts, affirming its generalizability and reliability.\n  Our results underscore the transformative capability of using targeted feed\nadditive strategies to both optimize dairy yield and milk composition, and to\nsignificantly reduce methane emissions. Specifically, our predictive model\ndemonstrates a scenario where its application could guide the assignment of\nadditives to farms where they are most effective. In doing so, we could achieve\nan average potential reduction of over 27\\% in overall emissions.",

            "summary": "Aerodynamic drag can be partially approximated by the entropy flux across\nfluid domain boundaries with a formula due to Oswatitsch. In this paper, we\nbuild the adjoint solution that corresponds to this representation of the drag\nand investigate its relation to the entropy variables, which are linked to the\nintegrated residual of the entropy transport equation. For inviscid isentropic\nflows, the resulting adjoint variables are identical to the entropy variables,\nan observation originally due to Fidkowski and Roe, while for non-isentropic\nflows there is a significant difference that is explicitly demonstrated with\nanalytic solutions in the shocked quasi-1D case. Both approaches are also\ninvestigated for viscous and inviscid flows in two and three dimensions, where\nthe adjoint equations and boundary conditions are derived. The application of\nboth approaches to mesh adaptation is investigated, with especial emphasis on\ninviscid flows with shocks.",

            "summary": "Accurate and automated segmentation of intervertebral discs (IVDs) in medical\nimages is crucial for assessing spine-related disorders, such as osteoporosis,\nvertebral fractures, or IVD herniation. We present HCA-Net, a novel contextual\nattention network architecture for semantic labeling of IVDs, with a special\nfocus on exploiting prior geometric information. Our approach excels at\nprocessing features across different scales and effectively consolidating them\nto capture the intricate spatial relationships within the spinal cord. To\nachieve this, HCA-Net models IVD labeling as a pose estimation problem, aiming\nto minimize the discrepancy between each predicted IVD location and its\ncorresponding actual joint location. In addition, we introduce a skeletal loss\nterm to reinforce the model's geometric dependence on the spine. This loss\nfunction is designed to constrain the model's predictions to a range that\nmatches the general structure of the human vertebral skeleton. As a result, the\nnetwork learns to reduce the occurrence of false predictions and adaptively\nimproves the accuracy of IVD location estimation. Through extensive\nexperimental evaluation on multi-center spine datasets, our approach\nconsistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both MRI T1w and\nT2w modalities.

Accordingly, here, for the first time, we\nobtain an analytical expression for the PE of a homogeneous general\nrelativistic UCO assuming it to be cold and static.

Further, UCOs supported by tangential stresses may be inhomogeneous and\nmuch more massive than neutron stars with PE $\\sim$ 2.1 Mc$^2$ Thus, in\nprinciple, formation of an UCO of a few solar masses ($M_\\odot$) might release\nan energy $Q\\sim10^{55}$ erg.",

The proposed architecture\nis superior since it enjoys the benefits of the individual designs. We\nintroduce a channel estimation approach of the cascaded channels with reduced\noverhead. Also, we obtain the deterministic equivalent (DE) of the downlink\nachievable sum spectral efficiency (SE) in closed form based on large-scale\nstatistics. Notably, relied on statistical channel state information (CSI), we\noptimise both surfaces by means of the projected gradient ascent method (PGAM),\nand obtain the gradients in closed form. The proposed optimization achieves to\nmaximise the sum SE of such a complex system, and has low complexity and low\noverhead since it can be performed at every several coherence intervals.\nNumerical results show the benefit of the proposed architecture and verify the\nanalytical framework.

All\nmechanistic steps constituting the transformation mechanism accurately predict\nthe experimentally measured solid and aqueous phase composition over time,\ninvolving only a single kinetic rate constant each. It is found that the\nprecipitation of goethite (i) occurs from solution and (ii) is limited by the\ncomparatively slow dissolution of the first forming amorphous phase 2-line\nferrihydrite. A generalised transformation mechanism applicable to near-neutral\nand mildly acidic pH further illustrates that differences in the kinetics of\nFe(III) precipitation are controlled by the coordination environment of the\npredominant Fe(III) hydrolysis product.

We\ninvestigate how sharing information across indications can strengthen the\ninferences supporting Health Technology Assessment (HTA). Methods: We applied\nmeta-analytic methods to randomised trial data on bevacizumab to share\ninformation across cancer indications on the treatment effect on overall\nsurvival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS), and on the surrogate\nrelationship between effects on PFS and OS. Common or random parameters were\nused to facilitate sharing and the further flexibility of mixture models was\nexplored. Results: OS treatment effects lacked precision when pooling data\navailable at present-day within each indication, particularly for indications\nwith few trials. There was no suggestion of heterogeneity across indications.\nSharing information across indications provided more precise inferences on\ntreatment effects, and on surrogacy parameters, with the strength of sharing\ndepending on the model. When a surrogate relationship was used to predict OS\neffects, uncertainty was only reduced with sharing imposed on PFS effects in\naddition to surrogacy parameters. Corresponding analyses using the earlier,\nsparser evidence available for particular HTAs showed that sharing on both\nsurrogacy and PFS effects did not notably reduce uncertainty in OS predictions.\nLimited heterogeneity across indications meant that the added flexibility of\nmixture models was unnecessary. Conclusions: Meta-analysis methods can be\nusefully applied to share information on treatment effectiveness across\nindications to increase the precision of target indication estimates in HTA.\nSharing on surrogate relationships requires caution, as meaningful precision\ngains require larger bodies of evidence and clear support for surrogacy from\nother indications.",

            "summary": "Lie algebraic techniques are powerful and widely-used tools for studying\ndynamics and metrology in quantum optics. When the Hamiltonian generates a Lie\nalgebra with finite dimension, the unitary evolution can be expressed as a\nfinite product of exponentials using the Wei-Norman expansion. The system is\nthen exactly described by a finite set of scalar differential equations, even\nif the Hilbert space is infinite. However, the differential equations provided\nby the Wei-Norman expansion are nonlinear and often have singularities that\nprevent both analytic and numerical evaluation. We derive a new Lie algebra\nexpansion for the quantum Fisher information, which results in linear\ndifferential equations. Together with existing Lie algebra techniques this\nallows many metrology problems to be analysed entirely in the Heisenberg\npicture. This substantially reduces the calculations involved in many metrology\nproblems, and provides analytical solutions for problems that cannot even be\nsolved numerically using the Wei-Norman expansion. We provide detailed examples\nof these methods applied to problems in quantum optics and nonlinear\noptomechanics.",

            "summary": "Calibration of machine learning classifiers is necessary to obtain reliable\nand interpretable predictions, bridging the gap between model confidence and\nactual probabilities. One prominent technique, isotonic regression (IR), aims\nat calibrating binary classifiers by minimizing the cross entropy on a\ncalibration set via monotone transformations. IR acts as an adaptive binning\nprocedure, which allows achieving a calibration error of zero, but leaves open\nthe issue of the effect on performance. In this paper, we first prove that IR\npreserves the convex hull of the ROC curve -- an essential performance metric\nfor binary classifiers. This ensures that a classifier is calibrated while\ncontrolling for overfitting of the calibration set. We then present a novel\ngeneralization of isotonic regression to accommodate classifiers with K\nclasses. Our method constructs a multidimensional adaptive binning scheme on\nthe probability simplex, again achieving a multi-class calibration error equal\nto zero. We regularize this algorithm by imposing a form of monotony that\npreserves the K-dimensional ROC surface of the classifier. We show empirically\nthat this general monotony criterion is effective in striking a balance between\nreducing cross entropy loss and avoiding overfitting of the calibration set.",

            "summary": "Bouldering is a sport where athletes aim to climb up an obstacle using a set\nof defined holds called a route. Typically routes are assigned a grade to\ninform climbers of its difficulty and allow them to more easily track their\nprogression. However, the variation in individual climbers technical and\nphysical attributes and many nuances of an individual route make grading a\ndifficult and often biased task. In this work, we apply classical and\ndeep-learning modelling techniques to the 2016, 2017 and 2019 Moonboard\ndatasets, achieving state of the art grade prediction performance with 0.87 MAE\nand 1.12 RMSE. We achieve this performance on a feature-set that does not\nrequire decomposing routes into individual moves, which is a method common in\nliterature and introduces bias. We also demonstrate the generalization\ncapability of this model between editions and introduce a novel vision-based\nmethod of grade prediction. While the generalization performance of these\ntechniques is below human level performance currently, we propose these methods\nas a basis for future work. Such a tool could be implemented in pre-existing\nmobile applications and would allow climbers to better track their progress and\nassess new routes with reduced bias.",

            "summary": "For intelligent quadcopter UAVs, a robust and reliable autonomous planning\nsystem is crucial. Most current trajectory planning methods for UAVs are\nsuitable for static environments but struggle to handle dynamic obstacles,\nwhich can pose challenges and even dangers to flight. To address this issue,\nthis paper proposes a vision-based planning system that combines tracking and\ntrajectory prediction of dynamic obstacles to achieve efficient and reliable\nautonomous flight. We use a lightweight object detection algorithm to identify\ndynamic obstacles and then use Kalman Filtering to track and estimate their\nmotion states. During the planning phase, we not only consider static obstacles\nbut also account for the potential movements of dynamic obstacles. For\ntrajectory generation, we use a B-spline-based trajectory search algorithm,\nwhich is further optimized with various constraints to enhance safety and\nalignment with the UAV's motion characteristics. We conduct experiments in both\nsimulation and real-world environments, and the results indicate that our\napproach can successfully detect and avoid obstacles in dynamic environments in\nreal-time, offering greater reliability compared to existing approaches.\nFurthermore, with the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechnology demonstrating exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities,\nmore user-friendly human-machine interactions have become feasible, and this\nstudy also explores the integration of autonomous planning systems with Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs).",

            "summary": "Articulated objects (e.g., doors and drawers) exist everywhere in our life.\nDifferent from rigid objects, articulated objects have higher degrees of\nfreedom and are rich in geometries, semantics, and part functions. Modeling\ndifferent kinds of parts and articulations with nerual networks plays an\nessential role in articulated object understanding and manipulation, and will\nfurther benefit 3D vision and robotics communities. To model articulated\nobjects, most previous works directly encode articulated objects into feature\nrepresentations, without specific designs for parts, articulations and part\nmotions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly\ndisentangles the part motion of articulated objects by predicting the\ntransformation matrix of points on the part surface, using spatially continuous\nneural implicit representations to model the part motion smoothly in the space.\nMore importantly, while many methods could only model a certain kind of joint\nmotion (such as the revolution in the clockwise order), our proposed framework\nis generic to different kinds of joint motions in that transformation matrix\ncan model diverse kinds of joint motions in the space. Quantitative and\nqualitative results of experiments over diverse categories of articulated\nobjects demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

            "summary": "Transparent objects are widely used in our daily lives, making it important\nto teach robots to interact with them. However, it's not easy because the\nreflective and refractive effects can make RGB-D cameras fail to give accurate\ngeometry measurements. To solve this problem, this paper introduces RFTrans, an\nRGB-D-based method for surface normal estimation and manipulation of\ntransparent objects. By leveraging refractive flow as an intermediate\nrepresentation, RFTrans circumvents the drawbacks of directly predicting the\ngeometry (e.g. surface normal) from RGB images and helps bridge the sim-to-real\ngap. RFTrans integrates the RFNet, which predicts refractive flow, object mask,\nand boundaries, followed by the F2Net, which estimates surface normal from the\nrefractive flow. To make manipulation possible, a global optimization module\nwill take in the predictions, refine the raw depth, and construct the point\ncloud with normal. An analytical grasp planning algorithm, ISF, is followed to\ngenerate the grasp poses. We build a synthetic dataset with physically\nplausible ray-tracing rendering techniques to train the networks. Results show\nthat the RFTrans trained on the synthetic dataset can consistently outperform\nthe baseline ClearGrasp in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks by a large\nmargin. Finally, a real-world robot grasping task witnesses an 83% success\nrate, proving that refractive flow can help enable direct sim-to-real transfer.\nThe code, data, and supplementary materials are available at\nhttps://rftrans.robotflow.ai.",

            "summary": "Class-agnostic object counting aims to count all objects in an image with\nrespect to example boxes or class names, \\emph{a.k.a} few-shot and zero-shot\ncounting. Current state-of-the-art methods highly rely on density maps to\npredict object counts, which lacks model interpretability. In this paper, we\npropose a generalized framework for both few-shot and zero-shot object counting\nbased on detection. Our framework combines the superior advantages of two\nfoundation models without compromising their zero-shot capability: (\\textbf{i})\nSAM to segment all possible objects as mask proposals, and (\\textbf{ii}) CLIP\nto classify proposals to obtain accurate object counts. However, this strategy\nmeets the obstacles of efficiency overhead and the small crowded objects that\ncannot be localized and distinguished. To address these issues, our framework,\ntermed PseCo, follows three steps: point, segment, and count. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a class-agnostic object localization to provide accurate but\nleast point prompts for SAM, which consequently not only reduces computation\ncosts but also avoids missing small objects. Furthermore, we propose a\ngeneralized object classification that leverages CLIP image/text embeddings as\nthe classifier, following a hierarchical knowledge distillation to obtain\ndiscriminative classifications among hierarchical mask proposals. Extensive\nexperimental results on FSC-147 dataset demonstrate that PseCo achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both few-shot/zero-shot object\ncounting/detection, with additional results on large-scale COCO and LVIS\ndatasets.

Instead of\nthe need to select a single optimal forecasting model, this paper introduces a\ndeep learning ensemble forecasting model based on the Dirichlet process.\nInitially, the learning rate is sampled with three basis distributions as\nhyperparameters to convert the infinite mixture into a finite one. All\ncheckpoints are collected to establish a deep learning sub-model pool, and\nweight adjustment and diversity strategies are developed during the combination\nprocess. The main advantage of this method is its ability to generate the\nrequired base learners through a single training process, utilizing the\ndecaying strategy to tackle the challenge posed by the stochastic nature of\ngradient descent in determining the optimal learning rate. To ensure the\nmethod's generalizability and competitiveness, this paper conducts an empirical\nanalysis using the weekly dataset from the M4 competition and explores\nsensitivity to the number of models to be combined. The results demonstrate\nthat the ensemble model proposed offers substantial improvements in prediction\naccuracy and stability compared to a single benchmark model.",

In this method, an optical profilometer is used to measure the curvature\ninduced in a magnetostrictively coated coverslip under a DC field through\nphase-sensitive interferometry. From this the magnetostrictive stress and\nstrain are calculated using Stoney's formula. This addresses limitations of\nconventional techniques that measure magnetostriction based on the deflection\nof a cantilever under an AC field, which require complex dedicated set-ups and\nare sensitive to vibrational noise. Further, it reveals information about the\nanisotropy of the film and allows for the possibility of measuring multiple\nsamples simultaneously. The theoretical sensitivity limits are derived,\npredicting a shot-noise-limit of 0.01 ppm. The method is implemented to measure\nthe magnetostrictive hysteresis and piezomagnetic coupling of thin-film\ngalfenol. Degradation in film performance is observed above a thickness of 206\nnm, alongside a change in coercivity.

In this study, a ball-on-plane model is considered to predict the\nlubrication regime across the entire gait cycle for the metal-on-metal and\nceramic-on-ceramic hip implants. According to ISO 14242-1, a normal walking\ngait cycle is considered for the loads and rotations in the hip implant for\nthis study. A comprehensive analysis is done to estimate the lubrication regime\nby considering different material combinations, body weights, femoral head\nsizes, clearances, and roughness across the entire gait cycle. The correlation\ncoefficients show that the geometrical parameters are dominant in affecting the\nlubrication film thickness compared to the operational and material parameters.\nThe femoral head size and body weight are found to be the most dominant and\nleast dominant parameter respectively. Among the hard-on-hard tribo-pair,\nceramics operate predominantly in the full-film lubrication regime compared to\nmetals due to its fine surface finish. The present research suggests that in\norder to maximise the longevity of a hip implant, an orthopaedic surgeon should\nchoose one with a larger femoral head diameter, less clearance, and an\nultra-fine surface finish, regardless of any tribo-pair.",

In this work, we\npropose a simple hierarchical framework for predicting the thermodynamic\nentropies of various molecular CG systems. Our approach employs a decomposition\nof the CG interactions, enabling the estimation of the CG partition function\nand thermodynamic properties a priori. Starting from the ideal gas description,\nwe leverage classical perturbation theory to systematically incorporate simple\nyet essential interactions, ranging from the hard sphere model to the\ngeneralized van der Waals model. Additionally, we propose an alternative\napproach based on multiparticle correlation functions, allowing for systematic\nimprovements through higher-order correlations. Numerical applications to\nmolecular liquids validate the high fidelity of our approach, and our\ncomputational protocols demonstrate that a reduced model with simple energetics\ncan reasonably estimate the thermodynamic entropy of CG models without\nperforming any CG simulations. Overall, our findings present a systematic\nframework for estimating not only the entropy but also other thermodynamic\nproperties of CG models, relying solely on information from the reference\nsystem.",

In the context of using Language Models for question-answering,\ndiscussion continues to occur as to the extent to which questions are answered\nthrough memorisation. We consider this issue for questions that would ideally\nbe answered through reasoning over an associated context. We propose a method\nof identifying evaluation samples for which it is very unlikely our model would\nhave memorised the answers. Our method is based on semantic similarity of input\ntokens and label tokens between training and evaluation samples. We show that\nour method offers advantages upon some prior approaches in that it is able to\nsurface evaluation-train pairs that have overlap in either contiguous or\ndiscontiguous sequences of tokens. We use this method to identify unmemorisable\nsubsets of our evaluation datasets. We train two Language Models in a multitask\nfashion whereby the second model differs from the first only in that it has two\nadditional datasets added to the training regime that are designed to impart\nsimple numerical reasoning strategies of a sort known to improve performance on\nsome of our evaluation datasets but not on others. We then show that there is\nperformance improvement between the two models on the unmemorisable subsets of\nthe evaluation datasets that were expected to benefit from the additional\ntraining datasets. Specifically, performance on unmemorisable subsets of two of\nour evaluation datasets, DROP and ROPES significantly improves by 9.0%, and\n25.7% respectively while other evaluation datasets have no significant change\nin performance.",

These challenges mainly\nstem from various factors such as the lack of annotated data, presence of noise\nin social media datasets, and the sheer volume of data. The common research\npractice typically examines the biased structure of online user communities for\na given topic or qualitatively measuring the impacts of polarized topics on\nsocial media. However, there is limited work focusing on analyzing polarization\nat the ground-level, specifically in the social media posts themselves. Such\nexisting analysis heavily relies on annotated data, which often requires\nlaborious human labeling, offers labels only to specific problems, and lacks\nthe ability to determine the near-future bias state of a social media\nconversations. Understanding the degree of political orientation conveyed in\nsocial media posts is crucial for quantifying the bias of online user\ncommunities and investigating the spread of polarized content. In this work, we\nfirst introduce two heuristic methods that leverage on news media bias and post\ncontent to label social media posts. Next, we compare the efficacy and quality\nof heuristically labeled dataset with a randomly sampled human-annotated\ndataset. Additionally, we demonstrate that current machine learning models can\nexhibit improved performance in predicting political orientation of social\nmedia posts, employing both traditional supervised learning and few-shot\nlearning setups.

            "summary": "Histopathology image analysis is the golden standard of clinical diagnosis\nfor Cancers. In doctors daily routine and computer-aided diagnosis, the Whole\nSlide Image (WSI) of histopathology tissue is used for analysis. Because of the\nextremely large scale of resolution, previous methods generally divide the WSI\ninto a large number of patches, then aggregate all patches within a WSI by\nMulti-Instance Learning (MIL) to make the slide-level prediction when\ndeveloping computer-aided diagnosis tools. However, most previous WSI-MIL\nmodels using global-attention without pairwise interaction and any positional\ninformation, or self-attention with absolute position embedding can not well\nhandle shape varying large WSIs, e.g. testing WSIs after model deployment may\nbe larger than training WSIs, since the model development set is always limited\ndue to the difficulty of histopathology WSIs collection. To deal with the\nproblem, in this paper, we propose to amend position embedding for shape\nvarying long-contextual WSI by introducing Linear Bias into Attention, and\nadapt it from 1-d long sequence into 2-d long-contextual WSI which helps model\nextrapolate position embedding to unseen or under-fitted positions. We further\nutilize Flash-Attention module to tackle the computational complexity of\nTransformer, which also keep full self-attention performance compared to\nprevious attention approximation work. Our method, Long-contextual MIL\n(Long-MIL) are evaluated on extensive experiments including 4 dataset including\nWSI classification and survival prediction tasks to validate the superiority on\nshape varying WSIs.

The output space of the DOA estimation is continuous,\nsuggesting that regression may be the most appropriate formulation for DOA.\nHowever, in practice, converting the DOA estimation into a classification\nproblem often results in better performance than the regression formulation,\nsince that classification problems are generally easier to model, and are more\nrobust in handling noise and uncertainty than regression problems. In the\nclassification formulation of DOA, the output space is discretized into several\nintervals, each of which is treated as a class. These classes exhibit strong\ninter-class correlation, with their mutual-similarity increasing when they\napproach each other and being ordered. However, this property is not\nsufficiently explored. To exploit these property, we propose a soft label\ndistribution, named Unbiased Label Distribution (ULD), for eliminating the\nquantization error of the training target and further taking the inter-class\nsimilarity into strong consideration. We further introduce two loss functions,\nnamed the Negative Log Absolute Error (NLAE) loss function and {Mean Squared\nError loss function without activation (MSE(wo))}, for the soft label family.\nFinally, we design a new decoding method to map the predicted distribution to\nsound source locations, called Weighted Adjacent Decoding (WAD). It uses the\nweighted sum of the probabilities of the peak classes and their adjacent\nclasses in the predicted distribution for decoding. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance, and the WAD\ndecoding method is able to even breakthrough the quantization error limits of\nexisting decoding methods.",

First, to explore\nmodel-based approaches to characterize the primary cause of the noise. in the\nRE dataset TACRED Second, to identify the potentially noisy instances. Towards\nthe first objective, we analyze predictions and performance of state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) models to identify the root cause of noise in the dataset. Our analysis\nof TACRED shows that the majority of the noise in the dataset originates from\nthe instances labeled as no-relation which are negative examples. For the\nsecond objective, we explore two nearest-neighbor-based strategies to\nautomatically identify potentially noisy examples for elimination and\nreannotation. Our first strategy, referred to as Intrinsic Strategy (IS), is\nbased on the assumption that positive examples are clean. Thus, we have used\nfalse-negative predictions to identify noisy negative examples. Whereas, our\nsecond approach, referred to as Extrinsic Strategy, is based on using a clean\nsubset of the dataset to identify potentially noisy negative examples. Finally,\nwe retrained the SOTA models on the eliminated and reannotated dataset.

However, these\ndescriptors are often supervised at point or voxel level, leading to\nsegmentation models that can behave poorly at instance-level. In this paper, we\nproposed a novel instance-aware approach for 3D semantic segmentation. Our\nmethod combines several geometry processing tasks supervised at instance-level\nto promote the consistency of the learned feature representation. Specifically,\nour methods use shape generators and shape classifiers to perform shape\nreconstruction and classification tasks for each shape instance. This enforces\nthe feature representation to faithfully encode both structural and local shape\ninformation, with an awareness of shape instances. In the experiments, our\nmethod significantly outperform existing approaches in 3D semantic segmentation\non several public benchmarks, such as Waymo Open Dataset, SemanticKITTI and\nScanNetV2.",

While researchers\nhad attempted to extend this success to time series models, the main challenge\nis effectively extracting representations and transferring knowledge from\npretraining datasets to the target finetuning dataset. To tackle this issue, we\nintroduce a novel pretraining procedure that leverages supervised contrastive\nlearning to distinguish features within each pretraining dataset. This\npretraining phase enables a probabilistic similarity metric, which assesses the\nlikelihood of a univariate sample being closely related to one of the\npretraining datasets. Subsequently, using this similarity metric as a guide, we\npropose a fine-tuning procedure designed to enhance the accurate prediction of\nthe target data by aligning it more closely with the learned dynamics of the\npretraining datasets.

However, our experiences in the development of a\nhigh-speed off-road platform have revealed several critical challenges that are\nnot adequately addressed by current methods at our operating speeds of 7--10\nm/s. This study focuses particularly on uneven terrain geometries such as\nhills, banks, and ditches. These common high-risk geometries are capable of\ndisabling the vehicle and causing severe passenger injuries if poorly\ntraversed. We introduce a physics-based framework for identifying\ntraversability constraints on terrain dynamics. Using this framework, we then\nderive two fundamental constraints, with a primary focus on mitigating rollover\nand ditch-crossing failures. In addition, we present the design of our planning\nand control system, which uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) and a low-level\ncontroller to enable the fast and efficient computation of these constraints to\nmeet the demands of our aggressive driving. Through real-world experimentation\nand traversal of hills and ditches, our approach is tested and benchmarked\nagainst a human expert. These results demonstrate that our approach captures\nfundamental elements of safe and aggressive control on these terrain features.",

In this paper, we propose a new approach for probabilistic\nforecast reconciliation. Unlike existing approaches, our proposed approach\nfuses the prediction step and reconciliation step into a deep learning\nframework, making the reconciliation step more flexible and soft by introducing\nthe Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization term into the loss function.

To avoid the\nuncertainty caused by RESs, this paper aims to investigate the real-time\noptimal operation of the micro EWH nexus which is however a challenging\noptimization problem.

We address the challenge of splice site prediction by\nintroducing DeepDeCode, an attention-based deep learning sequence model to\ncapture the long-term dependencies in the nucleotides in DNA sequences. We\nfurther propose using visualization techniques for accurate identification of\nsequence motifs, which enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of\nDeepDeCode. We compare DeepDeCode to other state-of-the-art methods for splice\nsite prediction and demonstrate its accuracy, explainability and efficiency.\nGiven the results of our methodology, we expect that it can used for healthcare\napplications to reason about genomic processes and be extended to discover new\nsplice sites and genomic regulatory elements.",

The considered\nscenario involves an ISAC device with a lightweight deep neural network (DNN)\nand a mobile edge computing (MEC) server with a large DNN. After collecting\nsensing data, the ISAC device either processes the data locally or uploads them\nto the server for higher-accuracy data processing. To cope with data drifts,\nthe server updates the lightweight DNN when necessary, referred to as continual\nlearning. Our objective is to minimize the long-term average computation cost\nof the MEC server by optimizing two decisions, i.e., sensing data offloading\nand sensing data selection for the DNN update. A DT of the ISAC device is\nconstructed to predict the impact of potential decisions on the long-term\ncomputation cost of the server, based on which the decisions are made with\nclosed-form formulas. Experiments on executing DNN-based human motion\nrecognition tasks are conducted to demonstrate the outstanding performance of\nthe proposed DT-based approach in computation cost minimization.",

We benchmark both architectures against a conventional Gaussian\nthreshold analysis method. In a sparse array (9 {\\mu}m atom separation) which\nexperiences negligible crosstalk, we observed up to 32% and 56% error reduction\nfor the multi-qubit and single-qubit architectures respectively, as compared to\nthe benchmark. In a tightly spaced array (5 {\\mu}m atom separation), which\nsuffers from readout crosstalk, we observed up to 43% and 32% error reduction\nin the multi-qubit and single-qubit CNN architectures respectively, as compared\nto the benchmark. By examining the correlation between the predicted states of\nneighboring qubits, we found that the multi-qubit CNN architecture reduces the\ncrosstalk correlation up to 78.5%.

For small molecules, when\ncomparing against state of the art wave function techniques, our results show\nthat performing full self-consistency in the GW scheme either systematically\noutperforms vertex corrected G0W0 or gives results of at least the same\nquality. Moreover, the G0W0{\\Gamma} results in additional computational cost\nwhen compared to G0W0 or self-consistent GW and the G0W0{\\Gamma} dependency on\nthe starting mean-filed solution is frequently larger than the magnitude of the\nvertex correction.

In realistic scenarios,\nhowever, these time scales could be similar, which has profound implications\nfor epidemic modeling (e.g., one can no longer reduce the dimensionality of\nepidemic models). We build a theory for the critical behavior of\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemics in the vicinity of the\ncritical threshold on the activity-driven model of temporal networks. We find\nthat the persistence of links in the network leads to increasing recovery rates\nreducing the threshold. Dynamic correlations (coming from being close to\ninfected nodes increases the likelihood of infection) drive the threshold in\nthe opposite direction. These two counteracting effects make epidemic\ncriticality in temporal networks a remarkably complex phenomenon.",

            "summary": "The task of predicting 3D eye gaze from eye images can be performed either by\n(a) end-to-end learning for image-to-gaze mapping or by (b) fitting a 3D eye\nmodel onto images. The former case requires 3D gaze labels, while the latter\nrequires eye semantics or landmarks to facilitate the model fitting. Although\nobtaining eye semantics and landmarks is relatively easy, fitting an accurate\n3D eye model on them remains to be very challenging due to its ill-posed nature\nin general. On the other hand, obtaining large-scale 3D gaze data is cumbersome\ndue to the required hardware setups and computational demands. In this work, we\npropose to predict 3D eye gaze from weak supervision of eye semantic\nsegmentation masks and direct supervision of a few 3D gaze vectors. The\nproposed method combines the best of both worlds by leveraging large amounts of\nweak annotations--which are easy to obtain, and only a few 3D gaze\nvectors--which alleviate the difficulty of fitting 3D eye models on the\nsemantic segmentation of eye images. Thus, the eye gaze vectors, used in the\nmodel fitting, are directly supervised using the few-shot gaze labels.\nAdditionally, we propose a transformer-based network architecture, that serves\nas a solid baseline for our improvements. Our experiments in diverse settings\nillustrate the significant benefits of the proposed method, achieving about 5\ndegrees lower angular gaze error over the baseline, when only 0.05% 3D\nannotations of the training images are used.

We demonstrate that these\nestimators provide quasi-unbiased joint estimations of the flux and background,\nwith a variance that approaches the CRLB very tightly and are, hence, optimal,\nunlike the case of sequential estimation used commonly in astronomical\nphotometry which is sub-optimal. We compare our predictions with numerical\nsimulations of realistic observations, as well as with observations of a\nbona-fide non-variable stellar source observed with TESS, and compare it to the\nresults from the sequential estimation of background and flux, confirming our\ntheoretical expectations.

            "summary": "Error-bounded lossy compression has been identified as a promising solution\nfor significantly reducing scientific data volumes upon users' requirements on\ndata distortion. For the existing scientific error-bounded lossy compressors,\nsome of them (such as SPERR and FAZ) can reach fairly high compression ratios\nand some others (such as SZx, SZ, and ZFP) feature high compression speeds, but\nthey rarely exhibit both high ratio and high speed meanwhile. In this paper, we\npropose HPEZ with newly-designed interpolations and quality-metric-driven\nauto-tuning, which features significantly improved compression quality upon the\nexisting high-performance compressors, meanwhile being exceedingly faster than\nhigh-ratio compressors. The key contributions lie in the following points: (1)\nWe develop a series of advanced techniques such as interpolation re-ordering,\nmulti-dimensional interpolation, and natural cubic splines to significantly\nimprove compression qualities with interpolation-based data prediction. (2) The\nauto-tuning module in HPEZ has been carefully designed with novel strategies,\nincluding but not limited to block-wise interpolation tuning, dynamic dimension\nfreezing, and Lorenzo tuning. (3) We thoroughly evaluate HPEZ compared with\nmany other compressors on six real-world scientific datasets. Experiments show\nthat HPEZ outperforms other high-performance error-bounded lossy compressors in\ncompression ratio by up to 140% under the same error bound, and by up to 360%\nunder the same PSNR. In parallel data transfer experiments on the distributed\ndatabase, HPEZ achieves a significant performance gain with up to 40% time cost\nreduction over the second-best compressor.",

            "summary": "Stellar mergers lead to diverse phenomena: rejuvenated blue stragglers,\nmagnetised and peculiar stars, transients and nebulae. Using a grid of about\n6000 detailed 1D binary evolution models (initial component masses of\n0.5-20$\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ at solar metallicity), we investigate which initial\nbinary-star configurations lead to contact and classical common-envelope (CE)\nphases and assess the likelihood of a subsequent merger. Considering rotation\nand tides, we identify five mechanisms leading to contact and mergers: runaway\nmass transfer, $\\text{L}_{2}$-overflow, accretor expansion, tidally-driven\norbital decay, and non-conservative mass transfer. At least 40% of\nmass-transferring binaries with initial primary masses of\n5-20$\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ enter contact, with >12% and >19% likely merging and\nevolving into a classical CE phase, respectively. Classical CE evolution occurs\nin late Case-B and Case-C binaries for initial mass ratios $q_{\\text{i}}$ <\n0.15-0.35, stable mass transfer for larger $q_{\\text{i}}$. Early Case-B\nbinaries enter contact for $q_{\\text{i}}$ < 0.15-0.35 and in initially wider\nCase-A binaries, this occurs for $q_{\\text{i}}$ < 0.35. All initially closest\nCase-A systems form contact binaries. We predict that binaries entering contact\nwith $q$ < 0.5 merge or detach on a thermal timescale, while those formed with\n$q$ > 0.5 lead to long-lived contact phases. The fact that contact binaries are\nalmost exclusively observed with $q$ > 0.5 confirms our expectations. Our\ncontact, merger and classical CE incidences are lower limits because the mass\ntransfer in our models is non-conservative. In most binaries, the non-accreted\nmass cannot be ejected and may settle in disks or lead to contact phases and\nmergers. Overall, contact binaries are a frequent and fascinating result of\nbinary mass transfer of which the exact outcomes still remain to be understood\nand explored further.",

The\nrobustness of the inferred properties of the GMF is gauged by studying many\ncombinations of parametric field models and electron density models.\n  We determine the pitch angle of the local magnetic field (11+/-1 deg.),\nexplore the evidence for a grand-design spiral coherent magnetic field\n(inconclusive), determine the strength of the toroidal magnetic halo below and\nabove the disk (same within 10%), set constraints on the half-height of the\ncosmic-ray diffusion volume (> 2.9 kpc), investigate the compatibility of RM-\nand PI-derived magnetic field strengths (compatible under certain assumptions)\nand check if the toroidal halo field could be created by the shear of the\npoloidal halo due to the differential rotation of the Galaxy (possibly).\n  A set of eight models is identified to broadly encompass the present\nuncertainties in the coherent GMF -- spanning different functional forms, data\nproducts and auxiliary input, and maximizing the differences in their\npredictions. We present the corresponding skymaps of rates for axion-photon\nconversion in the Galaxy, and deflections of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nBased on comparing the predicted deflections of UHECRs traversing the Galaxy in\nthese models, we conclude that the deflection uncertainties are smaller than\nthe deflections themselves for most of the sky and that the rigidity threshold\nfor nuclear astronomy can be lowered by a factor of two if GMF deflections are\ntaken into account.",

While\ndetection should depend only on the observed noisy data, there are situations\nwhere it is instead unphysically defined in terms also of the true source\nparameters through the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For example, the\ncomputational cost of applying real searches is often too prohibitive for large\nsimulated astrophysical populations to create predictive catalogs. By\nsimultaneously modeling selection effects and the intrinsic SNR distribution,\nwe infer the corresponding detection threshold from the real catalog in a\nBayesian setting, thereby calibrating the unphysical model to the physical one.\nFrom the latest open data we infer detection thresholds in the network optimal\nSNR of $10.5_{-2.4}^{+2.1}$, $11.2_{-1.4}^{+1.2}$, and $9.1_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$\n(medians and symmetric 90% credible intervals) for the first, second, and third\nobserving runs, respectively, and that the distribution is consistent with a\nfourth-order power law. We additionally relax the assumption of a step-function\nthreshold and show how the assumed distribution can be validated with more\nflexible models such as normalizing flows, which is useful for ranking\nstatistics with no obvious prior.

Although it is known how large these\ninitial perturbations must be to form haloes, it is rather poorly understood\nhow to predict which particles will end up belonging to which halo. However, it\nis this process that determines the Lagrangian shape of protohaloes and is\ntherefore essential to understand their mass, spin and formation history. Here,\nwe present a machine-learning framework to learn how the protohalo regions of\ndifferent haloes emerge from the initial density field. This involves one\nneural network to distinguish semantically which particles become part of any\nhalo and a second neural network that groups these particles by halo membership\ninto different instances. This instance segmentation is done through the\nWeinberger method, in which the network maps particles into a pseudo-space\nrepresentation where different instances can be distinguished easily through a\nsimple clustering algorithm. Our model reliably predicts the masses and\nLagrangian shapes of haloes object-by-object, as well as summary statistics\nlike the halo-mass function. We find that our model extracts information close\nto optimal by comparing it to the degree of agreement between two N-body\nsimulations with slight differences in their initial conditions.

Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug\ndiscovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a\ngeneral principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable\n\"ground rules\", remained elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor\nintrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an\nallosteric lever--a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation--governs\nthe directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural\nperturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard\nelastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of\nnon-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The\nallosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and\nallows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to\nspecific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and\n\"pseudoproteins\"--networks designed to display an allosteric response.\nInterestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission\nchannels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the\nresults may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict\nknown allosteric sites in proteins.",

            "summary": "All experiments to date are in remarkable agreement with the predictions of\nEinstein's theory of gravity, General Relativity. Besides the classical tests,\ninvolving light deflection, orbit precession, signal delay, and the\ngravitational redshift, modern technology has pushed the limits even further.\nGravitational waves have been observed multiple times as have been black holes,\narguably amongst the most fascinating objects populating our universe.\nMoreover, geodetic satellite missions have enabled the verification of yet\nanother prediction: gravitomagnetism. This phenomenon arises due to the\nrotation of a central body, e.g., the Earth, which is dragging spacetime along.\nOne resulting effect on satellite orbits is the observed Lense-Thirring effect.\nAnother predicted, yet unverified, effect is the so-called gravitomagnetic\nclock effect, which was first described by Cohen and Mashhoon as the proper\ntime difference of two counter-revolving clocks in an orbit around a rotating\nmass.\n  A theoretical framework is introduced that describes a gravitomagnetic clock\neffect based on a stationary spacetime model. An incremental definition of a\nsuitable observable follows, which can be accessed via orbit data obtained from\nthe European satellite navigation system Galileo, and an implementation of the\nframework for use with real satellite and clock data is presented. The\ntechnical requirements on a satellite mission are studied to measure the\ngravitomagnetic clock effect at the state-of-the-art in satellite laser ranging\nand modelling of gravitational and non-gravitational perturbations. Based on\nthe analysis within this work, a measurement of the gravitomagnetic clock\neffect is highly demanding, but might just be within reach in the very near\nfuture based on current and upcoming technology.",

            "summary": "When multiple fission modes coexist in a given nucleus, distinct fragment\nyield distributions appear. Multimodal fission has been observed in a number of\nfissioning nuclei spanning the nuclear chart, and this phenomenon is expected\nto affect the nuclear abundances synthesized during the rapid neutron-capture\nprocess (r-process). In this study, we generalize the previously proposed\nhybrid model for fission-fragment yield distributions to predict competing\nfission modes and estimate the resulting yield distributions. Our framework\nallows for a comprehensive large-scale calculation of fission fragment yields\nsuited for r-process nuclear network studies. Nuclear density functional theory\nis employed to obtain the potential energy and collective inertia tensor on a\nmultidimensional collective space defined by mass multipole moments. Fission\npathways and their relative probabilities are determined using the nudged\nelastic band method. Based on this information, mass and charge fission yields\nare predicted using the recently developed hybrid model. Fission properties of\nfermium isotopes are calculated in the axial quadrupole-octupole collective\nspace for three energy density functionals (EDFs). Disagreement between the\nEDFs appears when multiple fission modes are present. Within our framework, the\nUNEDF1$_{\\textrm{HFB}}$ EDF agrees best with experimental data. Calculations in\nthe axial quadrupole-octupole-hexadecapole collective space improve the\nagreement with the experiment for SkM$^{*}$. We also discuss the sensitivity of\nfission predictions on the choice of EDF for several superheavy nuclei. Fission\nfragment yield predictions for nuclei with multiple fission modes are sensitive\nto the underlying EDF. For large-scale calculations in which a minimal number\nof collective coordinates is considered, UNEDF1$_{\\textrm{HFB}}$ provides the\nbest description of experimental data.",

Probabilistic classifiers with low-order\nprobability tables, e.g. NB and AODE, are good alternatives for dealing with\nthis type of data. AODE usually improves NB in accuracy, but suffers from high\nspatial complexity since $k$ models, each with $n+1$ variables, are included in\nthe AODE ensemble. In this paper, we propose MiniAnDE, an algorithm that\nincludes only a small number of heterogeneous base classifiers in the ensemble,\ni.e., each model only includes a different subset of the $k$ predictive\nvariables.

First, we consider the possibility of detecting black\nholes in the Milky Way through the electromagnetic radiation emitted in the\nprocess of gas accretion, separately examining the astrophysical black hole\npopulation and an hypothetical primordial one. We employ a state-of-the-art\naccretion model, able to account for radiative feedback. Our findings suggest\nthat the detection of astrophysical isolated black holes in the vicinity of the\ngalactic center is around the corner. We perform a complete parametric study of\nthe uncertainty associated with this prediction. We then turn to constraining\nPBH abundance through the same channel, finding that existing bounds can be\nsignificantly relaxed when modelling uncertainties are taken into account. The\nPBH mass function motivated by the Universe's thermal history is considered. In\nthe second part, we turn to gravitational wave observations. The possibility of\ndisentangling the astrophysical background form a possible primordial signal in\npresent data is hampered by large theoretical uncertainties on the properties\nof both populations. However, third-generation gravitational wave detectors\nwill be able to detect mergers up to the dark ages, where the astrophysical\nbackground is expected to be absent. Through mock data generation and analysis,\nwe assess the ability of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify a subdominant\npopulation of PBHs, disentangling it from the astrophysical one based\nexclusively on event distance measurements. We find that the ET should be able\nto detect and constrain the PBH abundance if these constitute at least\napproximately one part in $10^5$ of the dark matter.",

            "summary": "Background and objectives: By extracting this information, Machine or Deep\nLearning (ML/DL)-based autonomous data analysis tools can assist clinicians and\ncancer researchers in discovering patterns and relationships from complex data\nsets. Many DL-based analyses on ovarian cancer (OC) data have recently been\npublished. These analyses are highly diverse in various aspects of cancer\n(e.g., subdomain(s) and cancer type they address) and data analysis features.\nHowever, a comprehensive understanding of these analyses in terms of these\nfeatures and AI assurance (AIA) is currently lacking. This systematic review\naims to fill this gap by examining the existing literature and identifying\nimportant aspects of OC data analysis using DL, explicitly focusing on the key\nfeatures and AI assurance perspectives. Methods: The PRISMA framework was used\nto conduct comprehensive searches in three journal databases. Only studies\npublished between 2015 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals were included in the\nanalysis. Results: In the review, a total of 96 DL-driven analyses were\nexamined. The findings reveal several important insights regarding DL-driven\novarian cancer data analysis: - Most studies 71% (68 out of 96) focused on\ndetection and diagnosis, while no study addressed the prediction and prevention\nof OC. - The analyses were predominantly based on samples from a non-diverse\npopulation (75% (72/96 studies)), limited to a geographic location or country.\n- Only a small proportion of studies (only 33% (32/96)) performed integrated\nanalyses, most of which used homogeneous data (clinical or omics). - Notably, a\nmere 8.3% (8/96) of the studies validated their models using external and\ndiverse data sets, highlighting the need for enhanced model validation, and -\nThe inclusion of AIA in cancer data analysis is in a very early stage; only\n2.1% (2/96) explicitly addressed AIA through explainability.",

We start by introducing a novel convex\napproximation of IF constraints that exponentially decreases the computational\ncost of providing formal guarantees of local individual fairness. We highlight\nthat prior methods are constrained by their focus on global IF certification\nand can therefore only scale to models with a few dozen hidden neurons, thus\nlimiting their practical impact. We propose to certify distributional\nindividual fairness which ensures that for a given empirical distribution and\nall distributions within a $\\gamma$-Wasserstein ball, the neural network has\nguaranteed individually fair predictions. Leveraging developments in\nquasi-convex optimization, we provide novel and efficient certified bounds on\ndistributional individual fairness and show that our method allows us to\ncertify and regularize neural networks that are several orders of magnitude\nlarger than those considered by prior works. Moreover, we study real-world\ndistribution shifts and find our bounds to be a scalable, practical, and sound\nsource of IF guarantees.",

            "published": "2023-11-20T16:40:31Z",
            "summary": "Methods: Broad- and narrow-band imaging of AFGL 5180 was made in the NIR with\nthe LBT, in both seeing-limited ($\\sim0.5\\arcsec$) and high angular resolution\n($\\sim0.09\\arcsec$) Adaptive Optics (AO) modes, as well as with HST. Archival\nALMA continuum data was also utilized.\n  Results: At least 40 jet knots were identified via NIR emission from H$_2$\nand [FeII] tracing shocked gas. Bright jet knots outflowing from the central\nmost massive protostar, S4, are detected towards the east of the source and are\nresolved in fine detail with the AO imaging. Additional knots are distributed\nthroughout the field, likely indicating the presence of multiple driving\nsources. Sub-millimeter sources detected by ALMA are shown to be grouped in two\nmain complexes, AFGL 5180 M and a small cluster $\\sim15\\arcsec$ to the south,\nAFGL 5180 S. From our NIR continuum images we identify YSO candidates down to\nmasses of $\\sim 0.1\\:M_\\odot$. Combined with the sub-mm sources, this yields a\nsurface number density of such YSOs of $N_* \\sim 10^3 {\\rm pc}^{-2}$ within a\nprojected radius of about 0.1 pc. Such a value is similar to those predicted by\nmodels of both Core Accretion from a turbulent clump environment and\nCompetitive Accretion. The radial profile of $N_*$ is relatively flat on scales\nout to 0.2~pc, with only modest enhancement around the massive protostar inside\n0.05~pc.\n  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of high-resolution NIR\nimaging, in particular with AO, for detecting outflow activity and YSOs in\ndistant regions. The presented images reveal the complex morphology of\noutflow-shocked gas within the large-scale bipolar flow of a massive protostar,\nas well as clear evidence for several other outflow driving sources in the\nregion. Finally, this work presents a novel approach to compare the observed\nYSO surface number density from our study against different models of massive\nstar formation.",

            "summary": "Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) are crucial in modern air defense systems. A\ncritical aspect of their effectiveness is the Engagement Zone (EZ), the spatial\nregion within which a SAM can effectively engage and neutralize a target.\nNotably, the EZ is intrinsically related to the missile's maximum range; it\ndefines the furthest distance at which a missile can intercept a target. The\naccurate computation of this EZ is essential but challenging due to the dynamic\nand complex factors involved, which often lead to high computational costs and\nextended processing times when using conventional simulation methods. In light\nof these challenges, our study investigates the potential of machine learning\ntechniques, proposing an approach that integrates machine learning with a\ncustom-designed simulation tool to train supervised algorithms. We leverage a\ncomprehensive dataset of pre-computed SAM EZ simulations, enabling our model to\naccurately predict the SAM EZ for new input parameters. It accelerates SAM EZ\nsimulations, enhances air defense strategic planning, and provides real-time\ninsights, improving SAM system performance. The study also includes a\ncomparative analysis of machine learning algorithms, illuminating their\ncapabilities and performance metrics and suggesting areas for future research,\nhighlighting the transformative potential of machine learning in SAM EZ\nsimulations.",

Much prior work in human-robot\ncollaboration uses observational models of humans (i.e. models that treat the\nrobot purely as an observer) to choose the robot's behavior, but such models do\nnot account for the influence the robot has on the human's actions, which may\nlead to inefficient interactions. We instead formulate the problem of optimally\nchoosing a collaborative robot's behavior based on a conditional model of the\nhuman that depends on the robot's future behavior. First, we propose a novel\nmodel-based formulation of conditional behavior prediction that allows the\nrobot to infer the human's intentions based on its future plan in data-sparse\nenvironments. We then show how to utilize a conditional model for proactive\ngoal selection and path generation around human collaborators.

DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN)\nand gated recurrent unit (GRU), were trained using 1-stride and 8-stride\naccelerations, respectively, to classify adult and older adult groups. SHAP was\nemployed to explain the models' predictions.\n  CNN achieved a satisfactory performance with an accuracy of 81.4% and an AUC\nof 0.89, and GRU demonstrated promising results with an accuracy of 84.5% and\nan AUC of 0.94. SHAP analysis revealed that both CNN and GRU assigned higher\nSHAP values to the data from vertical and walking directions, particularly\nemphasizing data around heel contact, spanning from the terminal swing to\nloading response phases. Furthermore, SHAP values indicated that GRU did not\ntreat every stride equally.\n  CNN accurately distinguished between adults and older adults based on the\ncharacteristics of a single stride's data. GRU achieved accurate classification\nby considering the relationships and subtle differences between strides. In\nboth models, data around heel contact emerged as most critical, suggesting\ndifferences in acceleration and deceleration patterns during walking between\ndifferent age groups.",

            "summary": "Measuring an observable that does not commute with the system's Hamiltonian\nusually leads to a variation of its energy. Unveiling the first link of the von\nNeumann chain, the quantum meter has to account for this energy change. Here,\nwe consider an autonomous meter-system dynamics: a qubit interacting\ndispersively with a light pulse propagating in a one-dimensional waveguide. The\nlight pulse (the meter) measures the qubit's state along the $z$-axis while the\nqubit's Hamiltonian is oriented along another direction. As the interaction is\ndispersive, photon number is conserved so that energy balance has to be\nattained by spectral deformations of the light pulse. An accurate and\nrepeatable measurement can be achieved only by employing short pulses, where\ntheir spectral deformation is practically undetectable. Increasing the pulse's\nduration, the measurement's quality drops and the spectral deformation of the\nscattered field becomes visible. Building on analytical and numerical\nsolutions, we reveal the mechanism underlying this spectral deformation and\ndisplay how it compensates for the qubit's energy change. We explain the\nformation of a three-peak structure of the output spectrum and we provide the\nconditions under which this is observable.",

            "summary": "Applying NeRF to downstream perception tasks for scene understanding and\nrepresentation is becoming increasingly popular. Most existing methods treat\nsemantic prediction as an additional rendering task, \\textit{i.e.}, the \"label\nrendering\" task, to build semantic NeRFs. However, by rendering\nsemantic/instance labels per pixel without considering the contextual\ninformation of the rendered image, these methods usually suffer from unclear\nboundary segmentation and abnormal segmentation of pixels within an object. To\nsolve this problem, we propose Generalized Perception NeRF (GP-NeRF), a novel\npipeline that makes the widely used segmentation model and NeRF work compatibly\nunder a unified framework, for facilitating context-aware 3D scene perception.\nTo accomplish this goal, we introduce transformers to aggregate radiance as\nwell as semantic embedding fields jointly for novel views and facilitate the\njoint volumetric rendering of both fields. In addition, we propose two\nself-distillation mechanisms, i.e., the Semantic Distill Loss and the\nDepth-Guided Semantic Distill Loss, to enhance the discrimination and quality\nof the semantic field and the maintenance of geometric consistency. In\nevaluation, we conduct experimental comparisons under two perception tasks\n(\\textit{i.e.} semantic and instance segmentation) using both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets. Notably, our method outperforms SOTA approaches by 6.94\\%,\n11.76\\%, and 8.47\\% on generalized semantic segmentation, finetuning semantic\nsegmentation, and instance segmentation, respectively.",

However, most of the existing\nMLLMs mainly adopt vision encoders pretrained on coarsely aligned image-text\npairs, leading to insufficient extraction and reasoning of visual knowledge. To\naddress this issue, we devise a dual-Level vIsual knOwledge eNhanced Multimodal\nLarge Language Model (LION), which empowers the MLLM by injecting visual\nknowledge in two levels. 1) Progressive incorporation of fine-grained\nspatial-aware visual knowledge. We design a vision aggregator cooperated with\nregion-level vision-language (VL) tasks to incorporate fine-grained\nspatial-aware visual knowledge into the MLLM. To alleviate the conflict between\nimage-level and region-level VL tasks during incorporation, we devise a\ndedicated stage-wise instruction-tuning strategy with mixture-of-adapters. This\nprogressive incorporation scheme contributes to the mutual promotion between\nthese two kinds of VL tasks. 2) Soft prompting of high-level semantic visual\nevidence. We facilitate the MLLM with high-level semantic visual evidence by\nleveraging diverse image tags. To mitigate the potential influence caused by\nimperfect predicted tags, we propose a soft prompting method by embedding a\nlearnable token into the tailored text instruction. Comprehensive experiments\non several multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our model\n(e.g., improvement of 5% accuracy on VSR and 3% CIDEr on TextCaps over\nInstructBLIP, 5% accuracy on RefCOCOg over Kosmos-2).",

We performed a two-loop renormalisation group analysis and showed that\nthe SUSY flipped $SU(5)$ model predicts a high GUT scale $M_{\\rm GUT} >\n10^{16}$ GeV. We also investigated the restrictions on the $M_{B-L}$ scale\nwhich is associated with the $U(1)_{\\chi}$ breaking scale. We found that the\n$M_{B-L}$ scale can vary in a broad region with negligible or little effect on\nthe value of $M_{\\rm GUT}$. Proton decay in this model is induced by\ndimension-6 operators only. The dimension-5 operator induced by SUSY\ncontribution is suppressed due to the missing partner mechanism. We found that\nthe partial decay width $p \\to \\pi^0 e^+$ is high suppressed, being at least\none order of magnitude lower than the future Hyper-K sensitivity. We also\nstudied fermion (including neutrino) masses and mixings which can also\ninfluence proton decay. We presented two scenarios of flavour textures to check\nthe consistency of the results with fermion masses and mixing. The $B-L$ gauge\nbreaking leads to the generation of cosmic strings. The $B-L$ scale here is not\nconstrained by gauge coupling unification. If this scale is very close that of\nGUT breaking, strings can be unstable due to the decay to monopole-antimonople\npair. Such metastable strings can be used to explain the NANOGrav signals of\nstochastic gravitational wave background, which may be interpreted here as\nresulting from the decay of metastable cosmic strings.",

Classifier\nmodels can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction, but this\nrequires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing\nthe distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one\nonly requires only marginal calibration on the image level, this calibration\nset consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration.\nHowever, if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel\nclassifier, the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario\nwhere data are scarce (such as the medical domain), it may not always be\npossible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level\ncalibration. The method we propose, dubbed ``Kandinsky calibration'', makes use\nof the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to\nsimultaneously calibrate the classifiers of ``similar'' pixels. This can be\nseen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional\n(pixelwise) calibration, where non-conformity scores are aggregated over\nsimilar image regions, thereby making more efficient use of the images\navailable for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms\ntrained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon\ndatasets, demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly\nimprove the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration\non little data, the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors,\nindicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration.",

First, two complementary augmented views\nare derived from an incomplete graph structure through a bidirectional graph\nstructure augmentation scheme.

            "summary": "4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) is a non-invasive\nmeasurement technique capable of quantifying blood flow across the\ncardiovascular system. While practical use is limited by spatial resolution and\nimage noise, incorporation of trained super-resolution (SR) networks has\npotential to enhance image quality post-scan. However, these efforts have\npredominantly been restricted to narrowly defined cardiovascular domains, with\nlimited exploration of how SR performance extends across the cardiovascular\nsystem; a task aggravated by contrasting hemodynamic conditions apparent across\nthe cardiovasculature. The aim of our study was to explore the generalizability\nof SR 4D Flow MRI using a combination of heterogeneous training sets and\ndedicated ensemble learning. With synthetic training data generated across\nthree disparate domains (cardiac, aortic, cerebrovascular), varying\nconvolutional base and ensemble learners were evaluated as a function of domain\nand architecture, quantifying performance on both in-silico and acquired\nin-vivo data from the same three domains. Results show that both bagging and\nstacking ensembling enhance SR performance across domains, accurately\npredicting high-resolution velocities from low-resolution input data in-silico.\nLikewise, optimized networks successfully recover native resolution velocities\nfrom downsampled in-vivo data, as well as show qualitative potential in\ngenerating denoised SR-images from clinical level input data. In conclusion,\nour work presents a viable approach for generalized SR 4D Flow MRI, with\nensemble learning extending utility across various clinical areas of interest.",

            "summary": "Automatic pavement crack detection is an important task to ensure the\nfunctional performances of pavements during their service life. Inspired by\ndeep learning (DL), the encoder-decoder framework is a powerful tool for crack\ndetection. However, these models are usually open-loop (OL) systems that tend\nto treat thin cracks as the background. Meanwhile, these models can not\nautomatically correct errors in the prediction, nor can it adapt to the changes\nof the environment to automatically extract and detect thin cracks. To tackle\nthis problem, we embed closed-loop feedback (CLF) into the neural network so\nthat the model could learn to correct errors on its own, based on generative\nadversarial networks (GAN). The resulting model is called CrackCLF and includes\nthe front and back ends, i.e. segmentation and adversarial network. The front\nend with U-shape framework is employed to generate crack maps, and the back end\nwith a multi-scale loss function is used to correct higher-order\ninconsistencies between labels and crack maps (generated by the front end) to\naddress open-loop system issues. Empirical results show that the proposed\nCrackCLF outperforms others methods on three public datasets. Moreover, the\nproposed CLF can be defined as a plug and play module, which can be embedded\ninto different neural network models to improve their performances.",

Sufficient amounts of high-quality manually\nannotated data are not available, so recent research has relied on generating\nsynthetic data, pretraining on it, and then fine-tuning on real datasets;\nperformance gains have been achieved either by ensembling or by using huge\npretrained models such as XXL-T5 as the backbone. In this work, we explore an\northogonal direction: how to use available data more efficiently. First, we\npropose auxiliary tasks that exploit the alignment between the original and\ncorrected sentences, such as predicting a sequence of corrections. We formulate\neach task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and perform multi-task training.\nSecond, we discover that the order of datasets used for training and even\nindividual instances within a dataset may have important effects on the final\nperformance, so we set out to find the best training schedule. Together, these\ntwo ideas lead to significant improvements, producing results that improve\nstate of the art with much smaller models; in particular, we outperform the\nbest models based on T5-XXL (11B parameters) with a BART-based model (400M\nparameters).",

These new constructions provide potential\ncandidates for theories whose existence was conjectured before:\n  $\\bullet$ K. Hori [23] predicted the existence of open $r$-spin theory with\n$\\lfloor\\frac{r}{2}\\rfloor$ types of boundary states. The one constructed in\n[5, 3] has only one type of boundary state.

            "summary": "Deep learning is revolutionising pathology, offering novel opportunities in\ndisease prognosis and personalised treatment. Historically, stain normalisation\nhas been a crucial preprocessing step in computational pathology pipelines, and\npersists into the deep learning era. Yet, with the emergence of feature\nextractors trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on diverse pathology\ndatasets, we call this practice into question. In an empirical evaluation of\npublicly available feature extractors, we find that omitting stain\nnormalisation and image augmentations does not compromise downstream\nperformance, while incurring substantial savings in memory and compute.\nFurther, we show that the top-performing feature extractors are remarkably\nrobust to variations in stain and augmentations like rotation in their latent\nspace. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach\nemphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level prediction tasks in a\nweakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. This work\nrepresents the most comprehensive robustness evaluation of public pathology SSL\nfeature extractors to date, involving more than 6,000 training runs across nine\ntasks, five datasets, three downstream architectures, and various preprocessing\nsetups. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by\nminimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature\nextractors.",

While HSF widely exists in\ndynamical constraint models, it is still challenging to tune HSF. Here, we\npropose a scheme to tune HSF in a one-dimensional tilted lattice of interacting\nspinless fermions with periodically driven tunneling. The dynamics is governed\nby effective Hamiltonians with kinetic constraints, which appear as\ndensity-dependent tunneling in the weak-tunneling perturbation expansion. The\nkinetic constraint can be tuned via changing the driving frequency, and three\ndifferent kinds of strong HSF can be engineered. In general, the system is\nstrongly constrained and exhibits a strong HSF. Two partial resonance\nfrequencies are analytically given by a time-dependent perturbation theory for\nFloquet systems, at which some kinetic constraints are released and the system\nexhibits another two different strong HSF. We demonstrate the perturbation\nanalysis with exact numerical simulation of the entanglement entropy, the\ndensity correlation functions and the saturated local density profiles. Our\nresult provides a promising way to control HSF through Floquet engineering.",

To achieve this, we employ individual mobility\nmodels to generate synthetic location visit sequences and control behavior\ndynamics by intervening in their data generation process. We evaluate the\ninterventional location sequences using mobility metrics and input them into\nwell-trained networks to analyze performance variations. The results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness in producing location sequences with distinct\nmobility behaviors, thus facilitating the simulation of diverse spatial and\ntemporal changes. These changes result in performance fluctuations in next\nlocation prediction networks, revealing impacts of critical mobility behavior\nfactors, including sequential patterns in location transitions, proclivity for\nexploring new locations, and preferences in location choices at population and\nindividual levels. The gained insights hold significant value for the\nreal-world application of mobility prediction networks, and the framework is\nexpected to promote the use of causal inference for enhancing the\ninterpretability and robustness of neural networks in mobility applications.",

In the Deep Learning (DL) field, it is commonly implemented\nthrough the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD).\nHowever, when a model is shared or released, there is no way to check whether\nit is differentially private, that is, it required to trust the model provider.\nThis situation poses a problem when data privacy is mandatory, specially with\ncurrent data regulations, as the presence of DP can not be certificated\nconsistently by any third party. Thus, we face the challenge of determining\nwhether a DL model has been trained with DP, according to the title question:\nCan we infer the presence of Differential Privacy in Deep Learning models'\nweights? Since the DP-SGD significantly changes the training process of a DL\nmodel, we hypothesize that DP leaves an imprint in the weights of a DL model,\nwhich can be used to predict whether a model has been trained with DP\nregardless of its architecture and the training dataset. In this paper, we\npropose to employ the imprint in model weights of using DP to infer the\npresence of DP training in a DL model. To substantiate our hypothesis, we\ndeveloped an experimental methodology based on two datasets of weights of DL\nmodels, each with models with and without DP training and a meta-classifier to\ninfer whether DP was used in the training process of a DL model, by accessing\nits weights. We accomplish both, the removal of the requirement of a trusted\nmodel provider and a strong foundation for this interesting line of research.\nThus, our contribution is an additional layer of security on top of the strict\nprivate requirements of DP training in DL models, towards to DL models.",

            "summary": "In Paper-I we developed a two-phase model to connect dynamically hot galaxies\n(such as ellipticals and bulges) with the formation of self-gravitating,\nturbulent gas clouds (SGC) associated with the fast assembly of dark matter\nhalos. Here we explore the implications of the model for the size-stellar mass\nrelation of dynamically hot galaxies. Star-forming sub-clouds produced by the\nfragmentation of the SGC inherit its spatial structure and dynamical hotness,\nwhich produces a tight and 'homologous' relation, $r_{\\rm f}\\approx\\, 100\nr_{\\rm bulge}$, between the size of a dynamically hot galaxy ($r_{\\rm bulge}$)\nand that of its host halo assembled in the fast assembly regime ($r_{\\rm f}$),\nindependent of redshift and halo mass. This relation is preserved by the 'dry'\nexpansion driven by dynamical heating when a galaxy becomes gas-poor due to\ninefficient cooling, and is frozen during the slow assembly regime when the\nbulge stops growing in mass and dynamical heating is no longer effective. The\nsize-stellar mass relation is thus a simple combination of the galaxy-halo\nhomology and the non-linear relation between stellar mass and halo mass. Using\na set of halo assembly histories we demonstrate that this model can reproduce\nall properties in the observed size-mass relation of dynamically hot galaxies,\nincluding the flattening of the relation in the low-mass end and the upturn in\nthe very massive end. The predicted evolution of this relation matches\nobservational data currently available to redshift $z \\approx 4$, and can be\ntested in the future at higher $z$. Our results indicate that the sizes of\ndynamically hot galaxies are produced by the dissipation and collapse of gas in\ndark matter halos to establish self-gravitating systems of sub-clouds in which\nstars form.",

Unlike some of the\nprevious fingerprinting approaches that employ monomer-level information where\natomistic descriptors are computed using quantum chemistry calculations, this\napproach incorporates configurational information from a coarse-grained model\nof a long polymer chain. The proposed approach may be advantageous for the\nstudy of behavior resulting from large molecular weights. To create this\nfingerprint, we make use of two kinds of descriptors. First, we calculate\ncertain geometric descriptors like Re2, Rg2 etc. and label them as Calculated\nDescriptors. Second, we generate a set of data-driven descriptors using an\nunsupervised autoencoder model and call them Learnt Descriptors. Using a\ncombination of both of them, we are able to learn mappings from the structure\nto various properties of the polymer chain by training ML models. We test our\nfingerprint to predict the probability of occurrence of a configuration at\nequilibrium, which is approximated by a simple linear relationship between the\ninstantaneous internal energy and equilibrium average internal energy.",

However, accurately predicting their electronic\nstructures, especially the band gap and energy levels of Zn 3d states, remains\na challenge. Traditional density functional theory (DFT) approaches, including\nlocal density and gradient-corrected approximations (LDA or GGA), often\nsignificantly underestimate these properties compared to experimental values.\nAdvanced methods such as the GW approximation and DFT+U have been used to\nresolve these discrepancies, but they involve high computational costs or\nrequire seemingly unphysical parameters. This study focuses on a modified\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional with the aim of\nmore efficient prediction of the band gaps in zinc monochalcogenides. Unlike\nprevious approaches that require large negative U values for O p orbitals, our\nmethod provides a more transparent solution by directly changing the PBE\nfunctional.

            "summary": "Amazon ships billions of packages to its customers annually within the United\nStates. Shipping cost of these packages are used on the day of shipping (day 0)\nto estimate profitability of sales. Downstream systems utilize these days 0\nprofitability estimates to make financial decisions, such as pricing strategies\nand delisting loss-making products. However, obtaining accurate shipping cost\nestimates on day 0 is complex for reasons like delay in carrier invoicing or\nfixed cost components getting recorded at monthly cadence. Inaccurate shipping\ncost estimates can lead to bad decision, such as pricing items too low or high,\nor promoting the wrong product to the customers. Current solutions for\nestimating shipping costs on day 0 rely on tree-based models that require\nextensive manual engineering efforts. In this study, we propose a novel\narchitecture called the Rate Card Transformer (RCT) that uses self-attention to\nencode all package shipping information such as package attributes, carrier\ninformation and route plan. Unlike other transformer-based tabular models, RCT\nhas the ability to encode a variable list of one-to-many relations of a\nshipment, allowing it to capture more information about a shipment. For\nexample, RCT can encode properties of all products in a package. Our results\ndemonstrate that cost predictions made by the RCT have 28.82% less error\ncompared to tree-based GBDT model. Moreover, the RCT outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art transformer-based tabular model, FTTransformer, by 6.08%. We\nalso illustrate that the RCT learns a generalized manifold of the rate card\nthat can improve the performance of tree-based models.",

We study 3D brittle\ncrack dynamics using a phase-field approach, where Gaussian quenched disorder\nin the fracture energy is incorporated. Disorder is characterized by a\ncorrelation length $R$ and strength $\\sigma$. We find that the mean crack\nvelocity $v$ is bounded by a limiting velocity, which is smaller than the\nhomogeneous material's prediction and decreases with $\\sigma$. It emerges from\na dynamic renormalization of the fracture energy with increasing crack driving\nforce $G$, resembling a critical point, due to an interplay between a 2D\nbranching instability and disorder. At small $G$, the probability of localized\nbranching on a scale $R$ is super-exponentially small. With increasing $G$ this\nprobability quickly increases, leading to misty fracture surfaces, yet the\nassociated extra dissipation remains small. As $G$ is further increased,\nbranching-related lengthscales become dynamic and persistently increase,\nleading to hackle-like structures and to a macroscopic contribution to the\nfracture surface. The latter dynamically renormalizes the actual fracture\nenergy until eventually any increase in $G$ is balanced by extra fracture\nsurface, with no accompanying increase in $v$. Finally, branching width reaches\nthe system's thickness such that 2D symmetry is statistically restored. Our\nfindings are consistent with a broad range of experimental observations.",

To address it, semi-supervised learning by\nexploiting abundant unlabeled data is highly desirable to boost the model\ntraining. However, most existing works still focus on limited medical tasks and\nunderestimate the potential of learning across diverse tasks and multiple\ndatasets. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a \\textbf{Ver}satile\n\\textbf{Semi}-supervised framework (VerSemi) to point out a new perspective\nthat integrates various tasks into a unified model with a broad label space, to\nexploit more unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\nSpecifically, we introduce a dynamic task-prompted design to segment various\ntargets from different datasets. Next, this unified model is used to identify\nthe foreground regions from all labeled data, to capture cross-dataset\nsemantics. Particularly, we create a synthetic task with a cutmix strategy to\naugment foreground targets within the expanded label space. To effectively\nutilize unlabeled data, we introduce a consistency constraint. This involves\naligning aggregated predictions from various tasks with those from the\nsynthetic task, further guiding the model in accurately segmenting foreground\nregions during training. We evaluated our VerSemi model on four public\nbenchmarking datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrated that VerSemi can\nconsistently outperform the second-best method by a large margin (e.g., an\naverage 2.69\\% Dice gain on four datasets), setting new SOTA performance for\nsemi-supervised medical image segmentation.

We examine the evolution of the gapless\nphases in the energy dispersions of the bulk as the chemical potential varies.\nThe topological properties of the gapless phases are characterized by the\nwinding numbers of the present gapless points. We also consider the ribbon\ngeometry to examine the corresponding topological edge states. It is revealed\nthat Majorana-fermion edge modes exist as flat bands in topological gapless\nphases.

            "summary": "Recovering temporally consistent 3D human body pose, shape and motion from a\nmonocular video is a challenging task due to (self-)occlusions, poor lighting\nconditions, complex articulated body poses, depth ambiguity, and limited\navailability of annotated data. Further, doing a simple perframe estimation is\ninsufficient as it leads to jittery and implausible results. In this paper, we\npropose a novel method for temporally consistent motion estimation from a\nmonocular video. Instead of using generic ResNet-like features, our method uses\na body-aware feature representation and an independent per-frame pose and\ncamera initialization over a temporal window followed by a novel\nspatio-temporal feature aggregation by using a combination of self-similarity\nand self-attention over the body-aware features and the perframe\ninitialization. Together, they yield enhanced spatiotemporal context for every\nframe by considering remaining past and future frames. These features are used\nto predict the pose and shape parameters of the human body model, which are\nfurther refined using an LSTM. Experimental results on the publicly available\nbenchmark data show that our method attains significantly lower acceleration\nerror and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods over all key\nquantitative evaluation metrics, including complex scenarios like partial\nocclusion, complex poses and even relatively low illumination.",

Specifically, the imposition of conformal symmetry places\nnoteworthy constraints on the model, shaping the analytical outcomes more\nprecisely. We studied the properties of traversable wormholes under both\nGaussian and Lorentzian distributions and noticed that NEC and SEC are violated\nin the neighborhood of the wormhole throat. We also observed the influence of\nmodel parameters as well as non-commutative parameters for these violations.\nEmploying the \"volume integral quantifier,\" it is established that conformally\nsymmetric wormhole geometries may, in principle, be constructed with\ninfinitesimally small amounts of matter, violating the averaged null energy\ncondition.

            "summary": "The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has\nshown promising results in utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) to objectively\nprognosticate cancer patients. However, most prognostic methods are currently\nlimited to either histopathology or genomics alone, which inevitably reduces\ntheir potential to accurately predict patient prognosis. Whereas integrating\nWSIs and genomic features presents three main challenges: (1) the enormous\nheterogeneity of gigapixel WSIs which can reach sizes as large as\n150,000x150,000 pixels; (2) the absence of a spatially corresponding\nrelationship between histopathology images and genomic molecular data; and (3)\nthe existing early, late, and intermediate multimodal feature fusion strategies\nstruggle to capture the explicit interactions between WSIs and genomics. To\nameliorate these issues, we propose the Mutual-Guided Cross-Modality\nTransformer (MGCT), a weakly-supervised, attention-based multimodal learning\nframework that can combine histology features and genomic features to model the\ngenotype-phenotype interactions within the tumor microenvironment. To validate\nthe effectiveness of MGCT, we conduct experiments using nearly 3,600 gigapixel\nWSIs across five different cancer types sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA). Extensive experimental results consistently emphasize that MGCT\noutperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

            "summary": "Illumination degradation image restoration (IDIR) techniques aim to improve\nthe visibility of degraded images and mitigate the adverse effects of\ndeteriorated illumination. Among these algorithms, diffusion model (DM)-based\nmethods have shown promising performance but are often burdened by heavy\ncomputational demands and pixel misalignment issues when predicting the\nimage-level distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to leverage DM\nwithin a compact latent space to generate concise guidance priors and introduce\na novel solution called Reti-Diff for the IDIR task. Reti-Diff comprises two\nkey components: the Retinex-based latent DM (RLDM) and the Retinex-guided\ntransformer (RGformer). To ensure detailed reconstruction and illumination\ncorrection, RLDM is empowered to acquire Retinex knowledge and extract\nreflectance and illumination priors. These priors are subsequently utilized by\nRGformer to guide the decomposition of image features into their respective\nreflectance and illumination components. Following this, RGformer further\nenhances and consolidates the decomposed features, resulting in the production\nof refined images with consistent content and robustness to handle complex\ndegradation scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Reti-Diff outperforms\nexisting methods on three IDIR tasks, as well as downstream applications.

These observations establish YCu3(OD)6+xBr3-x as a model\nmaterial for exploring the 1/9 plateau phase.",

            "summary": "In general, deep learning-based video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have\npredominantly focused on estimating motion vectors between two input frames and\nwarping them to the target time. While this approach has shown impressive\nperformance for linear motion between two input frames, it exhibits limitations\nwhen dealing with occlusions and nonlinear movements. Recently, generative\nmodels have been applied to VFI to address these issues. However, as VFI is not\na task focused on generating plausible images, but rather on predicting\naccurate intermediate frames between two given frames, performance limitations\nstill persist. In this paper, we propose a multi-in-single-out (MISO) based VFI\nmethod that does not rely on motion vector estimation, allowing it to\neffectively model occlusions and nonlinear motion. Additionally, we introduce a\nnovel motion perceptual loss that enables MISO-VFI to better capture the\nspatio-temporal correlations within the video frames. Our MISO-VFI method\nachieves state-of-the-art results on VFI benchmarks Vimeo90K, Middlebury, and\nUCF101, with a significant performance gap compared to existing approaches.",

            "summary": "Diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods aim to use diffusion models to\nrecover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded images and achieve promising\nperformance. Due to the inherent property of diffusion models, most of these\nmethods need long serial sampling chains to restore HQ images step-by-step. As\na result, it leads to expensive sampling time and high computation costs.\nMoreover, such long sampling chains hinder understanding the relationship\nbetween the restoration results and the inputs since it is hard to compute the\ngradients in the whole chains. In this work, we aim to rethink the\ndiffusion-based IR models through a different perspective, i.e., a deep\nequilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system. Specifically, we derive an analytical\nsolution by modeling the entire sampling chain in diffusion-based IR models as\na joint multivariate fixed point system. With the help of the analytical\nsolution, we are able to conduct single-image sampling in a parallel way and\nrestore HQ images without training. Furthermore, we compute fast gradients in\nDEQ and found that initialization optimization can boost performance and\ncontrol the generation direction. Extensive experiments on benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on typical IR tasks and\nreal-world settings. The code and models will be made publicly available.",

However, this training\nobjective may not be optimal for a specific array processing back-end, such as\nbeamforming. An alternative approach is to use a training objective considering\nthe array-processing back-end, such as a loss on the beamformer output. This\napproach may generate signals optimal for beamforming but not physically\ngrounded. To combine the advantages of both approaches, this paper proposes a\nmulti-task loss for NN-VME that combines both VM-level and beamformer-level\nlosses. We evaluate the proposed multi-task NN-VME on multi-talker\nunderdetermined conditions and show that it achieves a 33.1 % relative WER\nimprovement compared to using only real microphones and 10.8 % compared to\nusing a prior NN-VME approach.",

            "summary": "Trees inside cities are important for the urban microclimate, contributing\npositively to the physical and mental health of the urban dwellers. Despite\ntheir importance, often only limited information about city trees is available.\nTherefore in this paper, we propose a method for mapping urban trees in\nhigh-resolution aerial imagery using limited datasets and deep learning. Deep\nlearning has become best-practice for this task, however, existing approaches\nrely on large and accurately labelled training datasets, which can be difficult\nand expensive to obtain. However, often noisy and incomplete data may be\navailable that can be combined and utilized to solve more difficult tasks than\nthose datasets were intended for. This paper studies how to combine accurate\npoint labels of urban trees along streets with crowd-sourced annotations from\nan open geographic database to delineate city trees in remote sensing images, a\ntask which is challenging even for humans. To that end, we perform semantic\nsegmentation of very high resolution aerial imagery using a fully convolutional\nneural network. The main challenge is that our segmentation maps are sparsely\nannotated and incomplete. Small areas around the point labels of the street\ntrees coming from official and crowd-sourced data are marked as foreground\nclass. Crowd-sourced annotations of streets, buildings, etc. define the\nbackground class. Since the tree data is incomplete, we introduce a masking to\navoid class confusion. Our experiments in Hamburg, Germany, showed that the\nsystem is able to produce tree cover maps, not limited to trees along streets,\nwithout providing tree delineations. We evaluated the method on manually\nlabelled trees and show that performance drastically deteriorates if the open\ngeographic database is not used.",

            "summary": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied to various tasks successfully,\nand mainstream methods typically boost the student model via spatial imitation\nlosses. However, the consecutive downsamplings induced in the spatial domain of\nteacher model is a type of corruption, hindering the student from analyzing\nwhat specific information needs to be imitated, which results in accuracy\ndegradation. To better understand the underlying pattern of corrupted feature\nmaps, we shift our attention to the frequency domain. During frequency\ndistillation, we encounter a new challenge: the low-frequency bands convey\ngeneral but minimal context, while the high are more informative but also\nintroduce noise. Not each pixel within the frequency bands contributes equally\nto the performance. To address the above problem: (1) We propose the Frequency\nPrompt plugged into the teacher model, absorbing the semantic frequency context\nduring finetuning. (2) During the distillation period, a pixel-wise frequency\nmask is generated via Frequency Prompt, to localize those pixel of interests\n(PoIs) in various frequency bands. Additionally, we employ a position-aware\nrelational frequency loss for dense prediction tasks, delivering a high-order\nspatial enhancement to the student model. We dub our Frequency Knowledge\nDistillation method as FreeKD, which determines the optimal localization and\nextent for the frequency distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFreeKD not only outperforms spatial-based distillation methods consistently on\ndense prediction tasks (e.g., FreeKD brings 3.8 AP gains for RepPoints-R50 on\nCOCO2017 and 4.55 mIoU gains for PSPNet-R18 on Cityscapes), but also conveys\nmore robustness to the student. Notably, we also validate the generalization of\nour approach on large-scale vision models (e.g., DINO and SAM).",

The scarcity of non-English domain\ncorpora, not to mention parallel data, poses a significant hurdle in training\nmultilingual biomedical models. Since knowledge forms the core of\ndomain-specific corpora and can be translated into various languages\naccurately, we propose a model called KBioXLM, which transforms the\nmultilingual pretrained model XLM-R into the biomedical domain using a\nknowledge-anchored approach. We achieve a biomedical multilingual corpus by\nincorporating three granularity knowledge alignments (entity, fact, and passage\nlevels) into monolingual corpora. Then we design three corresponding training\ntasks (entity masking, relation masking, and passage relation prediction) and\ncontinue training on top of the XLM-R model to enhance its domain cross-lingual\nability. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we translate the English\nbenchmarks of multiple tasks into Chinese. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our model significantly outperforms monolingual and multilingual\npretrained models in cross-lingual zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving\nimprovements of up to 10+ points.

Additionally, prognostic factors may\nhave dynamic effects (time-varying effects) in long-term follow-up. However,\nexisting competing risks regression models only provide a static view of\ncovariate effects, leading to a distorted assessment of the prognostic factor.\nTo address this issue, we proposed a dynamic effect RMTL regression that can\nexplore the between-group cumulative difference in mean life lost over a period\nof time and obtain the real-time effect by the speed of accumulation, as well\nas personalized predictions on a time scale. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we\nvalidated the dynamic effects estimated by the proposed regression having low\nbias and a coverage rate of around 95%. Applying this model to an elderly\nearly-stage breast cancer cohort, we found that most factors had different\npatterns of dynamic effects, revealing meaningful physiological mechanisms\nunderlying diseases.

            "summary": "In our previous work, we proposed a neural vocoder called APNet, which\ndirectly predicts speech amplitude and phase spectra with a 5 ms frame shift in\nparallel from the input acoustic features, and then reconstructs the 16 kHz\nspeech waveform using inverse short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT). APNet\ndemonstrates the capability to generate synthesized speech of comparable\nquality to the HiFi-GAN vocoder but with a considerably improved inference\nspeed. However, the performance of the APNet vocoder is constrained by the\nwaveform sampling rate and spectral frame shift, limiting its practicality for\nhigh-quality speech synthesis. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved\niteration of APNet, named APNet2. The proposed APNet2 vocoder adopts ConvNeXt\nv2 as the backbone network for amplitude and phase predictions, expecting to\nenhance the modeling capability. Additionally, we introduce a multi-resolution\ndiscriminator (MRD) into the GAN-based losses and optimize the form of certain\nlosses. At a common configuration with a waveform sampling rate of 22.05 kHz\nand spectral frame shift of 256 points (i.e., approximately 11.6ms), our\nproposed APNet2 vocoder outperformed the original APNet and Vocos vocoders in\nterms of synthesized speech quality.

Two canonical geometries, namely a\nsplit-ring resonator (SRR) and an array of cylinders, are used to highlight the\ntheory, which generalises to arbitrary scatterer geometries. The problem is\nsolved using the generalised eigenfunction expansion method (GEM), which\nexpresses the time-domain solution in terms of the frequency-domain solutions.\nA discrete GEM is proposed to numerically approximate the time-domain solution.\nIt relies on quadrature approximations of continuous integrals and can be\nthought of as a generalisation of the discrete Fourier transform. The solution\nthen takes a simple form in terms of direct matrix multiplications. In parallel\nto the GEM, the singularity expansion method (SEM) is also presented and\napplied to the two aforementioned geometries. It expands the time-domain\nsolution over a discrete set of unforced, complex resonant modes of the\nscatterer. Although the coefficients of this expansion are divergent integrals,\nwe introduce a method of regularising them using analytic continuation. The\nresults show that while the SEM is usually inaccurate at $t=0$, it converges\nrapidly to the GEM solution at all spatial points in the computational domain,\nwith the most rapid convergence occurring inside the resonant cavity.",

In contrast to the general expectation of a Weyl\nsemimetal phase, EuCd2As2 shows insulating behavior in both antiferromagnetic\nand ferromagnetic states as well as surface-dominated conduction from band\nbending. Moreover, the application of a dc bias current can dramatically\nmodulate the resistance by over one order of magnitude, and induce a periodic\nresistance oscillation due to the geometric resonance. Such nonlinear transport\nresults from the highly nonequilibrium state induced by electrical field near\nthe band edge.

            "summary": "The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic make people wear masks more frequently than\never. Current general face recognition system suffers from serious performance\ndegradation,when encountering occluded scenes. The potential reason is that\nface features are corrupted by occlusions on key facial regions. To tackle this\nproblem, previous works either extract identity-related embeddings on feature\nlevel by additional mask prediction, or restore the occluded facial part by\ngenerative models. However, the former lacks visual results for model\ninterpretation, while the latter suffers from artifacts which may affect\ndownstream recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-task gEnerative\nmask dEcoupling face Recognition (MEER) network to jointly handle these two\ntasks, which can learn occlusionirrelevant and identity-related representation\nwhile achieving unmasked face synthesis. We first present a novel mask\ndecoupling module to disentangle mask and identity information, which makes the\nnetwork obtain purer identity features from visible facial components. Then, an\nunmasked face is restored by a joint-training strategy, which will be further\nused to refine the recognition network with an id-preserving loss. Experiments\non masked face recognition under realistic and synthetic occlusions benchmarks\ndemonstrate that the MEER can outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.",

However, these models are susceptible to adversarial\nprompt attacks, where attackers can carefully curate input strings that lead to\nundesirable outputs. The inherent vulnerability of LLMs stems from their\ninput-output mechanisms, especially when presented with intensely\nout-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This paper proposes a token-level detection\nmethod to identify adversarial prompts, leveraging the LLM's capability to\npredict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's\nperplexity and incorporate neighboring token information to encourage the\ndetection of contiguous adversarial prompt sequences.

Here, we present a straightforward and robust on-chip\nmicrolens-based strategy for light-scattering enhancement, providing an\nenhancement range ten times greater than that of near-field optical techniques.\nThese properties are attributed to the increased long-range optical fields and\ncomplex composite interactions between two closely spaced structures. Thanks to\nthis strategy, we demonstrate that high-performance S-SPT can be achieved, for\nthe first time, under a conventional bright-field microscope with illumination\npowers over 1,000 times lower than typically required.

In this article, we explore the\nuse of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) regression models to predict claims\nfrequency and severity based on covariates. In particular, we model claims\nfrequency as a mixture of Poisson regression, and the logarithm of claims\nseverity as a mixture of normal regression. We use the Dirichlet process (DP)\nand Pitman-Yor process (PY) as a prior for the mixing distribution over the\nregression parameters. Unlike parametric regression, such models allow each\ndata point to have its individual parameters, making them highly flexible,\nresulting in improved prediction accuracy.

While models like nearest neighbors and non-negative\nmatrix factorization (NMF) offer high interpretability, their predictive\nperformance on supervised learning tasks is often limited. In contrast, neural\nnetworks based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) support the modular\nconstruction of expressive architectures and tend to have better recognition\naccuracy but are often regarded as black boxes in terms of interpretability.\nOur approach aims to strike a better balance between these two aspects through\nthe use of a building block based on NMF that incorporates supervised neural\nnetwork training methods to achieve high predictive performance while retaining\nthe desirable interpretability properties of NMF. We evaluate our Predictive\nFactorized Coupling (PFC) block on small datasets and show that it achieves\ncompetitive predictive performance with MLPs while also offering improved\ninterpretability. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in various\nscenarios, such as continual learning, training on non-i.i.d. data, and\nknowledge removal after training. Additionally, we show examples of using the\nPFC block to build more expressive architectures, including a fully-connected\nresidual network as well as a factorized recurrent neural network (RNN) that\nperforms competitively with vanilla RNNs while providing improved\ninterpretability. The PFC block uses an iterative inference algorithm that\nconverges to a fixed point, making it possible to trade off accuracy vs\ncomputation after training but also currently preventing its use as a general\nMLP replacement in some scenarios such as training on very large datasets.

Structured EHR\nfoundation models, trained on coded medical records from millions of patients,\ndemonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training\nlabels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions\nremain on the feasibility of sharing these models across different hospitals\nand their performance for local task adaptation. This multi-center study\nexamined the adaptability of a recently released structured EHR foundation\nmodel ($FM_{SM}$), trained on longitudinal medical record data from 2.57M\nStanford Medicine patients. Experiments were conducted using EHR data at The\nHospital for Sick Children and MIMIC-IV. We assessed both adaptability via\ncontinued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to\nbaselines of training models from scratch at each site, including a local\nfoundation model. We evaluated the performance of these models on 8 clinical\nprediction tasks. In both datasets, adapting the off-the-shelf $FM_{SM}$\nmatched the performance of GBM models locally trained on all data while\nproviding a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels.\nWith continued pretraining on local data, label efficiency substantially\nimproved, such that $FM_{SM}$ required fewer than 1% of training examples to\nmatch the fully trained GBM's performance. Continued pretraining was also 60 to\n90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch.\nOur findings show that adapting shared EHR foundation models across hospitals\nprovides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility\nof base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development\nof healthcare AI.",

            "summary": "After a machine learning (ML)-based system is deployed in clinical practice,\nperformance monitoring is important to ensure the safety and effectiveness of\nthe algorithm over time. The goal of this work is to highlight the complexity\nof designing a monitoring strategy and the need for a systematic framework that\ncompares the multitude of monitoring options. One of the main decisions is\nchoosing between using real-world (observational) versus interventional data.\nAlthough the former is the most convenient source of monitoring data, it\nexhibits well-known biases, such as confounding, selection, and missingness. In\nfact, when the ML algorithm interacts with its environment, the algorithm\nitself may be a primary source of bias. On the other hand, a carefully designed\ninterventional study that randomizes individuals can explicitly eliminate such\nbiases, but the ethics, feasibility, and cost of such an approach must be\ncarefully considered. Beyond the decision of the data source, monitoring\nstrategies vary in the performance criteria they track, the interpretability of\nthe test statistics, the strength of their assumptions, and their speed at\ndetecting performance decay. As a first step towards developing a framework\nthat compares the various monitoring options, we consider a case study of an\nML-based risk prediction algorithm for postoperative nausea and vomiting\n(PONV). Bringing together tools from causal inference and statistical process\ncontrol, we walk through the basic steps of defining candidate monitoring\ncriteria, describing potential sources of bias and the causal model, and\nspecifying and comparing candidate monitoring procedures. We hypothesize that\nthese steps can be applied more generally, as causal inference can address\nother sources of biases as well.",

To\nenable discovery, a fundamentally different approach to building generative\nmodels is required: models should be able to propose rare, albeit physical,\nconformations that may not arise in even the largest data sets. Here we\nintroduce a modular strategy to generate conformations based on ``backmapping''\nfrom a fixed protein backbone that 1) maintains conformational diversity of the\nside chains and 2) couples the side chain fluctuations using global information\nabout the protein conformation. Our model combines simple statistical models of\nside chain conformations based on rotamer libraries with the now ubiquitous\ntransformer architecture to sample with atomistic accuracy. Together, these\ningredients provide a strategy for rapid data acquistion and hence a crucial\ningredient for scalable physical simulation with generative neural networks.",

While traditional predictive models, grounded in\nsimulation, hold theoretical robustness, they grapple with challenges, notably\nthe assimilation of imprecise data and extensive computational complexities. In\nrecent years, Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has been adopted to develop\nMachine Learning (ML)-enabled magnetometer systems for predicting real-time\nterrestrial magnetic perturbations as a proxy measure for GIC. While TinyML\noffers efficient, real-time data processing, its intrinsic limitations prevent\nthe utilization of robust methods with high computational needs. This paper\ndeveloped a physics-guided TinyML framework to address the above challenges.\nThis framework integrates physics-based regularization at the stages of model\ntraining and compression, thereby augmenting the reliability of predictions.\nThe developed pruning scheme within the framework harnesses the inherent\nphysical characteristics of the domain, striking a balance between model size\nand robustness. The study presents empirical results, drawing a comprehensive\ncomparison between the accuracy and reliability of the developed framework and\nits traditional counterpart.

In recent years,\nprogress has been made towards high-NA (Numerical Aperture) EUVL\n(Extreme-Ultraviolet-Lithography) paradigm, which promises to advance pattern\nshrinking (2 nm node and beyond). However, a significant increase in stochastic\ndefects and the complexity of defect detection becomes more pronounced with\nhigh-NA. Present defect inspection techniques (both non-machine learning and\nmachine learning based), fail to achieve satisfactory performance at high-NA\ndimensions. In this work, we investigate the use of the Slicing Aided Hyper\nInference (SAHI) framework for improving upon current techniques. Using SAHI,\ninference is performed on size-increased slices of the SEM images. This leads\nto the object detector's receptive field being more effective in capturing\nsmall defect instances. First, the performance on previously investigated\nsemiconductor datasets is benchmarked across various configurations, and the\nSAHI approach is demonstrated to substantially enhance the detection of small\ndefects, by approx. 2x. Afterwards, we also demonstrated application of SAHI\nleads to flawless detection rates on a new test dataset, with scenarios not\nencountered during training, whereas previous trained models failed. Finally,\nwe formulate an extension of SAHI that does not significantly reduce\ntrue-positive predictions while eliminating false-positive predictions.",

            "summary": "The half-filled $t_{2g}$ shell of the $t_{2g}^3$ configuration usually, in LS\ncoupling, hosts a S = 3/2 ground state with quenched orbital moment. This state\nis not Jahn-Teller active. Sufficiently large spin-orbit coupling $\\zeta$ has\nbeen predicted to change this picture by mixing in orbital moment, giving rise\nto a sizable Jahn-Teller distortion. In $5d^3$ K$_2$ReCl$_6$ we study the\nelectronic excitations using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and\noptical spectroscopy. We observe on-site intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations below 2 eV\nand corresponding overtones with two intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations on adjacent\nsites, the Mott gap at 2.7 eV, $t_{2g}$-to-$e_g$ excitations above 3 eV, and\ncharge-transfer excitations at still higher energy. The intra-$t_{2g}$\nexcitation energies are a sensitive measure of $\\zeta$ and Hund's coupling\n$J_H$. The sizable value of $\\zeta \\approx$ 0.29 eV places K$_2$ReCl$_6$ into\nthe intermediate coupling regime, but $\\zeta/J_H \\approx 0.6$ is not\nsufficiently large to drive a pronounced Jahn-Teller effect. We discuss the\nground state wavefunction in a Kanamori picture and find that the S = 3/2\nmultiplet still carries about 97 % of the weight. However, the finite admixture\nof orbital moment allows for subtle effects. We discuss small\ntemperature-induced changes of the optical data and find evidence for a\nlowering of the ground state by about 3 meV below the structural phase\ntransitions.",

Recent application of deep learning\nmethods for image reconstruction provides a successful data-driven approach to\naddressing the challenges when reconstructing images with undersampled\nmeasurements or various types of noise. In this work, we propose a hybrid\nsupervised-unsupervised learning framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT)\nimage reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages both sparsity\nor unsupervised learning-based priors and neural network reconstructors to\nsimulate a fixed-point iteration process. Each proposed trained block consists\nof a deterministic MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in\nparallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally combined.\nMultiple such blocks are cascaded to form a reconstruction pipeline. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of this learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image\nreconstruction with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo\nClinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and testing. In our\nexperiments, we study combinations of supervised deep network reconstructors\nand MBIR solver with learned sparse representation-based priors or analytical\npriors. Our results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed\nframework compared to recent low-dose CT reconstruction methods.",

            "summary": "Overfitting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model is\ntrained for too long and focused too much on the exact fitness of the training\nsamples to the provided training labels and cannot keep track of the predictive\nrules that would be useful on the test data. This phenomenon is commonly\nattributed to memorization of particular samples, memorization of the noise,\nand forced fitness into a data set of limited samples by using a high number of\nneurons. While it is true that the model encodes various peculiarities as the\ntraining process continues, we argue that most of the overfitting occurs in the\nprocess of reconciling sharply defined membership ratios. In this study, we\npresent an approach that increases the classification accuracy of machine\nlearning models by allowing the model to negotiate output representations of\nthe samples with previously determined class labels. By setting up a\nnegotiation between the models interpretation of the inputs and the provided\nlabels, we not only increased average classification accuracy but also\ndecreased the rate of overfitting without applying any other regularization\ntricks. By implementing our negotiation paradigm approach to several low regime\nmachine learning problems by generating overfitting scenarios from publicly\navailable data sets such as CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and MNIST we have demonstrated\nthat the proposed paradigm has more capacity than its intended purpose. We are\nsharing the experimental results and inviting the machine learning community to\nexplore the limits of the proposed paradigm. We also aim to incentive the\ncommunity to exploit the negotiation paradigm to overcome the learning related\nchallenges in other research fields such as continual learning.

In this study, we\nintroduce a local environment framework that extracts local features from\ncrystal structures to portray the environment surrounding specific adsorption\nsites. Upon OC20 database (~20,000 3D entries), we apply our local environment\nframework on several ML models, such as random forest, convolutional neural\nnetwork, and graph neural network. It is found that our framework achieves\nremarkable prediction accuracy in predicting molecular adsorption energy,\nsignificantly outperforming other examined global-environment-based models.\nMoreover, the employment of this framework reduces data requirements and\naugments computational speed, specifically for deep learning algorithms.\nFinally, we directly apply our Local Environment ResNet (LERN) on a small\n2DMatPedia database (~2,000 2D entries), which also achieves highly accurate\nprediction, demonstrating the model transferability and remarkable data\nefficiency. Overall, the prediction accuracy, data-utilization efficiency, and\ntransferability of our local-environment-based ML framework hold a promising\nhigh applicability across a broad molecular adsorption field, such as catalysis\nand sensor technologies.",

The\nLS-Transducer extracts a label-level encoder representation before combining it\nwith the prediction network output. Since blank tokens are no longer needed,\nthe prediction network performs as a standard language model, which can be\neasily adapted using text-only data. An Auto-regressive Integrate-and-Fire\n(AIF) mechanism is proposed to generate the label-level encoder representation\nwhile retaining low latency operation that can be used for streaming. In\naddition, a streaming joint decoding method is designed to improve ASR accuracy\nwhile retaining synchronisation with AIF. Experiments show that compared to\nstandard neural transducers, the proposed LS-Transducer gave a 12.9% relative\nWER reduction (WERR) for intra-domain LibriSpeech data, as well as 21.4% and\n24.6% relative WERRs on cross-domain TED-LIUM 2 and AESRC2020 data with an\nadapted prediction network.",

Specifically, model performance has a\npower-law relationship with model size or data size, which provides important\nguidance for the development of large-scale models. However, there is still\nlimited understanding on the scaling effect of user behavior models in\nrecommender systems, where the unique data characteristics (e.g. data scarcity\nand sparsity) pose new challenges to explore the scaling effect in\nrecommendation tasks. In this work, we focus on investigating the scaling laws\nin large sequential recommendation models. Specially, we consider a pure\nID-based task formulation, where the interaction history of a user is formatted\nas a chronological sequence of item IDs. We don't incorporate any side\ninformation (e.g. item text), because we would like to explore how scaling law\nholds from the perspective of user behavior. With specially improved\nstrategies, we scale up the model size to 0.8B parameters, making it feasible\nto explore the scaling effect in a diverse range of model sizes. As the major\nfindings, we empirically show that scaling law still holds for these trained\nmodels, even in data-constrained scenarios. We then fit the curve for scaling\nlaw, and successfully predict the test loss of the two largest tested model\nscales. Furthermore, we examine the performance advantage of scaling effect on\nfive challenging recommendation tasks, considering the unique issues (e.g. cold\nstart, robustness, long-term preference) in recommender systems. We find that\nscaling up the model size can greatly boost the performance on these\nchallenging tasks, which again verifies the benefits of large recommendation\nmodels.",

To resolve this issue, we propose a novel\nframework to generate a model-agnostic recourse that exhibits robustness to\nmodel shifts.

This conformal block decomposition is highly nontrivial, even\nfor the simplest 4d massless scalar amplitude. We use the analytic continuation\nof the Appell hypergeometric function $F_1$ and the method of monodromy\nprojection of conformal blocks, to achieve this block decomposition. This\nprocedure is consistent with the crossing symmetry, in both the\ncorrelator-level and each explicit block-level. We also investigate its\nbehavior in the conformal soft limit and find that the Appell hypergeometric\nfunction $F_1$ does not reduce to the Gauss hypergeometric function. This is\ndifferent from the block decomposition of celestial gluons we studied before,\nwhere the Appell hypergeometric function $F_1$ reduces to the Gauss\nhypergeometric function.

While the significance of\nattributes in IAA is widely recognized, many attribute-based methods lack\nconsideration for the selection and utilization of aesthetic attributes. Our\ninitial step involves the acquisition of aesthetic attributes from both intra-\nand inter-perspectives. Within the intra-perspective, we extract the direct\nvisual attributes of images, constituting the absolute attribute. In the\ninter-perspective, our focus lies in modeling the relative score relationships\nbetween images within the same sequence, forming the relative attribute. Then,\nto better utilize image attributes in aesthetic assessment, we propose the\nUnified Multi-attribute Aesthetic Assessment Framework (UMAAF) to model both\nabsolute and relative attributes of images. For absolute attributes, we\nleverage multiple absolute-attribute perception modules and an\nabsolute-attribute interacting network. The absolute-attribute perception\nmodules are first pre-trained on several absolute-attribute learning tasks and\nthen used to extract corresponding absolute attribute features. The\nabsolute-attribute interacting network adaptively learns the weight of diverse\nabsolute-attribute features, effectively integrating them with generic\naesthetic features from various absolute-attribute perspectives and generating\nthe aesthetic prediction. To model the relative attribute of images, we\nconsider the relative ranking and relative distance relationships between\nimages in a Relative-Relation Loss function, which boosts the robustness of the\nUMAAF. Furthermore, UMAAF achieves state-of-the-art performance on TAD66K and\nAVA datasets, and multiple experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each\nmodule and the model's alignment with human preference.",

Previous works often decode the ultimate\nhigh-level semantic features to future frames without texture details, which\ndeteriorates the prediction quality. Motivated by this, we develop a Pair-wise\nLayer Attention (PLA) module to enhance the layer-wise semantic dependency of\nthe feature maps derived from the U-shape structure in Translator, by coupling\nlow-level visual cues and high-level features. Hence, the texture details of\npredicted frames are enriched. Moreover, most existing methods capture the\nspatiotemporal dynamics by Translator, but fail to sufficiently utilize the\nspatial features of Encoder. This inspires us to design a Spatial Masking (SM)\nmodule to mask partial encoding features during pretraining, which adds the\nvisibility of remaining feature pixels by Decoder. To this end, we present a\nPair-wise Layer Attention with Spatial Masking (PLA-SM) framework for video\nprediction to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics, which reflect the motion\ntrend.

            "summary": "Doping nonmagnetic semiconductors with magnetic impurities is a feasible way\nto obtain diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). It is generally accepted that\nfor the most extensively studied DMS, (Ga, Mn)As, its highest Curie temperature\nT$_{\\text{C}}$ was achieved at 200 K with a Mn concentration of approximately\n16% in experiments. A recent experiment reported record-breaking high electron\nand hole mobilities in the semiconductor BAs [Science 377, 437 (2022)]. Since\nBAs shares the same zinc-blende structure with GaAs, here we predict four DMSs\n(B, Mn)X (X = N, P, As, Sb) by density functional theory calculations. Our\nresults indicate that a significantly higher T$_{\\text{C}}$ in the range of 254\nK to 300 K for (B, Mn)As with a Mn concentration of around 15.6%, and even\nhigher T$_{\\text{C}}$ values above the room temperature for (B, Mn)N and (B,\nMn)P with a Mn concentration exceeding 12.5%. Furthermore, we have predicted a\nlarge hole mobility of 1561 cm$^{\\text{2}}$V$^{\\text{-1}}$s$^{\\text{-1}}$ at\n300 K for (B, Mn)As with a Mn concentration of about 3.7%, which is three\norders of magnitude larger than the hole mobility of 4\ncm$^{\\text{2}}$V$^{\\text{-1}}$s$^{\\text{-1}}$ at 300 K observed in the\nexperiment for (Ga, Mn)As. Our findings predict the emergence of a new family\nof DMS, (B, Mn)X, and are expected to stimulate both experimental and\ntheoretical studies of the DMS with high T$_{\\text{C}}$ and high mobilities.",

            "summary": "Incompatible spatial data modeling is a pervasive challenge in remote sensing\ndata analysis that involves field data. Typical approaches to addressing this\nchallenge aggregate information to a coarser common scale, i.e., compatible\nresolutions. Such pre-processing aggregation to a common resolution simplifies\nanalysis, but potentially causes information loss and hence compromised\ninference and predictive performance. To incorporate finer information to\nenhance prediction performance, we develop a new Bayesian method aimed at\nimproving predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification. The main\ncontribution of this work is an efficient algorithm that enables full Bayesian\ninference using finer resolution data while optimizing computational and\nstorage costs. The algorithm is developed and applied to a forest damage\nassessment for the 2018 Adrian storm in Carinthia, Austria, which uses field\ndata and high-resolution LiDAR measurements.

This model effectively predicts ionic\ncoherence resulting from directional tunnel ionization. With increasing field\nstrength, the degree of coherence predicted by the ASFA model gradually\ndeviates from that of the SFA model but remains much milder compared to the\nresults of the simple and partial-wave expansion models. The impact of\ncoherence injection on the postionization molecular dynamics is explored in\nO$_2$ and N$_2$. We find that the ionization-induced vibrational coherence\nstrongly enhances the population inversion of $X^2 \\Sigma _g^+ -B^2 \\Sigma _u^+\n$ in N$_2^+$ and the dissociation probability of O$_2^+$. Conversely, the\nionization-induced vibronic coherences have inhibitory effects on the related\ntransitions.

Existing methods construct experiments\nbased on the public datasets of related tasks, which are not tailored for open\nvocabulary and rarely involves imperceptible objects camouflaged in complex\nscenes due to data collection bias and annotation costs. To fill in the gaps,\nwe introduce a new task, open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation\n(OVCOS) and construct a large-scale complex scene dataset (\\textbf{OVCamo})\nwhich containing 11,483 hand-selected images with fine annotations and\ncorresponding object classes.

            "summary": "Backdoor attacks have become a major security threat for deploying machine\nlearning models in security-critical applications. Existing research endeavors\nhave proposed many defenses against backdoor attacks. Despite demonstrating\ncertain empirical defense efficacy, none of these techniques could provide a\nformal and provable security guarantee against arbitrary attacks. As a result,\nthey can be easily broken by strong adaptive attacks, as shown in our\nevaluation. In this work, we propose TextGuard, the first provable defense\nagainst backdoor attacks on text classification. In particular, TextGuard first\ndivides the (backdoored) training data into sub-training sets, achieved by\nsplitting each training sentence into sub-sentences. This partitioning ensures\nthat a majority of the sub-training sets do not contain the backdoor trigger.\nSubsequently, a base classifier is trained from each sub-training set, and\ntheir ensemble provides the final prediction. We theoretically prove that when\nthe length of the backdoor trigger falls within a certain threshold, TextGuard\nguarantees that its prediction will remain unaffected by the presence of the\ntriggers in training and testing inputs. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of TextGuard on three benchmark text classification tasks,\nsurpassing the certification accuracy of existing certified defenses against\nbackdoor attacks. Furthermore, we propose additional strategies to enhance the\nempirical performance of TextGuard. Comparisons with state-of-the-art empirical\ndefenses validate the superiority of TextGuard in countering multiple backdoor\nattacks.

            "summary": "Scaling laws have allowed Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) into the field\nof causal reasoning. Causal reasoning of PLM relies solely on text-based\ndescriptions, in contrast to causal discovery which aims to determine the\ncausal relationships between variables utilizing data. Recently, there has been\ncurrent research regarding a method that mimics causal discovery by aggregating\nthe outcomes of repetitive causal reasoning, achieved through specifically\ndesigned prompts. It highlights the usefulness of PLMs in discovering cause and\neffect, which is often limited by a lack of data, especially when dealing with\nmultiple variables. Conversely, the characteristics of PLMs which are that PLMs\ndo not analyze data and they are highly dependent on prompt design leads to a\ncrucial limitation for directly using PLMs in causal discovery. Accordingly,\nPLM-based causal reasoning deeply depends on the prompt design and carries out\nthe risk of overconfidence and false predictions in determining causal\nrelationships. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate the aforementioned\nlimitations of PLM-based causal reasoning through experiments on\nphysics-inspired synthetic data. Then, we propose a new framework that\nintegrates prior knowledge obtained from PLM with a causal discovery algorithm.\nThis is accomplished by initializing an adjacency matrix for causal discovery\nand incorporating regularization using prior knowledge. Our proposed framework\nnot only demonstrates improved performance through the integration of PLM and\ncausal discovery but also suggests how to leverage PLM-extracted prior\nknowledge with existing causal discovery algorithms.",

However,\ndue to the lack of appropriate ground truth images, DL-based PWI still remains\nchallenging for performance improvements. To address this issue, in this paper,\nwe propose a new unsupervised learning approach, i.e., deep coherence learning\n(DCL)-based DL beamformer (DL-DCL), for high-quality single PWI. In DL-DCL, the\nDL network is trained to predict highly correlated signals with a unique loss\nfunction from a set of PW data, and the trained DL model encourages\nhigh-quality PWI from low-quality single PW data. In addition, the DL-DCL\nframework based on complex baseband signals enables a universal beamformer. To\nassess the performance of DL-DCL, simulation, phantom and in vivo studies were\nconducted with public datasets, and it was compared with traditional\nbeamformers (i.e., DAS with 75-PWs and DMAS with 1-PW) and other DL-based\nmethods (i.e., supervised learning approach with 1-PW and generative\nadversarial network (GAN) with 1-PW). From the experiments, the proposed DL-DCL\nshowed comparable results with DMAS with 1-PW and DAS with 75-PWs in spatial\nresolution, and it outperformed all comparison methods in contrast resolution.\nThese results demonstrated that the proposed unsupervised learning approach can\naddress the inherent limitations of traditional PWIs based on DL, and it also\nshowed great potential in clinical settings with minimal artifacts.",

Due to the presence of unreliable data qubits in\nexisting quantum computers, implementing quantum error correction is a critical\nstep when establishing a stable quantum computer system. Recently, machine\nlearning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed to address this challenge.\nHowever, they lack a thorough understanding of quantum error correction. To\nbridge this research gap, we provide a new perspective to understand machine\nlearning-based QEC in this paper. We find that syndromes in the ancilla qubits\nresult from errors on connected data qubits, and distant ancilla qubits can\nprovide auxiliary information to rule out some incorrect predictions for the\ndata qubits. Therefore, to detect errors in data qubits, we must consider the\ninformation present in the long-range ancilla qubits. To the best of our\nknowledge, machine learning is less explored in the dependency relationship of\nQEC. To fill the blank, we curate a machine learning benchmark to assess the\ncapacity to capture long-range dependencies for quantum error correction. To\nprovide a comprehensive evaluation, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art deep\nlearning algorithms spanning diverse neural network architectures, such as\nconvolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and graph transformers.\nOur exhaustive experiments reveal an enlightening trend: By enlarging the\nreceptive field to exploit information from distant ancilla qubits, the\naccuracy of QEC significantly improves. For instance, U-Net can improve CNN by\na margin of about 50%. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis that could\ninspire future research in this field.

            "summary": "We study the design of goal-oriented communication strategies for remote\ninference, where an inferrer (e.g., a trained neural network) on the receiver\nside predicts a time-varying target signal (e.g., the position of the car in\nfront) using the data packet (e.g., video clip) most recently received from a\nsensor (e.g., camera). The communication between the sensor and the receiver is\ncarried out over a two-way channel. The objective is to minimize the expected\ninference error per time slot by exploiting the memory of the delay in the\nchannel. It turns out that the optimal policy is an index-based threshold\npolicy. The scheduler submits a packet at suitable time slots for which the\nindex function exceeds a threshold. The index function depends on the current\nage of information on the receiver side and the prior knowledge about the delay\nin the subsequent packet transmission.",

Such a dataset currently does not exist and is impossible to\nconstruct manually. Recent automated efforts focus on deep learning models for\nlandslide segmentation (pixel labeling) from satellite imagery. However, it is\nalso important to characterize the uncertainty or confidence levels of such\nsegmentations. Accurate and robust uncertainty estimates can enable low-cost\n(in terms of manual labor) oversight of auto-generated landslide databases to\nresolve errors, identify hard negative examples, and increase the size of\nlabeled training data. In this paper, we evaluate several methods for assessing\npixel-level uncertainty of the segmentation. Three methods that do not require\narchitectural changes were compared, including Pre-Threshold activations,\nMonte-Carlo Dropout and Test-Time Augmentation -- a method that measures the\nrobustness of predictions in the face of data augmentation. Experimentally, the\nquality of the latter method was consistently higher than the others across a\nvariety of models and metrics in our dataset.",

To address this issue, we present\nSecondPose, a novel approach integrating object-specific geometric features\nwith semantic category priors from DINOv2. Leveraging the advantage of DINOv2\nin providing SE(3)-consistent semantic features, we hierarchically extract two\ntypes of SE(3)-invariant geometric features to further encapsulate\nlocal-to-global object-specific information. These geometric features are then\npoint-aligned with DINOv2 features to establish a consistent object\nrepresentation under SE(3) transformations, facilitating the mapping from\ncamera space to the pre-defined canonical space, thus further enhancing pose\nestimation. Extensive experiments on NOCS-REAL275 demonstrate that SecondPose\nachieves a 12.4% leap forward over the state-of-the-art.

However, existing works\nfail to generalize under distribution shifts, which are common in real-world\nscenarios. As the generation of dynamic graphs is heavily influenced by latent\nenvironments, investigating their impacts on the out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization is critical. However, it remains unexplored with the following\ntwo major challenges: (1) How to properly model and infer the complex\nenvironments on dynamic graphs with distribution shifts? (2) How to discover\ninvariant patterns given inferred spatio-temporal environments? To solve these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Environment-Aware dynamic Graph LEarning (EAGLE)\nframework for OOD generalization by modeling complex coupled environments and\nexploiting spatio-temporal invariant patterns. Specifically, we first design\nthe environment-aware EA-DGNN to model environments by multi-channel\nenvironments disentangling. Then, we propose an environment instantiation\nmechanism for environment diversification with inferred distributions. Finally,\nwe discriminate spatio-temporal invariant patterns for out-of-distribution\nprediction by the invariant pattern recognition mechanism and perform\nfine-grained causal interventions node-wisely with a mixture of instantiated\nenvironment samples. Experiments on real-world and synthetic dynamic graph\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art\nbaselines under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to study OOD generalization on dynamic graphs from the environment\nlearning perspective.",

            "summary": "The signed distance field (SDF) represents 3D geometries in continuous\nfunction space. Due to its continuous nature, explicit 3D models (e.g., meshes)\ncan be extracted from it at arbitrary resolution, which means losing the SDF is\nequivalent to losing the mesh. Recent research has shown meshes can also be\nextracted from SDF-enhanced neural radiance fields (NeRF). Such a signal raises\nan alarm that any implicit neural representation with SDF enhancement can\nextract the original mesh, which indicates identifying the SDF's intellectual\nproperty becomes an urgent issue. This paper proposes FuncMark, a robust and\ninvisible watermarking method to protect the copyright of signed distance\nfields by leveraging analytic on-surface deformations to embed binary watermark\nmessages. Such deformation can survive isosurfacing and thus be inherited by\nthe extracted meshes for further watermark message decoding. Our method can\nrecover the message with high-resolution meshes extracted from SDFs and detect\nthe watermark even when mesh vertices are extremely sparse. Furthermore, our\nmethod is robust even when various distortions (including remeshing) are\nencountered.

CBMs essentially limit the latent space of a model to\nhuman-understandable high-level concepts. While beneficial, CBMs have been\nreported to often learn irrelevant concept representations that consecutively\ndamage model performance. To overcome the performance trade-off, we propose\ncooperative-Concept Bottleneck Model (coop-CBM).

This paper presents extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets for image classification tasks, namely CUB, AwA2, CelebA and TIL.

Next, our lightweight retrieval\nmodule aggregates the features within each part as its retrieval token and\ncompare all the tokens with source shapes from a pre-established database to\nidentify the most geometrically similar shape. Finally, we deform the retrieved\nshape in the deformation module to tightly fit the input object by harnessing\npart center guided neural cage deformation. The key insight of ShapeMaker is\nthe simultaneous training of the four highly-associated processes:\ncanonicalization, segmentation, retrieval, and deformation, leveraging\ncross-task consistency losses for mutual supervision.

In contrast to the trend\nof making the model larger and more complicated, we argue that a desirable\nframework should be deployment-friendly to diverse chips while maintaining high\nprecision. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play paradigm, namely FlashOCC,\nto consolidate rapid and memory-efficient occupancy prediction while\nmaintaining high precision.

            "summary": "Constructing a robust model that can effectively generalize to test samples\nunder distribution shifts remains a significant challenge in the field of\nmedical imaging. The foundational models for vision and language, pre-trained\non extensive sets of natural image and text data, have emerged as a promising\napproach. It showcases impressive learning abilities across different tasks\nwith the need for only a limited amount of annotated samples. While numerous\ntechniques have focused on developing better fine-tuning strategies to adapt\nthese models for specific domains, we instead examine their robustness to\ndomain shifts in the medical image segmentation task. To this end, we compare\nthe generalization performance to unseen domains of various pre-trained models\nafter being fine-tuned on the same in-distribution dataset and show that\nfoundation-based models enjoy better robustness than other architectures. From\nhere, we further developed a new Bayesian uncertainty estimation for frozen\nmodels and used them as an indicator to characterize the model's performance on\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data, proving particularly beneficial for real-world\napplications. Our experiments not only reveal the limitations of current\nindicators like accuracy on the line or agreement on the line commonly used in\nnatural image applications but also emphasize the promise of the introduced\nBayesian uncertainty. Specifically, lower uncertainty predictions usually tend\nto higher out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.",

The fabricability of\nthese designs, with segmentations in both the longitudinal and transverse\ndimensions, hinges on the minimum feature size offered by cutting-edge\nfabrication technologies. In this work we present both numerical and\nexperimental evidence that high performance devices can be obtained while using\nlarge transverse segmentation periods of up to 650 nm, thereby increasing the\ncritical feature sizes. For single-step etched couplers produced on the 220 nm\nsilicon-on-insulator platform, we demonstrate coupling efficiencies of nearly\n50% in the C-band and remarkably low back reflections of -22 dB at zero-degree\nincidence angle. Notably, the duty cycles used in our optimized designs deviate\nsignificantly from those predicted by traditional effective medium models, even\nfor small periods. Our findings promise to expand the range of optical\nproperties achievable in metamaterials and offer fresh insights into the\nfine-tuning of nanophotonic devices.",

Central to this\nprediction is the finding that the zero field splittings between spin sublevels\nin such defects are typically in the sub-terahertz to terahertz range due to\nthe large spin-orbit coupling in these systems. As a proof of concept, we\nconsider different transition metal impurities from across the periodic table,\nin prototypical TMDs, MoS2 and WSe2. Using first principles calculations, we\ndemonstrate that selected spin triplet defects can potentially serve as qubits\noperating in the terahertz regime.

The\nproposed framework includes EEG and NLP feature extraction, processing, and\nclassification.

An ensemble stacking classification method -- a combination of\nmultiple individual models that produces an enhanced predictive model -- is\nstudied to learn from the features to make predictions accurately. Furthermore,\nwe also utilized subjective confusion ratings as another integrated feature to\nenhance classification performance. By doing so, experiment results show that\nthis framework performs better than the baselines, which achieved F1 up to 0.65\nfor predicting confusion and 0.78 for predicting correctness, highlighting that\nutilizing this has helped improve the classification performance.",

            "summary": "When traveling to an unfamiliar city for holidays, tourists often rely on\nguidebooks, travel websites, or recommendation systems to plan their daily\nitineraries and explore popular points of interest (POIs). However, these\napproaches may lack optimization in terms of time feasibility, localities, and\nuser preferences. In this paper, we propose the SBTRec algorithm: a BERT-based\nTrajectory Recommendation with sentiment analysis, for recommending\npersonalized sequences of POIs as itineraries. The key contributions of this\nwork include analyzing users' check-ins and uploaded photos to understand the\nrelationship between POI visits and distance. We introduce SBTRec, which\nencompasses sentiment analysis to improve recommendation accuracy by\nunderstanding users' preferences and satisfaction levels from reviews and\ncomments about different POIs. Our proposed algorithms are evaluated against\nother sequence prediction methods using datasets from 8 cities. The results\ndemonstrate that SBTRec achieves an average F1 score of 61.45%, outperforming\nbaseline algorithms.\n  The paper further discusses the flexibility of the SBTRec algorithm, its\nability to adapt to different scenarios and cities without modification, and\nits potential for extension by incorporating additional information for more\nreliable predictions. Overall, SBTRec provides personalized and relevant POI\nrecommendations, enhancing tourists' overall trip experiences.

They are endowed\nwith exotic symmetry-breaking properties that contrast sharply with the\nspontaneous breaking of global symmetries and deconfinement transition of gauge\ntheories. To show these unconventional behaviors, which are associated with\nsub-dimensional symmetries, we construct and analyze the order parameters,\ncorrelators, and symmetry generators for both models. Notably, the tetrahedral\nIsing model acquires an extended semi-local ordering moment, while the fractal\nIsing model fits into a polynomial ring representation and leads to a fractal\norder parameter. Numerical studies combined with analytical tools show that\nboth models experience a strong first-order phase transition with an anomalous\n$L^{-(D-1)}$ scaling, despite the fractal symmetry of the latter.

            "summary": "Capturing the extremal behaviour of data often requires bespoke marginal and\ndependence models which are grounded in rigorous asymptotic theory, and hence\nprovide reliable extrapolation into the upper tails of the data-generating\ndistribution. We present a modern toolbox of four methodological frameworks,\nmotivated by modern extreme value theory, that can be used to accurately\nestimate extreme exceedance probabilities or the corresponding level in either\na univariate or multivariate setting. Our frameworks were used to facilitate\nthe winning contribution of Team Yalla to the data competition organised for\nthe 13th International Conference on Extreme Value Analysis (EVA2023). This\ncompetition comprised seven teams competing across four separate\nsub-challenges, with each requiring the modelling of data simulated from known,\nyet highly complex, statistical distributions, and extrapolation far beyond the\nrange of the available samples in order to predict probabilities of extreme\nevents. Data were constructed to be representative of real environmental data,\nsampled from the fantasy country of \"Utopia\".",

            "summary": "In many Industry 4.0 data analytics applications, quality characteristic data\nacquired from manufacturing processes are better modeled as functions, often\nreferred to as profiles. In practice, there are situations where a scalar\nquality characteristic, referred to also as the response, is influenced by one\nor more variables in the form of functional data, referred to as functional\ncovariates. To adjust the monitoring of the scalar response by the effect of\nthis additional information, a new profile monitoring strategy is proposed on\nthe residuals obtained from the functional neural network, which is able to\nlearn a possibly nonlinear relationship between the scalar response and the\nfunctional covariates. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is performed\nto assess the performance of the proposed method with respect to other control\ncharts that appeared in the literature before. Finally, a case study in the\nrailway industry is presented with the aim of monitoring the heating,\nventilation and air conditioning systems installed onboard passenger trains.",

            "summary": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric disorder that\naffects the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe. Even\ntoday, researchers debate if morphological alterations in the brain are linked\nto MDD, likely due to the heterogeneity of this disorder. The application of\ndeep learning tools to neuroimaging data, capable of capturing complex\nnon-linear patterns, has the potential to provide diagnostic and predictive\nbiomarkers for MDD. However, previous attempts to demarcate MDD patients and\nhealthy controls (HC) based on segmented cortical features via linear machine\nlearning approaches have reported low accuracies. In this study, we used\nglobally representative data from the ENIGMA-MDD working group containing an\nextensive sample of people with MDD (N=2,772) and HC (N=4,240), which allows a\ncomprehensive analysis with generalizable results. Based on the hypothesis that\nintegration of vertex-wise cortical features can improve classification\nperformance, we evaluated the classification of a DenseNet and a Support Vector\nMachine (SVM), with the expectation that the former would outperform the\nlatter. As we analyzed a multi-site sample, we additionally applied the ComBat\nharmonization tool to remove potential nuisance effects of site. We found that\nboth classifiers exhibited close to chance performance (balanced accuracy\nDenseNet: 51%; SVM: 53%), when estimated on unseen sites. Slightly higher\nclassification performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 58%; SVM: 55%) was\nfound when the cross-validation folds contained subjects from all sites,\nindicating site effect. In conclusion, the integration of vertex-wise\nmorphometric features and the use of the non-linear classifier did not lead to\nthe differentiability between MDD and HC. Our results support the notion that\nMDD classification on this combination of features and classifiers is\nunfeasible.",

We solve the relativistic Liouville equation in\nthe full $3+1$ dimensional framework of Kerr geometry. For the flow that is\nstationary and axial symmetric, we prove that the distribution function is\nindependent of the conjugate coordinates. For an explicit distribution that can\napproximate to Maxwell-J\\\"{u}ttner distribution, we further calculate the\nparticle current density, the stress energy momentum tensor and the unit\naccretion rates of mass, energy and angular momentum. The analytic results at\nlarge distance are shown to be consistent with the limits of the numerical ones\ncomputed at finite distance. Especially, we show that the unit mass accretion\nrate agrees with the Schwarzschild result in the case of low temperature limit.\nFurthermore, we find from the numerical results that the three unit accretion\nrates vary with the angle in Kerr metric and the accretion of Vlasov gas would\nslow down the Kerr black hole.

            "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial examples, which\nintroduce imperceptible perturbations to benign samples, deceiving DNN\npredictions. While some attack methods excel in the white-box setting, they\noften struggle in the black-box scenario, particularly against models fortified\nwith defense mechanisms. Various techniques have emerged to enhance the\ntransferability of adversarial attacks for the black-box scenario. Among these,\ninput transformation-based attacks have demonstrated their effectiveness. In\nthis paper, we explore the potential of leveraging data generated by Stable\nDiffusion to boost adversarial transferability. This approach draws inspiration\nfrom recent research that harnessed synthetic data generated by Stable\nDiffusion to enhance model generalization. In particular, previous work has\nhighlighted the correlation between the presence of both real and synthetic\ndata and improved model generalization. Building upon this insight, we\nintroduce a novel attack method called Stable Diffusion Attack Method (SDAM),\nwhich incorporates samples generated by Stable Diffusion to augment input\nimages. Furthermore, we propose a fast variant of SDAM to reduce computational\noverhead while preserving high adversarial transferability. Our extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines by a substantial margin. Moreover, our approach is compatible with\nexisting transfer-based attacks to further enhance adversarial transferability.",

We specialize our result to several concrete\nSGMs with specific choices of forward processes modelled by stochastic\ndifferential equations, and obtain an upper bound on the iteration complexity\nfor each model, which demonstrates the impacts of different choices of the\nforward processes. We also provide a lower bound when the data distribution is\nGaussian.

When the spacecraft deviates significantly from the reference\ntrajectory, a new reference is calculated through the same method to reach the\ntarget debris. When required, phasing is integrated into the transfer. During\nthe mission, the phase of the spacecraft is adjusted to match that of the\ntarget debris at the end of the transfer by introducing intermediate waiting\ntimes. The robustness of the guidance scheme is tested in a high-fidelity\ndynamical model that includes thrust errors and misthrust events. The guidance\nalgorithm performs well without requiring successive convex iterations.\nMonte-Carlo simulations are conducted to analyze the impact of these thrust\nuncertainties on the guidance.

These models fail to represent modern systems composed of multiple\ninteracting assets. We are providing the first O&M model to optimize O&M in\nmulti-asset systems with embedded decision-dependent degradation interactions.\nWe formulate robust optimization models that inherently capture degradation and\nfailure risks by embedding degradation signals via a set of constraints, and\nbuilding condition-based uncertainty sets to model probable degradation\nscenarios. We offer multiple reformulations and a solution algorithm to ensure\ncomputational scalability. Performance of the proposed O&M model is evaluated\nthrough extensive experiments, where the degradation is either emulated or\ntaken from vibration-based readings from a rotating machinery system. The\nproposed model provides significant improvements in terms of operation,\nmaintenance, and reliability metrics.

For instance, the stationary distributions of reversible chains\nare fundamentally simpler than those of nonreversible chains because they are\nBoltzmann distributions -- they can be expressed in terms of a purely local\n\"free energy\" landscape, in analogy with equilibrium statistical physics. In\ngeneral, it is impossible to similarly represent the steady states of\nnonequilibrium physical systems in a purely local way. However, a series of\nrecent works on rattling theory (e.g., Chvykov et al., Science (2021)) provides\nstrong evidence that a broad class of such systems nevertheless exhibit\n\"approximate Boltzmann distributions,\" which allow some aspects of the global\ndistributions to be inferred, at least approximately, from local information.\n  We formalize the main claims of this physical theory to identify its hidden\nassumptions and demonstrate its basis in the theory of continuous-time Markov\nchains. To do so, we decompose an arbitrary stationary distribution $\\pi$ into\nits \"local\" part -- the exit rates $q$ out of each state -- and its \"global\"\npart -- the stationary distribution $\\psi$ of the embedded \"jump\" chain. We\nexplain a variety of experimental results by showing that, for a random state,\n$\\log \\pi$ and $-\\log q$ are correlated to the extent that $\\log \\psi$ and\n$-\\log q$ are correlated or the ratio of their variances is small.

Given the rapid advancements in the\nfield of quantum information science, there is a growing interest and\nsignificance in investigating the connection between Maxwell demon and quantum\ncorrelation. The majority of research endeavors thus far have been directed\ntowards the extraction of work from quantum correlation through the utilization\nof Maxwell demon. Recently, a novel concept called Maxwell demon-assistant\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering has been proposed, which suggests that\nit is possible to simulate quantum correlation by doing work. This seemingly\ncounterintuitive conclusion is attributed to the fact that Alice and Bob need\nclassical communication during EPR steering task, a requirement that does not\napply in the Bell test. In this study, we demonstrate Maxwell demon-assistant\nEPR steering with superconducting quantum circuits. By compiling and optimizing\na quantum circuit to be implemented on a 2D superconducting chip, we were able\nto achieve a steering parameter of $S_{2} = 0.770 \\pm 0.005$ in the case of two\nmeasurement settings, which surpasses the classical bound of $1/\\sqrt{2}$ by\n12.6 standard deviations. In addition, experimental observations have revealed\na linear correlation between the non-locality demonstrated in EPR steering and\nthe work done by the demon. Considering the errors in practical operation, the\nexperimental results are highly consistent with theoretical predictions. Our\nfindings not only suggest the presence of a Maxwell demon loophole in the EPR\nsteering, but also contribute to a deeper comprehension of the interplay\nbetween quantum correlation, information theory, and thermodynamics.",

For example, asteroid taxonomy is based on the spectral features\nor multiple color indices in visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The\ncomposition of asteroids gives key information to understand their origin and\nevolution. However, we lack compositional information for faint asteroids due\nto limits of ground-based observational instruments. In the near future, the\nChinese Space Survey telescope (CSST) will provide multiple colors and\nspectroscopic data for asteroids of apparent magnitude brighter than 25 mag and\n23 mag, respectively. For the aim of analysis of the CSST spectroscopic data,\nwe applied an algorithm using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to establish a\npreliminary classification model for asteroid taxonomy according to the design\nof the survey module of CSST. Using the SMASS II spectra and the Bus-Binzel\ntaxonomy system, our ANN classification tool composed of 5 individual ANNs is\nconstructed, and the accuracy of this classification system is higher than 92\n%. As the first application of our ANN tool, 64 spectra of 42 asteroids\nobtained in 2006 and 2007 by us with the 2.16-m telescope in the Xinglong\nstation (Observatory Code 327) of National Astronomical Observatory of China\nare analyzed. The predicted labels of these spectra using our ANN tool are\nfound to be reasonable when compared to their known taxonomic labels.\nConsidering the accuracy and stability, our ANN tool can be applied to analyse\nthe CSST asteroid spectra in the future.",

Recent experiments have shown that incorporating hydrogen atoms into\nK$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ would significantly change its electronic and magnetic\nproperties. Hence, it's necessary to investigate the impact of hydrogen doping\nin superconducting pairing symmetry of this material. Employing the hydrogen as\nan non-trivial electron-doping, our calculates show that, different from the\n$p_z$-wave obtained without hydrogen, the system exhibits $p_x\\pm ip_y$ pairing\nsuperconductivity under specific hydrogen doping. Specifically, we adopt the\nrandom-phase-approximation approach based on a six-band tight-binding model\nequipped with multi-orbital Hubbard interactions to study the hydrogen-doping\ndependence of the pairing symmetry and superconducting $T_c$. Under the\nrigid-band approximation, our pairing phase diagram shows the spin-triplet\npairing states is dominated through out the hydrogen-doping regime $x\\in\n(0,0.7)$. Particularly, the $T_c\\sim x$ curve shows a peak at the 3D-quasi-1D\nLifshitz transition point, and the pairing symmetry around this doping level is\n$p_x\\pm ip_y$. The physical origin of this pairing symmetry is that the density\nof states is mainly concentrated at $k_x(k_y)$ with large momentum. Due to the\nthree-dimensional character of the real material, this $p_x\\pm ip_y$-wave\nsuperconducting state possesses point gap nodes.

            "summary": "The fundamental theorem behind financial markets is that stock prices are\nintrinsically complex and stochastic. One of the complexities is the volatility\nassociated with stock prices. Volatility is a tendency for prices to change\nunexpectedly [1]. Price volatility is often detrimental to the return\neconomics, and thus, investors should factor it in whenever making investment\ndecisions, choices, and temporal or permanent moves. It is, therefore, crucial\nto make necessary and regular short and long-term stock price volatility\nforecasts for the safety and economics of investors returns. These forecasts\nshould be accurate and not misleading. Different models and methods, such as\nARCH GARCH models, have been intuitively implemented to make such forecasts.\nHowever, such traditional means fail to capture the short-term volatility\nforecasts effectively. This paper, therefore, investigates and implements a\ncombination of numeric and probabilistic models for short-term volatility and\nreturn forecasting for high-frequency trades. The essence is that one-day-ahead\nvolatility forecasts were made with Gaussian Processes (GPs) applied to the\noutputs of a Numerical market prediction (NMP) model. Firstly, the stock price\ndata from NMP was corrected by a GP. Since it is not easy to set price limits\nin a market due to its free nature and randomness, a Censored GP was used to\nmodel the relationship between the corrected stock prices and returns.\nForecasting errors were evaluated using the implied and estimated data.",

            "summary": "Explainability is a longstanding challenge in deep learning, especially in\nhigh-stakes domains like healthcare. Common explainability methods highlight\nimage regions that drive an AI model's decision. Humans, however, heavily rely\non language to convey explanations of not only \"where\" but \"what\".\nAdditionally, most explainability approaches focus on explaining individual AI\npredictions, rather than describing the features used by an AI model in\ngeneral. The latter would be especially useful for model and dataset auditing,\nand potentially even knowledge generation as AI is increasingly being used in\nnovel tasks. Here, we present an explainability strategy that uses a\nvision-language model to identify language-based descriptors of a visual\nclassification task. By leveraging a pre-trained joint embedding space between\nimages and text, our approach estimates a new classification task as a linear\ncombination of words, resulting in a weight for each word that indicates its\nalignment with the vision-based classifier. We assess our approach using two\nmedical imaging classification tasks, where we find that the resulting\ndescriptors largely align with clinical knowledge despite a lack of\ndomain-specific language training. However, our approach also identifies the\npotential for 'shortcut connections' in the public datasets used. Towards a\nfunctional measure of explainability, we perform a pilot reader study where we\nfind that the AI-identified words can enable non-expert humans to perform a\nspecialized medical task at a non-trivial level. Altogether, our results\nemphasize the potential of using multimodal foundational models to deliver\nintuitive, language-based explanations of visual tasks.",

Verbal agitation can impose mental\ndistress on informal caregivers (e.g., family, friends), which may cause severe\nmental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety disorders. To improve informal\ncaregivers' mental health, we explore design opportunities by interviewing 11\ninformal caregivers suffering from verbal agitation of PwD. In particular, we\nfirst characterize how the predictability of verbal agitation impacts informal\ncaregivers' mental health and how caregivers' coping strategies vary before,\nduring, and after verbal agitation. Based on our findings, we propose design\nopportunities to improve the mental health of informal caregivers suffering\nfrom verbal agitation: distracting PwD (in-situ support; before), prompting\njust-in-time maneuvers (information support; during), and comfort and education\n(social & information support; after). We discuss our reflections on cultural\ndisparities between participants. Our work envisions a broader design space for\nsupporting informal caregivers' well-being and describes when and how that\nsupport could be provided.",

There are major challenges in\ndetermining the physical properties within a neutron star, both experimentally\nand theoretically. However, there is a region within the crust of a neutron\nstar that resembles a gas of fermions that is recreated in a cold atom\nlaboratory. This is the so-called unitary Fermi gas characterized by a large\nnegative scattering length and small effective range. We set out to calculate\nfrom first principles certain transport coefficients that appear at second\norder in the hydrodynamic expansion. These particular transport coefficients\nare obtained from two point correlation functions in flat space that do not\nrequire analytic continuation from Euclidean to Minkowski space. We are\nmotivated by the potential to learn about neutron star properties from cold\natom experiments.",

            "summary": "Background: Deep neural networks have proven to be powerful computational\ntools for modeling, prediction, and generation. However, the workings of these\nmodels have generally been opaque. Recent work has shown that the performance\nof some models are modulated by overlapping functional networks of connections\nwithin the models. Here the techniques of functional neuroimaging are applied\nto an exemplary large language model to probe its functional structure.\nMethods: A series of block-designed task-based prompt sequences were generated\nto probe the Facebook Galactica-125M model. Tasks included prompts relating to\npolitical science, medical imaging, paleontology, archeology, pathology, and\nrandom strings presented in an off/on/off pattern with prompts about other\nrandom topics. For the generation of each output token, all layer output values\nwere saved to create an effective time series. General linear models were fit\nto the data to identify layer output values which were active with the tasks.\nResults: Distinct, overlapping networks were identified with each task. Most\noverlap was observed between medical imaging and pathology networks. These\nnetworks were repeatable across repeated performance of related tasks, and\ncorrespondence of identified functional networks and activation in tasks not\nused to define the functional networks was shown to accurately identify the\npresented task. Conclusion: The techniques of functional neuroimaging can be\napplied to deep neural networks as a means to probe their workings. Identified\nfunctional networks hold the potential for use in model alignment, modulation\nof model output, and identifying weights to target in fine-tuning.",

Here, we aim to find such\nstructures through a normative analysis of the score function.\n  First, we derived the closed-form solution to the scored-based model with a\nGaussian score. We claimed that for well-trained diffusion models, the learned\nscore at a high noise scale is well approximated by the linear score of\nGaussian. We demonstrated this through empirical validation of pre-trained\nimages diffusion model and theoretical analysis of the score function. This\nfinding enabled us to precisely predict the initial diffusion trajectory using\nthe analytical solution and to accelerate image sampling by 15-30\\% by skipping\nthe initial phase without sacrificing image quality.

An analytical solution is presented and\nvalidated with coupled laboratory and numerical experiments. The dominant\nbalance of Lorentz forcing and basal viscous drag reproduces the kinematic\nreversibility observed by G.I. Taylor with precise electromagnetic control.\nInduced fluid deformation may be undone by simply reversing the polarity of\nelectric current through the system. We illustrate this analogy with theory and\nexperiment, and we draw a further connection to potential flow using the\nHele-Shaw approximation. The stability and controllability of the\nmagneto-Stokes system make it an attractive tool for investigating shear flows\nin a variety of settings from industrial to astrophysical.

In this work, we investigate\ncorrelations between the statistics underlying the structure of random arrays\nof particles and their spectral properties.

We show that the\nscattering cross section of a random particle array is primarily governed by\nits configuration statistics and is independent of its exact instantiation or\nthe number of its constituent particles. We further exploit the strong\ncorrelations between the statistics and spectral properties of random particle\narrays to predict their spectral response. By using a semi-analytical nearest\nneighbor coupling model, we produce accurate qualitative estimates of the\nspectral responses of both one and two-dimensional random arrays for different\nconfiguration statistics.

            "summary": "We present an unstructured geometrical Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method for\nhandling two-phase flows with a viscoelastic liquid phase. The viscoelastic\nbehavior is modeled via generic rate-type constitutive equations. A one-field\nformulation is employed, which results from conditional volume averaging of the\nlocal instantaneous bulk equations and interface jump conditions. The method\nbuilds on the 'plicRDF-isoAdvector' geometrical VOF solver that is extended and\ncombined with the modular framework 'DeboRheo' for viscoelastic CFD. A\npiecewise-linear geometrical interface reconstruction technique on general\nunstructured meshes is employed for discretizing the viscoelastic stresses\nacross the fluid interface in a numerically consistent and highly accurate way.\nBecause of the numerical challenges posed by the high Weissenberg number\nproblem, we employ an appropriate stabilization approach to the constitutive\nequation of the viscoelastic phase to increase the robustness of the method at\nhigher fluid elasticity. DeboRheo facilitates a flexible combination of\ndifferent rheological models with appropriate stabilization methods to address\nthe high Weissenberg number problem. We discuss the theoretical formulation and\nimplementation of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness using\nnumerical examples of viscoelastic flows. The results highlight the method's\nability to accurately capture the behavior of viscoelastic fluids in various\napplications. The proposed method holds promise for furthering our\nunderstanding and predictive capabilities of viscoelastic flows in various\nindustrial and natural processes.",

            "summary": "Although 3D human pose estimation has gained impressive development in recent\nyears, only a few works focus on infants, that have different bone lengths and\nalso have limited data. Directly applying adult pose estimation models\ntypically achieves low performance in the infant domain and suffers from\nout-of-distribution issues. Moreover, the limitation of infant pose data\ncollection also heavily constrains the efficiency of learning-based models to\nlift 2D poses to 3D. To deal with the issues of small datasets, domain\nadaptation and data augmentation are commonly used techniques. Following this\nparadigm, we take advantage of an optimization-based method that utilizes\ngenerative priors to predict 3D infant keypoints from 2D keypoints without the\nneed of large training data. We further apply a guided diffusion model to\ndomain adapt 3D adult pose to infant pose to supplement small datasets.\nBesides, we also prove that our method, ZeDO-i, could attain efficient domain\nadaptation, even if only a small number of data is given. Quantitatively, we\nclaim that our model attains state-of-the-art MPJPE performance of 43.6 mm on\nthe SyRIP dataset and 21.2 mm on the MINI-RGBD dataset.",

            "summary": "Periodic signatures in time-domain observations of quasars have been used to\nsearch for binary supermassive black holes. These searches, across existing\ntime-domain surveys, have produced several hundred candidates. The general\nstochastic variability of quasars, however, can masquerade as a false-positive\nperiodic signal, especially when monitoring cadence and duration are limited.\nIn this work, we predict the detectability of binary supermassive black holes\nin the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We\napply computationally inexpensive sinusoidal curve fits to millions of\nsimulated LSST Deep Drilling Field light curves of both single, isolated\nquasars and binary quasars. Period and phase of simulated binary signals can\ngenerally be disentangled from quasar variability. Binary amplitude is\noverestimated and poorly recovered for two-thirds of potential binaries due to\nquasar accretion variability. Quasars with strong intrinsic variability can\nobscure a binary signal too much for recovery. We also find that the most\nluminous quasars mimic current binary candidate light curves and their\nproperties: false positive rates are 60\\% for these quasars. The reliable\nrecovery of binary period and phase for a wide range of input binary LSST light\ncurves is promising for multi-messenger characterization of binary supermassive\nblack holes. However, pure electromagnetic detections of binaries using\nphotometric periodicity with amplitude greater than 0.1 magnitude will result\nin samples that are overwhelmed by false positives. This paper represents an\nimportant and computationally inexpensive way forward for understanding the\ntrue and false positive rates for binary candidates identified by Rubin.",

This work\nshows that total one-neutron knockout cross sections are not sensitive to the\nshort-range part of the s.p. wave function. Rather, they scale with the mean\nsquare radius of the overlap function. Using a perturbative expression of the\ncross section, we can easily explain our numerical predictions analytically.\nThis analysis suggests that (i) spectroscopic factors extracted from knockout\ndata suffer from sizeable model uncertainties associated with the choice of\ns.p. wave functions and (ii) knockout reactions constitute an excellent probe\nof the radius of the nucleus and therefore offer an alternative technique to\ninfer the neutron-skin thickness of exotic nuclei.",

Here, motivated by anecdotal evidence from previous work,\nwe provide compelling evidence that the Busse balloon provides insufficient\ninformation to predict wavelength changes due to a delayed loss of stability\nphenomenon. Using two different reaction-advection-diffusion systems, we relate\nthe delay that occurs between the crossing of a stability boundary in the Busse\nballoon and the occurrence of a wavelength change to features of the essential\nspectrum of the destabilised PTW. This leads to a predictive framework that can\nestimate the order of magnitude of such a time delay, which provides a novel\n``early warning sign'' for pattern destabilization.

However, accurately modeling these\nstatistics may require theoretical templates that go beyond second-order\nperturbation theory, especially for achieving precision at smaller scales. In\nour previous work, we introduced a hybrid model for the redshift space power\nspectrum of galaxies. This model combines second-order templates with N-body\nsimulations to capture the influence of scale-independent parameters on the\ngalaxy power spectrum. However, the impact of scale-dependent parameters was\naddressed by precomputing a set of input statistics derived from\ncomputationally expensive N-body simulations. As a result, exploring the\nscale-dependent parameter space was not feasible in this approach. To address\nthis challenge, we present an accelerated methodology that utilizes Gaussian\nprocesses, a machine learning technique, to emulate these input statistics. Our\nemulators exhibit remarkable accuracy, achieving reliable results with just 13\nN-body simulations for training. We reproduce all necessary input statistics\nfor a set of test simulations with an error of approximately 0.1 per cent in\nthe parameter space within $5\\sigma$ of the Planck predictions, specifically\nfor scales around $k > 0.1$ $h$Mpc$^{-1}$. Following the training of our\nemulators, we can predict all inputs for our hybrid model in approximately\n0.2,seconds at a specified redshift.

In string compactifications with $U(1)$s\nfrom sequestered D-brane sectors, kinetic mixing becomes a key target for the\nUV prediction of a phenomenologically important EFT operator. Surprisingly, in\nmany cases kinetic mixing is absent due to a non-trivial cancellation. In\nparticular, D3-D3 kinetic mixing in type-IIB vanishes while D3-anti-D3 mixing\ndoes not. This follows both from exact CFT calculations on tori as well as from\na leading-order 10d supergravity analysis, where the key cancellation is\nbetween the $C_2$ and $B_2$ contribution. We take the latter approach, which is\nthe only one available in realistic Calabi-Yau settings, to a higher level of\nprecision by including sub-leading terms of the brane action and allowing for\nnon-vanishing $C_0$. The exact cancellation persists, which we argue to be the\nresult of $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ self-duality. We note that a $B_2C_2$ term on the\nD3-brane, which is often missing in the recent literature, is essential to\nobtain the correct zero result. Finally, allowing for\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$-breaking fluxes, kinetic mixing between D3-branes arises at\na volume-suppressed level. We provide basic explicit formulae, both for kinetic\nas well as magnetic mixing, leaving the study of phenomenologically relevant,\nmore complex situations for the future.",

Our approach, termed Agent-Driver, transforms the\ntraditional autonomous driving pipeline by introducing a versatile tool library\naccessible via function calls, a cognitive memory of common sense and\nexperiential knowledge for decision-making, and a reasoning engine capable of\nchain-of-thought reasoning, task planning, motion planning, and\nself-reflection. Powered by LLMs, our Agent-Driver is endowed with intuitive\ncommon sense and robust reasoning capabilities, thus enabling a more nuanced,\nhuman-like approach to autonomous driving. We evaluate our approach on the\nlarge-scale nuScenes benchmark, and extensive experiments substantiate that our\nAgent-Driver significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art driving methods by\na large margin. Our approach also demonstrates superior interpretability and\nfew-shot learning ability to these methods. Code will be released.",

The comparison of the RE\nmethods with the gold standard showed that as the complexity increased in the\nRE algorithms, the F1 score increased from 0.3-0.4 to around 0.9. The NER\nmodels demonstrated excellent predictions, with the simple RE method showing\n0.84-0.92 in the evaluation metrics, and the advanced and combined RE method\ndemonstrating 0.95-0.99 in the evaluation.

This\nprediction is a challenging task, especially on the out-of-domain test set. In\nthis paper, we proposed a novel fusion model for MOS prediction that combines\nsupervised and unsupervised approaches. In the supervised aspect, we developed\nan SSL-based predictor called LE-SSL-MOS. The LE-SSL-MOS utilizes pre-trained\nself-supervised learning models and further improves prediction accuracy by\nutilizing the opinion scores of each utterance in the listener enhancement\nbranch. In the unsupervised aspect, two steps are contained: we fine-tuned the\nunit language model (ULM) using highly intelligible domain data to improve the\ncorrelation of an unsupervised metric - SpeechLMScore. Another is that we\nutilized ASR confidence as a new metric with the help of ensemble learning. To\nour knowledge, this is the first architecture that fuses supervised and\nunsupervised methods for MOS prediction. With these approaches, our\nexperimental results on the VoiceMOS Challenge 2023 show that LE-SSL-MOS\nperforms better than the baseline. Our fusion system achieved an absolute\nimprovement of 13% over LE-SSL-MOS on the noisy and enhanced speech track. Our\nsystem ranked 1st and 2nd, respectively, in the French speech synthesis track\nand the challenge's noisy and enhanced speech track.",

However, a\ngood content recommendation is not necessarily similar to what the user has\nchosen in the past. As humans, users naturally evolve, learn, forget, get\nbored, they change their perspective of the world and in consequence, of the\nrecommendable content. One well known mechanism that affects user interest is\nthe Mere Exposure Effect: when repeatedly exposed to stimuli, users' interest\ntends to rise with the initial exposures, reaching a peak, and gradually\ndecreasing thereafter, resulting in an inverted-U shape. Since previous\nresearch has shown that the magnitude of the effect depends on a number of\ninteresting factors such as stimulus complexity and familiarity, leveraging\nthis effect is a way to not only improve repeated recommendation but to gain a\nmore in-depth understanding of both users and stimuli. In this work we present\n(Mere) Exposure2Vec (Ex2Vec) our model that leverages the Mere Exposure Effect\nin repeat consumption to derive user and item characterization and track user\ninterest evolution.

            "summary": "Space is becoming more crowded in Low Earth Orbit due to increased space\nactivity. Such a dense space environment increases the risk of collisions\nbetween space objects endangering the whole space population. Therefore, the\nneed to consider collision avoidance as part of routine operations is evident\nto satellite operators. Current procedures rely on the analysis of multiple\ncollision warnings by human analysts. However, with the continuous growth of\nthe space population, this manual approach may become unfeasible, highlighting\nthe importance of automation in risk assessment. In 2019, ESA launched a\ncompetition to study the feasibility of applying machine learning in collision\nrisk estimation and released a dataset that contained sequences of Conjunction\nData Messages (CDMs) in support of real close encounters. The competition\nresults showed that the naive forecast and its variants are strong predictors\nfor this problem, which suggests that the CDMs may follow the Markov property.\nThe proposed work investigates this theory by benchmarking Hidden Markov Models\n(HMM) in predicting the risk of collision between two resident space objects by\nusing one feature of the entire dataset: the sequence of the probability in the\nCDMs. In addition, Bayesian statistics are used to infer a joint distribution\nfor the parameters of the models, which allows the development of robust and\nreliable probabilistic predictive models that can incorporate physical or prior\nknowledge about the problem within a rigorous theoretical framework and\nprovides prediction uncertainties that nicely reflect the accuracy of the\npredicted risk. This work shows that the implemented HMM outperforms the naive\nsolution in some metrics, which further adds to the idea that the collision\nwarnings may be Markovian and suggests that this is a powerful method to be\nfurther explored.",

Although tools for computing properties of proteins\nalready existed, we could not find a comprehensive tool that enables the\ncalculations of multiple properties for multiple input proteins on the proteome\nlevel at once. Facing this limitation, we have developed Multiple Protein\nProfiler (MPP) 1.0 as an integrated tool that allows the profiling of 12\nindividual properties of multiple proteins in a significant manner.

            "summary": "We analyse the ground-state quantum phase diagram of hardcore Bosons\ninteracting with repulsive dipolar potentials. The bosons dynamics is described\nby the extended-Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional lattice. The\nground state results from the interplay between the lattice geometry and the\nlong-range interactions, which we account for by means of a classical spin\nmean-field approach limited by the size of the considered unit cells. This\nextended classical spin mean-field theory accounts for the long-range\ndensity-density interaction without truncation. We consider three different\nlattice geometries: square, honeycomb, and triangular. In the limit of zero\nhopping the ground state is always a devil's staircase of solid (gapped)\nphases. Such crystalline phases with broken translational symmetry are robust\nwith respect to finite hopping amplitudes. At intermediate hopping amplitudes,\nthese gapped phases melt, giving rise to various lattice supersolid phases,\nwhich can have exotic features with multiple sublattice densities. At\nsufficiently large hoppings the ground state is a superfluid. The stability of\nphases predicted by our approach is gauged by comparison to the known quantum\nphase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions as\nwell as quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the dipolar case on the square\nlattice. Our results are of immediate relevance for experimental realisations\nof self-organised crystalline ordering patterns in analogue quantum simulators,\ne.g., with ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical lattice.",

Results show that this model can\nsuccessfully reproduce the log-growth rate distribution of the considered\nabundance time-series. More significantly, it predicts its temporal dependence,\nby reproducing its kurtosis evolution when the time lag $\\tau$ is increased.\nFurthermore, its typical shape for large $\\tau$ is assessed, verifying that the\ndistribution variance does not diverge with $\\tau$. The simulated processes\ngenerated by the calibrated stochastic equation and the analysis of each\ntime-series, taken one by one, provided additional support for our approach.\nAlternatively, we tried to describe our dataset by using a logistic model with\nan environmental stochastic term. Analytical and numerical results show that\nthis model is not suited for describing the leptokurtic log-growth rates\ndistribution found in our data.

            "summary": "Accurate and robust drug response prediction is of utmost importance in\nprecision medicine. Although many models have been developed to utilize the\nrepresentations of drugs and cancer cell lines for predicting cancer drug\nresponses (CDR), their performances can be improved by addressing issues such\nas insufficient data modality, suboptimal fusion algorithms, and poor\ngeneralizability for novel drugs or cell lines. We introduce TransCDR, which\nuses transfer learning to learn drug representations and fuses multi-modality\nfeatures of drugs and cell lines by a self-attention mechanism, to predict the\nIC50 values or sensitive states of drugs on cell lines. We are the first to\nsystematically evaluate the generalization of the CDR prediction model to novel\n(i.e., never-before-seen) compound scaffolds and cell line clusters. TransCDR\nshows better generalizability than 8 state-of-the-art models. TransCDR\noutperforms its 5 variants that train drug encoders (i.e., RNN and AttentiveFP)\nfrom scratch under various scenarios. The most critical contributors among\nmultiple drug notations and omics profiles are Extended Connectivity\nFingerprint and genetic mutation. Additionally, the attention-based fusion\nmodule further enhances the predictive performance of TransCDR. TransCDR,\ntrained on the GDSC dataset, demonstrates strong predictive performance on the\nexternal testing set CCLE. It is also utilized to predict missing CDRs on GDSC.\nMoreover, we investigate the biological mechanisms underlying drug response by\nclassifying 7,675 patients from TCGA into drug-sensitive or drug-resistant\ngroups, followed by a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. TransCDR emerges as a\npotent tool with significant potential in drug response prediction. The source\ncode and data can be accessed at https://github.com/XiaoqiongXia/TransCDR.",

We obtain a generalized Teukolsky master equation\nfor all spin perturbation fields. The equations are separated into their\nangular and radial parts. The angular equations lead to spin-weighted\nspheroidal harmonic functions that generalize those in Kerr spacetime. We\nidentify an effective spin as a coupling between frequency (or energy) and the\nNUT parameter. The behaviors of the radial wave function near the horizon and\nat the infinite boundary are studied.

Here, we present \"ToSkA: Topological\nSkeleton Analysis\" a method to analyse complex objects by representing their\nshape asymmetries as networks. Using global neighbourhood principles, classic\nnetwork science metrics and spatial feature embedding we are able to create\nunique object profiles for classification. It is also possible to track objects\nover time and extract significantly different shape features between\nexperiments. Importantly, we have incorporated the capacity to measure absolute\nspatial features of objects (e.g., branch lengths). This adds additional layers\nof sensitivity to object classification. Furthermore, because topology is an\ninherent property of system identity, ToSkA is able to identify segmentation\nerrors that alter object topology by observing the emergence or loss of cycles\nin network representations. Combined, the analytics of ToSkA presented here\nallow for the flexibility and in-depth shape profiling necessary for complex\nobjects often observed in biological and physical settings where robust, yet\nprecise, system configuration is essential to downstream processes.",

From the statistical point of\nview, we did not find evidence of such a transition, i.e. deviation from the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM behavior, and from the joint analysis using Planck + BAO\n+ Pantheon+ data, we constrain the graviton mass to $< 6.6 \\times 10^{-34}$ eV\nat 95% CL.

A crucial approach to tackling this\nissue involves transforming vibration signals into health indicators (HI) to\naid model training. This paper presents an end-to-end HI construction method,\nvector quantised variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), which addresses the need for\ndimensionality reduction of latent variables in traditional unsupervised\nlearning methods such as autoencoder. Moreover, concerning the inadequacy of\ntraditional statistical metrics in reflecting curve fluctuations accurately,\ntwo novel statistical metrics, mean absolute distance (MAD) and mean variance\n(MV), are introduced. These metrics accurately depict the fluctuation patterns\nin the curves, thereby indicating the model's accuracy in discerning similar\nfeatures. On the PMH2012 dataset, methods employing VQ-VAE for label\nconstruction achieved lower values for MAD and MV. Furthermore, the ASTCN\nprediction model trained with VQ-VAE labels demonstrated commendable\nperformance, attaining the lowest values for MAD and MV.",

            "summary": "The disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is widely regarded as a\nprominent formation channel of binary black hole (BBH) mergers that can be\ndetected through gravitational waves (GWs). Besides, the presence of dense\nenvironmental gas offers the potential for an embedded BBH merger to produce\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterparts. In this paper, we investigate EM emission\npowered by the kicked remnant of a BBH merger occurring within the AGN disk.\nThe remnant BH will launch a jet via accreting magnetized medium as it\ntraverses the disk. The resulting jet will decelerate and dissipate energy into\na lateral cocoon during its propagation. We explore three radiation mechanisms\nof the jet cocoon system: jet breakout emission, disk cocoon cooling emission,\nand jet cocoon cooling emission, and find that the jet cocoon cooling emission\nis more likely to be detected in its own frequency bands. We predict a soft\nX-ray transient, lasting for O($10^3$) s, to serve as an EM counterpart, of\nwhich the time delay O(10) days after the GW trigger contributes to follow-up\nobservations. Consequently, BBH mergers in the AGN disk represent a novel\nmultimessenger source. In the future, enhanced precision in measuring and\nlocalizing GWs, coupled with diligent searches for such associated EM signal,\nwill effectively validate or restrict the origin of BBH mergers in the AGN\ndisk.",

            "summary": "At the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), we are currently working on the\ndevelopment of a high-precision apparatus with the aim of searching for the\nmuon electric dipole moment (EDM) with unprecedented sensitivity. The\nunderpinning principle of this experiment is the frozen-spin technique, a\nmethod that suppresses the spin precession due to the anomalous magnetic\nmoment, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio for EDM signals. This\nincreased sensitivity facilitates measurements that would be difficult to\nachieve with conventional $g - 2$ muon storage rings. Given the availability of\nthe $p = 125$ MeV/$c$ muon beam at PSI, the anticipated statistical sensitivity\nfor the EDM after a year of data collection is $6\\times 10^{-23}e\\cdot$cm. To\nachieve this goal, it is imperative to meticulously analyse and mitigate any\npotential spurious effects that could mimic EDM signals. In this study, we\npresent a quantitative methodology to evaluate the systematic effects that\nmight arise in the context of employing the frozen-spin technique within a\ncompact storage ring. Our approach entails the analytical derivation of\nequations governing the motion of the muon spin in the electromagnetic (EM)\nfields intrinsic to the experimental setup, validated through subsequent\nnumerical simulations. We also illustrate a method to calculate the cumulative\ngeometric (Berry's) phase. This work complements ongoing experimental efforts\nto detect a muon EDM at PSI and contributes to a broader understanding of\nspin-precession systematic effects.",

            "summary": "Aiming to train and deploy predictive models, organizations collect large\namounts of detailed client data, risking the exposure of private information in\nthe event of a breach. To mitigate this, policymakers increasingly demand\ncompliance with the data minimization (DM) principle, restricting data\ncollection to only that data which is relevant and necessary for the task.\nDespite regulatory pressure, the problem of deploying machine learning models\nthat obey DM has so far received little attention. In this work, we address\nthis challenge in a comprehensive manner. We propose a novel vertical DM (vDM)\nworkflow based on data generalization, which by design ensures that no\nfull-resolution client data is collected during training and deployment of\nmodels, benefiting client privacy by reducing the attack surface in case of a\nbreach. We formalize and study the corresponding problem of finding\ngeneralizations that both maximize data utility and minimize empirical privacy\nrisk, which we quantify by introducing a diverse set of policy-aligned\nadversarial scenarios. Finally, we propose a range of baseline vDM algorithms,\nas well as Privacy-aware Tree (PAT), an especially effective vDM algorithm that\noutperforms all baselines across several settings. We plan to release our code\nas a publicly available library, helping advance the standardization of DM for\nmachine learning. Overall, we believe our work can help lay the foundation for\nfurther exploration and adoption of DM principles in real-world applications.",

In\nhealthcare datasets there is often a small amount of information that is\navailable for a larger number of patients such as an electronic health record,\nhowever a small number of patients may have had extensive further testing.\nCommon solutions such as missing imputation can often be unwise if the smaller\ncohort is significantly different in scale to the larger sample, therefore the\naim of this research is to develop a new method which can model the smaller\ncohort against a particular response, whilst considering the larger cohort\nalso. Motivated by non-parametric models, and specifically flexible smoothing\ntechniques via generalized additive models, we model a twice penalized P-Spline\napproximation method to firstly prevent over/under-fitting of the smaller\ncohort and secondly to consider the larger cohort. This second penalty is\ncreated through discrepancies in the marginal value of covariates that exist in\nboth the smaller and larger cohorts. Through data simulations, parameter\ntunings and model adaptations to consider a continuous and binary response, we\nfind our twice penalized approach offers an enhanced fit over a linear B-Spline\nand once penalized P-Spline approximation. Applying to a real-life dataset\nrelating to a person's risk of developing Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, we see\nan improved model fit performance of over 65%. Areas for future work within\nthis space include adapting our method to not require dimensionality reduction\nand also consider parametric modelling methods. However, to our knowledge this\nis the first work to propose additional marginal penalties in a flexible\nregression of which we can report a vastly improved model fit that is able to\nconsider asymmetric datasets, without the need for missing data imputation.",

However, in practical applications, modeling different features\ntypically involves four main steps: data preparation, data processing, model\nestablishment, evaluation, and optimization. This process is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive. Repeating this workflow for each feature results in abundant\ndevelopment time for tasks and a reduced overall volume of task development.\nIndeed, human mobility data contains a wealth of information. Several\nsuccessful cases suggest that conducting in-depth analysis of population\nmovement data could potentially yield meaningful profiles about users and\nareas. Nonetheless, most related works have not thoroughly utilized the\nsemantic information within human mobility data and trained on a fixed number\nof the regions. To tap into the rich information within population movement,\nbased on the perspective that Regions Are Who walk them, we propose a large\nspatiotemporal model based on trajectories (RAW). It possesses the following\ncharacteristics: 1) Tailored for trajectory data, introducing a GPT-like\nstructure with a parameter count of up to 1B; 2) Introducing a spatiotemporal\nfine-tuning module, interpreting trajectories as collection of users to derive\narbitrary region embedding. This framework allows rapid task development based\non the large spatiotemporal model. We conducted extensive experiments to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed large spatiotemporal model. It's\nevident that our proposed method, relying solely on human mobility data without\nadditional features, exhibits a certain level of relevance in user profiling\nand region analysis.

GTAP is based on eliminating\nneurons in the network based on an estimation of their joint impact on the\nprediction quality through game theoretic solutions.

            "summary": "Extrasolar debris disks are detected by observing dust, which is thought to\nbe released during planetesimal collisions. This implies that planetesimals are\ndynamically excited (\"stirred\"), such that collisions are sufficiently common\nand violent. The most frequently considered stirring mechanisms are\nself-stirring by disk self-gravity, and planet-stirring via secular\ninteractions. However, these models face problems when considering disk mass,\nself-gravity, and planet eccentricity, leading to the possibility that other,\nunexplored mechanisms instead stir debris. We hypothesize that planet-stirring\ncould be more efficient than the traditional secular model implies, due to two\nadditional mechanisms. First, a planet at the inner edge of a debris disk can\nscatter massive bodies onto eccentric, disk-crossing orbits, which then excite\ndebris (\"projectile stirring\"). Second, a planet can stir debris over a wide\nregion via broad mean-motion resonances, both at and between nominal resonance\nlocations (\"resonant stirring\"). Both mechanisms can be effective even for\nlow-eccentricity planets, unlike secular-planet-stirring. We run N-body\nsimulations across a broad parameter space, to determine the viability of these\nnew stirring mechanisms. We quantify stirring levels using a bespoke program\nfor assessing Rebound debris simulations, which we make publicly available. We\nfind that even low-mass projectiles can stir disks, and verify this with a\nsimple analytic criterion. We also show that resonant stirring is effective for\nplanets above ~0.5 MJup. By proving that these mechanisms can increase\nplanet-stirring efficiency, we demonstrate that planets could still be stirring\ndebris disks even in cases where conventional (secular) planet-stirring is\ninsufficient.",

Excitability has recently drawn increasing interest in optics, as it\nis key to realize all-optical artificial neurons enabling speed-of-light\ninformation processing. However, the realization of all-optical excitable units\nand networks remains challenging. Here we demonstrate how laser-driven optical\ncavities with memory in their nonlinear response can sustain excitability\nbeyond the constraints of memoryless systems. First we demonstrate different\nclasses of excitability and spiking, and their control in a single cavity with\nmemory. This single-cavity excitability is limited to a narrow range of memory\ntimes commensurate with the linear dissipation time. To overcome this\nlimitation, we explore coupled cavities with memory. We demonstrate that this\nsystem can exhibit excitability for arbitrarily long memory times, even when\nthe inter-cavity coupling rate is smaller than the dissipation rate. Our\ncoupled-cavity system also sustains spike trains -- a hallmark of neurons --\nthat spontaneously break mirror symmetry. Our predictions can be readily tested\nin thermo-optical cavities, where thermal dynamics effectively give memory to\nthe nonlinear optical response. The huge separation between thermal and optical\ntime scales in such cavities is promising for the realization of artificial\nneurons that can self-organize to the edge of a phase transition, like many\nbiological systems do.",

These mechanisms lead to intriguing TeV collider\nsignatures and the possibility of detecting mHz GWs in future experiments. In\nsummary, this study provides a strong motivation for advancing GW experiments\nthat can bridge the $\\mu$Hz frequency gap in the GW spectrum.

The field of natural language processing (NLP) has recently\nexperienced a surge in the development of powerful language models.

Previous studies have demonstrated\nthat the features of language models can be mapped to fMRI brain activity. This\nraises the question: is there a commonality between information processing in\nlanguage models and the human brain? To estimate information flow patterns in a\nlanguage model, we examined the causal relationships between different layers.\nDrawing inspiration from the workspace framework for consciousness, we\nhypothesized that features integrating more information would more accurately\npredict higher hierarchical brain activity. To validate this hypothesis, we\nclassified language model features into two categories based on causal network\nmeasures: 'low in-degree' and 'high in-degree'. We subsequently compared the\nbrain prediction accuracy maps for these two groups. Our results reveal that\nthe difference in prediction accuracy follows a hierarchical pattern,\nconsistent with the cortical hierarchy map revealed by activity time constants.\nThis finding suggests a parallel between how language models and the human\nbrain process linguistic information.",

            "summary": "Medical image segmentation annotations exhibit variations among experts due\nto the ambiguous boundaries of segmented objects and backgrounds in medical\nimages. Although using multiple annotations for each image in the\nfully-supervised has been extensively studied for training deep models,\nobtaining a large amount of multi-annotated data is challenging due to the\nsubstantial time and manpower costs required for segmentation annotations,\nresulting in most images lacking any annotations. To address this, we propose\nMulti-annotated Semi-supervised Ensemble Networks (MSE-Nets) for learning\nsegmentation from limited multi-annotated and abundant unannotated data.\nSpecifically, we introduce the Network Pairwise Consistency Enhancement (NPCE)\nmodule and Multi-Network Pseudo Supervised (MNPS) module to enhance MSE-Nets\nfor the segmentation task by considering two major factors: (1) to optimize the\nutilization of all accessible multi-annotated data, the NPCE separates\n(dis)agreement annotations of multi-annotated data at the pixel level and\nhandles agreement and disagreement annotations in different ways, (2) to\nmitigate the introduction of imprecise pseudo-labels, the MNPS extends the\ntraining data by leveraging consistent pseudo-labels from unannotated data.\nFinally, we improve confidence calibration by averaging the predictions of base\nnetworks. Experiments on the ISIC dataset show that we reduced the demand for\nmulti-annotated data by 97.75\\% and narrowed the gap with the best\nfully-supervised baseline to just a Jaccard index of 4\\%. Furthermore, compared\nto other semi-supervised methods that rely only on a single annotation or a\ncombined fusion approach, the comprehensive experimental results on ISIC and\nRIGA datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in\nmedical image segmentation with ambiguous boundaries.",

This theoretical framework\nhas already been successfully applied in various tetra- and penta-quark\nsystems. In the complete coupled-channel case, and within the complex-range\nformulation, several narrow resonances of $\\bar{q}q\\bar{s}c$ and\n$\\bar{q}q\\bar{s}b$ systems are obtained in each allowed $I(J^P)$-channels.\nParticularly, the $T_{c\\bar{s}}(2900)$ is well identified as a $I(J^P)=1(0^+)$\n$\\bar{q}q\\bar{s}c$ tetraquark state with a dominant molecular structure.\nMeanwhile, more resonances in $\\bar{q}q\\bar{s}c$ and $\\bar{q}q\\bar{s}b$ systems\nare also obtained within the energy regions $2.4-3.4$ GeV and $5.7-6.7$ GeV,\nrespectively.

In this paper,\nwe propose an adaptive modeling approach for row-type dependent predictive\nanalysis(RTDPA). Our framework enables the development of models that can\neffectively handle diverse row types within a single dataset. Our dataset from\nXXX bank contains two different risk categories, personal loan and agriculture\nloan. each of them are categorised into four classes standard, sub-standard,\ndoubtful and loss. We performed tailored data pre processing and feature\nengineering to different row types. We selected traditional machine learning\npredictive models and advanced ensemble techniques. Our findings indicate that\nall predictive approaches consistently achieve a precision rate of no less than\n90%. For RTDPA, the algorithms are applied separately for each row type,\nallowing the models to capture the specific patterns and characteristics of\neach row type. This approach enables targeted predictions based on the row\ntype, providing a more accurate and tailored classification for the given\ndataset.Additionally, the suggested model consistently offers decision makers\nvaluable and enduring insights that are strategic in nature in banking sector.",

            "summary": "Deploying data-driven disruption predictors across different tokamak devices\nis challenging due to their inherent differences. This study addresses some\nchallenges of cross-tokamak deployment for data-driven plasma disruption\npredictors. Current predictors primarily employ supervised learning methods and\nrequire a balanced dataset of disruption and non-disruption shots. However,\nobtaining disruption shots for future tokamaks is extremely costly, resulting\nin imbalanced training datasets. Imbalance leads to reduced or even ineffective\nperformance of supervised learning predictors. To solve this problem, we\npropose the Enhanced Convolutional Autoencoder Anomaly Detection (E-CAAD)\npredictor, which can be trained using disruption precursor samples when\ndisruption shots occur. This model not only overcomes the sample imbalance\nproblem in supervised learning predictors but also overcomes the inefficient\ndataset utilization faced by traditional anomaly detection predictors that\ncannot use disruption precursor samples for training, making it more suitable\nfor the unpredictable datasets of future tokamaks. Compared to traditional\nanomaly detection predictor, the E-CAAD predictor performs better in disruption\nprediction and is deployed faster on new devices. Additionally, we explore\nstrategies to accelerate deployment of E-CAAD predictor on the new device by\nusing data from existing devices, with a focus on achieving good performance\nusing minimal new device data during the initial operation stages. Two\ndeployment strategies are presented: mixing data from existing devices and\nfine-tuning the predictor trained on existing devices. Our comparisons indicate\nthat rational utilization of data from existing devices expedites deployment.\nNotably, the fine-tuning strategy yields the fastest deployment on new device\namong the proposed strategies.",
