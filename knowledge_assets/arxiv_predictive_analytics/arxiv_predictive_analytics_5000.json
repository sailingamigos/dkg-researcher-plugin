            "summary": "There is a need for compact, dynamically tunable nonreciprocal optical\nelements to enable on-chip-compatible optical isolators and more efficient\nradiative energy transfer systems. Plasmon Fizeau drag, the drag of electrical\ncurrent on propagating surface plasmon polaritons, has been proposed to induce\nnonreciprocal surface modes to enable one-way energy transport. However,\nrelativistic electron drift velocities are required to induce appreciable\ncontrast between the dispersion characteristics of co-propagating and\ncounter-propagating surface plasmon modes. The high electron drift velocity of\ngraphene previously allowed for the experimental demonstration of\ncurrent-induced nonreciprocity in a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac material. The\nhigh electron drift and Fermi velocities in three-dimensional (3D) Dirac\nmaterials make them ideal candidates for the effect, however, both the theory\nof the Fizeau drag effect and its experimental demonstrations in 3D Dirac\nmaterials are missing. Here we develop a comprehensive theory of Fizeau drag in\nDC-biased 3D Weyl semimetals (WSM) or Dirac semimetals (DSM), both under local\nand non-local approximation and with dissipative losses. We predict that under\npractical assumptions for loss, Fizeau drag in the DSM Cd$_3$As$_2$ opens\nwindows of pseudo-unidirectional transport. We additionally introduce new\nfigures of merit to rank nonreciprocal plasmonic systems by their potential for\ndirectional SPP transport. Further, we propose a new approach for achieving\nappreciable plasmonic Fizeau drag via optically pumping bulk inversion symmetry\nbreaking WSMs or DSMs.",

The results are applied to analytically describe\nwave-optical imaging via Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction, leading to, e.g., the\nformation of observable black hole shadows. A comparison to the ray-optical\ndescription is given, providing new insights into wave-optical effects and\nproperties. On a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime, the cosmological constant changes\nthe singularity structure of the Teukolsky equation and allows for an\nanalytical, exact solution via a transformation into the Heun's differential\nequation, which is the most general, second-order differential equation with\nfour regular singularities. The scattering of waves originating from a point\nsource involves a solution in terms of the so-called Heun's function $Hf$. It\nis used to find angular solutions, which form a complete set of orthonormal\nfunctions similar to the spherical harmonics. Our approach allows to solve the\nscattering problem while taking into account the complex interplay of Heun's\nfunctions around local singularities.",

Using both an analytical model and numerical N-body simulations, we\nshow that the lowest velocity impacts occur onto planets in tightly-packed\nplanetary systems around high-mass (i.e. Solar-mass) stars, enabling the intact\ndelivery of complex organic molecules. Impacts onto planets around low-mass\nstars are found to be very sensitive to the planetary architecture, with the\nsurvival of complex prebiotic molecules potentially impossible in\nloosely-packed systems. Rocky planets around M-dwarfs also suffer significantly\nmore high velocity impacts, potentially posing unique challenges for life on\nthese planets.

The machine learning\nmodel we adopted was the Support Vector Regression (SVR). We performed accuracy\nthrough offline assessment and carried out feature selection and parameter\ntuning. Although overall dataset provided consists of 100,000 users trajectory,\nour method use only 20,000 target users data, and do not need to use other\n80,000 data. Despite the personalized model's traditional feature engineering\napproach, this model yields reasonably good accuracy with lower computational\ncost.",

Using high-resolution videos of the nematode worm $C.\nelegans$, we show that a single dynamics connects posture-scale fluctuations\nwith trajectory diffusion, and longer-lived behavioral states. We take short\nposture sequences as an instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence\nlength for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture sequences we\nconstruct a fine-scale, maximum entropy partition so that transitions among\nmicrostates define a high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means\nof principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into movement using\nresistive force theory, capturing the statistical properties of foraging\ntrajectories. Predictive across scales, we leverage the longest-lived\neigenvectors of the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision of\nthe worm's foraging behavior, revealing both ``runs-and-pirouettes'' as well as\npreviously uncharacterized finer-scale behaviors. We use our model to\ninvestigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for foraging success,\nrecovering a trade-off between local and global search strategies.",

            "summary": "The central topic of this letter is to show that light-matter hybridization\nnot only gives rise to novel dynamic responses but can also modify\nintermolecular interactions and induce new structural order. Using the van der\nWaals (vdW) system in an optical cavity as an example, we predict the effects\nof interference and collectivity in cavity-induced many-body dispersion\ninteractions. Specifically, the leading order correction due to cavity-induced\nquantum fluctuations leads to 3-body and 4-body vdW interactions, which can\nalign intermolecular vectors and are not pairwise additive. In addition, the\ncavity-induced dipole leads to a single-molecule energy shift that aligns\nindividual molecules, and a pair-wise interaction that scales as $R^{-3}$\ninstead of the standard $R^{-6}$ distance scaling. The coefficients of all\nthese cavity-induced corrections depend on the cavity frequency and are\nrenormalized by the effective Rabi frequency, which in turn depends on the\nparticle density. Finally, we study the interaction of the vdW system in a\ncavity with an external object and find a significant enhancement in the\ninteraction range due to modified distance scaling laws. These theoretical\npredictions suggest the possibility of cavity-induced nematic or smectic order\nand may provide an essential clue to understanding intriguing phenomena\nobserved in optical cavities, such as strongly-modified ground-state\nreactivity, ion transport and solvent polarity.",

For some therapies, it is not possible to predict patients' responses,\npotentially exposing them to the adverse effects of treatment without any\ntherapeutic benefit. As part of the automated prediction of treatment\neffectiveness in ovarian cancer using histopathological images (ATEC23)\nchallenge, we evaluated the effectiveness of deep learning to predict whether a\ncourse of treatment including the antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab could\ncontribute to remission or prevent disease progression for at least 6 months in\na set of 282 histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) from 78 ovarian cancer\npatients. Our approach used a pretrained Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer\n(HIPT) to extract region-level features and an attention-based multiple\ninstance learning (ABMIL) model to aggregate features and classify whole\nslides. The optimal HIPT-ABMIL model had an internal balanced accuracy of 60.2%\n+- 2.9% and an AUC of 0.646 +- 0.033. Histopathology-specific model pretraining\nwas found to be beneficial to classification performance, though hierarchical\ntransformers were not, with a ResNet feature extractor achieving similar\nperformance. Due to the dataset being small and highly heterogeneous,\nperformance was variable across 5-fold cross-validation folds, and there were\nsome extreme differences between validation and test set performance within\nfolds. The model did not generalise well to tissue microarrays, with accuracy\nworse than random chance. It is not yet clear whether ovarian cancer WSIs\ncontain information that can be used to accurately predict treatment response,\nwith further validation using larger, higher-quality datasets required.",

Rotationally constrained convection has been invoked to explain\nthe lack of large-scale power in observations of solar flows. Aims: The main\naims are to quantify the effects of rotation on the scale of convective eddies\nand velocity, the depths of convective overshoot, and the subadiabatic\nDeardorff layers. Methods: Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\nrotating convection in Cartesian domains were run. The results were compared\nwith theoretical scaling results that assume a balance between Coriolis,\ninertial, and buoyancy (Archemedean) forces (CIA balance). Results: The scale\nof convective eddies decreases as rotation increases, and ultimately reaches a\nrotationally constrained regime consistent with the CIA balance. Using a new\nmeasure of the rotational influence on the system, it is shown that even the\ndeep parts of the solar convection zone are not in the rotationally constrained\nregime. The simulations capture the slowly and rapidly rotating scaling laws\npredicted by theory, and the Sun appears to be in between these two regimes.\nBoth, the overshooting depth and the extent of the Deardorff layer, decrease as\nrotation becomes more rapid. For sufficiently rapid rotation the Deardorff\nlayer is absent. Conclusions: Relating the simulations with the Sun suggests\nthat the convective scale even in the deep parts of the Sun is only mildly\naffected by rotation and that some other mechanism is needed to explain the\nlack of strong large-scale flows in the Sun. Taking the current results at face\nvalue, the overshoot and Deardorff layers are estimated to span roughly five\nper cent of the pressure scale height at the base of the convection zone in the\nSun.",

In practical physical modeling within these\ndomains, the systems often generate high-index DAEs. Classical implicit\nnumerical methods typically result in varying order reduction of numerical\naccuracy when solving high-index systems.~Recently, the physics-informed neural\nnetwork (PINN) has gained attention for solving DAE systems. However, it faces\nchallenges like the inability to directly solve high-index systems, lower\npredictive accuracy, and weaker generalization capabilities. In this paper, we\npropose a PINN computational framework, combined Radau IIA numerical method\nwith a neural network structure via the attention mechanisms, to directly solve\nhigh-index DAEs. Furthermore, we employ a domain decomposition strategy to\nenhance solution accuracy. We conduct numerical experiments with two classical\nhigh-index systems as illustrative examples, investigating how different orders\nof the Radau IIA method affect the accuracy of neural network solutions. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the PINN based on a 5th-order Radau IIA\nmethod achieves the highest level of system accuracy. Specifically, the\nabsolute errors for all differential variables remains as low as $10^{-6}$, and\nthe absolute errors for algebraic variables is maintained at $10^{-5}$,\nsurpassing the results found in existing literature. Therefore, our method\nexhibits excellent computational accuracy and strong generalization\ncapabilities, providing a feasible approach for the high-precision solution of\nlarger-scale DAEs with higher indices or challenging high-dimensional partial\ndifferential algebraic equation systems.",

In this paper, we show how\nexisting methods in explainability can be extended to uncertainty-aware models\nand how such extensions can be used to understand the sources of uncertainty in\na model's predictive distribution. In particular, by adapting permutation\nfeature importance, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional\nexpectation plots, we demonstrate that novel insights into model behaviour may\nbe obtained and that these methods can be used to measure the impact of\nfeatures on both the entropy of the predictive distribution and the\nlog-likelihood of the ground truth labels under that distribution.

            "summary": "It is commonly believed that accretion discs are truncated and their inner\nregions are described by advection dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) in the\nhard spectral state of black hole X-ray binaries. However, the increasing\noccurrence of a relativistically blurred Fe K$\\alpha$ line together with a hard\ncontinuum points to the existence of a thin disc located near the innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO). Assuming the accretion in the hard state is via\nan ADAF extending to near 100 Schwarzschild radii, which is supplied by either\na stellar wind from a companion star or resulting from an evaporated disc, we\nstudy the possible condensation of the hot gas during its accretion towards the\nblack hole. It is found that a small fraction of the ADAF condenses into a cold\ndisc as a consequence of efficient radiative cooling at small distances,\nforming a disc-corona configuration near the ISCO. This takes place for low\naccretion rates corresponding to luminosities ranging from $\\sim 10^{-3}$ to a\nfew per cent of the Eddington luminosity. The coexistence of the weak inner\ndisc and the dominant hot accretion flow provides a natural explanation of the\nbroad K$\\alpha$ line in the hard state. Detailed computations demonstrate that\nsuch accretion flows produce a hard X-ray spectrum accompanied by a weak disc\ncomponent with a negative correlation between the 2-10 keV photon index and the\nEddington ratio. The predicted spectrum of Cygnus X-1 and the correlation\nbetween the photon index and the Eddington ratio are in good agreement with\nobservations.",

We propose to learn a coherent forecast for millions of\ntime series with a single bottom-level forecast model by using a sparse loss\nfunction that directly optimizes the hierarchical product and/or temporal\nstructure. The benefit of our sparse hierarchical loss function is that it\nprovides practitioners a method of producing bottom-level forecasts that are\ncoherent to any chosen cross-sectional or temporal hierarchy. In addition,\nremoving the need for a post-processing step as required in traditional\nhierarchical forecasting techniques reduces the computational cost of the\nprediction phase in the forecasting pipeline. On the public M5 dataset, our\nsparse hierarchical loss function performs up to 10% (RMSE) better compared to\nthe baseline loss function. We implement our sparse hierarchical loss function\nwithin an existing forecasting model at bol, a large European e-commerce\nplatform, resulting in an improved forecasting performance of 2% at the product\nlevel. Finally, we found an increase in forecasting performance of about 5-10%\nwhen evaluating the forecasting performance across the cross-sectional\nhierarchies that we defined.

In the context of machine learning (ML), one can use\ncause-to-effect analysis to understand the reason for the biased behavior of\nthe system. For example, we can examine the root causes of biases by checking\neach feature for a potential cause of bias in the model. To approach this, one\ncan apply small changes to a given feature or a pair of features in the data,\nfollowing some guidelines and observing how it impacts the decision made by the\nmodel (i.e., model prediction). Therefore, we can use cause-to-effect analysis\nto identify the potential bias-inducing features, even when these features are\noriginally are unknown. This is important since most current methods require a\npre-identification of sensitive features for bias assessment and can actually\nmiss other relevant bias-inducing features, which is why systematic\nidentification of such features is necessary. Moreover, it often occurs that to\nachieve an equitable outcome, one has to take into account sensitive features\nin the model decision. Therefore, it should be up to the domain experts to\ndecide based on their knowledge of the context of a decision whether bias\ninduced by specific features is acceptable or not.

            "summary": "Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive molecule understanding\nability on various 1D text-related tasks. However, they inherently lack 2D\ngraph perception - a critical ability of human professionals in comprehending\nmolecules' topological structures. To bridge this gap, we propose MolCA:\nMolecular Graph-Language Modeling with Cross-Modal Projector and Uni-Modal\nAdapter. MolCA enables an LM (e.g., Galactica) to understand both text- and\ngraph-based molecular contents via the cross-modal projector. Specifically, the\ncross-modal projector is implemented as a Q-Former to connect a graph encoder's\nrepresentation space and an LM's text space. Further, MolCA employs a uni-modal\nadapter (i.e., LoRA) for the LM's efficient adaptation to downstream tasks.\nUnlike previous studies that couple an LM with a graph encoder via cross-modal\ncontrastive learning, MolCA retains the LM's ability of open-ended text\ngeneration and augments it with 2D graph information. To showcase its\neffectiveness, we extensively benchmark MolCA on tasks of molecule captioning,\nIUPAC name prediction, and molecule-text retrieval, on which MolCA\nsignificantly outperforms the baselines.

            "summary": "The chemical fingerprint of a planet reveals information about its formation\nhistory regarding when and where it formed. The water content of a planet can\nhelp to constrain its formation pathway: If the planet formed in the outer\nregions of the disk and migrated inward, it will be water-rich due to the\naccretion of water-ice-rich solids. Conversely, formation in the inner disk,\nwhere water-ice is not available, will result in a smaller atmospheric water\ncontent due to the limited accretion of water vapor. This process complicates\nwith the presence of gap-opening giant planets. A gas giant exerts a pressure\nbump exterior to its orbit, preventing the further influx of pebbles into the\ninner system, resulting in a water-poor environment. The different formation\nscenarios can help to constrain the formation of the HAT-P-11 system, which\ncontains an inner sub-Neptune with a mass of 23.4 $\\mathrm{M_{\\oplus}}$ and\nsubstellar water abundances ($X_\\mathrm{H_2O} \\approx 0.11$), as well as an\nouter giant planet orbiting exterior to the water-ice line. Our planet\nformation model encompasses planetary growth through pebble and gas accretion,\nalong with a pebble drift and evaporation module that enables us to track the\nchemical composition of the disk and the planets. We find that the presence of\nthe gas giant is necessary to block water-ice-rich material, resulting in a\nsubstellar water content for the inner sub-Neptune. If the giant planet forms\ntoo early, not enough solid material can enter the inner disk regions,\npreventing the efficient growth of the inner planet. This highlights the\nimportance of the timing of giant planet formation to explain the inner system\nstructure. Our simulations predict a roughly stellar C/O ratio with\nsuperstellar C/H and O/H for HAT-P-11b, providing constraints for future\nobservations that are essential for gaining a more detailed understanding of\nits formation.",

            "summary": "Existing works have made great progress in improving adversarial robustness,\nbut typically test their method only on data from the same distribution as the\ntraining data, i.e. in-distribution (ID) testing. As a result, it is unclear\nhow such robustness generalizes under input distribution shifts, i.e.\nout-of-distribution (OOD) testing. This is a concerning omission as such\ndistribution shifts are unavoidable when methods are deployed in the wild. To\naddress this issue we propose a benchmark named OODRobustBench to\ncomprehensively assess OOD adversarial robustness using 23 dataset-wise shifts\n(i.e. naturalistic shifts in input distribution) and 6 threat-wise shifts\n(i.e., unforeseen adversarial threat models). OODRobustBench is used to assess\n706 robust models using 60.7K adversarial evaluations. This large-scale\nanalysis shows that: 1) adversarial robustness suffers from a severe OOD\ngeneralization issue; 2) ID robustness correlates strongly with OOD robustness,\nin a positive linear way, under many distribution shifts. The latter enables\nthe prediction of OOD robustness from ID robustness. Based on this, we are able\nto predict the upper limit of OOD robustness for existing robust training\nschemes. The results suggest that achieving OOD robustness requires designing\nnovel methods beyond the conventional ones. Last, we discover that extra data,\ndata augmentation, advanced model architectures and particular regularization\napproaches can improve OOD robustness. Noticeably, the discovered training\nschemes, compared to the baseline, exhibit dramatically higher robustness under\nthreat shift while keeping high ID robustness, demonstrating new promising\nsolutions for robustness against both multi-attack and unforeseen attacks.",

Black-box\nprompt search has received growing interest recently for its distinctive\nproperties of gradient-free optimization, proven particularly useful and\npowerful for model-as-a-service usage. However, the discrete nature and the\ncomplexity of combinatorial optimization hinder the efficiency of modern\nblack-box approaches. Despite extensive research on search algorithms, the\ncrucial aspect of search space design and optimization has been largely\noverlooked. In this paper, we first conduct a sensitivity analysis by prompting\nLLM, revealing that only a small number of tokens exert a disproportionate\namount of influence on LLM predictions. Leveraging this insight, we propose the\nClustering and Pruning for Efficient Black-box Prompt Search (ClaPS), a simple\nblack-box search method that first clusters and prunes the search space to\nfocus exclusively on influential prompt tokens. By employing even simple search\nmethods within the pruned search space, ClaPS achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various tasks and LLMs, surpassing the performance of\ncomplex approaches while significantly reducing search costs.

This dichotomy is further exacerbated by a prevalent dependency on\npotentially noisy data sources. Specifically, many models utilize patches\nintegrated with Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) that, unfortunately, may contain\nparsing inaccuracies, thus acting as a suboptimal source of supervision. In\nresponse to these challenges, we introduce PATCH-CLIP, a novel pre-training\nframework for patches and natural language text. PATCH-CLIP deploys a\ntriple-loss training strategy for 1) patch-description contrastive learning,\nwhich enables to separate patches and descriptions in the embedding space, 2)\npatch-description matching, which ensures that each patch is associated to its\ndescription in the embedding space, and 3) patch-description generation, which\nensures that the patch embedding is effective for generation. These losses are\nimplemented for joint learning to achieve good performance in both predictive\nand generative tasks involving patches. Empirical evaluations focusing on patch\ndescription generation, demonstrate that PATCH-CLIP sets new state of the art\nperformance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art in metrics like\nBLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and Recall.",

In this work, we train, evaluate, interpret, and control\nBackpack language models in character-tokenized Chinese, in which words are\noften composed of many characters. We find that our (134M parameter) Chinese\nBackpack language model performs comparably to a (104M parameter) Transformer,\nand learns rich character-level meanings that log-additively compose to form\nword meanings. In SimLex-style lexical semantic evaluations, simple averages of\nBackpack character senses outperform input embeddings from a Transformer.

            "summary": "Manifold learning flows are a class of generative modelling techniques that\nassume a low-dimensional manifold description of the data. The embedding of\nsuch a manifold into the high-dimensional space of the data is achieved via\nlearnable invertible transformations. Therefore, once the manifold is properly\naligned via a reconstruction loss, the probability density is tractable on the\nmanifold and maximum likelihood can be used to optimize the network parameters.\nNaturally, the lower-dimensional representation of the data requires an\ninjective-mapping. Recent approaches were able to enforce that the density\naligns with the modelled manifold, while efficiently calculating the density\nvolume-change term when embedding to the higher-dimensional space. However,\nunless the injective-mapping is analytically predefined, the learned manifold\nis not necessarily an efficient representation of the data. Namely, the latent\ndimensions of such models frequently learn an entangled intrinsic basis, with\ndegenerate information being stored in each dimension. Alternatively, if a\nlocally orthogonal and/or sparse basis is to be learned, here coined canonical\nintrinsic basis, it can serve in learning a more compact latent space\nrepresentation. Toward this end, we propose a canonical manifold learning flow\nmethod, where a novel optimization objective enforces the transformation matrix\nto have few prominent and non-degenerate basis functions. We demonstrate that\nby minimizing the off-diagonal manifold metric elements $\\ell_1$-norm, we can\nachieve such a basis, which is simultaneously sparse and/or orthogonal.\nCanonical manifold flow yields a more efficient use of the latent space,\nautomatically generating fewer prominent and distinct dimensions to represent\ndata, and a better approximation of target distributions than other manifold\nflow methods in most experiments we conducted, resulting in lower FID scores.",

Several\nnumerical cases are conducted to intensively verify the proposed solution by\nexamining boundary conditions and comparing with existing solutions, and all\nthe results are in good agreements.

However, inaccurate motion vector (MV)\nusually lead to the distortion of reconstructed frame. In addition, most\napproaches ignore the spatial and channel redundancy. To solve above problems,\nwe propose a motion-aware and spatial-temporal-channel contextual coding based\nvideo compression network (MASTC-VC), which learns the latent representation\nand uses variational autoencoders (VAEs) to capture the characteristics of\nintra-frame pixels and inter-frame motion. Specifically, we design a multiscale\nmotion-aware module (MS-MAM) to estimate spatial-temporal-channel consistent\nmotion vector by utilizing the multiscale motion prediction information in a\ncoarse-to-fine way. On the top of it, we further propose a\nspatial-temporal-channel contextual module (STCCM), which explores the\ncorrelation of latent representation to reduce the bit consumption from\nspatial, temporal and channel aspects respectively. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that our proposed MASTC-VC is surprior to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods on three public benchmark datasets.

This formalization makes it\npossible to address both the representation and the computation of uncertainty.\nBuilding on recent advances in supervised phonological reconstruction, during\nwhich an algorithm learns how to reconstruct words in a given proto-language\nrelying on previously annotated data, and inspired by improved methods for\nautomated word prediction from cognate sets, we present a new framework that\nallows for the representation of uncertainty in linguistic reconstruction and\nalso includes a workflow for the computation of fuzzy reconstructions from\nlinguistic data.",

Although the\nluminal and superluminal modulations are unconditionally transparent for the\nincident radiation, they both can reflect.

In this study, we propose a novel privacypreserving image\nclassification scheme that enables the direct application of classifiers\ntrained in the plaintext domain to classify encrypted images, without the need\nof retraining a dedicated classifier. Moreover, encrypted images can be\ndecrypted back into their original form with high fidelity (recoverable) using\na secret key. Specifically, our proposed scheme involves utilizing a feature\nextractor and an encoder to mask the plaintext image through a newly designed\nNoise-like Adversarial Example (NAE). Such an NAE not only introduces a\nnoise-like visual appearance to the encrypted image but also compels the target\nclassifier to predict the ciphertext as the same label as the original\nplaintext image. At the decoding phase, we adopt a Symmetric Residual Learning\n(SRL) framework for restoring the plaintext image with minimal degradation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that 1) the classification accuracy of the\nclassifier trained in the plaintext domain remains the same in both the\nciphertext and plaintext domains; 2) the encrypted images can be recovered into\ntheir original form with an average PSNR of up to 51+ dB for the SVHN dataset\nand 48+ dB for the VGGFace2 dataset; 3) our system exhibits satisfactory\ngeneralization capability on the encryption, decryption and classification\ntasks across datasets that are different from the training one; and 4) a\nhigh-level of security is achieved against three potential threat models.

            "summary": "Generative probabilistic models emerge as a new paradigm in data-driven,\nevolution-informed design of biomolecular sequences. This paper introduces a\nnovel approach, called Edge Activation Direct Coupling Analysis (eaDCA),\ntailored to the characteristics of RNA sequences, with a strong emphasis on\nsimplicity, efficiency, and interpretability. eaDCA explicitly constructs\nsparse coevolutionary models for RNA families, achieving performance levels\ncomparable to more complex methods while utilizing a significantly lower number\nof parameters. Our approach demonstrates efficiency in generating artificial\nRNA sequences that closely resemble their natural counterparts in both\nstatistical analyses and SHAPE-MaP experiments, and in predicting the effect of\nmutations. Notably, eaDCA provides a unique feature: estimating the number of\npotential functional sequences within a given RNA family. For example, in the\ncase of cyclic di-AMP riboswitches (RF00379), our analysis suggests the\nexistence of approximately $\\mathbf{10^{39}}$ functional nucleotide sequences.\nWhile huge compared to the known $< \\mathbf{4,000}$ natural sequences, this\nnumber represents only a tiny fraction of the vast pool of nearly\n$\\mathbf{10^{82}}$ possible nucleotide sequences of the same length (136\nnucleotides). These results underscore the promise of sparse and interpretable\ngenerative models, such as eaDCA, in enhancing our understanding of the\nexpansive RNA sequence space.",

            "summary": "Previous motion generation methods are limited to the pre-rigged 3D human\nmodel, hindering their applications in the animation of various non-rigged\ncharacters. In this work, we present TapMo, a Text-driven Animation Pipeline\nfor synthesizing Motion in a broad spectrum of skeleton-free 3D characters. The\npivotal innovation in TapMo is its use of shape deformation-aware features as a\ncondition to guide the diffusion model, thereby enabling the generation of\nmesh-specific motions for various characters. Specifically, TapMo comprises two\nmain components - Mesh Handle Predictor and Shape-aware Diffusion Module. Mesh\nHandle Predictor predicts the skinning weights and clusters mesh vertices into\nadaptive handles for deformation control, which eliminates the need for\ntraditional skeletal rigging. Shape-aware Motion Diffusion synthesizes motion\nwith mesh-specific adaptations. This module employs text-guided motions and\nmesh features extracted during the first stage, preserving the geometric\nintegrity of the animations by accounting for the character's shape and\ndeformation. Trained in a weakly-supervised manner, TapMo can accommodate a\nmultitude of non-human meshes, both with and without associated text motions.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TapMo through rigorous\nqualitative and quantitative experiments. Our results reveal that TapMo\nconsistently outperforms existing auto-animation methods, delivering\nsuperior-quality animations for both seen or unseen heterogeneous 3D\ncharacters.",

            "summary": "Automatic methods for early detection of breast cancer on mammography can\nsignificantly decrease mortality. Broad uptake of those methods in hospitals is\ncurrently hindered because the methods have too many constraints. They assume\nannotations available for single images or even regions-of-interest (ROIs), and\na fixed number of images per patient. Both assumptions do not hold in a general\nhospital setting. Relaxing those assumptions results in a weakly supervised\nlearning setting, where labels are available per case, but not for individual\nimages or ROIs. Not all images taken for a patient contain malignant regions\nand the malignant ROIs cover only a tiny part of an image, whereas most image\nregions represent benign tissue. In this work, we investigate a two-level\nmulti-instance learning (MIL) approach for case-level breast cancer prediction\non two public datasets (1.6k and 5k cases) and an in-house dataset of 21k\ncases. Observing that breast cancer is usually only present in one side, while\nimages of both breasts are taken as a precaution, we propose a domain-specific\nMIL pooling variant. We show that two-level MIL can be applied in realistic\nclinical settings where only case labels, and a variable number of images per\npatient are available. Data in realistic settings scales with continuous\npatient intake, while manual annotation efforts do not. Hence, research should\nfocus in particular on unsupervised ROI extraction, in order to improve breast\ncancer prediction for all patients.",

Essential to many of these\napplications is the control of the comb's defining parameters, i.e.,\ncarrier-envelope offset frequency and repetition rate. An elegant and\nall-optical approach to controlling both degrees of freedom is the suitable\ninjection of a secondary continuous-wave laser into the resonator onto which\none of the comb lines locks. Here, we study experimentally such sideband\ninjection locking in microresonator soliton combs across a wide optical\nbandwidth and derive analytic scaling laws for the locking range and repetition\nrate control. As an application example, we demonstrate optical frequency\ndivision and repetition rate phase-noise reduction to three orders of magnitude\nbelow the noise of a free-running system. The presented results can guide the\ndesign of sideband injection-locked, parametrically generated frequency combs\nwith opportunities for low-noise microwave generation, compact optical clocks\nwith simplified locking schemes and more generally, all-optically stabilized\nfrequency combs from Kerr-nonlinear resonators.",

In previous works we presented\nanalytic approximations to the RSET, obtained by dimensional reduction,\navailable in spherical symmetry, and showed that the backreaction-generated\nsolutions described ultracompact fluid spheres with a negative mass interior.\nHere, we derive a novel approximation to the RSET that does not rely on\ndimensional reduction, but rather on a perturbative reduction of the\ndifferential order. This approximation also leads to regular stars surpassing\nthe Buchdahl limit. We conclude that this is a consequence of the negative\nenergies associated with the Boulware vacuum which, for sufficiently compact\nfluid spheres, make the Misner-Sharp mass negative near the centre of spherical\nsymmetry.

It is also necessary\nto study the role of radiative thermal conductivity, which may play an\nimportant role for such large particles. We investigated layers constructed\nfrom large aggregates and having various thicknesses and porosity and evaluated\nthe effective sublimation of water ice at different heliocentric distances. For\nradiative conductivity, approximate commonly used models and the complicated\nmodel based on the Dense Medium Radiative Transfer theory were compared. It was\nshown that for millimetre-size aggregates careful consideration of the\nradiative thermal conductivity is required since this mechanism of energy\ntransfer may change the resulting gas productivity by several times. We\ndemonstrate that our model is more realistic for an evolved comet than simple\nmodels parameterising the properties of the cometary surface layer, yet\nmaintains comparable computational complexity.",

            "summary": "Existing sentence ordering approaches generally employ encoder-decoder\nframeworks with the pointer net to recover the coherence by recurrently\npredicting each sentence step-by-step. Such an autoregressive manner only\nleverages unilateral dependencies during decoding and cannot fully explore the\nsemantic dependency between sentences for ordering. To overcome these\nlimitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Ordering\nNetwork, dubbed \\textit{NAON}, which explores bilateral dependencies between\nsentences and predicts the sentence for each position in parallel. We claim\nthat the non-autoregressive manner is not just applicable but also particularly\nsuitable to the sentence ordering task because of two peculiar characteristics\nof the task: 1) each generation target is in deterministic length, and 2) the\nsentences and positions should match exclusively. Furthermore, to address the\nrepetition issue of the naive non-autoregressive Transformer, we introduce an\nexclusive loss to constrain the exclusiveness between positions and sentences.\nTo verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on several common-used datasets and the experimental results show\nthat our method outperforms all the autoregressive approaches and yields\ncompetitive performance compared with the state-of-the-arts.

            "summary": "Historical maps provide useful spatio-temporal information on the Earth's\nsurface before modern earth observation techniques came into being. To extract\ninformation from maps, neural networks, which gain wide popularity in recent\nyears, have replaced hand-crafted map processing methods and tedious manual\nlabor. However, aleatoric uncertainty, known as data-dependent uncertainty,\ninherent in the drawing/scanning/fading defects of the original map sheets and\ninadequate contexts when cropping maps into small tiles considering the memory\nlimits of the training process, challenges the model to make correct\npredictions. As aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced even with more training\ndata collected, we argue that complementary spatio-temporal contexts can be\nhelpful. To achieve this, we propose a U-Net-based network that fuses\nspatio-temporal features with cross-attention transformers (U-SpaTem),\naggregating information at a larger spatial range as well as through a temporal\nsequence of images. Our model achieves a better performance than other\nstate-or-art models that use either temporal or spatial contexts. Compared with\npure vision transformers, our model is more lightweight and effective. To the\nbest of our knowledge, leveraging both spatial and temporal contexts have been\nrarely explored before in the segmentation task. Even though our application is\non segmenting historical maps, we believe that the method can be transferred\ninto other fields with similar problems like temporal sequences of satellite\nimages.

Recent\nwork has shown that bulk cytoplasmic flows, driven by cortical contractions\nalong the walls of the embryo, enable the uniform spreading of nuclei along the\nanterior-posterior (AP) axis necessary for proper embryonic development. Here\nwe propose two mathematical models to characterise cytoplasmic flows driven by\ntangential cortical contractions in elongated cells. Assuming Newtonian fluid\nflow at low Reynolds number in a spheroidal cell, we first compute the flow\nfield exactly, thereby bypassing the need for numerical computations. We then\napply our results to recent experiments on nuclear transport in cell cycles 4-6\nof Drosophila embryo development. By fitting the cortical contractions in our\nmodel to measurements, we reveal that experimental cortical flows enable\nnear-optimal axial spreading of nuclei. A second mathematical approach,\napplicable to general elongated cell geometries, exploits a long-wavelength\napproximation to produce an even simpler solution, with errors below 5%\ncompared to the full model. An application of this long-wavelength result to\ntransport leads to fully analytical solutions for the nuclear concentration\nthat capture the essential physics of the system, including optimal axial\nspreading of nuclei.",

In this paper, we present a new pretraining framework\nfor LMs that explicitly considers the topological and heterogeneous information\nin TAHGs. Firstly, we define a context graph as neighborhoods of a target node\nwithin specific orders and propose a topology-aware pretraining task to predict\nnodes involved in the context graph by jointly optimizing an LM and an\nauxiliary heterogeneous graph neural network. Secondly, based on the\nobservation that some nodes are text-rich while others have little text, we\ndevise a text augmentation strategy to enrich textless nodes with their\nneighbors' texts for handling the imbalance issue. We conduct link prediction\nand node classification tasks on three datasets from various domains.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing\nmethods and the rationality of each design.

Our results\nindicate that the predicted Curie temperature depends strongly on the choice of\nDFT functional and system size, due to the presence of emergent long-range\ndirectional correlations in the local dipole fluctuations.

Built on this principle, we propose a\nnew class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the\ninformation of a key variable within the system. To this end, we develop an\napproximated analytical physics-based representation of an entropy to forecast\nthe information gain of each action and greedily choose the one with the\nlargest information gain. This method yields strong performances in classical\nbandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we prove its asymptotic\noptimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards.

            "summary": "A novel approach to simulate dynamic, recurrent flows with very large time\nsteps is presented. Data-driven forecasts based on the method of analogues are\nmade employing a set of precomputed time series segments of flow fields. These\npredictions are then corrected with the evolved deviation between initial flow\nstate and its nearest neighbor in the database. The evolution of these\ndeviations is obtained from the convolution with the propagator of the\nlinearized Navier-Stokes equations, where linearization takes place around the\nmost similar state in the database. The error $E_{\\textrm{lin}}$ due to this\napproximation implies the appropriate distance function to determine\nnearest-neighbor fields. We tested the method on the simple case of 2D vortex\nshedding behind a cylinder at Reynolds numbers in the range of 200 with step\nsizes of up to 200 times larger than those used to generate the underlying data\nwith the PISO algorithm. Short-term forecasts showed a high degree of accuracy\nwith errors correlating well with $E_{\\textrm{lin}}$ for a number of case\nvariations. But also after many steps, the predicted flow fields remained in\nclose agreement with high-fidelity CFD calculations with relative errors on the\norder of 1% for the temporal averages. Furthermore, excellent conservation\nbehavior of global properties like total momentum and kinetic energy was\nobserved.",

            "summary": "Recent discoveries have revealed that deep neural networks might behave in a\nbiased manner in many real-world scenarios. For instance, deep networks trained\non a large-scale face recognition dataset CelebA tend to predict blonde hair\nfor females and black hair for males. Such biases not only jeopardize the\nrobustness of models but also perpetuate and amplify social biases, which is\nespecially concerning for automated decision-making processes in healthcare,\nrecruitment, etc., as they could exacerbate unfair economic and social\ninequalities among different groups. Existing debiasing methods suffer from\nhigh costs in bias labeling or model re-training, while also exhibiting a\ndeficiency in terms of elucidating the origins of biases within the model. To\nthis respect, we propose a fast model debiasing framework (FMD) which offers an\nefficient approach to identify, evaluate and remove biases inherent in trained\nmodels. The FMD identifies biased attributes through an explicit counterfactual\nconcept and quantifies the influence of data samples with influence functions.\nMoreover, we design a machine unlearning-based strategy to efficiently and\neffectively remove the bias in a trained model with a small counterfactual\ndataset. Experiments on the Colored MNIST, CelebA, and Adult Income datasets\nalong with experiments with large language models demonstrate that our method\nachieves superior or competing accuracies compared with state-of-the-art\nmethods while attaining significantly fewer biases and requiring much less\ndebiasing cost.

However, recent\nadvances in our understanding of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence demonstrate that MHD turbulence and 3D magnetic fields leave their\nimprints on the intensity features of spectroscopic observations. Leveraging\nthese theoretical frameworks, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) model to extract this embedded information, enabling the probe of 3D\nmagnetic fields. This model examines not only the plane-of-the-sky magnetic\nfield orientation ($\\phi$), but also the magnetic field's inclination angle\n($\\gamma$) relative to the line-of-sight, and the total magnetization level\n(M$_A^{-1}$) of the cloud. We train the model using synthetic emission lines of\n$^{13}$CO (J = 1 - 0) and C$^{18}$O (J = 1 - 0), generated from 3D MHD\nsimulations that span conditions from sub-Alfv\\'enic to super-Alfv\\'enic\nmolecular clouds. Our tests confirm that the CNN model effectively reconstructs\nthe 3D magnetic field topology and magnetization. The median uncertainties are\nunder $5^\\circ$ for both $\\phi$ and $\\gamma$, and less than 0.2 for M$_A$ in\nsub-Alfv\\'enic conditions (M$_A\\approx0.5$). In super-Alfv\\'enic scenarios\n(M$_A\\approx2.0$), they are under $15^\\circ$ for $\\phi$ and $\\gamma$, and 1.5\nfor M$_A$. We applied this trained CNN model to the L1478 molecular cloud.\nResults show a strong agreement between the CNN-predicted magnetic field\norientation and that derived from Planck 353 GHz polarization data. The CNN\napproach enabled us to construct the 3D magnetic field map for L1478, revealing\na global inclination angle of $\\approx76^\\circ$ and a global M$_A$ of\n$\\approx1.07$.",

In this work, we perform one-dimensional general\nrelativistic PIC simulations to examine the gamma-ray emission from\nstellar-mass BH magnetospheres. We find that intermittent spark gaps emerge and\nparticles are efficiently accelerated, in a similar manner to the supermassive\nBH case.

We identified\na homozygous p.Pro357Leu missense variant in a single consanguineous PD case.\nThis mutation predicted deleterious, affects a conserved amino acid localized\nin the catalytic domain of the protein nearby the pathological p.Asp363Gly\nmutation described in the previous paper. As the most frequent genes involved\nin AR-PD (PRKN, PINK1), the DAGLB-associated disease presents and evolves like\ntypical PD.This work reinforces the fact that DAGLB is involved in early onset\nParkinson disease, but given the fact that we identified a single patient among\n684 index cases screened, we conclude that DAGLB is a very rare cause of early\nonset autosomal recessive Parkinson disease.

            "summary": "Options, serving as a crucial financial instrument, are used by investors to\nmanage and mitigate their investment risks within the securities market.\nPrecisely predicting the present price of an option enables investors to make\ninformed and efficient decisions. In this paper, we propose a machine learning\nmethod for forecasting the prices of SPY (ETF) option based on gated recurrent\nunit (GRU) and self-attention mechanism. We first partitioned the raw dataset\ninto 15 subsets according to moneyness and days to maturity criteria. For each\nsubset, we matched the corresponding U.S. government bond rates and Implied\nVolatility Indices. This segmentation allows for a more insightful exploration\nof the impacts of risk-free rates and underlying volatility on option pricing.\nNext, we built four different machine learning models, including multilayer\nperceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), self-attention LSTM, and\nself-attention GRU in comparison to the traditional binomial model. The\nempirical result shows that self-attention GRU with historical data outperforms\nother models due to its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies and\nleverage the contextual information embedded in the historical data. Finally,\nin order to unveil the \"black box\" of artificial intelligence, we employed the\nSHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret and analyze the\nprediction results of the self-attention GRU model with historical data. This\nprovides insights into the significance and contributions of different input\nfeatures on the pricing of American-style options.",

To answer this question, in this paper, we provide a novel\ndemonstration of the application of EIT. By integrating EM knowledge into the\nclassical MMSE channel estimator, we observe for the first time that EIT is\ncapable of improving the channel estimation performace. Specifically, the EM\nknowledge is first encoded into a spatio-temporal correlation function (STCF),\nwhich we term as the EM kernel. This EM kernel plays the role of side\ninformation to the channel estimator. Since the EM kernel takes the form of\nGaussian processes (GP), we propose the EIT-based Gaussian process regression\n(EIT-GPR) to derive the channel estimations. In addition, since the EM kernel\nallows parameter tuning, we propose EM kernel learning to fit the EM kernel to\nchannel observations.

Based on a diploid Wright-Fisher model with a single\nmating type and partial selfing for a constant large population with size $N$,\nwe quantify the combined effect of genetic drift and two competing factors,\nrecombination and selfing, on the correlation of coalescence times at two\nlinked loci for samples of size two. Recombination decouples the genealogies at\ndifferent loci and decreases the correlation while selfing increases the\ncorrelation. We obtain explicit asymptotic formulas for the correlation for\nfour scaling scenarios that depend on whether the selfing probability and the\nrecombination probability are of order $O(1/N)$ or $O(1)$ as $N$ tends to\ninfinity. Our analytical results confirm that the asymptotic lower bound in\n[King, Wakeley, Carmi (Theor. Popul. Biol. 2018)] is sharp when the loci are\nunlinked and when there is no selfing, and provide a number of new formulas for\nother scaling scenarios that have not been considered before. We present\nasymptotic results for the variance of Tajima's estimator of the population\nmutation rate for infinitely many loci as $N$ tends to infinity. When the\nselfing probability is of order $O(1)$ and is equal to a positive constant $s$\nfor all $N$ and if the samples at both loci are in the same individual, then\nthe variance of the Tajima's estimator tends to $s/2$ (hence remains positive)\neven when the recombination rate, the number of loci and the population size\nall tend to infinity.",

Orthogonal to prior\nwork handling accident-prone traffic events by algorithm designs at the policy\nlevel, we investigate a Closed-loop Adversarial Training (CAT) framework for\nsafe end-to-end driving in this paper through the lens of environment\naugmentation. CAT aims to continuously improve the safety of driving agents by\ntraining the agent on safety-critical scenarios that are dynamically generated\nover time. A novel resampling technique is developed to turn log-replay\nreal-world driving scenarios into safety-critical ones via probabilistic\nfactorization, where the adversarial traffic generation is modeled as the\nmultiplication of standard motion prediction sub-problems. Consequently, CAT\ncan launch more efficient physical attacks compared to existing safety-critical\nscenario generation methods and yields a significantly less computational cost\nin the iterative learning pipeline. We incorporate CAT into the MetaDrive\nsimulator and validate our approach on hundreds of driving scenarios imported\nfrom real-world driving datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT can\neffectively generate adversarial scenarios countering the agent being trained.\nAfter training, the agent can achieve superior driving safety in both\nlog-replay and safety-critical traffic scenarios on the held-out test set.

The representations of negative\nsamples are obtained from the image encoder in advance and saved in a memory\nbank.

This linearity facilitates a local notion of\nexplainability of RF predictions that generates attributions for any model\nprediction across observations in the training set, and thereby complements\nestablished methods like SHAP, which instead generates attributions for a model\nprediction across dimensions of the feature space.

This\nproblem is important because sea-level rise affects millions of people in\ncoastal communities and beyond due to climate change's impacts on polar ice\nsheets and the ocean. This problem is challenging due to spatial variability\nand unknowns such as possible tipping points (e.g., collapse of Greenland or\nWest Antarctic ice-shelf), climate feedback loops (e.g., clouds, permafrost\nthawing), future policy decisions, and human actions. Most existing climate\nmodeling approaches use the same set of weights globally, during either\nregression or deep learning to combine different climate projections. Such\napproaches are inadequate when different regions require different weighting\nschemes for accurate and reliable sea-level rise predictions.

Scanning electron microscopy suggests that a\nconsiderable fraction of the oxide added to the feedstock is lost during\nprocessing, due to oxide agglomeration and the ejection of oxide-rich spatter\nfrom the melt pool.

Existing techniques only employ a limited\nsource of run-time data (e.g., code coverage) to be failure proximity, which\ntypically delivers unsatisfactory results. 2) The outcome can be hardly\ncomprehensible. A developer who receives the failure indexing result does not\nknow why all failures should be divided the way they are. This leads to\ndifficulties for developers to be convinced by the result, which in turn\naffects the adoption of the results. To tackle these challenges, in this paper,\nwe propose SURE, a viSUalized failuRe indExing approach using the program\nmemory spectrum. We first collect the run-time memory information at preset\nbreakpoints during the execution of failed test cases, and transform it into\nhuman-friendly images (called program memory spectrum, PMS). Then, any pair of\nPMS images that serve as proxies for two failures is fed to a trained Siamese\nconvolutional neural network, to predict the likelihood of them being triggered\nby the same fault. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of SURE: It achieves\n101.20% and 41.38% improvements in faults number estimation, as well as 105.20%\nand 35.53% improvements in clustering, compared with the state-of-the-art\ntechnique in this field, in simulated and real-world environments,\nrespectively. Moreover, we carry out a human study to quantitatively evaluate\nthe comprehensibility of PMS, revealing that this novel type of representation\ncan help developers better comprehend failure indexing results.",

Treatment usually includes a mix of surgical\nresection, radiation therapy, and akylating chemotherapy but, even with these\nintensive treatments, the 2-year survival rate is still very low.\nO6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation has been\nshown to be a predictive bio-marker for resistance to chemotherapy, but it is\ninvasive and time-consuming to determine the methylation status. Due to this,\nthere has been effort to predict the MGMT methylation status through analyzing\nMRI scans using machine learning, which only requires pre-operative scans that\nare already part of standard-of-care for GBM patients. We developed a 3D\nSpotTune network with adaptive fine-tuning capability to improve the\nperformance of conventional transfer learning in the identification of MGMT\npromoter methylation status. Using the pretrained weights of MedicalNet coupled\nwith the SpotTune network, we compared its performance with two equivalent\nnetworks: one that is initialized with MedicalNet weights, but with no adaptive\nfine-tuning and one initialized with random weights. These three networks are\ntrained and evaluated using the UPENN-GBM dataset, a public GBM dataset\nprovided by the University of Pennsylvania. The SpotTune network showed better\nperformance than the network with randomly initialized weights and the\npre-trained MedicalNet with no adaptive fine-tuning. SpotTune enables transfer\nlearning to be adaptive to individual patients, resulting in improved\nperformance in predicting MGMT promoter methylation status in GBM using MRIs as\ncompared to conventional transfer learning without adaptive fine-tuning.",

            "summary": "Traffic state forecasting is crucial for traffic management and control\nstrategies, as well as user- and system-level decision making in the\ntransportation network. While traffic forecasting has been approached with a\nvariety of techniques over the last couple of decades, most approaches simply\nrely on endogenous traffic variables for state prediction, despite the evidence\nthat exogenous factors can significantly impact traffic conditions. This paper\nproposes a multi-dimensional spatio-temporal graph attention-based traffic\nprediction approach (M-STGAT), which predicts traffic based on past\nobservations of speed, along with lane closure events, temperature, and\nvisibility across the transportation network. The approach is based on a graph\nattention network architecture, which also learns based on the structure of the\ntransportation network on which these variables are observed. Numerical\nexperiments are performed using traffic speed and lane closure data from the\nCalifornia Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Performance Measurement\nSystem (PeMS). The corresponding weather data were downloaded from the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOOA) Automated Surface Observing\nSystems (ASOS). For comparison, the numerical experiments implement three\nalternative models which do not allow for the multi-dimensional input. The\nM-STGAT is shown to outperform the three alternative models, when performing\ntests using our primary data set for prediction with a 30-, 45-, and 60-minute\nprediction horizon, in terms of three error measures: Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).\nHowever, the model's transferability can vary for different transfer data sets\nand this aspect may require further investigation.",

Thus, federated learning (FL) becomes a trending solution to\naddress this challenge in a distributed learning paradigm. However, as GNNs may\ninherit historical bias from training data and lead to discriminatory\npredictions, the bias of local models can be easily propagated to the global\nmodel in distributed settings. This poses a new challenge in mitigating bias in\nfederated GNNs. To address this challenge, we propose $\\text{F}^2$GNN, a Fair\nFederated Graph Neural Network, that enhances group fairness of federated GNNs.\nAs bias can be sourced from both data and learning algorithms, $\\text{F}^2$GNN\naims to mitigate both types of bias under federated settings. First, we provide\ntheoretical insights on the connection between data bias in a training graph\nand statistical fairness metrics of the trained GNN models. Based on the\ntheoretical analysis, we design $\\text{F}^2$GNN which contains two key\ncomponents: a fairness-aware local model update scheme that enhances group\nfairness of the local models on the client side, and a fairness-weighted global\nmodel update scheme that takes both data bias and fairness metrics of local\nmodels into consideration in the aggregation process.

This research advocates for the\ncombined use of both P- and S-wave data, captured by geophone monitoring\nsystems, to improve source inversion accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the\nsecondary source concept in Elastic Reflection Full Waveform Inversion (ERFWI),\nwe introduce an equivalent source term. This term combines source functions and\nsource images. Our optimization strategy iteratively refines the spatial\nlocations of the source, its temporal functions, and associated velocities\nusing a full waveform inversion framework. Under the premise of an isotropic\nmedium with consistent density, the source is defined by two spatial and three\ntemporal components. This offers a nuanced source representation in contrast to\nthe conventional seismic moment tensor. To address gradient computation, we\nemploy the adjoint-state method. However, we encountered pronounced\nnon-linearity in waveform inversion of micro-seismic events, primarily due to\nthe unknown source origin time, resulting in cycle skipping challenges. To\ncounteract this, we devised an objective function that is decoupled from the\nsource origin time. This function is formulated by convolving reference traces\nwith both observed and predicted data. Through the concurrent inversion of the\nsource image, source time function, and velocity model, our method offers\nprecise estimations of these parameters, as validated by a synthetic 2D example\nbased on a modified Marmousi model.

The paradigmatic model of Bistritzer and MacDonald [PNAS 108,\n12233 (2011)], based on the moir\\'e pattern formed by tBLG, predicts the\nexistence of \"magic angles\" at which the Fermi velocity of the low-energy bands\ngoes to zero, and the bands themselves become dispersionless. Here, we\nreexamine the low-energy bands of tBLG from the ab initio electronic structure\nperspective, motivated by features related to the atomic relaxation in the\nmoir\\'e pattern, namely circular regions of AA stacking, triangular regions of\nAB/BA stacking and domain walls separating the latter. We find that the bands\nare never perfectly flat and the Fermi velocity never vanishes, but rather a\n\"magic range\" exists where the lower band becomes extremely flat and the Fermi\nvelocity attains a non-zero minimum value. We propose a simple $(2+2)$-band\nmodel, comprised of two different pairs of orbitals, both on a honeycomb\nlattice: the first pair represents the low-energy bands with high localization\nat the AA sites, while the second pair represents highly dispersive bands\nassociated with domain-wall states. This model gives an accurate description of\nthe low-energy bands with few (13) parameters which are physically motivated\nand vary smoothly in the magic range. In addition, we derive an effective\ntwo-band hamiltonian which also gives an accurate description of the low-energy\nbands.

Theoretically, RDF expressions for\nodd-dimensional fluids can be obtained by solving the Percus-Yevick integral\nequations. But for even-dimensional cases, such as the hard disk (2D) fluid,\nanalytical expressions are infeasible. The only 2D RDF is a heuristic\nexpression proposed by Yuste et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 99, 2020,1993), which\napproximates the 2D RDF with an interpolation of the RDFs for hard-rod (1D) and\nhard-sphere (3D) fluids and provides acceptable estimations for an intermediate\nand low density range. In this work, we employ a simple and empirical\nexpression for the 2D RDF and the 3D RDF based on the approach proposed by\nTrokhymchuk et al. for the 3D RDF (J. Chem. Phys., 123, 024501, 2005). The\nparameters are determined in such a way that the final RDF expressions are\nthermodynamically consistent, namely the pressure constraint and the isothermal\ncompressibility constraint are both satisfied. The new RDFs for the 2D and 3D\nhard spheres are highly accurate for the entire density range up to the\nfirst-order phase transition points. The predictions of the first coordination\nnumbers are consistent with simulation results for 3D fluid. Finally, by using\nthe 2D RDF with a primitive second-order perturbation theory, the\npressure-volume-temperature relation and vapor-liquid equilibrium are\ncalculated for the 2D Lennard-Jones fluid. Comparisons with the simulation data\nshow promising results.",

We\ndemonstrate how the system transitions from kinetic behavior to hydrodynamic\nbehavior as the nonintegrability strength increases. Specifically, for the\nthermalization dynamics, we find a power-law relationship between the\nthermalization time and the perturbation strength near integrable regime,\nwhereas in the far from integrable regime, the hydrodynamics dominates and the\nthermalization time becomes independent of the perturbation strength and\nexhibits a strong size-dependent behavior. Regarding transport behavior, our\nresults further establish a threshold for the nonintegrable strength of this\ntransition. Consequently, we can predict which behavior dominates the transport\nproperties of the system. Especially, an explicit expression of the thermal\nconductivity contributed by the kinetics is given.

The study investigates different process parameters that influence the\nmelt pool width (signature) and bead width (property) in single and multi-layer\nbeads. The proposed modeling approach utilizes a parameter-signature model as\nF_1 and a signature-property model as F_2. Linear and nonlinear modeling\napproaches are compared to describe a dynamic relationship between process\nparameters and a process signature, the melt pool width (F_1). A fully\nconnected artificial neural network is employed to model and predict the final\npart property, i.e., bead width, based on melt pool signatures (F_2).

            "summary": "We present a new method for calculating the temperature profile in high\nexplosive (HE) material using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To\ntrain/test the CNN, we have developed a hybrid experiment/simulation method for\ncollecting acoustic and temperature data. We experimentally heat cylindrical\ncontainers of HE material until detonation/deflagration, where we continuously\nmeasure the acoustic bursts through the HE using multiple acoustic transducers\nlined around the exterior container circumference. However, measuring the\ntemperature profile in the HE in experiment would require inserting a high\nnumber of thermal probes, which would disrupt the heating process. Thus, we use\ntwo thermal probes, one at the HE center and one at the wall. We then use\nfinite element simulation of the heating process to calculate the temperature\ndistribution, and correct the simulated temperatures based on the experimental\ncenter and wall temperatures. We calculate temperature errors on the order of\n15{\\deg}C, which is approximately 12% of the range of temperatures in the\nexperiment. We also investigate how the algorithm accuracy is affected by the\nnumber of acoustic receivers used to collect each measurement and the\nresolution of the temperature prediction. This work provides a means of\nassessing the safety status of HE material, which cannot be achieved using\nexisting temperature measurement methods. Additionally, it has implications for\nrange of other applications where internal temperature profile measurements\nwould provide critical information. These applications include detecting\nchemical reactions, observing thermodynamic processes like combustion,\nmonitoring metal or plastic casting, determining the energy density in thermal\nstorage capsules, and identifying abnormal battery operation.",

However, the state-of-the-art LTMs\nusually focused on segment-level modelling, in which the traffic operation\ndifferences among multiple turning directions are neglected. Such models are\nincapable of differentiating the turn-level queue transmission, resulting in\nunderrepresented queue spillbacks and misidentification of bottlenecks.\nMoreover, a constant free-flow speed is usually assumed to formulate LTMs,\nrestricting their applications to model dynamic traffic management strategies\ninvolving variable speed limits (VSL) and connected and automated vehicles.\nThis study proposed an extended LTM with VSL and turn-level queue transmission\nto capture the traffic flow propagation at signalized intersections. First,\neach road segment (RS) with multiple turning directions is divided into many\nfree-flow and queueing parts characterized by the triangular fundamental\ndiagrams. Then, the vehicle propagation within the link is described by the\nturn-level link inflow, queue inflow, and outflow, which depends on the\nfree-flow speed changes. A node model involving an iterative procedure is\nfurther defined to capture the potential queue spillback, which estimates the\nactual flow propagation between the adjacent RSs. Simulated and field data were\nused to verify the proposed model performance. Results reveal that the proposed\nLTM predict traffic operations of complex intersections with multiple turning\nmovements, VSL and signal control schemes, and enables an accurate yet\ncomputationally tractable representation of flow propagation.",

Within our adiabatic\nformalism, the two coefficients are given in terms of Berry curvatures defined\nin synthetic spaces. Our work lays the foundations for the systematic\ndescription of topological diagonal superfluid responses induced by\nsingularities dictating the synthetic Berry curvatures. We exemplify our\napproach for concrete one- and two-dimensional models of superconducting\ntopological (semi)metals. We discuss topological phenomena which arise in the\nsuperfluid stiffness of bulk systems and the quantum capacitance of Josephson\njunctions. We show that both coefficients become proportional to a topological\ninvariant which counts the number of topological touchings/crossings of the\nnormal phase band structure.

We show that such\nmodel correctly reproduces the UV luminosity function at $z>10$, and the star\nformation rate (SFR) density evolution. The model also predicts, in agreement\nwith data, that the cosmic specific SFR grows as ${\\rm sSFR} \\propto\n(1+z)^{3/2}$. At $z \\simeq 10$ the cosmic sSFR crosses the critical value $\\rm\nsSFR^\\star = 25\\, \\rm Gyr^{-1}$ and $\\approx 45$% of the galaxies become\nsuper-Eddington driving outflows reaching velocities of $\\approx 830\n\\,(\\epsilon_\\star/f_M)^{1/2}\\, {\\rm km\\, s}^{-1}$, where $\\epsilon_\\star$ and\n$f_M$ are the SF efficiency and fraction of the halo gas expelled in the\noutflow, respectively.

            "summary": "We find that different asymptotic measurements in quantum field theory can be\nrelated to one another through new versions of crossing symmetry. Assuming\nanalyticity, we conjecture generalized crossing relations for multi-particle\nprocesses and the corresponding paths of analytic continuation. We prove them\nto all multiplicity at tree-level in quantum field theory and string theory. We\nillustrate how to practically perform analytic continuations on loop-level\nexamples using different methods, including unitarity cuts and differential\nequations. We study the extent to which anomalous thresholds away from the\nusual physical region can cause an analytic obstruction to crossing when\nmassless particles are involved. In an appendix, we review and streamline\nhistorical proofs of four-particle crossing symmetry in gapped theories.",

We make use of Ernst's potential to solve the Einstein\nequations perturbatively in the angular momentum $a$. Calculating to order\n$a^6$, we find accurate predictions up to about $a=0.45$, where the quadrupole\nmoment is predicted to be around $1\\%$ higher than its Kerr value; higher\nmultipole moments show deviation of the order of $\\sim 10\\%$. Our analysis\ntakes into account deformations of the black shells, and we propose that it can\nbe used for numerical simulations comparing gravitational waves emitted by\norbiting black shells with those emitted by orbiting black holes.

            "summary": "Making models algorithmically fairer in tabular data has been long studied,\nwith techniques typically oriented towards fixes which usually take a neural\nmodel with an undesirable outcome and make changes to how the data are\ningested, what the model weights are, or how outputs are processed. We employ\nan emergent and different strategy where we consider updating the model's\narchitecture and training hyperparameters to find an entirely new model with\nbetter outcomes from the beginning of the debiasing procedure. In this work, we\npropose using multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and\nHyperparameter Optimization (HPO) in the first application to the very\nchallenging domain of tabular data. We conduct extensive exploration of\narchitectural and hyperparameter spaces (MLP, ResNet, and FT-Transformer)\nacross diverse datasets, demonstrating the dependence of accuracy and fairness\nmetrics of model predictions on hyperparameter combinations. We show that\nmodels optimized solely for accuracy with NAS often fail to inherently address\nfairness concerns. We propose a novel approach that jointly optimizes\narchitectural and training hyperparameters in a multi-objective constraint of\nboth accuracy and fairness. We produce architectures that consistently Pareto\ndominate state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods either in fairness, accuracy\nor both, all of this while being Pareto-optimal over hyperparameters achieved\nthrough single-objective (accuracy) optimization runs. This research\nunderscores the promise of automating fairness and accuracy optimization in\ndeep learning models.",

            "summary": "Recently we found compelling evidence for a gravitational wave background\nwith Hellings and Downs (HD) correlations in our 15-year data set. These\ncorrelations describe gravitational waves as predicted by general relativity,\nwhich has two transverse polarization modes. However, more general metric\ntheories of gravity can have additional polarization modes which produce\ndifferent interpulsar correlations. In this work we search the NANOGrav 15-year\ndata set for evidence of a gravitational wave background with quadrupolar\nHellings and Downs (HD) and Scalar Transverse (ST) correlations. We find that\nHD correlations are the best fit to the data, and no significant evidence in\nfavor of ST correlations. While Bayes factors show strong evidence for a\ncorrelated signal, the data does not strongly prefer either correlation\nsignature, with Bayes factors $\\sim 2$ when comparing HD to ST correlations,\nand $\\sim 1$ for HD plus ST correlations to HD correlations alone. However,\nwhen modeled alongside HD correlations, the amplitude and spectral index\nposteriors for ST correlations are uninformative, with the HD process\naccounting for the vast majority of the total signal. Using the optimal\nstatistic, a frequentist technique that focuses on the pulsar-pair\ncross-correlations, we find median signal-to-noise-ratios of 5.0 for HD and 4.6\nfor ST correlations when fit for separately, and median signal-to-noise-ratios\nof 3.5 for HD and 3.0 for ST correlations when fit for simultaneously. While\nthe signal-to-noise-ratios for each of the correlations are comparable, the\nestimated amplitude and spectral index for HD are a significantly better fit to\nthe total signal, in agreement with our Bayesian analysis.",

Data from patients with mental disease\ndiagnoses were extracted from the well-known clinical MIMIC-III data set\nutilizing demographic, prescription, and procedural information. Four machine\nlearning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector\nMachine, and K-Nearest Neighbors) were used, with results indicating that\nRandom Forest and Support Vector Machine models outperformed others, with AUC\nscores of 0.911. Feature importance analysis revealed that drug prescriptions,\nparticularly Morphine Sulfate, play a pivotal role in prediction. We applied a\nvariety of machine learning algorithms to predict 30-day mortality followed by\nfeature importance analysis. This study can be used to assist hospital workers\nin identifying at-risk patients to reduce excess mortality.",

As the number\nof criteria increases, the skyline presumes excessive data items, which yield a\nmeaningless result.

Specifically, each data item was associated with a\nprobability of appearance, which represented the probability of becoming a\nmember of the k-dominant skyline. As data items appear continuously in data\nstreams, the corresponding k-dominant skyline may vary with time. Therefore, an\neffective and rapid mechanism of updating the k-dominant skyline becomes\ncrucial. Herein, we proposed two time-efficient schemes, Middle Indexing (MI)\nand All Indexing (AI), for k-dominant skyline in distributed edge-computing\nenvironments, where irrelevant data items can be effectively excluded from the\ncompute to reduce the processing duration. Furthermore, the proposed schemes\nwere validated with extensive experimental simulations.

Our second findings demonstrate\nsignificant enhancements in forecasting accuracy when one incorporates wind\nspeed data from proximate weather stations, in full agreement with the results\nobtained formerly for point-wise wind speed prediction.

Also, the magnetic field and its\nvariation inside the conductor is of interest for computing stress and strain,\nand due to superconducting quench limits. For these force, inductance, energy,\nand internal field calculations, the coils cannot be naively approximated as\ninfinitesimally thin filaments due to divergences when the source and\nevaluation points coincide, so more computationally demanding calculations are\nusually required, resolving the finite cross-section of the conductors. Here,\nwe present a new alternative method that enables the internal magnetic field\nvector, self-force, and self-inductance to be computed rapidly and accurately\nwithin a 1D filament model. The method is applicable to coils for which the\ncurve center-line can have general noncircular shape, as long as the conductor\nwidth is small compared to the radius of curvature. This paper extends a\nprevious calculation for circular-cross-section conductors [Hurwitz et al,\narXiv:2310.09313 (2023)] to consider the case of rectangular cross-section. The\nreduced model is derived by rigorous analysis of the singularity, regularizing\nthe filament integrals such that they match the true high-dimensional integrals\nat high coil aspect ratio. The new filament model exactly recovers analytic\nresults for a circular coil, and is shown to accurately reproduce full\nfinite-cross-section calculations for a non-planar coil of a stellarator\nmagnetic fusion device. Due to the efficiency of the model here, it is well\nsuited for use inside design optimization.",

Essentially, our method represents\neach graph as a set of relational matrices corresponding to the information of\ndifferent modalities. Given two graphs, we enumerate all relational matrix\npairs and obtain their matching results, and accordingly, infer the node\ncorrespondence by the weighted averaging of the matching results. This method\ncan be implemented as computing the HOT distance between the two graphs -- each\nmatching result is an optimal transport plan associated with the\nGromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance between two relational matrices, and the\nweights of all matching results are the elements of an upper-level optimal\ntransport plan defined on the matrix sets. We propose a bi-level optimization\nalgorithm to compute the HOT distance in a differentiable way, making the\nsignificance of the relational matrices adjustable.

Nevertheless, their application in real-time\nscenarios has been highly restricted due to the significant inference latency\nassociated with these models. This is particularly pronounced due to the\nautoregressive nature of generative LLM inference, where tokens are generated\nsequentially since each token depends on all previous output tokens. It is\ntherefore challenging to achieve any token-level parallelism, making inference\nextremely memory-bound. In this work, we propose SPEED, which improves\ninference efficiency by speculatively executing multiple future tokens in\nparallel with the current token using predicted values based on early-layer\nhidden states. For Transformer decoders that employ parameter sharing, the\nmemory operations for the tokens executing in parallel can be amortized, which\nallows us to accelerate generative LLM inference. We demonstrate the efficiency\nof our method in terms of latency reduction relative to model accuracy and\ndemonstrate how speculation allows for training deeper decoders with parameter\nsharing with minimal runtime overhead.",

After reviewing the two relaxation time model from\nholography and studying the effect of the magnetic field on thermo-electric\ntransports from hydrodynamic theory, we present a new dilatonic dyonic\nasymptotically AdS black hole solution. Notice that S-duality plays an\nimportant role in finding the analytic solution with the magnetic field. Using\nthe AdS/CMT dictionary, we analyze the electric and thermo-electric transport\nproperties of the dual field theory. The resistivity exhibits T-linearity in\nthe low-temperature regime. However, in the strong momentum relaxation and a\nstrong magnetic field limit, the resistivitiy shows explicit deviation from the\nlinear-in-T resistivity. The Hall angle is linear-in-T for both the\nlow-temperature regime and the high-temperature regime for fixed momentum\ndissipation strength. The Nernst signal is a bell-shaped function in terms of\nthe magnetic field even when the momentum relaxation is strong. Finally, we\ndiscuss the possibility of getting a semi-realistic strange metal description\nfrom our model.",

Our work mathematically characterizes the optimal information design\nscheme and the resulting utility when observations are not perfectly observed\nbut arise from an imperfect classifier. Framing the optimization problem as a\nlinear program, we give sufficient and necessary conditions on the classifier\naccuracy to ensure platform utility under optimal signaling is monotonically\nincreasing and continuous. We next consider this interaction under a\nperformative model, wherein platform intervention through signaling affects the\ncontent distribution in the future. We fully characterize the convergence and\nstability of optimal signaling under this performative process.

            "summary": "It is well known that inertia-free shearing flows of a viscoelastic fluid\nwith curved streamlines, such as the torsional flow between a rotating cone and\nplate, or the flow in a Taylor-Couette geometry, can become unstable to a\nthree-dimensional time-dependent instability at conditions exceeding a critical\nWeissenberg (Wi) number. However, the combined effects of fluid elasticity,\nshear thinning, and finite inertia (as quantified by the Reynolds number Re) on\nthe onset of elasto-inertial instabilities are not fully understood. Using a\nset of cone-plate geometries, we experimentally explore the entire Wi - Re\nphase space for a series of rate-dependent viscoelastic fluids (quantified\nusing a shear thinning parameter $\\beta_P$). We tune $\\beta_P$ by varying the\npolymer concentration in solutions. This progressively reduces shear-thinning\nbut leads to finite inertial effects before the onset of elastic instability,\nthus naturally resulting in elasto-inertial coupling. Transient rheometric\nmeasurements and flow visualization experiments allow us to investigate the\neffects of flow geometry and document the combined effects of varying Wi, Re,\nand $\\beta_P$ on the emergence of secondary motions at the onset of\ninstability. The resulting critical state diagram quantitatively depicts the\ncompetition between the stabilizing effects of shear thinning and the\ndestabilizing effects of inertia. We extend the curved streamline instability\ncriterion of Pakdel and McKinley 1996 for the onset of purely elastic\ninstability in curvilinear geometries by using scaling arguments to incorporate\nshear thinning and finite inertial effects. The augmented condition facilitates\npredictions of the onset of instability over a broader range of flow\nconditions, thus bridging the gap between purely elastic and elasto-inertial\ncurved streamline instabilities.",

However,\ncapturing its fluctuations on a sub-minute timescale is challenging due to the\nsparsity of the existing flow measuring tools. Here we present a virtual\nreality fine fingertip force control (F3C) task to induce flow, wherein the\ntask challenge is set at a compatible level with personal skill, and to track\nthe flow fluctuations from the synchronous force control performance. We\nextract eight performance metrics from the fingertip force sequence and reveal\ntheir significant differences under distinct flow states. Further, we built a\nflow decoder and demonstrated that the flow variations can be decoded using\nselected metrics. The predicted values reach significant correlation with the\nself-reported flow intensity (r=0.81). This study showcases the feasibility of\ntracking intrinsic flow variations with high temporal resolution using task\nperformance measures.",

Hence,\nobtaining reliable uncertainty estimates is crucial for prioritizing drug\nmolecules for subsequent experimental validation. Conformal Prediction (CP) is\na promising tool for creating such prediction sets for molecular properties\nwith a coverage guarantee. However, the exchangeability assumption of CP is\noften challenged with covariate shift in drug discovery tasks: Most datasets\ncontain limited labeled data, which may not be representative of the vast\nchemical space from which molecules are drawn. To address this limitation, we\npropose a method called CoDrug that employs an energy-based model leveraging\nboth training data and unlabelled data, and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to\nassess the densities of a molecule set. The estimated densities are then used\nto weigh the molecule samples while building prediction sets and rectifying for\ndistribution shift. In extensive experiments involving realistic distribution\ndrifts in various small-molecule drug discovery tasks, we demonstrate the\nability of CoDrug to provide valid prediction sets and its utility in\naddressing the distribution shift arising from de novo drug design models. On\naverage, using CoDrug can reduce the coverage gap by over 35% when compared to\nconformal prediction sets not adjusted for covariate shift.",

Here, we show that this key piece of\nfundamental physics has been hiding in plain sight for the past 60 years in the\nphysics of induction generators. We measure the amplification of an\nelectromagnetic field, generated by a toroid LC-circuit, scattered by an\naluminium cylinder spinning in the toroid gap. We show that when the Zel'dovich\ncondition is met, the resistance induced by the cylinder becomes negative\nimplying amplification of the incoming EM waves. These results reveal the\nconnection between the concept of induction generators and the physics of this\nfundamental effect that was believed to be unobservable, and hence open new\nprospects towards testing the Zel'dovich mechanism in the quantum regime, as\nwell as related quantum friction effects.",

Many intelligent systems, such as\nelectronic payment and identity verification, rely on face forgery detection.\nAlthough face forgery detection has successfully distinguished fake faces,\nrecent studies have demonstrated that face forgery detectors are very\nvulnerable to adversarial examples. Meanwhile, existing attacks rely on network\narchitectures or training datasets instead of the predicted labels, which leads\nto a gap in attacking deployed applications. To narrow this gap, we first\nexplore the decision-based attacks on face forgery detection. However, applying\nexisting decision-based attacks directly suffers from perturbation\ninitialization failure and low image quality. First, we propose cross-task\nperturbation to handle initialization failures by utilizing the high\ncorrelation of face features on different tasks. Then, inspired by using\nfrequency cues by face forgery detection, we propose the frequency\ndecision-based attack. We add perturbations in the frequency domain and then\nconstrain the visual quality in the spatial domain. Finally, extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack\nperformance on FaceForensics++, CelebDF, and industrial APIs, with high query\nefficiency and guaranteed image quality. Further, the fake faces by our method\ncan pass face forgery detection and face recognition, which exposes the\nsecurity problems of face forgery detectors.",

In the model, grains are represented by a collection of point\nparticles connected by bonds. A simple multibody interaction is introduced to\ncontrol Poisson's ratio and the arrangement of particles on the surface of a\ngrain is varied to model both high- and low-frictional grains. At low\npressures, the growth in packing fraction and coordination number follow the\nexpected behavior near jamming and exhibit friction dependence. As the pressure\nincreases, deviations from the low-pressure power-law scaling emerge after the\npacking fraction grows by approximately 0.1 and results from simulations with\ndifferent friction coefficients converge. These results are compared to\npredictions from traditional discrete element method simulations which,\ndepending on the definition of packing fraction and coordination number, may\nonly differ by a factor of two. As grains deform under compaction, the average\nvolumetric strain and asphericity, a measure of the change in the shape of\ngrains, are found to grow as power laws and depend heavily on the Poisson's\nratio of the constituent solid. Larger Poisson's ratios are associated with\nless volumetric strain and more asphericity and the apparent power-law exponent\nof the asphericity may vary. The elastic properties of the packed grains are\nalso calculated as a function of packing fraction. In particular, we find the\nPoisson's ratio near jamming is 1/2 but decreases to 1/4 before rising again as\nsystems densify.",

            "summary": "Latent Gaussian process (GP) models are flexible probabilistic non-parametric\nfunction models. Vecchia approximations are accurate approximations for GPs to\novercome computational bottlenecks for large data, and the Laplace\napproximation is a fast method with asymptotic convergence guarantees to\napproximate marginal likelihoods and posterior predictive distributions for\nnon-Gaussian likelihoods. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of\ncombined Vecchia-Laplace approximations grows faster than linearly in the\nsample size when used in combination with direct solver methods such as the\nCholesky decomposition. Computations with Vecchia-Laplace approximations thus\nbecome prohibitively slow precisely when the approximations are usually the\nmost accurate, i.e., on large data sets. In this article, we present several\niterative methods for inference with Vecchia-Laplace approximations which make\ncomputations considerably faster compared to Cholesky-based calculations. We\nanalyze our proposed methods theoretically and in experiments with simulated\nand real-world data. In particular, we obtain a speed-up of an order of\nmagnitude compared to Cholesky-based inference and a threefold increase in\nprediction accuracy in terms of the continuous ranked probability score\ncompared to a state-of-the-art method on a large satellite data set. All\nmethods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python\nand R packages.",

            "summary": "Large-scale pre-trained models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks\nthrough a new paradigm called prompt learning. In contrast to fine-tuning,\nprompt learning does not update the pre-trained model's parameters. Instead, it\nonly learns an input perturbation, namely prompt, to be added to the downstream\ntask data for predictions. Given the fast development of prompt learning, a\nwell-generalized prompt inevitably becomes a valuable asset as significant\neffort and proprietary data are used to create it. This naturally raises the\nquestion of whether a prompt may leak the proprietary information of its\ntraining data. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive privacy\nassessment of prompts learned by visual prompt learning through the lens of\nproperty inference and membership inference attacks. Our empirical evaluation\nshows that the prompts are vulnerable to both attacks. We also demonstrate that\nthe adversary can mount a successful property inference attack with limited\ncost. Moreover, we show that membership inference attacks against prompts can\nbe successful with relaxed adversarial assumptions. We further make some\ninitial investigations on the defenses and observe that our method can mitigate\nthe membership inference attacks with a decent utility-defense trade-off but\nfails to defend against property inference attacks. We hope our results can\nshed light on the privacy risks of the popular prompt learning paradigm. To\nfacilitate the research in this direction, we will share our code and models\nwith the community.",

Modeling UI elements is essential to user click\nbehavior prediction, while the complexity and variety of the UI make it\ndifficult to adequately capture the information of different scales. In\naddition, the lack of relevant datasets also presents difficulties for such\nstudies. In response to these challenges, we construct a fine-grained\nsmartphone usage behavior dataset containing 3,664,325 clicks of 100 users and\npropose a UI element spatial hierarchy aware smartphone user click behavior\nprediction method (SHA-SCP). SHA-SCP builds element groups by clustering the\nelements according to their spatial positions and uses attention mechanisms to\nperceive the UI at the element level and the element group level to fully\ncapture the information of different scales. Experiments are conducted on the\nfine-grained smartphone usage behavior dataset, and the results show that our\nmethod outperforms the best baseline by an average of 10.52%, 11.34%, and\n10.42% in Top-1 Accuracy, Top-3 Accuracy, and Top-5 Accuracy, respectively.",

Their accessibility for analytic\nconsiderations also opens up the possibility of prescreening datasets based on\ntheir potential for a quantum advantage. To do so, earlier works developed the\ngeometric difference, which can be understood as a closeness measure between\ntwo kernel-based machine learning approaches, most importantly between a\nquantum kernel and classical kernel. This metric links the quantum and\nclassical model complexities. Therefore, it raises the question of whether the\ngeometric difference, based on its relation to model complexity, can be a\nuseful tool in evaluations other than for the potential for quantum advantage.\nIn this work, we investigate the effects of hyperparameter choice on the model\nperformance and the generalization gap between classical and quantum kernels.\nThe importance of hyperparameter optimization is well known also for classical\nmachine learning. Especially for the quantum Hamiltonian evolution feature map,\nthe scaling of the input data has been shown to be crucial. However, there are\nadditional parameters left to be optimized, like the best number of qubits to\ntrace out before computing a projected quantum kernel. We investigate the\ninfluence of these hyperparameters and compare the classically reliable method\nof cross validation with the method of choosing based on the geometric\ndifference. Based on the thorough investigation of the hyperparameters across\n11 datasets we identified commodities that can be exploited when examining a\nnew dataset.

Counting the number of temporal butterflies is thus a\nfundamental task in analyzing temporal bipartite graphs. However, existing\nalgorithms for butterfly counting on static bipartite graphs and motif counting\non temporal unipartite graphs are inefficient for this purpose. In this paper,\nwe present a general framework with three sampling strategies for temporal\nbutterfly counting. Since exact counting can be time-consuming on large graphs,\nour approach alternatively computes approximate estimates accurately and\nefficiently. We also provide analytical bounds on the number of samples each\nstrategy requires to obtain estimates with small relative errors and high\nprobability.

To address these\nlimitations, our model consists of a continuous branch and a discrete branch.\nThe continuous branch follows the conventional pipeline to predict decomposed\nmaterials, while the discrete branch uses the VQ mechanism to quantize\ncontinuous materials into individual ones. By discretizing the materials, our\nmodel can reduce noise in the decomposition process and generate a segmentation\nmap of discrete materials. Specific materials can be easily selected for\nfurther editing by clicking on the corresponding area of the segmentation\noutcomes. Additionally, we propose a dropout-based VQ codeword ranking strategy\nto predict the number of materials in a scene, which reduces redundancy in the\nmaterial segmentation process.

To do this, we put forward a new hypernetwork\nbased model, called PudNet, which intends to learn a mapping between datasets\nand their corresponding network parameters, and then predicts parameters for\nunseen data with only a single forward propagation. Moreover, our model\nbenefits from a series of adaptive hyper recurrent units sharing weights to\ncapture the dependencies of parameters among different network layers.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves good\nefficacy for unseen image datasets on two kinds of settings: Intra-dataset\nprediction and Inter-dataset prediction.

            "summary": "This paper introduces a simple framework for accurately predicting the\nfatigue lifetime of notched components by employing various machine learning\nalgorithms applied to a wide range of materials, loading conditions, notch\ngeometries, and fatigue lives. Traditional approaches for this task have relied\non empirical relationships involving one of the mechanical properties, such as\nstress, strain, or energy. This study goes further by exploring which\nmechanical property serves as a better measure. The key idea of the framework\nis to use the gradient of the mechanical properties (stress, strain, and\nenergy) to distinguish between different notch geometries. To demonstrate the\naccuracy and broad applicability of the framework, it is initially validated\nusing isotropic materials, subsequently applied to samples produced through\nadditive manufacturing techniques, and ultimately tested on carbon fiber\nlaminated composites. The research demonstrates that the gradient of all three\nmeasures can be effectively employed to estimate fatigue lifetime, with\nstress-based predictions exhibiting the highest accuracy. Among the machine\nlearning algorithms investigated, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest yield the\nmost successful results. A noteworthy finding is the significant improvement in\nprediction accuracy achieved by incorporating new data generated based on the\nBasquin equation.",

We formalize stable perception as consensus\nachieved through components exchanging information. Our key finding is that\nrelationships between components influence monostable versus multistable\nperceptions. When components contain substitute information about the\nprediction target, stimuli display monostability. With complementary\ninformation, multistability arises. We then analyze phenomena like order\neffects and switching costs. Finally, we provide two additional perspectives.\nAn optimization perspective balances accuracy and communication costs, relating\nstability to local optima. A Prediction market perspective highlights the\nstrategic behaviors of neural coordination and provides insights into phenomena\nlike rivalry, inhibition, and mental disorders. The two perspectives\ndemonstrate how relationships among components influence perception costs, and\nimpact competition and coordination behaviors in neural dynamics.",

We\ninvestigate the synchronization phenomenon among the patches of the outer\nlayers by introducing higher-order interactions (specifically three-body\ninteractions) in the middle layer. We observe a decrease in the synchronous\nbehavior or, alternatively, an increase in desynchrony due to the inclusion of\ngroup interactions among the patches of the middle layer. The advancement of\ndesynchrony becomes more prominent with increasing strength and numbers of\nthree-way interactions in the middle layer. We analytically validated our\nnumerical results by performing the stability analysis of the referred\nsynchronous solution using the master stability function approach.\nAdditionally, we verify our findings by taking into account two distinct\npredator-prey models and dispersal topologies, which ultimately assert that the\nfindings are generalizable across various models and dispersal structures.",

            "summary": "In general, hand pose estimation aims to improve the robustness of model\nperformance in the real-world scenes. However, it is difficult to enhance the\nrobustness since existing datasets are obtained in restricted environments to\nannotate 3D information. Although neural networks quantitatively achieve a high\nestimation accuracy, unsatisfied results can be observed in visual quality.\nThis discrepancy between quantitative results and their visual qualities\nremains an open issue in the hand pose representation. To this end, we propose\na mesh represented recycle learning strategy for 3D hand pose and mesh\nestimation which reinforces synthesized hand mesh representation in a training\nphase. To be specific, a hand pose and mesh estimation model first predicts\nparametric 3D hand annotations (i.e., 3D keypoint positions and vertices for\nhand mesh) with real-world hand images in the training phase. Second, synthetic\nhand images are generated with self-estimated hand mesh representations. After\nthat, the synthetic hand images are fed into the same model again. Thus, the\nproposed learning strategy simultaneously improves quantitative results and\nvisual qualities by reinforcing synthetic mesh representation. To encourage\nconsistency between original model output and its recycled one, we propose\nself-correlation loss which maximizes the accuracy and reliability of our\nlearning strategy. Consequently, the model effectively conducts self-refinement\non hand pose estimation by learning mesh representation from its own output. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our learning strategy, we provide extensive\nexperiments on FreiHAND dataset. Notably, our learning strategy improves the\nperformance on hand pose and mesh estimation without any extra computational\nburden during the inference.",

            "summary": "Several theoretical approaches to disordered media predict that acoustic\nwaves should undergo a quartic increase in their attenuation coefficient with\nincreasing frequency in the sub-terahertz region. Such Rayleigh-type scattering\nwould be related to the anomalous low-temperature plateau in the thermal\nconductivity and to the so-called boson peak, i.e. an excess of vibrational\nmodes above the Debye density of states at around 1 THz. Brillouin scattering\nof light allows the measurement of sound absorption and velocity dispersion up\nto about 0.1 THz while inelastic x-ray scattering is limited to frequencies\nlarger than about 1 THz. We take advantage of the advent of ultrafast optical\ntechniques to explore the acoustical properties of amorphous SiO2 layers in the\ndifficult but crucial frequency region within this gap. A quartic scaling law\nwith frequency is clearly revealed between 0.2 and 0.9 THz, which is further\nshown to be independent of temperature. This strongly damped regime is\naccompanied by a decrease in the sound velocity already starting from about 0.5\nTHz, in line with theories. Our study assists to clarify the anomalous\nacoustical properties in glasses at frequencies entering the boson peak region.",

As a\nresult, even if there are, on occasion, exploitable patterns that could be\npicked up by machine-learning algorithms, these are obscured by feature and\nlabel noise rendering the predictions less useful, and risky in practice.\nTraditional rule-learning techniques developed for noisy data, such as CN2,\nwould seek only high precision rules and refrain from making predictions where\ntheir antecedents did not apply. We apply a similar approach, where a model\nabstains from making a prediction on data points that it is uncertain on.\nDuring training, a cascade of such models are learned in sequence, similar to\nrule lists, with each model being trained only on data on which the previous\nmodel(s) were uncertain. Similar pruning of data takes place at test-time, with\n(higher accuracy) predictions being made albeit only on a fraction (support) of\ntest-time data. In a financial prediction setting, such an approach allows\ndecisions to be taken only when the ensemble model is confident, thereby\nreducing risk. We present results using traditional MLPs as well as\ndifferentiable decision trees, on synthetic data as well as real financial\nmarket data, to predict fixed-term returns using commonly used features.

We propose the first approach for realistic 3D hand-object shape\nand pose reconstruction from a single depth map.

The model can simultaneously predict\nmultiple quantum properties, including not only expectation values of quantum\nobservables, but also general nonlinear functions of the quantum state, such as\nentanglement entropies. Remarkably, we find that multi-task training over a\ngiven set of quantum properties enables our model to discover new properties\noutside the original set. Without any labeled data, the model can perform\nunsupervised classification of quantum phases of matter and uncover unknown\nboundaries between different phases.",

The observed pattern of element\nabundances is unique to these stellar environments, and cannot be fully\nexplained by any proposed mechanism. It remains unclear whether stars form with\nchemical heterogeneity, or inherit it from interactions with other members.\nThese scenarios may be differentiated by the dependence of chemical spread on\nstellar mass; however, obtaining a sufficiently large mass baseline requires\nabundance measurements on the lower main sequence that is too faint for\nspectroscopy even in the nearest globular clusters. We developed a stellar\nmodelling method to obtain precise chemical abundances for stars near the end\nof the main sequence from multiband photometry, and applied it to the globular\ncluster 47 Tucanae. The computational efficiency is attained by matching\nchemical elements to the model components that are most sensitive to their\nabundance. We determined [O/Fe] for ~5000 members below the main sequence knee\nat the level of accuracy, comparable to the spectroscopic measurements of\nevolved members in literature. The inferred distribution disfavors stellar\ninteractions as the origin of chemical spread; however, an accurate theory of\naccretion is required to draw a more definitive conclusion.

Here we present a method, referred\nto as the building block method (BBM), for constructing possible spin-1/2 XXZ\nHeisenberg lattice systems possessing phantom helix states. We focus on two\ntypes of XXZ dimers as basic elements, with a non-Hermitian parity-time (PT )\nfield and Hermitian Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which share the\nsame degenerate eigenstates. Based on these two building blocks, one can\nconstruct a variety of Heisenberg quantum spin systems, which support helix\nstates with zero energy. The underlying mechanism is the existence of a set of\ndegenerate eigenstates. Furthermore, we show that such systems act as quantum\nspin graphs since they obey the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for sets of spin\nhelix states when the non-Hermitian PT fields cancel each other out. In\naddition, the dynamic response of the helix states for three types of\nperturbations is also investigated analytically and numerically.

Due to its ability of\nautomatically exploring clues of topic shift from abundant labeled data, recent\nsupervised neural models have greatly promoted the development of long document\ntopic segmentation, but leaving the deeper relationship between coherence and\ntopic segmentation underexplored. Therefore, this paper enhances the ability of\nsupervised models to capture coherence from both logical structure and semantic\nsimilarity perspectives to further improve the topic segmentation performance,\nproposing Topic-aware Sentence Structure Prediction (TSSP) and Contrastive\nSemantic Similarity Learning (CSSL). Specifically, the TSSP task is proposed to\nforce the model to comprehend structural information by learning the original\nrelations between adjacent sentences in a disarrayed document, which is\nconstructed by jointly disrupting the original document at topic and sentence\nlevels. Moreover, we utilize inter- and intra-topic information to construct\ncontrastive samples and design the CSSL objective to ensure that the sentences\nrepresentations in the same topic have higher similarity, while those in\ndifferent topics are less similar. Extensive experiments show that the\nLongformer with our approach significantly outperforms old state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods. Our approach improve $F_1$ of old SOTA by 3.42 (73.74 -> 77.16)\nand reduces $P_k$ by 1.11 points (15.0 -> 13.89) on WIKI-727K and achieves an\naverage relative reduction of 4.3% on $P_k$ on WikiSection.

To eliminate such inconsistency, in this study we propose a novel\nQuasi-Wasserstein (QW) loss with the help of the optimal transport defined on\ngraphs, leading to new learning and prediction paradigms of GNNs. In\nparticular, we design a \"Quasi-Wasserstein\" distance between the observed\nmulti-dimensional node labels and their estimations, optimizing the label\ntransport defined on graph edges. The estimations are parameterized by a GNN in\nwhich the optimal label transport may determine the graph edge weights\noptionally. By reformulating the strict constraint of the label transport to a\nBregman divergence-based regularizer, we obtain the proposed Quasi-Wasserstein\nloss associated with two efficient solvers learning the GNN together with\noptimal label transport. When predicting node labels, our model combines the\noutput of the GNN with the residual component provided by the optimal label\ntransport, leading to a new transductive prediction paradigm. Experiments show\nthat the proposed QW loss applies to various GNNs and helps to improve their\nperformance in node-level classification and regression tasks.",

Such a process\ncan be modeled by a function coined perceptual scale. The perceptual scale can\nbe deduced from psychophysical measurements that consist in comparing the\nrelative differences between stimuli (i.e. difference scaling experiments).\nHowever, this approach is often overlooked by the modeling and experimentation\ncommunities. Here, we demonstrate the value of measuring the perceptual scale\nof classical (spatial frequency, orientation) and less classical physical\nvariables (interpolation between textures) by embedding it in recent\nprobabilistic modeling of perception. First, we show that the assumption that\nan observer has an internal representation of univariate parameters such as\nspatial frequency or orientation while stimuli are high-dimensional does not\nlead to contradictory predictions when following the theoretical framework.\nSecond, we show that the measured perceptual scale corresponds to the\ntransduction function hypothesized in this framework. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that it is related to the Fisher information of the generative\nmodel that underlies perception and we test the predictions given by the\ngenerative model of different stimuli in a set a of difference scaling\nexperiments. Our main conclusion is that the perceptual scale is mostly driven\nby the stimulus power spectrum. Finally, we propose that this measure of\nperceptual scale is a way to push further the notion of perceptual distances by\nestimating the perceptual geometry of images i.e. the path between images\ninstead of simply the distance between those.",

In this work, we design a simple auditing method to measure\nmemorization in large ASR models without the extra compute overhead.\nConcretely, we speed up randomly-generated utterances to create a mapping\nbetween vocal and text information that is difficult to learn from typical\ntraining examples. Hence, accurate predictions only for sped-up training\nexamples can serve as clear evidence for memorization, and the corresponding\naccuracy can be used to measure memorization. Using the proposed method, we\nshowcase memorization in the state-of-the-art ASR models. To mitigate\nmemorization, we tried gradient clipping during training to bound the influence\nof any individual example on the final model. We empirically show that clipping\neach example's gradient can mitigate memorization for sped-up training examples\nwith up to 16 repetitions in the training set.

In this paper, we\npropose an effective registration method with dual branches decoupling for\npartial-to-partial registration, dubbed as DBDNet. Specifically, we introduce a\ndual branches structure to eliminate mutual interference error between rotation\nand translation by separately creating two individual correspondence matrices.\nFor partial-to-partial registration, we consider overlap prediction as a\npreordering task before the registration procedure. Accordingly, we present an\noverlap predictor that benefits from explicit feature interaction, which is\nachieved by the powerful attention mechanism to accurately predict pointwise\nmasks. Furthermore, we design a multi-resolution feature extraction network to\ncapture both local and global patterns thus enhancing both overlap prediction\nand registration module.

To incorporate 3D depth information with low cost, we\ndesign a novel depth position encoding method tailored for depth maps.\nFurthermore, we introduce a token-supervised prediction loss to provide\nstraightforward guidance for the task-related tokens. We evaluate our VST++\nmodel across various transformer-based backbones on RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T SOD\nbenchmark datasets.

            "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown great advances in a variety\nof tasks, including natural language understanding and generation. However,\ntheir use in high-stakes decision-making scenarios is still limited due to the\npotential for errors. Selective prediction is a technique that can be used to\nimprove the reliability of the LLMs by allowing them to abstain from making\npredictions when they are unsure of the answer. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework for adaptation with self-evaluation to improve the selective\nprediction performance of LLMs. Our framework is based on the idea of using\nparameter-efficient tuning to adapt the LLM to the specific task at hand while\nimproving its ability to perform self-evaluation. We evaluate our method on a\nvariety of question-answering (QA) datasets and show that it outperforms\nstate-of-the-art selective prediction methods. For example, on the CoQA\nbenchmark, our method improves the AUACC from 91.23% to 92.63% and improves the\nAUROC from 74.61% to 80.25%.",

            "summary": "Nonlinear light-matter interactions are typically enhanced by increasing the\nlocal field and its interaction time with matter. Conventional methods to\nachieve these goals are based on resonances or slow-light effects. However,\nthese methods suffer from various issues, including narrow operational\nbandwidths, large footprints, and material absorption. An interesting\nalternative approach to enhance the local field is offered by nonreciprocal\nsystems: by blocking the path of a unidirectional wave in a terminated\nnonreciprocal waveguiding structure, broadband electromagnetic fields can be\ndrastically enhanced and localized near the termination. This approach was\npreviously studied only in three-dimensional gyrotropic material platforms\nwhere the need for external magnets and bulky materials make it less practical.\nHere, instead, we employ a magnet-free mechanism to break reciprocity in 2D\nplasmonic materials, e.g., graphene. Specifically, we employ high-speed\ndrifting electrons on a voltage-biased graphene sheet to lift the\nforward/backward degeneracy of the surface plasmon-polariton dispersion,\ncreating modes with different propagation properties parallel and antiparallel\nto the current. We show that controllable, asymmetric, and intense field\nhot-spots are generated at the edges of a suitably terminated graphene\nmetasurface. We then theoretically demonstrate that such asymmetric field\nhot-spots offer an effective solution to enhance third-order nonlinear optical\neffects. As an example, we predict that, using realistic values of drift\nvelocity, high third-harmonic conversion efficiencies of up to 0.3 percent are\nachievable around the plasmon resonance frequencies.",

To address the challenge, we present Hetero$^2$Net,\na heterophily-aware HGNN that incorporates both masked metapath prediction and\nmasked label prediction tasks to effectively and flexibly handle both\nhomophilic and heterophilic heterogeneous graphs. We evaluate the performance\nof Hetero$^2$Net on five real-world heterogeneous graph benchmarks with varying\nlevels of heterophily.

To enhance practical performance and learning\nefficiency, we present an adjustment procedure for prediction of random\nparameters and a method-of-moments estimator for pretraining of variance\ncomponent. Various experiential studies and real data analyses confirm the\nadvantages of our proposed methods.",

Recently, these\nDirac fermions have been widely found in electronic systems, such as graphene\nand topological insulators. At the conceptual level, since the charge is not a\nprerequisite for Dirac fermions, the emergence of Dirac fermions without charge\ndegree of freedom has been theoretically predicted to be realized in Dirac\nquantum spin liquids. In such case, the Dirac quasiparticles are charge-neutral\nand carry a spin of 1/2, known as spinons. Despite of theoretical aspirations,\nspectra evidence of Dirac spinons remains elusive. Here we show that the spin\nexcitations of a kagome antiferromagnet,\nYCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], are conical with a spin continuum\ninside, which are consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. The\nspinon velocity obtained from the spin excitations also quantitatively\nreproduces the low-temperature specific heat of the sample. Interestingly, the\nlocations of the conical spin excitations differ from those calculated by the\nnearest neighbor Heisenberg model, suggesting an unexpected origin of the Dirac\nspinons. Our results thus provide strong spectra evidence for the Dirac\nquantum-spin-liquid state emerging in this kagome-lattice antiferromagnet.",

For example, the development of\ntopological band theory has delivered new approaches and tools to characterize\nthe electronic structure of materials, resulting in the discovery of new phases\nof matter with exotic properties. In the framework of topological band theory,\nthe crossings between energy levels of electrons are characterized by\ntopological invariants, which predict the presence of topological boundary\nstates. Given the frequency of energy level crossings on the potential energy\nsurface in molecules, the applicability of these concepts to molecular systems\ncould be of great interest for our understanding of reaction dynamics. However,\nchallenges arise due to differing quantum mechanical descriptions of solids and\nmolecules. Out work aims to bridge the gap between topological band theory and\nmolecular chemistry. We propose that the Euler Class, a topological invariant,\ncan be used to categorize and analyse the distribution of nonadiabatic\ncouplings on the potential energy surface. To exemplify this connection, we\nintroduce a model system with two distinct regimes that are characterized by\ndifferent values of the Euler Class, yet identical potential energy surfaces.\nContrary to expectations set by the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we propose\nthat these two regimes don't exhibit identical dynamics, due to a qualitatively\ndistinct distribution of nonadiabatic couplings.",

            "summary": "Language models typically tokenize text into subwords, using a deterministic,\nhand-engineered heuristic of combining characters into longer surface-level\nstrings such as 'ing' or whole words. Recent literature has repeatedly shown\nthe limitations of such a tokenization strategy, particularly for documents not\nwritten in English and for representing numbers. On the other extreme,\nbyte/character-level language models are much less restricted but suffer from\nincreased sequence description lengths and a subsequent quadratic expansion in\nself-attention computation. Recent attempts to compress and limit these context\nlengths with fixed size convolutions is helpful but completely ignores the word\nboundary. This paper considers an alternative 'learn your tokens' scheme which\nutilizes the word boundary to pool bytes/characters into word representations,\nwhich are fed to the primary language model, before again decoding individual\ncharacters/bytes per word in parallel. We find that our moderately expressive\nand moderately fast end-to-end tokenizer outperform by over 300% both subwords\nand byte/character models over the intrinsic language modeling metric of\nnext-word prediction across datasets. It particularly outshines on rare words,\noutperforming by a factor of 30! We extensively study the language modeling\nsetup for all three categories of tokenizers and theoretically analyze how our\nend-to-end models can also be a strong trade-off in efficiency and robustness.",

Work to date has explored the substantial\ndanger posed by the GRB to on-axis observers: here we focus instead on the\npotential threats posed to nearby off-axis observers. Our analysis is based\nlargely on observations of the GW 170817/GRB 170817A multi-messenger event, as\nwell as theoretical predictions. For baseline kilonova parameters, we find that\nthe X-ray emission from the afterglow may be lethal out to $\\sim 5$ pc and the\noff-axis gamma-ray emission may threaten a range out to $\\sim 4$ pc, whereas\nthe greatest threat comes years after the explosion, from the cosmic rays\naccelerated by the kilonova blast, which can be lethal out to distances up to\n$\\sim 11$ pc. The distances quoted here are typical, but the values have\nsignificant uncertainties and depend on the viewing angle, ejected mass, and\nexplosion energy in ways we quantify. Assessing the overall threat to\nEarth-like planets, have a similar kill distance to supernovae, but are far\nless common.

As a first approximation we can say that this solution computes\n$\\textrm{Tr}[e^{-iKT}]$, a trace of the \"evolution\" operator that generates\nSchwarzschild time translations on the two sided wormhole geometry. This point\nof view leads to a simple way to compute the normalization factor of the\nwormhole. When we have bulk matter fields, SSS suggested using a modified\nevolution $\\tilde K$ which involves a slightly complex geometry, so that we are\nreally computing $\\textrm{Tr}[e^{-i\\tilde{K}T}]$. We argue that, for general\nblack holes, the spectrum of $\\tilde K$ is given by quasinormal mode\nfrequencies. We explain that this reproduces various features that were\npreviously predicted from the spectral form factor on hydrodynamics grounds. We\nalso give a general algebraic construction of the modified boost in terms of\noperators constructed from half sided modular inclusions.

Rotational spectroscopy enables structure\ndetermination by providing accurate 3D information about small organic\nmolecules via their moments of inertia. Using these moments, Kraitchman\nanalysis determines isotopic substitution coordinates, which are the unsigned\n$|x|,|y|,|z|$ coordinates of all atoms with natural isotopic abundance,\nincluding carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. While unsigned substitution coordinates\ncan verify guesses of structures, the missing $+/-$ signs make it challenging\nto determine the actual structure from the substitution coordinates alone. To\ntackle this inverse problem, we develop KREED (Kraitchman\nREflection-Equivariant Diffusion), a generative diffusion model that infers a\nmolecule's complete 3D structure from its molecular formula, moments of\ninertia, and unsigned substitution coordinates of heavy atoms. KREED's top-1\npredictions identify the correct 3D structure with >98% accuracy on the QM9 and\nGEOM datasets when provided with substitution coordinates of all heavy atoms\nwith natural isotopic abundance. When substitution coordinates are restricted\nto only a subset of carbons, accuracy is retained at 91% on QM9 and 32% on\nGEOM. On a test set of experimentally measured substitution coordinates\ngathered from the literature, KREED predicts the correct all-atom 3D structure\nin 25 of 33 cases, demonstrating experimental applicability for context-free 3D\nstructure determination with rotational spectroscopy.",

            "summary": "The ability to detect intent in dialogue systems has become increasingly\nimportant in modern technology. These systems often generate a large amount of\nunlabeled data, and manually labeling this data requires substantial human\neffort. Semi-supervised methods attempt to remedy this cost by using a model\ntrained on a few labeled examples and then by assigning pseudo-labels to\nfurther a subset of unlabeled examples that has a model prediction confidence\nhigher than a certain threshold. However, one particularly perilous consequence\nof these methods is the risk of picking an imbalanced set of examples across\nclasses, which could lead to poor labels. In the present work, we describe\nTop-K K-Nearest Neighbor (TK-KNN), which uses a more robust pseudo-labeling\napproach based on distance in the embedding space while maintaining a balanced\nset of pseudo-labeled examples across classes through a ranking-based approach.\nExperiments on several datasets show that TK-KNN outperforms existing models,\nparticularly when labeled data is scarce on popular datasets such as CLINC150\nand Banking77.

            "summary": "Due to the popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, numerous\nbackdoor attacks are designed by adversaries to mislead deep neural network\npredictions by manipulating training samples and training processes. Although\nbackdoor attacks are effective in various real scenarios, they still suffer\nfrom the problems of both low fidelity of poisoned samples and non-negligible\ntransfer in latent space, which make them easily detectable by existing\nbackdoor detection algorithms. To overcome the weakness, this paper proposes a\nnovel frequency-based backdoor attack method named WaveAttack, which obtains\nimage high-frequency features through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to\ngenerate backdoor triggers. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric frequency\nobfuscation method, which can add an adaptive residual in the training and\ninference stage to improve the impact of triggers and further enhance the\neffectiveness of WaveAttack. Comprehensive experimental results show that\nWaveAttack not only achieves higher stealthiness and effectiveness, but also\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attack methods in the fidelity of\nimages by up to 28.27\\% improvement in PSNR, 1.61\\% improvement in SSIM, and\n70.59\\% reduction in IS.",

Second, we\ncontribute analyses of how well humans and supervised learning techniques can\npredict perceived robot performance based on different combinations of\nobservation types (e.g., facial, spatial, and map features). Our results show\nthat facial expressions alone provide useful information about human\nimpressions of robot performance; but in the navigation scenarios we tested,\nspatial features are the most critical piece of information for this inference\ntask. Also, when evaluating results as binary classification (rather than\nmulticlass classification), the F1-Score of human predictions and machine\nlearning models more than doubles, showing that both are better at telling the\ndirectionality of robot performance than predicting exact performance ratings.\nBased on our findings, we provide guidelines for implementing these predictions\nmodels in real-world navigation scenarios.",

            "summary": "In mass-transferring wide binary stellar systems, the companion star can\ncapture some of the mass released in wind by the primary evolved star, and form\nan accretion disk. Such accretion disks could evolve to form disks of\ncomparable properties to protoplanetary disks and may enable the formation of\nnew planets and/or the interactions, re-growth, and re-migration of\npre-existing planets in the newly formed disks. We study the formation and the\ndynamical evolution of such \"second generation\" (SG) protoplanetary disks in\nevolved wide binary systems, with primaries in the mass range of 1-8 Solar\nmass. We follow their evolution from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of\nthe red giant stellar donor until its evolution to become a white dwarf. We\nperform 1D semi-analytical numerical simulations for several binary systems\nvarying the mass of the evolved stellar donor and the initial orbital distance,\ntaking into account the changing mass-loss rates and the binary orbital\nexpansion due to mass-loss. We calculate the radial density profile of the\nformed SG accretion disk and its temperature profile, considering a\nnon-stationary viscosity profile which depends on the radial temperature\nprofile. We find that SG circumstellar disks evolve to form a long-lived stable\nstructure over the lifetime of the donor star, and we show that we can\nconsistently produce the observed conditions and accretion rate inferred for\nthe Mira evolved wide-binary system. The quasi-steady state radial surface\ndensity profiles are comparable with the typical range of masses and densities\nof observed (regular \"first-generation\") protoplanetary disks. This suggests\nthat realistic SG disks can give rise to a second phase of planet formation and\ndynamics in old wide binary systems.",

A\ncombination of experimental measurements and theory development form the basis\nof this work. For many cases, existing theory is sufficient but there are\nnuances leading to systemic errors in prediction which we address here. In\naddition, for certain cases there exist unexpected local minimum in $R_s$ found\nat temperatures above 0K. We compare here several alternative models for RF\nsurface resistivity those which incorporate thin film like behavior which we\nuse to predict the location of the local minimum in surface resistivity. Our\nexperimental results focus on C-band frequencies for the benefit of several\nfuture cryogenic linear accelerator concepts intended to operate in this\nregime. To this end we have measured factor of $2.89\\pm 0.05$ improvements in\nquality factor at $77$K and $4.61\\pm 0.05$ at 45K. We further describe the test\nsetup and cooling capabilities to address systematic issues associated with the\nmeasurements as well as a comparison of RF cavity preparation and the\nsignificant effect on $R_s$.

            "summary": "Asking questions is an important element of real-life collaboration on\nreasoning tasks like question answering. For example, a legal assistant chatbot\nmay be unable to make accurate recommendations without specific information on\nthe user's circumstances. However, large language models are usually deployed\nto solve reasoning tasks directly without asking follow-up questions to the\nuser or third parties. We term this problem task-oriented asking (TOA).\nZero-shot chat models can perform TOA, but their training is primarily based on\nnext-token prediction rather than whether questions contribute to successful\ncollaboration. To enable the training and evaluation of TOA models, we present\na definition and framework for natural language task-oriented asking, the\nproblem of generating questions that result in answers useful for a reasoning\ntask. We also present fact-level masking (FLM), a procedure for converting\nnatural language datasets into self-supervised TOA datasets by omitting\nparticular critical facts. Finally, we generate a TOA dataset from the HotpotQA\ndataset using FLM and evaluate several zero-shot language models on it. Our\nexperiments show that current zero-shot models struggle to ask questions that\nretrieve useful information, as compared to human annotators. These results\ndemonstrate an opportunity to use FLM datasets and the TOA framework to train\nand evaluate better TOA models.",

            "summary": "Probabilistic hierarchical time-series forecasting is an important variant of\ntime-series forecasting, where the goal is to model and forecast multivariate\ntime-series that have underlying hierarchical relations. Most methods focus on\npoint predictions and do not provide well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts\ndistributions. Recent state-of-art probabilistic forecasting methods also\nimpose hierarchical relations on point predictions and samples of distribution\nwhich does not account for coherency of forecast distributions. Previous works\nalso silently assume that datasets are always consistent with given\nhierarchical relations and do not adapt to real-world datasets that show\ndeviation from this assumption. We close both these gap and propose PROFHiT,\nwhich is a fully probabilistic hierarchical forecasting model that jointly\nmodels forecast distribution of entire hierarchy. PROFHiT uses a flexible\nprobabilistic Bayesian approach and introduces a novel Distributional Coherency\nregularization to learn from hierarchical relations for entire forecast\ndistribution that enables robust and calibrated forecasts as well as adapt to\ndatasets of varying hierarchical consistency. On evaluating PROFHiT over wide\nrange of datasets, we observed 41-88% better performance in accuracy and\nsignificantly better calibration. Due to modeling the coherency over full\ndistribution, we observed that PROFHiT can robustly provide reliable forecasts\neven if up to 10% of input time-series data is missing where other methods'\nperformance severely degrade by over 70%.",

This paper examines the\nquestion of how to optimally utilize uncertainty-quantified predictions in the\ndesign of online algorithms. In particular, we consider predictions augmented\nwith uncertainty quantification describing the likelihood of the ground truth\nfalling in a certain range, designing online algorithms with these\nprobabilistic predictions for two classic online problems: ski rental and\nonline search. In each case, we demonstrate that non-trivial modifications to\nalgorithm design are needed to fully leverage the probabilistic predictions.\nMoreover, we consider how to utilize more general forms of uncertainty\nquantification, proposing a framework based on online learning that learns to\nexploit uncertainty quantification to make optimal decisions in multi-instance\nsettings.",

The representation of semantic\nand topological properties in CityGML makes it possible to query such 3D city\ndata to perform analysis in various applications, e.g., security management and\nemergency response, energy consumption and estimation, and occupancy\nmeasurement. However, the potential of querying CityGML data has not been fully\nexploited. The official GML/XML encoding of CityGML is only intended as an\nexchange format but is not suitable for query answering. The most common way of\ndealing with CityGML data is to store them in the 3DCityDB system as relational\ntables and then query them with the standard SQL query language. Nevertheless,\nfor end users, it remains a challenging task to formulate queries over 3DCityDB\ndirectly for their ad-hoc analytical tasks, because there is a gap between the\nconceptual semantics of CityGML and the relational schema adopted in 3DCityDB.\nIn fact, the semantics of CityGML itself can be modeled as a suitable ontology.\nThe technology of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), where an ontology is at the core, is\na good solution to bridge such a gap. Moreover, embracing KGs makes it easier\nto integrate with other spatial data sources, e.g., OpenStreetMap and existing\n(Geo)KGs (e.g., Wikidata, DBPedia, and GeoNames), and to perform queries\ncombining information from multiple data sources.

Existing alignment algorithms can be\nexpensive to align for each group, requiring prohibitive amounts of\ngroup-specific preference data and computation for real-world use cases. We\nintroduce Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an alignment framework that\nsteers language models to preferences of individual groups in a few-shot\nmanner. In GPO, we augment the base LLM with an independent transformer module\ntrained to predict the preferences of a group for the LLM generations. For\nfew-shot learning, we parameterize this module as an in-context autoregressive\ntransformer and train it via meta-learning on several groups. We empirically\nvalidate the efficacy of GPO through rigorous evaluations using LLMs with\nvaried sizes on three human opinion adaptation tasks. These tasks involve\nadapting to the preferences of US demographic groups, global countries, and\nindividual users. Our results demonstrate that GPO not only aligns models more\naccurately but also requires fewer group-specific preferences, and less\ntraining and inference computing resources, outperforming existing strategies\nsuch as in-context steering and fine-tuning methods.",

            "summary": "Quantum addition based on the quantum Fourier transform can be an integral\npart of a quantum circuit and proved to be more efficient than the existing\nclassical ripple carry adder. Our study includes identifying the quantum\nresource required in a quantum adder in any arbitrary dimension and its\nrelationship with the performance indicator in the presence of local noise\nacting on the circuit and when a limited number of controlled rotation\noperations is permitted, a procedure known as banding. We analytically prove an\nupper bound on the number of the controlled rotation gates required to\naccomplish the quantum addition up to an arbitrary defect in the fidelity\nbetween the desired and imperfect output. When the environment interacts with\nindividual qudits, we establish a connection between quantum coherence and\nfidelity of the output. Interestingly, we demonstrate that when banding is\nemployed in the presence of noise, approximate circuits of constant depth\noutperform circuits with a higher number of controlled rotations, establishing\na complementary relationship between the approximate quantum adder and the\nstrength of the noise. We exhibit that utilizing magnetic fields to prepare an\ninitial state that evolves according to a one-dimensional spin chain for a\nspecific amount of time can be a potential technique to implement quantum\naddition circuits in many-body systems.",

            "summary": "Semi-analytic models (SAMs) systematically predict higher stellar-mass\nscatter at a given halo mass than hydrodynamical simulations and most empirical\nmodels. Our goal is to investigate the physical origin of this scatter by\nexploring modifications to the physics in the SAM Dark Sage. We design two\nblack hole formation models that approximate results from the IllustrisTNG\n300-1 hydrodynamical simulation. In the first model, we assign a fixed black\nhole mass of $10^{6}\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ to every halo that reaches\n$10^{10.5}\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. In the second model, we disregard any black\nhole growth as implemented in the standard Dark Sage model. Instead, we force\nall black hole masses to follow the median black hole mass-halo mass relation\nin IllustrisTNG 300-1 with a fixed scatter. We find that each model on its own\ndoes not significantly reduce the scatter in stellar mass. To do this, we\nreplace the native Dark Sage AGN feedback model with a simple model where we\nturn off cooling for galaxies with black hole masses above $10^{8}\\,\n\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. With this additional modification, the SMBH seeding and\nfixed conditional distribution models find a significant reduction in the\nscatter in stellar mass at halo masses between $10^{11-14}\\,\n\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. These results suggest that AGN feedback in SAMs acts in a\nqualitatively different way than feedback implemented in cosmological\nsimulations. Either or both may require substantial modification to match the\nempirically inferred scatter in the Stellar Mass Halo Mass Relation (SMHMR).",

            "summary": "According to observations and numerical simulations, the Milky Way could\nexhibit several spiral arm modes with multiple pattern speeds, wherein the\nslower patterns are located at larger Galactocentric distances. Our aim is to\nquantify the effects of the spiral arms on the azimuthal variations of the\nchemical abundances for oxygen, iron and for the first time for neutron-capture\nelements (europium and barium) in the Galactic disc. We assume a model based on\nmultiple spiral arm modes with different pattern speeds. The resulting model\nrepresents an updated version of previous 2D chemical evolution models. We\napply new analytical prescriptions for the spiral arms in a 2D Galactic disc\nchemical evolution model, exploring the possibility that the spiral structure\nis formed by the overlap of chunks with different pattern speeds and spatial\nextent. The predicted azimuthal variations in abundance gradients are dependent\non the considered chemical element. Elements synthesised on short time scales\n(i.e., oxygen and europium in this study) exhibit larger abundance\nfluctuations. In fact, for progenitors with short lifetimes, the chemical\nelements restored into the ISM perfectly trace the star formation perturbed by\nthe passage of the spiral arms. The map of the star formation rate predicted by\nour chemical evolution model with multiple patterns of spiral arms presents\narcs and arms compatible with those revealed by multiple tracers (young upper\nmain sequence stars, Cepheids, and distribution of stars with low radial\nactions). Finally, our model predictions are in good agreement with the\nazimuthal variations that emerged from the analysis of Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec [M/H]\nabundance ratios, if at most recent times the pattern speeds match the Galactic\nrotational curve at all radii.",

            "summary": "We forward model the difference in stellar age between post-coalescence\nmergers and a control sample with the same stellar mass, environmental density,\nand redshift. In particular, we use a pure sample of 445 post-coalescence\nmergers from the recent visually-confirmed post-coalescence merger sample\nidentified by Bickley et al. and find that post-coalescence mergers are on\naverage younger than control galaxies for $10<\\log\n(M_\\star/\\mathrm{M}_\\odot)<11$. The difference in age from matched controls is\nup to 1.5 Gyr, highest for lower stellar mass galaxies. We forward model this\ndifference using parametric star formation histories, accounting for the\npre-coalescence inspiral phase of enhanced star formation using close pair\ndata, and a final additive burst of star formation at coalescence. We find a\nbest-fitting stellar mass burst fraction of $f_\\mathrm{burst}=\\Delta\nM_\\star/M_{\\star,\\mathrm{merger}}=0.18 \\pm 0.02$ for $10<\\log\n(M_\\star/\\mathrm{M}_\\odot)<11$ galaxies, with no evidence of a trend in stellar\nmass. The modeled burst fraction is robust to choice of parametric star\nformation history, as well as differences in burst duration. The result appears\nconsistent with some prior observationally-derived values, but is significantly\nhigher than that found in hydrodynamical simulations. Using published Luminous\nInfraRed Galaxy (LIRG) star formation rates, we find a burst duration\nincreasing with stellar mass, from $120-250$ Myr. A comparison to published\ncold gas measurements indicates there is enough molecular gas available in very\nclose pairs to fuel the burst. Additionally, given our stellar mass burst\nestimate, the predicted cold gas fraction remaining after the burst is\nconsistent with observed post-coalescence mergers.",

            "summary": "Upcoming 21 cm intensity mapping experiments like the Square Kilometer Array\n(SKA) hold significant potential to constrain the properties of dark matter. In\nthis work, we model neutral hydrogen (HI) distributions using high-resolution\nhydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of both cold dark matter (CDM) and fuzzy\ndark matter (FDM) cosmologies in the post-reionization redshift range of\n$z=3.42-4.94$. We show that the HI abundance and the HI column density\ndistribution function decrease in FDM-like cosmologies. Extreme FDM models with\n$m\\sim 10^{-22}$ eV are at odds with a range of measurements. Due to the\nincreased halo bias, the HI bias increases, paralleled by the damped \\Lya \\\n(DLA) bias which we infer from the cross-section of DLAs. The DLA cross-section\ndistribution in extreme FDM models has a high median at the low-mass end, which\ncan be traced to the high column density of cosmic filaments. We study the\nprospects of detecting the brightest HI peaks with SKA1-Low at $z=4.94$,\nindicating moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at angular resolution\n$\\theta_A = 2^{\\prime}$ with a rapidly declining SNR for lower values of\n$\\theta_{A}$. After training the conditional normalizing flow network HIGlow on\n2D HI maps, we interpolate its latent space of axion masses to predict the peak\nflux for a new, synthetic FDM cosmology, finding good agreement with\nexpectations. This work thus underscores the potential of normalizing flows in\ncapturing complex, non-linear structures within HI maps, offering a versatile\ntool for conditional sample generation and prediction tasks.",

Thanks to self-calibrating observables,\nAMI accesses inner working angles down to and even within the classical\ndiffraction limit. The scientific potential of this mode has recently been\ndemonstrated by the Early Release Science (ERS) 1386 program with a deep search\nfor close-in companions in the HIP 65426 exoplanetary system. As part of ERS\n1386, we use the same dataset to explore the random, static, and calibration\nerrors of NIRISS AMI observables. We compare the observed noise properties and\nachievable contrast to theoretical predictions. We explore possible sources of\ncalibration errors, and show that differences in charge migration between the\nobservations of HIP 65426 and point-spread function calibration stars can\naccount for the achieved contrast curves. Lastly, we use self-calibration tests\nto demonstrate that with adequate calibration, NIRISS AMI can reach contrast\nlevels of $\\sim9-10$ mag. These tests lead us to observation planning\nrecommendations and strongly motivate future studies aimed at producing\nsophisticated calibration strategies taking these systematic effects into\naccount.

            "summary": "A star completely destroyed in a tidal disruption event (TDE) ignites a\nluminous flare that is powered by the fallback of tidally stripped debris to a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{\\bullet}$. We analyze two estimates\nfor the peak fallback rate in a TDE, one being the \"frozen-in\" model, which\npredicts a strong dependence of the time to peak fallback rate, $t_{\\rm peak}$,\non both stellar mass and age, with $15\\textrm{ days} \\lesssim t_{\\rm peak}\n\\lesssim 10$ yr for main sequence stars with masses $0.2\\le M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}\n\\le 5$ and $M_{\\bullet} = 10^6M_{\\odot}$. The second estimate, which postulates\nthat the star is completely destroyed when tides dominate the maximum stellar\nself-gravity, predicts that $t_{\\rm peak}$ is very weakly dependent on stellar\ntype, with $t_{\\rm peak} = \\left(23.2\\pm4.0\\textrm{\ndays}\\right)\\left(M_{\\bullet}/10^6M_{\\odot}\\right)^{1/2}$ for $0.2\\le\nM_{\\star}/M_{\\odot} \\le 5$, while $t_{\\rm peak} = \\left(29.8\\pm3.6\\textrm{\ndays}\\right)\\left(M_{\\bullet}/10^6M_{\\odot}\\right)^{1/2}$ for a Kroupa initial\nmass function truncated at $1.5 M_{\\odot}$. This second estimate also agrees\nclosely with hydrodynamical simulations, while the frozen-in model is\ndiscrepant by orders of magnitude. We conclude that (1) the time to peak\nluminosity in complete TDEs is almost exclusively determined by SMBH mass, and\n(2) massive-star TDEs power the largest accretion luminosities. Consequently,\n(a) decades-long extra-galactic outbursts cannot be powered by complete TDEs,\nincluding massive-star disruptions, and (b) the most highly super-Eddington\nTDEs are powered by the complete disruption of massive stars, which -- if\nresponsible for producing jetted TDEs -- would explain the rarity of jetted\nTDEs and their preference for young and star-forming host galaxies.",

Leading order string perturbation theory is used to obtain the\nbasic interaction rates in a flat background, which are shown to be consistent\nwith the random walk picture of highly excited strings that should apply in\nmore general backgrounds. Using the random walk interpretation we infer the\nstructure of more general semi-inclusive string scattering rates and then write\ndown the corresponding Boltzmann equations describing ensembles of highly\nexcited closed and open strings. We organise the interaction terms in Boltzmann\nequations so that detailed balance becomes manifest. We obtain the equilibrium\nsolutions and show that they reduce to previously computed solutions for $d=0$.\nWe further study the behaviour of non-equlibrium fluctuations and find explicit\nanalytic expressions for the equilibration rates (and for the number of open\nstrings in $d=0$).

            "summary": "Accurately predicting the future would be an important milestone in the\ncapabilities of artificial intelligence. However, research on the ability of\nlarge language models to provide probabilistic predictions about future events\nremains nascent. To empirically test this ability, we enrolled OpenAI's\nstate-of-the-art large language model, GPT-4, in a three-month forecasting\ntournament hosted on the Metaculus platform. The tournament, running from July\nto October 2023, attracted 843 participants and covered diverse topics\nincluding Big Tech, U.S. politics, viral outbreaks, and the Ukraine conflict.\nFocusing on binary forecasts, we show that GPT-4's probabilistic forecasts are\nsignificantly less accurate than the median human-crowd forecasts. We find that\nGPT-4's forecasts did not significantly differ from the no-information\nforecasting strategy of assigning a 50% probability to every question. We\nexplore a potential explanation, that GPT-4 might be predisposed to predict\nprobabilities close to the midpoint of the scale, but our data do not support\nthis hypothesis. Overall, we find that GPT-4 significantly underperforms in\nreal-world predictive tasks compared to median human-crowd forecasts. A\npotential explanation for this underperformance is that in real-world\nforecasting tournaments, the true answers are genuinely unknown at the time of\nprediction; unlike in other benchmark tasks like professional exams or time\nseries forecasting, where strong performance may at least partly be due to the\nanswers being memorized from the training data. This makes real-world\nforecasting tournaments an ideal environment for testing the generalized\nreasoning and prediction capabilities of artificial intelligence going forward.",

We\npropose a new reaction mechanism based on known experiments in the literature\nthat explains the synthesis of vitamin B$_3$.

While SGD noise is benign in the single-step action\nprediction objective, it results in catastrophic error accumulation over long\nhorizons, an effect we term gradient variance amplification (GVA). We show that\nmany standard mitigation techniques do not alleviate GVA, but find an\nexponential moving average (EMA) of iterates to be surprisingly effective at\ndoing so. We illustrate the generality of this phenomenon by showing the\nexistence of GVA and its amelioration by EMA in both continuous control and\nautoregressive language generation.

One such material, zincblende-derived Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), has shown\npromise due to its ideal band-gap size and high absorption coefficient.\nHowever, challenges such as structural defects and secondary phase formation\nhave hindered its development. In this study, we examine the potential of\nanother compound Cu2ZnSnO4 (CZTO) with a similar composition to CZTS as a\npromising alternative. Employing ab initio density function theory (DFT)\ncalculations in combination with an evolutionary structure prediction\nalgorithm, we identify that the crystalline phase of the delafossite structure\nis the most stable among the 900 (meta)stable CZTO. Its thermodynamic stability\nat room temperature is also confirmed by the molecular dynamics study.\nExcitingly, this new phase of CZTO displays a direct band gap where the\ndipole-allowed transition occurs, making it a strong candidate for efficient\nlight absorption. Furthermore, the estimation of spectroscopic limited maximum\nefficiency (SLME) directly demonstrates the high potential of delafossite-CZTO\nas a photovoltaic absorber.

            "summary": "Existing visual change detectors usually adopt CNNs or Transformers for\nfeature representation learning and focus on learning effective representation\nfor the changed regions between images. Although good performance can be\nobtained by enhancing the features of the change regions, however, these works\nare still limited mainly due to the ignorance of mining the unchanged\nbackground context information. It is known that one main challenge for change\ndetection is how to obtain the consistent representations for two images\ninvolving different variations, such as spatial variation, sunlight intensity,\netc. In this work, we demonstrate that carefully mining the common background\ninformation provides an important cue to learn the consistent representations\nfor the two images which thus obviously facilitates the visual change detection\nproblem. Based on this observation, we propose a novel Visual change\nTransformer (VcT) model for visual change detection problem. To be specific, a\nshared backbone network is first used to extract the feature maps for the given\nimage pair. Then, each pixel of feature map is regarded as a graph node and the\ngraph neural network is proposed to model the structured information for coarse\nchange map prediction. Top-K reliable tokens can be mined from the map and\nrefined by using the clustering algorithm. Then, these reliable tokens are\nenhanced by first utilizing self/cross-attention schemes and then interacting\nwith original features via an anchor-primary attention learning module.\nFinally, the prediction head is proposed to get a more accurate change map.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validated the\neffectiveness of our proposed VcT model.",

            "summary": "Query Performance Prediction (QPP) estimates the effectiveness of a search\nengine's results in response to a query without relevance judgments.\nTraditionally, post-retrieval predictors have focused upon either the\ndistribution of the retrieval scores, or the coherence of the top-ranked\ndocuments using traditional bag-of-words index representations. More recently,\nBERT-based models using dense embedded document representations have been used\nto create new predictors, but mostly applied to predict the performance of\nrankings created by BM25. Instead, we aim to predict the effectiveness of\nrankings created by single-representation dense retrieval models (ANCE &\nTCT-ColBERT). Therefore, we propose a number of variants of existing\nunsupervised coherence-based predictors that employ neural embedding\nrepresentations. In our experiments on the TREC Deep Learning Track datasets,\nwe demonstrate improved accuracy upon dense retrieval (up to 92% compared to\nsparse variants for TCT-ColBERT and 188% for ANCE). Going deeper, we select the\nmost representative and best performing predictors to study the importance of\ndifferences among predictors and query types on query performance. Using\nexisting distribution-based evaluation QPP measures and a particular type of\nlinear mixed models, we find that query types further significantly influence\nquery performance (and are up to 35% responsible for the unstable performance\nof QPP predictors), and that this sensitivity is unique to dense retrieval\nmodels. Our approach introduces a new setting for obtaining richer information\non query differences in dense QPP that can explain potential unstable\nperformance of existing predictors and outlines the unique characteristics of\ndifferent query types on dense retrieval models.",

            "summary": "Fairness, especially group fairness, is an important consideration in the\ncontext of machine learning systems. The most commonly adopted group\nfairness-enhancing techniques are in-processing methods that rely on a mixture\nof a fairness objective (e.g., demographic parity) and a task-specific\nobjective (e.g., cross-entropy) during the training process. However, when data\narrives in an online fashion -- one instance at a time -- optimizing such\nfairness objectives poses several challenges. In particular, group fairness\nobjectives are defined using expectations of predictions across different\ndemographic groups. In the online setting, where the algorithm has access to a\nsingle instance at a time, estimating the group fairness objective requires\nadditional storage and significantly more computation (e.g., forward/backward\npasses) than the task-specific objective at every time step. In this paper, we\npropose Aranyani, an ensemble of oblique decision trees, to make fair decisions\nin online settings. The hierarchical tree structure of Aranyani enables\nparameter isolation and allows us to efficiently compute the fairness gradients\nusing aggregate statistics of previous decisions, eliminating the need for\nadditional storage and forward/backward passes. We also present an efficient\nframework to train Aranyani and theoretically analyze several of its\nproperties. We conduct empirical evaluations on 5 publicly available benchmarks\n(including vision and language datasets) to show that Aranyani achieves a\nbetter accuracy-fairness trade-off compared to baseline approaches.",

            "summary": "In this work, we explore how a real time reading tracker can be built\nefficiently for children's voices. While previously proposed reading trackers\nfocused on ASR-based cascaded approaches, we propose a fully end-to-end model\nmaking it less prone to lags in voice tracking. We employ a pointer network\nthat directly learns to predict positions in the ground truth text conditioned\non the streaming speech. To train this pointer network, we generate ground\ntruth training signals by using forced alignment between the read speech and\nthe text being read on the training set. Exploring different forced alignment\nmodels, we find a neural attention based model is at least as close in\nalignment accuracy to the Montreal Forced Aligner, but surprisingly is a better\ntraining signal for the pointer network. Our results are reported on one adult\nspeech data (TIMIT) and two children's speech datasets (CMU Kids and Reading\nRaces). Our best model can accurately track adult speech with 87.8% accuracy\nand the much harder and disfluent children's speech with 77.1% accuracy on CMU\nKids data and a 65.3% accuracy on the Reading Races dataset.",

Integrated intensity maps of SO\nand SiO emission reveal a bipolar structure with blue-shifted emission\ndominantly extending to the SE from the centre of the hot core and red-shifted\nemission to the NW. This is also prominently observed in emission of other\nS-bearing molecules and species that only contain N as a heavy element,\nincluding COMs, but also CH3OH, CH3CHO, HNCO, and NH2CHO. For a selection of\nCOMs and simpler species, spectra were modelled under the assumption of LTE and\npopulation diagrams were derived at two positions, one in each outflow lobe.\nFrom this analysis, we obtained rotational temperatures, which are in a range\nof ~100-200K, and column densities. Abundances were subsequently compared to\npredictions of astrochemical models and to observations of L1157-B1, a position\nlocated in the well-studied outflow of the low-mass protostar L1157, and the\nsource G+0.693-0.027, located in the Sgr B2 molecular cloud complex. Given the\nshort distance of the analysed outflow positions to the centre of Sgr B2(N1),\nwe propose a scenario in which a phase of hot-core chemistry (i.e. thermal\ndesorption of ice species and high-temperature gas-phase chemistry) preceded a\nshock wave. The subsequent compression and further heating of the material\nresulted in the accelerated destruction of (mainly O-bearing) molecules.\nGas-phase formation of cyanides seems to be able to compete with their\ndestruction in the post-shock gas. Abundances of HCnN (n=3,5) are enhanced in\nthe outflow component pointing to (additional) gas-phase formation. To confirm\nsuch a scenario, appropriate chemical shock models need to be run.",

            "summary": "Selective robotic harvesting is a promising technological solution to address\nlabour shortages which are affecting modern agriculture in many parts of the\nworld. For an accurate and efficient picking process, a robotic harvester\nrequires the precise location and orientation of the fruit to effectively plan\nthe trajectory of the end effector. The current methods for estimating fruit\norientation employ either complete 3D information which typically requires\nregistration from multiple views or rely on fully-supervised learning\ntechniques, which require difficult-to-obtain manual annotation of the\nreference orientation. In this paper, we introduce a novel key-point-based\nfruit orientation estimation method allowing for the prediction of 3D\norientation from 2D images directly. The proposed technique can work without\nfull 3D orientation annotations but can also exploit such information for\nimproved accuracy. We evaluate our work on two separate datasets of strawberry\nimages obtained from real-world data collection scenarios. Our proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with an average error as low as\n$8^{\\circ}$, improving predictions by $\\sim30\\%$ compared to previous work\npresented in~\\cite{wagner2021efficient}.

The\nadvancement of artificial intelligence has led to the development of\ncomputational models to predict cancer cell line response to drug treatment. It\nis important to analyze the false positive rate (FPR) of the models, to\nincrease the number of effective treatments identified and to minimize\nunnecessary laboratory experimentation. Such analysis will also aid in\nidentifying drugs or cancer types that require more data collection to improve\nmodel predictions. This work uses an attention based neural network\nclassification model to identify responsive/non-responsive drug treatments\nacross multiple types of cancer cell lines. Two data filtering techniques have\nbeen applied to generate 10 data subsets, including removing samples for which\ndose response curves are poorly fitted and removing samples whose area under\nthe dose response curve (AUC) values are marginal around 0.5 from the training\nset. One hundred trials of 10-fold cross-validation analysis is performed to\ntest the model prediction performance on all the data subsets and the subset\nwith the best model prediction performance is selected for further analysis.\nSeveral error analysis metrics such as the false positive rate (FPR), and the\nprediction uncertainty are evaluated, and the results are summarized by cancer\ntype and drug mechanism of action (MoA) category. The FPR of cancer type spans\nbetween 0.262 and 0.5189, while that of drug MoA category spans almost the full\nrange of [0, 1]. This study identifies cancer types and drug MoAs with high\nFPRs. Additional drug screening data of these cancer and drug categories may\nimprove response modeling. Our results also demonstrate that the two data\nfiltering approaches help improve the drug response prediction performance.",

            "summary": "Code-switching (CS) speech refers to the phenomenon of mixing two or more\nlanguages within the same sentence. Despite the recent advances in automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR), CS-ASR is still a challenging task ought to the\ngrammatical structure complexity of the phenomenon and the data scarcity of\nspecific training corpus. In this work, we propose to leverage large language\nmodels (LLMs) and lists of hypotheses generated by an ASR to address the CS\nproblem. Specifically, we first employ multiple well-trained ASR models for\nN-best hypotheses generation, with the aim of increasing the diverse and\ninformative elements in the set of hypotheses. Next, we utilize the LLMs to\nlearn the hypotheses-to-transcription (H2T) mapping by adding a trainable\nlow-rank adapter. Such a generative error correction (GER) method directly\npredicts the accurate transcription according to its expert linguistic\nknowledge and N-best hypotheses, resulting in a paradigm shift from the\ntraditional language model rescoring or error correction techniques.\nExperimental evidence demonstrates that GER significantly enhances CS-ASR\naccuracy, in terms of reduced mixed error rate (MER). Furthermore, LLMs show\nremarkable data efficiency for H2T learning, providing a potential solution to\nthe data scarcity problem of CS-ASR in low-resource languages.",

            "summary": "Monocular 3D object detection is an inherently ill-posed problem, as it is\nchallenging to predict accurate 3D localization from a single image. Existing\nmonocular 3D detection knowledge distillation methods usually project the LiDAR\nonto the image plane and train the teacher network accordingly. Transferring\nLiDAR-based model knowledge to RGB-based models is more complex, so a general\ndistillation strategy is needed. To alleviate cross-modal prob-lem, we propose\nMonoSKD, a novel Knowledge Distillation framework for Monocular 3D detection\nbased on Spearman correlation coefficient, to learn the relative correlation\nbetween cross-modal features. Considering the large gap between these features,\nstrict alignment of features may mislead the training, so we propose a looser\nSpearman loss. Furthermore, by selecting appropriate distillation locations and\nremoving redundant modules, our scheme saves more GPU resources and trains\nfaster than existing methods. Extensive experiments are performed to verify the\neffectiveness of our framework on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection\nbenchmark. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance until submission\nwith no additional inference computational cost. Our codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/Senwang98/MonoSKD",

            "summary": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide.\nPatients with suspected CAD undergo coronary CT angiography (CCTA) to evaluate\nthe risk of cardiovascular events and determine the treatment. Clinical\nanalysis of coronary arteries in CCTA comprises the identification of\natherosclerotic plaque, as well as the grading of any coronary artery stenosis\ntypically obtained through the CAD-Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS). This\nrequires analysis of the coronary lumen and plaque. While voxel-wise\nsegmentation is a commonly used approach in various segmentation tasks, it does\nnot guarantee topologically plausible shapes. To address this, in this work, we\npropose to directly infer surface meshes for coronary artery lumen and plaque\nbased on a centerline prior and use it in the downstream task of CAD-RADS\nscoring. The method is developed and evaluated using a total of 2407 CCTA\nscans. Our method achieved lesion-wise volume intraclass correlation\ncoefficients of 0.98, 0.79, and 0.85 for calcified, non-calcified, and total\nplaque volume respectively. Patient-level CAD-RADS categorization was evaluated\non a representative hold-out test set of 300 scans, for which the achieved\nlinearly weighted kappa ($\\kappa$) was 0.75. CAD-RADS categorization on the set\nof 658 scans from another hospital and scanner led to a $\\kappa$ of 0.71. The\nresults demonstrate that direct inference of coronary artery meshes for lumen\nand plaque is feasible, and allows for the automated prediction of routinely\nperformed CAD-RADS categorization.",

A realistic scene can be well\nmodeled as a collection of rigidly moving parts, therefore its scene flow can\nbe represented as a combination of the rigid motion of these individual parts.\nBuilding upon this observation, we propose to generate pseudo scene flow labels\nfor self-supervised learning through piecewise rigid motion estimation, in\nwhich the source point cloud is decomposed into local regions and each region\nis treated as rigid. By rigidly aligning each region with its potential\ncounterpart in the target point cloud, we obtain a region-specific rigid\ntransformation to generate its pseudo flow labels. To mitigate the impact of\npotential outliers on label generation, when solving the rigid registration for\neach region, we alternately perform three steps: establishing point\ncorrespondences, measuring the confidence for the correspondences, and updating\nthe rigid transformation based on the correspondences and their confidence. As\na result, confident correspondences will dominate label generation and a\nvalidity mask will be derived for the generated pseudo labels. By using the\npseudo labels together with their validity mask for supervision, models can be\ntrained in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on FlyingThings3D\nand KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance in self-supervised scene flow learning, without any ground truth\nscene flow for supervision, even performing better than some supervised\ncounterparts. Additionally, our method is further extended to class-agnostic\nmotion prediction and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nself-supervised methods on nuScenes dataset.",

The methodology is\ndesigned for obtaining fine scale fluctuations from neural networks in a local\nmanner. The network is capable of locally correcting a coarse finite element\nsolution towards a fine solution taking the source term and the coarse\napproximation as input. Key observation is the dependency between quality of\npredictions and the size of training set which consists of different source\nterms and corresponding fine & coarse solutions. We provide the a priori error\nanalysis of the method together with the stability analysis of the neural\nnetwork. The numerical experiments confirm the capability of the network\npredicting fine finite element solutions. We also illustrate the generalization\nof the method to problems where test and training domains differ from each\nother.",

            "summary": "We present a theoretical model to study the effect of counterion size on the\neffective charge, size, and thermodynamic behavior of a single, isolated, and\nflexible polyelectrolyte (PE) chain. We analyze how altering counterion size\nmodifies the energy and entropy contributions to the system, including the\nion-pair free energy, excluded volume interactions, entropy of free and\ncondensed ions, and dipolar attraction among monomer-counterion pairs, which\nresult in competing effects challenging intuitive predictions. The PE self\nenergy is calculated using Edwards-Muthukumar Hamiltonian, considering a\nGaussian monomer distribution for the PE. The condensed ions are assumed\nconfined within a cylindrical volume around the PE backbone. The dipolar and\nexcluded volume interactions are described by the second and third virial\ncoefficients. Assumption of freely-rotating dipoles results in a first-order\ncoil-globule transition of the PE chain. A more realistic weaker dipolar\nattraction, parameterized in our theory, shifts it to a second-order continuous\ntransition. We calculate the size scaling-exponent of the PE and find exponents\naccording to the relative dominance of the electrostatic, excluded volume, or\ndipolar effects. We further identify the entropy- and energy-driven regimes of\nthe effective charge and conformation of the PE, highlighting the interplay of\nfree ion entropy and ion-pair energy with varying electrostatic strengths. The\ncrossover strength, dependent on the counterion size, indicates that\ndiminishing sizes favor counterion condensation at the expense of free ion\nentropy. The predictions of the model are consistent with trends in\nsimulations, and generalize findings of the point-like counterion theories.",

However,\nthese methods train KG embeddings and neural set operators concurrently on both\nsimple (one-hop) and complex (multi-hop and logical) queries, which causes\nperformance degradation on simple queries and low training efficiency. In this\npaper, we propose Query to Triple (Q2T), a novel approach that decouples the\ntraining for simple and complex queries. Q2T divides the training into two\nstages: (1) Pre-training a neural link predictor on simple queries to predict\ntail entities based on the head entity and relation. (2) Training a query\nencoder on complex queries to encode diverse complex queries into a unified\ntriple form that can be efficiently solved by the pretrained neural link\npredictor. Our proposed Q2T is not only efficient to train, but also modular,\nthus easily adaptable to various neural link predictors that have been studied\nwell.

            "summary": "Fabry-Perot microcavities can strongly enhance interactions between light and\nmolecules, leading to the formation of hybrid light-matter states known as\npolaritons. Polaritons possess much smaller effective masses and much larger\ngroup velocities when the molecules are resonant with cavity modes that have\nfinite (non-zero) in-plane wavevectors, giving rise to the possibilities of\nlong-range and ultrafast ballistic transport. In this paper, we present results\nof numerical simulations of the ultrafast ballistic transport phenomenon in\nreal space and time during and after initialization with a short, spatially\nlocalized pulse. We find that the transport of the molecular excitons as\ninduced by the external light field is synchronized with the evolution of the\nenhanced and localized electromagnetic field inside the cavity. Moreover, the\nsynchronized transport rate is in good agreement with the group velocities\npredicted from a calculated dispersion relation across a wide range of\nfrequencies. These simulations provide an intuitive tool for understanding the\ncollective motion of light and excitons and helps to better understand how\nexperimental observations of polaritons should be interpreted.",

The atrioventricular\n(AV) node plays a vital role in regulating heart rate during AF, but is often\ninsufficient in regards to maintaining a healthy heart rate. Thus, the AV node\nproperties are modified using rate-control drugs. Hence, quantifying individual\ndifferences in diurnal and short-term variability of AV-nodal function could\naid in personalized treatment selection.\n  This study presents a novel methodology for estimating the refractory period\n(RP) and conduction delay (CD) trends and their uncertainty in the two pathways\nof the AV node during 24 hours using non-invasive data. This was achieved using\na network model together with a problem-specific genetic algorithm and an\napproximate Bayesian computation algorithm. Diurnal and short-term variability\nin the estimated RP and CD was quantified by the difference between the daytime\nand nighttime estimates and by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between adjacent\n10-minute segments in the 24-hour trends.\n  Holter ECGs from 51 patients with permanent AF during baseline were analyzed,\nand the predictive power of variations in RP and CD on the resulting heart rate\nreduction after treatment with four rate control drugs was investigated.\nDiurnal variability yielded no correlation to treatment outcome, and no\nprediction of drug outcome was possible using the machine learning tools.\nHowever, a correlation between the short-term variability for the RP and CD in\nthe fast pathway and resulting heart rate reduction during treatment with\nmetoprolol ($\\rho=0.48, p<0.005$ in RP, $\\rho=0.35, p<0.05$ in CD) were found.\n  The proposed methodology enables non-invasive estimation of the AV node\nproperties during 24 hours, which may have the potential to assist in treatment\nselection.",

This non-linear inverse problem is known to\nsuffer from severe ill-posedness. As for any other phase retrieval problem,\nconstructive recovery is a notoriously delicate affair due to the lack of\nconvexity. One of the fundamental insights in this line of research is that the\nconnectivity of the measurements is both necessary and sufficient for\nreconstruction of phase information to be theoretically possible. In this\narticle we propose a reconstruction algorithm which is based on solving two\nconvex problems and, as such, amenable to numerical analysis. We show,\nempirically as well as analytically, that the scheme accurately reconstructs\nfrom noisy data within the connected regime.Moreover, to emphasize the\npracticability of the algorithm we argue that both convex problems can actually\nbe reformulated as semi-definite programs for which efficient solvers are\nreadily available.

While in the presence of static\ndisorder, the effects on a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type superfluid are\npredicted to be much smaller compared to a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC), we find that the quantum properties of a resonantly interacting, unitary\nFermi gas are more strongly suppressed in the presence of quenched disorder\nthan in a molecular BEC. For quenches from a disordered potential, we find that\nthe unitary Fermi gas never recovers quantum hydrodynamics for all parameters\nstudied, while a molecular BEC always recovers quantum hydrodynamics, even when\nthe quench leads to strong particle losses of up to 70 %. Temperature\nmeasurements indicate an additional heating channel specific to gases close to\nresonant interactions, leading to strong local dephasing or pair breaking. Our\nwork illustrates the striking difference between the nonequilibrium phase\ndiagram of the time-dependent disordered BEC-BCS crossover compared to that of\nthe static-disorder case.

Through a\ncomprehensive analysis of 20 spectroscopic observations acquired between 2003\nand 2018, we studied the striking deformations of various BEL profiles and\ndetermined the sizes of their respective emitting regions. Our approach\ninvolves a detailed analysis of the magnitude differences in the BEL wings and\ntheir adjacent continua, and the implementation of a statistical model to\nquantify the distribution and impact of microlensing magnifications. To ensure\na reliable baseline for no microlensing, we used the emission line cores as a\nreference. We then applied a Bayesian estimate to derive the size lower limits\nof the Ly$\\alpha$, Si IV, C IV, C III], and Mg II emitting regions, as well as\nthe sizes of the underlying continuum-emitting sources. We analyzed the\noutstanding microlensing-induced distortions in the line profiles of various\nBELs in the quasar image A, characterized by a prominent magnification of the\nblue part and a strong demagnification of the red part. From the statistics of\nmicrolensing magnifications and using Bayesian methods, we estimate the lower\nlimit to the overall size of the regions emitting the BELs to be a few lt-days\nacross, which is significantly smaller than in typically lensed quasars. The\nasymmetric deformations in the BELs indicate that the broad-line region is\ngenerally not spherically symmetric, and is likely confined to a plane and\nfollowing the motions of the accretion disk. Additionally, the inferred\ncontinuum-emitting region sizes are larger than predictions based on standard\nthin-disk theory by a factor of $\\sim$3.6 on average. The size-wavelength\nrelation is consistent with that of a geometrically thin and optically thick\naccretion disk.",

            "summary": "It has been observed that machine learning algorithms exhibit biased\npredictions against certain population groups. To mitigate such bias while\nachieving comparable accuracy, a promising approach is to introduce surrogate\nfunctions of the concerned fairness definition and solve a constrained\noptimization problem. However, it is intriguing in previous work that such\nfairness surrogate functions may yield unfair results and high instability. In\nthis work, in order to deeply understand them, taking a widely used fairness\ndefinition--demographic parity as an example, we show that there is a\nsurrogate-fairness gap between the fairness definition and the fairness\nsurrogate function. Also, the theoretical analysis and experimental results\nabout the gap motivate us that the fairness and stability will be affected by\nthe points far from the decision boundary, which is the large margin points\nissue investigated in this paper. To address it, we propose the general sigmoid\nsurrogate to simultaneously reduce both the surrogate-fairness gap and the\nvariance, and offer a rigorous fairness and stability upper bound.\nInterestingly, the theory also provides insights into two important issues that\ndeal with the large margin points as well as obtaining a more balanced dataset\nare beneficial to fairness and stability. Furthermore, we elaborate a novel and\ngeneral algorithm called Balanced Surrogate, which iteratively reduces the gap\nto mitigate unfairness. Finally, we provide empirical evidence showing that our\nmethods consistently improve fairness and stability while maintaining accuracy\ncomparable to the baselines in three real-world datasets.",

In this study, a new algorithm\nfor the detection of deepfakes in digital videos is presented, focusing on the\nmain goal of creating a fast and explainable method from a forensic\nperspective. To achieve this goal, the I-frames were extracted in order to\nprovide faster computation and analysis than approaches described in\nliterature.

            "summary": "We introduce a novel strategy to train randomised predictors in federated\nlearning, where each node of the network aims at preserving its privacy by\nreleasing a local predictor but keeping secret its training dataset with\nrespect to the other nodes. We then build a global randomised predictor which\ninherits the properties of the local private predictors in the sense of a\nPAC-Bayesian generalisation bound. We consider the synchronous case where all\nnodes share the same training objective (derived from a generalisation bound),\nand the asynchronous case where each node may have its own personalised\ntraining objective. We show through a series of numerical experiments that our\napproach achieves a comparable predictive performance to that of the batch\napproach where all datasets are shared across nodes. Moreover the predictors\nare supported by numerically nonvacuous generalisation bounds while preserving\nprivacy for each node. We explicitly compute the increment on predictive\nperformance and generalisation bounds between batch and federated settings,\nhighlighting the price to pay to preserve privacy.",

            "summary": "I unveil a novel variant of Anderson localization. This emergent phenomenon\npertains to the motion of a dopant in a thermal spin lattice, rendered\nlocalized by thermal fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to the intrinsic\norigin of localization for quenched disorder. The system of interest consists\nof spin-$1/2$ particles organized in a two-leg ladder with nearest neighbor\nIsing interactions $J$. The motion of a hole -- the dopant -- is initialized by\nsuddenly removing a spin from the thermal spin ensemble, which then moves along\nthe ladder via nearest neighbor hopping $t$. I find that the hole remains\n\\emph{localized} for all values of $J/t$ and for \\emph{all} nonzero\ntemperatures. The origin is an effective disorder potential seen by the hole\nand induced by thermal spin fluctuations. Its length scale is found to match\nwith the underlying spin-spin correlation length at low temperatures. For\nferromagnetic couplings ($J<0$), the associated localization length of the hole\nincreases with decreasing temperature and becomes proportional to the\ncorrelation length at low temperatures, asymptotically delocalizing at low\ntemperatures. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J>0$), there is a smooth\ncrossover between thermal localization at high temperatures to localization\ndriven by the antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures. At infinite\ntemperatures, the dynamics becomes independent of the sign of the spin\ncoupling, whereby the localization length is a universal function of $|J|/t$,\ndiverging as $(t/|J|)^{5/3}$ for $|J| \\ll t$. Finally, I analyze a setup with\nRydberg-dressed atoms, which naturally realizes finite range Ising\ninteractions, accessible in current experimental setups. I show that the\ndiscovered localization phenomenon can be probed on experimentally accessible\nlength- and timescales, providing a strong testing ground for my predictions.",

            "summary": "Reconstructing 3D shape and pose of static objects from a single image is an\nessential task for various industries, including robotics, augmented reality,\nand digital content creation. This can be done by directly predicting 3D shape\nin various representations or by retrieving CAD models from a database and\npredicting their alignments. Directly predicting 3D shapes often produces\nunrealistic, overly smoothed or tessellated shapes. Retrieving CAD models\nensures realistic shapes but requires robust and accurate alignment. Learning\nto directly predict CAD model poses from image features is challenging and\ninaccurate. Works, such as ROCA, compute poses from predicted normalised object\ncoordinates which can be more accurate but are susceptible to systematic\nfailure. SPARC demonstrates that following a ''render-and-compare'' approach\nwhere a network iteratively improves upon its own predictions achieves accurate\nalignments. Nevertheless, it performs individual CAD alignment for every object\ndetected in an image. This approach is slow when applied to many objects as the\ntime complexity increases linearly with the number of objects and can not learn\ninter-object relations. Introducing a new network architecture Multi-SPARC we\nlearn to perform CAD model alignments for multiple detected objects jointly.\nCompared to other single-view methods we achieve state-of-the-art performance\non the challenging real-world dataset ScanNet.

Actually, even whether Al is overabundant or underabundant in Am\nstars is not clarified. This is presumably because most of the previous studies\nemployed the Al I 3944/3961 lines with the assumption of LTE, despite that a\nconsiderable non-LTE effect is expected in this resonance doublet. With an aim\nto shed light on this issue, extensive statistical-equilibrium calculations on\nAl I/Al II were carried out for a wide range of atmospheric parameters, based\non which the non-LTE Al abundances were determined by applying the\nspectrum-fitting technique to the Al I 3944/3961 lines for 63 A-type dwarfs\n(7000 < Teff < 10000 K) of comparatively lower rotational velocities (vsini <\n100 km/s). The following results were obtained. (1) The non-LTE corrections\n(Delta) are positive (reflecting the importance of overionization) and\nsignificantly large (0.3 < Delta < 1.0 dex depending on Teff; generally\nDelta_3944 < Delta_3961). (2) By applying these corrections (and indispensable\ninclusion of Balmer line wings as background opacity), consistent non-LTE\nabundances for both lines could be obtained, and the serious zero-point\ndiscrepancy (considerably negative [Al/H] for normal metallicity stars of\n[Fe/H]~ 0) found in old studies has been settled. (3) Al abundances of A-type\nstars are almost in proportion to [Fe/H] (tending to be overabundant in Am\nstars) with an approximate relation of [Al/H]~1.2[Fe/H]. which is qualitatively\nconsistent with the prediction of the diffusion theory (suggesting an Al excess\nin the photosphere of Am stars).",

Although recent deep learning methods show great potential\nin anomaly detection, they do not explicitly capture spatial-temporal\nrelationships between univariate time series of different modalities, resulting\nin more false negatives and false positives. In this paper, we propose a\nmultimodal spatial-temporal graph attention network (MST-GAT) to tackle this\nproblem. MST-GAT first employs a multimodal graph attention network (M-GAT) and\na temporal convolution network to capture the spatial-temporal correlation in\nmultimodal time series. Specifically, M-GAT uses a multi-head attention module\nand two relational attention modules (i.e., intra- and inter-modal attention)\nto model modal correlations explicitly. Furthermore, MST-GAT optimizes the\nreconstruction and prediction modules simultaneously. Experimental results on\nfour multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that MST-GAT outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis indicates that MST-GAT strengthens\nthe interpretability of detected anomalies by locating the most anomalous\nunivariate time series.",

We propose a novel alternative\napproach in which a human and an autoregressive model together co-create a\nharmonic annotation for an audio track. After automatically generating harmony\npredictions, a human sparsely annotates parts with low model confidence and the\nmodel then adjusts its predictions following human guidance.

To predict which compounds could be\nused as such tracers, it is therefore essential to study how photochemical\nprocesses affect their abundances. For this purpose, we investigated\nexperimentally the efficiency of the photochemical formation of hydrocarbons in\ngas mixtures representative of warm gas giant atmospheres as a function of the\ngas temperature at millibar pressures. We find that, compared to thermal\nreactions alone, photochemistry efficiently promotes, under the studied\nconditions, the formation of hydrocarbons, with the detection of acetylene,\nethane, and propane, as well as carbon monoxide. Therefore, our results confirm\nthe importance of photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres as a disequilibrium\nprocess. Ethane is the major hydrocarbon formed in our experiments, in apparent\ncontradiction with the prediction by thermophotochemical models that acetylene\nshould be the main hydrocarbon product. We also observe an evolution of the\nhydrocarbon production efficiency as a function of the temperature, a behavior\nnot reproduced by a 0D thermophotochemical model. Additional studies are\nnecessary to definitively understand the origin of the differences between the\nexperimental and modeling results and to infer the importance of our results\nfor understanding hydrocarbon formation in warm gas giant exoplanet\natmospheres. Finally, our work demonstrates the importance of experimental\nstudies together with modeling studies to accurately interpret, understand, and\npredict observations of exoplanet atmospheres.",

            "summary": "Radon is a carcinogenic, radioactive gas that can accumulate indoors. Indoor\nradon exposure at the national scale is usually estimated on the basis of\nextensive measurement campaigns. However, characteristics of the sample often\ndiffer from the characteristics of the population due to the large number of\nrelevant factors such as the availability of geogenic radon or floor level.\nFurthermore, the sample size usually does not allow exposure estimation with\nhigh spatial resolution. We propose a model-based approach that allows a more\nrealistic estimation of indoor radon distribution with a higher spatial\nresolution than a purely data-based approach. We applied a two-stage modelling\napproach: 1) a quantile regression forest using environmental and building data\nas predictors was applied to estimate the probability distribution function of\nindoor radon for each floor level of each residential building in Germany; (2)\na probabilistic Monte Carlo sampling technique enabled the combination and\npopulation weighting of floor-level predictions. In this way, the uncertainty\nof the individual predictions is effectively propagated into the estimate of\nvariability at the aggregated level. The results give an arithmetic mean of 63\nBq/m3, a geometric mean of 41 Bq/m3 and a 95 %ile of 180 Bq/m3. The exceedance\nprobability for 100 Bq/m3 and 300 Bq/m3 are 12.5 % (10.5 million people) and\n2.2 % (1.9 million people), respectively. In large cities, individual indoor\nradon exposure is generally lower than in rural areas, which is a due to the\ndifferent distribution of the population on floor levels. The advantages of our\napproach are 1) an accurate exposure estimation even if the survey was not\nfully representative with respect to the main controlling factors, and 2) an\nestimate of the exposure distribution with a much higher spatial resolution\nthan basic descriptive statistics.",

In this paper, we\nseek to produce small scale models of IPG that can be handled within the scheme\nof Density Functional Theory (DFT) to study the electronic structure of this\nmaterial. The starting models generated using Monte Carlo (MC) method [S. Singh\nand S. Chandra, Comp. Mat.

The equilibrated structure at\nthis temperature was then force-relaxed using conjugate-gradient (CG)\noptimization. This hybrid approach (MC + AIMD + 0K DFT-CG optimization)\nproduced good atomistic models of IPG which can reproduce experimentally\nobserved electronic band-gap, vibrational density of states (VDOS), magnetic\nmoment of Fe, the elastic constants as well as optical and dielectric\nproperties.

Conformal prediction (CP) offers a promising framework for\nquantifying uncertainty by providing $\\textit{valid}$ prediction sets for any\nblack-box model. CP ensures formal probabilistic guarantees that a prediction\nset contains a true label with a desired probability. However, the size of\nprediction sets, known as $\\textit{inefficiency}$, is influenced by the\nunderlying model and data generating process.

Building on a recent work that introduced a scaling\nparameter for constructing valid credible regions from posterior estimate, our\nstudy explores the advantages of incorporating a temperature parameter into\nBayesian GNNs within CP framework.

In contrast, empirical results in image\nclassification indicate that increasing the training time of deep models or\nusing bigger models almost never hurts generalization. Is it because the way we\nmeasure overfit is too limited? Here, we introduce a novel score for\nquantifying overfit, which monitors the forgetting rate of deep models on\nvalidation data. Presumably, this score indicates that even while\ngeneralization improves overall, there are certain regions of the data space\nwhere it deteriorates. When thus measured, we show that overfit can occur with\nand without a decrease in validation accuracy, and may be more common than\npreviously appreciated. This observation may help to clarify the aforementioned\nconfusing picture. We use our observations to construct a new ensemble method,\nbased solely on the training history of a single network, which provides\nsignificant improvement in performance without any additional cost in training\ntime. An extensive empirical evaluation with modern deep models shows our\nmethod's utility on multiple datasets, neural networks architectures and\ntraining schemes, both when training from scratch and when using pre-trained\nnetworks in transfer learning.

We find that the issue directly\nstems from the unreliable estimation of the gradients used to optimize the data\nadaptor, which is inherently due to the unreliable nature of the pseudo-labels\nassigned to the test data. Based on this observation, we propose\npseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) to improve the performance of data\nadaptation. Specifically, SODA leverages high-confidence predicted labels as\nreliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction. For\ndata with low-confidence predictions, SODA encourages the adaptor to preserve\ndata information to mitigate data corruption. Empirical results indicate that\nSODA can significantly enhance the performance of deployed models in the\npresence of distribution shifts without requiring access to model parameters.",

In a system featuring multiple\nsubstitutional elements at high local concentration levels, solute-solute\ninteraction needs to be considered to interpret and predict co-segregation\nbehavior. In this work, atomic-scale experimental and modelling techniques were\napplied to investigate the co-segregation behavior of Ca, Zn and Al solutes at\na LAGB in a Mg alloy. Three-dimensional atom probe tomography and corresponding\nclustering analysis revealed a strong clustering tendency of Ca solutes at the\nlinear dislocation arrays.

The prevalent strategy is to abstract SL\nprediction as an edge classification task on gene nodes within SL data and\nachieve it through graph neural networks (GNNs). However, GNNs suffer from\nlimitations in their message passing mechanisms, including over-smoothing and\nover-squashing issues. Moreover, harnessing the information of non-SL gene\nrelationships within large-scale multi-omics data to facilitate SL prediction\nposes a non-trivial challenge. To tackle these issues, we propose a new\nmulti-omics sampling-based graph transformer for SL prediction (MSGT-SL).\nConcretely, we introduce a shallow multi-view GNN to acquire local structural\npatterns from both SL and multi-omics data. Further, we input gene features\nthat encode multi-view information into the standard self-attention to capture\nlong-range dependencies. Notably, starting with batch genes from SL data, we\nadopt parallel random walk sampling across multiple omics gene graphs\nencompassing them. Such sampling effectively and modestly incorporates genes\nfrom omics in a structure-aware manner before using self-attention. We showcase\nthe effectiveness of MSGT-SL on real-world SL tasks, demonstrating the\nempirical benefits gained from the graph transformer and multi-omics data.",

The downside of such powerful learners is the danger\nof overfitting the training set, leading to poor generalization, which is\nusually avoided by regularization and \"early stopping\" of the training. In this\npaper, we propose a new deep network ensemble classifier that is very effective\nagainst overfit. We begin with the theoretical analysis of a regression model,\nwhose predictions - that the variance among classifiers increases when overfit\noccurs - is demonstrated empirically in deep networks in common use. Guided by\nthese results, we construct a new ensemble-based prediction method designed to\ncombat overfit, where the prediction is determined by the most consensual\nprediction throughout the training. On multiple image and text classification\ndatasets, we show that when regular ensembles suffer from overfit, our method\neliminates the harmful reduction in generalization due to overfit, and often\neven surpasses the performance obtained by early stopping. Our method is easy\nto implement, and can be integrated with any training scheme and architecture,\nwithout additional prior knowledge beyond the training set.

            "summary": "The rapid development of Internet technology has given rise to a vast amount\nof graph-structured data. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as an effective method\nfor various graph mining tasks, incurs substantial computational resource costs\nwhen dealing with large-scale graph data. A data-centric manner solution is\nproposed to condense the large graph dataset into a smaller one without\nsacrificing the predictive performance of GNNs. However, existing efforts\ncondense graph-structured data through a computational intensive bi-level\noptimization architecture also suffer from massive computation costs. In this\npaper, we propose reforming the graph condensation problem as a Kernel Ridge\nRegression (KRR) task instead of iteratively training GNNs in the inner loop of\nbi-level optimization. More specifically, We propose a novel dataset\ncondensation framework (GC-SNTK) for graph-structured data, where a\nStructure-based Neural Tangent Kernel (SNTK) is developed to capture the\ntopology of graph and serves as the kernel function in KRR paradigm.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model\nin accelerating graph condensation while maintaining high prediction\nperformance.",

            "summary": "This paper introduces a novel robust trading paradigm, called\n\\textit{multi-double linear policies}, situated within a \\textit{generalized}\nlattice market. Distinctively, our framework departs from most existing robust\ntrading strategies, which are predominantly limited to single or paired assets\nand typically embed asset correlation within the trading strategy itself,\nrather than as an inherent characteristic of the market. Our generalized\nlattice market model incorporates both serially correlated returns and asset\ncorrelation through a conditional probabilistic model. In the nominal case,\nwhere the parameters of the model are known, we demonstrate that the proposed\npolicies ensure survivability and probabilistic positivity. We then derive an\nanalytic expression for the worst-case expected gain-loss and prove sufficient\nconditions that the proposed policies can maintain a \\textit{positive expected\nprofits}, even within a seemingly nonprofitable symmetric lattice market. When\nthe parameters are unknown and require estimation, we show that the parameter\nspace of the lattice model forms a convex polyhedron, and we present an\nefficient estimation method using a constrained least-squares method. These\ntheoretical findings are strengthened by extensive empirical studies using data\nfrom the top 30 companies within the S\\&P 500 index, substantiating the\nefficacy of the generalized model and the robustness of the proposed policies\nin sustaining the positive expected profit and providing downside risk\nprotection.",

Practically, data collection\nsystems could produce irregularly sampled time series due to sensor failures\nand interventions. However, existing methods designed for regularly sampled\nmultivariate time series cannot directly handle irregularity owing to\nmisalignment along both temporal and variate dimensions. To fill this gap, we\npropose Compatible Transformer (CoFormer), a transformer-based encoder to\nachieve comprehensive temporal-interaction feature learning for each individual\nsample in irregular multivariate time series. In CoFormer, we view each sample\nas a unique variate-time point and leverage intra-variate/inter-variate\nattentions to learn sample-wise temporal/interaction features based on\nintra-variate/inter-variate neighbors. With CoFormer as the core, we can\nanalyze irregularly sampled multivariate time series for many downstream tasks,\nincluding classification and prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on 3\nreal-world datasets and validate that the proposed CoFormer significantly and\nconsistently outperforms existing methods.",

However,\nBIO-tagging scheme relies on the correct order of model inputs, which is not\nguaranteed in real-world NER on scanned VrDs where text are recognized and\narranged by OCR systems. Such reading order issue hinders the accurate marking\nof entities by BIO-tagging scheme, making it impossible for sequence-labeling\nmethods to predict correct named entities. To address the reading order issue,\nwe introduce Token Path Prediction (TPP), a simple prediction head to predict\nentity mentions as token sequences within documents. Alternative to token\nclassification, TPP models the document layout as a complete directed graph of\ntokens, and predicts token paths within the graph as entities. For better\nevaluation of VrD-NER systems, we also propose two revised benchmark datasets\nof NER on scanned documents which can reflect real-world scenarios.

Heuristic measures are chosen such that they correlate well\nwith the underlying factors related to link formation. In recent years, a new\nclass of methods has emerged that combines the advantages of message-passing\nneural networks (MPNN) and heuristics methods. These methods perform\npredictions by using the output of an MPNN in conjunction with a \"pairwise\nencoding\" that captures the relationship between nodes in the candidate link.\nThey have been shown to achieve strong performance on numerous datasets.\nHowever, current pairwise encodings often contain a strong inductive bias,\nusing the same underlying factors to classify all links. This limits the\nability of existing methods to learn how to properly classify a variety of\ndifferent links that may form from different factors. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a new method, LPFormer, which attempts to adaptively\nlearn the pairwise encodings for each link.

Instead, searching for fossil records of Pop III stars in nearby\ndwarf galaxies provides an alternative method for studying their physical\nproperties. It is intriguing that a star recently discovered in the Sculptor\ndwarf galaxy, named AS0039, is considered to show the unique signature of a\nPop~III star. The detailed abundance patterns of AS0039 are well-matched with\nthose predicted by nucleosynthesis models for Pop~III exploding as an energetic\nhypernova (HN), confirming its potential to provide insight into the properties\nof the first stars. This study aims to explore the environmental conditions\nrequired for the formation of such a unique star using cosmological\nhydrodynamic zoom-in simulations on dwarf galaxies with a mass of M_vir~10^8\nsolar mass at z=0 while varying the fraction of Pop~III stars that undergo HNe.\nOur simulations identify rapid gas inflow (~0.08 solar mass/yr) as a possible\nfactor in facilitating the formation of stars similar to AS0039. Alternatively,\nthe delayed formation of subsequent Pop~II stars in the gas-enriched\nenvironment may lead to low-metallicity stars like AS0039. Additionally, using\nthe A-SLOTH code, we investigate the probability of finding remnants of Pop II\nstars with HN signatures in nearby dwarf satellite galaxies. We suggest that\nthe most likely dwarf galaxies to contain HN signatures are massive satellites\nwith a probability of 40% in the range of M_peak~10^{10}-10^{11} solar mass and\nM_star~10^7-10^8 solar mass, considering observational limitations.",

An additional challenge that theoretical predictions face\nis the difficulty to encode the desired inter-particle interaction potential\nwith the currently available library of nano- and micron-sized particles. To\novercome these issues, we conjugate here SAT-assembly -- a patchy-particle\ninteraction design algorithm based on constrained optimization solvers -- with\ncoarse-grained simulations of DNA nanotechnology to experimentally realize\ntrap-free self-assembly pathways. As a proof of concept we investigate the\nassembly of the pyrochlore (also known as tetrastack) lattice, a highly coveted\n3D crystal lattice due to its promise in construction of optical metamaterials.\nWe confirm the successful assembly with two different patchy DNA origami\ndesigns via SAXS as well as SEM visualization of the silica-coated lattice. Our\napproach offers a versatile modeling pipeline that starts from patchy particles\ndesigned in silico and ends with wireframe DNA origami that self-assemble into\nthe desired structure.",

Additionally, we\nperformed associated factor analysis to analyze which type of data would be\nmost influential on the performance of machine learning models in predicting\ngraduation and dropout status. These features were used to train four binary\nclassifiers to determine if students would graduate or drop out. The overall\nperformance of the classifiers in predicting dropout status had an average\nROC-AUC score of 0.935. The data type most influential to the model performance\nwas found to be academic data, with the average ROC-AUC score dropping from\n0.935 to 0.811 when excluding all academic-related features from the data set.\nPreliminary results indicate that a correlation does exist between data types\nand dropout status.",

            "summary": "Panoptic Narrative Detection (PND) and Segmentation (PNS) are two challenging\ntasks that involve identifying and locating multiple targets in an image\naccording to a long narrative description. In this paper, we propose a unified\nand effective framework called NICE that can jointly learn these two panoptic\nnarrative recognition tasks. Existing visual grounding tasks use a two-branch\nparadigm, but applying this directly to PND and PNS can result in prediction\nconflict due to their intrinsic many-to-many alignment property. To address\nthis, we introduce two cascading modules based on the barycenter of the mask,\nwhich are Coordinate Guided Aggregation (CGA) and Barycenter Driven\nLocalization (BDL), responsible for segmentation and detection, respectively.\nBy linking PNS and PND in series with the barycenter of segmentation as the\nanchor, our approach naturally aligns the two tasks and allows them to\ncomplement each other for improved performance. Specifically, CGA provides the\nbarycenter as a reference for detection, reducing BDL's reliance on a large\nnumber of candidate boxes. BDL leverages its excellent properties to\ndistinguish different instances, which improves the performance of CGA for\nsegmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE surpasses all\nexisting methods by a large margin, achieving 4.1% for PND and 2.9% for PNS\nover the state-of-the-art. These results validate the effectiveness of our\nproposed collaborative learning strategy. The project of this work is made\npublicly available at https://github.com/Mr-Neko/NICE.",

PHC is the first point of contact for most people with\ndepression, but about 25% of diagnoses made by PHC physicians are inaccurate.\nMany other barriers also hinder depression detection and treatment in PHC.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) may help reduce depression misdiagnosis in PHC and\nimprove overall diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Telehealth consultations\noften have video issues, such as poor connectivity or dropped calls. Audio-only\ntelehealth is often more practical for lower-income patients who may lack\nstable internet connections. Thus, our study focused on using audio data to\npredict depression risk. The objectives were to: 1) Collect audio data from 24\npeople (12 with depression and 12 without mental health or major health\ncondition diagnoses); 2) Build a machine learning model to predict depression\nrisk. TPOT, an autoML tool, was used to select the best machine learning\nalgorithm, which was the K-nearest neighbors classifier. The selected model had\nhigh performance in classifying depression risk (Precision: 0.98, Recall: 0.93,\nF1-Score: 0.96). These findings may lead to a range of tools to help screen for\nand treat depression. By developing tools to detect depression risk, patients\ncan be routed to AI-driven chatbots for initial screenings. Partnerships with a\nrange of stakeholders are crucial to implementing these solutions. Moreover,\nethical considerations, especially around data privacy and potential biases in\nAI models, need to be at the forefront of any AI-driven intervention in mental\nhealth care.",

            "summary": "T cell receptors (TCRs) are critical components of adaptive immune systems,\nresponsible for responding to threats by recognizing epitope sequences\npresented on host cell surface. Computational prediction of binding affinity\nbetween TCRs and epitope sequences using machine/deep learning has attracted\nintense attention recently. However, its success is hindered by the lack of\nlarge collections of annotated TCR-epitope pairs. Annotating their binding\naffinity requires expensive and time-consuming wet-lab evaluation. To reduce\nannotation cost, we present ActiveTCR, a framework that incorporates active\nlearning and TCR-epitope binding affinity prediction models. Starting with a\nsmall set of labeled training pairs, ActiveTCR iteratively searches for\nunlabeled TCR-epitope pairs that are ''worth'' for annotation. It aims to\nmaximize performance gains while minimizing the cost of annotation. We compared\nfour query strategies with a random sampling baseline and demonstrated that\nActiveTCR reduces annotation costs by approximately 40%. Furthermore, we showed\nthat providing ground truth labels of TCR-epitope pairs to query strategies can\nhelp identify and reduce more than 40% redundancy among already annotated pairs\nwithout compromising model performance, enabling users to train equally\npowerful prediction models with less training data. Our work is the first\nsystematic investigation of data optimization for TCR-epitope binding affinity\nprediction.",

            "summary": "In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples\nas prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are\ncrucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be\nsampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may\nresult in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper\nintroduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to\nminimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples.\nThe essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale\nunlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts.\nSpecifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled\ndata. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified\nwith a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled\ndata selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it\nprovides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared\nwith previous efforts on selective annotations, our influence-driven method\nworks in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between\ndata diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support.\nExperiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various\nbenchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during\nsubset selection.

In this game, participants assume the role of taxi drivers and use a\nshared information display to decide where to search for their next ride. Our\nexperimental design endows agents with varying level-$k$ depths of thinking,\nallowing some agents to possess greater sophistication in anticipating the\ndecisions of others using the same information display. Through several large\npre-registered experiments, we identify trade-offs between displays that are\noptimal for individual decisions and those that best serve the collective\nsocial welfare of the system. Additionally, we note that the influence of\ndisplay characteristics varies based on an agent's strategic sophistication. We\nobserve that design choices promoting individual-level decision-making can lead\nto suboptimal system outcomes, as manifested by a lower realization of\npotential social welfare. However, this decline in social welfare is offset by\na slight reduction in distribution shift, narrowing the gap between predicted\nand realized system outcomes.

The benefit of our approach is that it allows us to model different\nregions of the input for different classes and is at the same time data\nefficient.

Our model outperforms standard transformer (80.9%) and\nperceiver (81.8%) models and achieves an average accuracy of 83.1%. With\nlimited task-specific data, we find that pretraining is important and\nsurprisingly pretraining with the unrelated automatic speech recognition (ASR)\ntask is also beneficial. Encodings from the middle layers provide a mix of both\nacoustic and phonetic information and achieve best prediction results compared\nto just using the final layer encodings (83.1% vs. 79.6%).

Notably, the rise of powerful Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) has enabled malicious users to mimic the style of\ntrustworthy news outlets at minimal cost. Our analysis reveals that\nLLM-camouflaged fake news content leads to substantial performance degradation\nof state-of-the-art text-based detectors (up to 38% decrease in F1 Score),\nposing a significant challenge for automated detection in online ecosystems. To\naddress this, we introduce SheepDog, a style-agnostic fake news detector robust\nto news writing styles. SheepDog achieves this adaptability through\nLLM-empowered news reframing, which customizes each article to match different\nwriting styles using style-oriented reframing prompts. By employing\nstyle-agnostic training, SheepDog enhances its resilience to stylistic\nvariations by maximizing prediction consistency across these diverse\nreframings. Furthermore, SheepDog extracts content-focused veracity\nattributions from LLMs, where the news content is evaluated against a set of\nfact-checking rationales. These attributions provide supplementary information\nand potential interpretability that assist veracity prediction. On three\nbenchmark datasets, empirical results show that SheepDog consistently yields\nsignificant improvements over competitive baselines and enhances robustness\nagainst LLM-empowered style attacks.",

Its\naction contains a special term that couples the field to the curvature of the\nnoncommutative background space. We first analyze the numerically obtained\nphase diagram of the model and its three phases: the ordered, the disordered,\nand the noncommutative stripe phase. Afterward, we discuss the analytical\nderivation of the effective action and the ordered-to-stripe transition line,\nand how the obtained expression successfully explains the curvature-induced\nshift of the triple point compared to the model without curvature. This shift\nalso causes the removal of the stripe phase and makes the model renormalizable.",

For\na supervised learning task, the association between the eigenvectors of the NTK\nkernel and given data (a concept referred to as alignment in this paper) can\ngovern the rate of convergence of gradient descent, as well as generalization\nto unseen data. Building upon this concept, we investigate NTKs and alignment\nin the context of graph neural networks (GNNs), where our analysis reveals that\noptimizing alignment translates to optimizing the graph representation or the\ngraph shift operator in a GNN. Our results further establish the theoretical\nguarantees on the optimality of the alignment for a two-layer GNN and these\nguarantees are characterized by the graph shift operator being a function of\nthe cross-covariance between the input and the output data. The theoretical\ninsights drawn from the analysis of NTKs are validated by our experiments\nfocused on a multi-variate time series prediction task for a publicly available\ndataset.

The recently developed\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have also been employed to learn\ngoverning equations given data across diverse scientific disciplines. Despite\nthe effectiveness of PINNs for discovering governing equations, the physical\nmodels encoded in PINNs may be misspecified in complex systems as some of the\nphysical processes may not be fully understood, leading to the poor accuracy of\nPINN predictions. In this work, we present a general approach to correct the\nmisspecified physical models in PINNs for discovering governing equations,\ngiven some sparse and/or noisy data. Specifically, we first encode the assumed\nphysical models, which may be misspecified, then employ other deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) to model the discrepancy between the imperfect models and the\nobservational data. Due to the expressivity of DNNs, the proposed method is\ncapable of reducing the computational errors caused by the model\nmisspecification and thus enables the applications of PINNs in complex systems\nwhere the physical processes are not exactly known. Furthermore, we utilize the\nBayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) and/or ensemble PINNs to quantify uncertainties\narising from noisy and/or gappy data in the discovered governing equations. A\nseries of numerical examples including non-Newtonian channel and cavity flows\ndemonstrate that the added DNNs are capable of correcting the model\nmisspecification in PINNs and thus reduce the discrepancy between the physical\nmodels and the observational data.

In this study, we aimed to identify the most favorable\nconstitutive material model for human brain tissue. To achieve this, we applied\nartificial neural network and multiple regression methods to a generalization\nof widely accepted classic models, and compared the results obtained from these\ntwo approaches. To evaluate the applicability and efficacy of the model, all\nsetups were kept consistent across both methods, except for the approach to\nprevent potential overfitting. Our results demonstrate that artificial neural\nnetworks are capable of automatically identifying accurate constitutive models\nfrom given admissible estimators. Nonetheless, the five-term and two-term\nneural network models trained under single-mode and multi-mode loading\nscenarios, were found to be suboptimal and could be further simplified into\ntwo-term and single-term, respectively, with higher accuracy using multiple\nregression.

While data-driven methodologies have\nexhibited promise in approximating finite Koopman operators, they grapple with\nvarious challenges, such as the judicious selection of observables,\ndimensionality reduction, and the ability to predict complex system behaviours\naccurately. This study presents a novel approach termed Mori-Zwanzig\nautoencoder (MZ-AE) to robustly approximate the Koopman operator in\nlow-dimensional spaces. The proposed method leverages a nonlinear autoencoder\nto extract key observables for approximating a finite invariant Koopman\nsubspace and integrates a non-Markovian correction mechanism using the\nMori-Zwanzig formalism. Consequently, this approach yields a closed\nrepresentation of dynamics within the latent manifold of the nonlinear\nautoencoder, thereby enhancing the precision and stability of the Koopman\noperator approximation. Demonstrations showcase the technique's ability to\ncapture regime transitions in the flow around a circular cylinder. It also\nprovided a low dimensional approximation for chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky with\npromising short-term predictability and robust long-term statistical\nperformance. By bridging the gap between data-driven techniques and the\nmathematical foundations of Koopman theory, MZ-AE offers a promising avenue for\nimproved understanding and prediction of complex nonlinear dynamics.",

With such data violating the\nusual independent and identically distributed (IID) assumption in machine\nlearning and classical statistics, it is unclear a priori how one should\nmeasure the performance and generalization of models. Several authors have\nempirically investigated cross-validation (CV) methods in this setting,\nreaching mixed conclusions. We provide a class of unbiased estimation methods\nfor general quadratic errors, correlated Gaussian response, and arbitrary\nprediction function $g$, for a noise-elevated version of the error. Our\napproach generalizes the coupled bootstrap (CB) from the normal means problem\nto general normal data, allowing correlation both within and between the\ntraining and test sets. CB relies on creating bootstrap samples that are\nintelligently decoupled, in the sense of being statistically independent.\nSpecifically, the key to CB lies in generating two independent \"views\" of our\ndata and using them as stand-ins for the usual independent training and test\nsamples. Beginning with Mallows' $C_p$, we generalize the estimator to develop\nour generalized $C_p$ estimators (GC). We show at under only a moment condition\non $g$, this noise-elevated error estimate converges smoothly to the noiseless\nerror estimate. We show that when Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE)\napplies, GC converges to SURE as in the normal means problem. Further, we use\nthese same tools to analyze CV and provide some theoretical analysis to help\nunderstand when CV will provide good estimates of error. Simulations align with\nour theoretical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of GC and illustrating\nthe behavior of CV methods. Lastly, we apply our estimator to a model selection\ntask on geothermal data in Nevada.",

This stellar\nmetallicity enhancement becomes progressively larger towards low-mass galaxies\n(at a given epoch) and earlier epochs (at a given stellar mass), which suggests\nstrangulation as the primary mechanism for star formation quenching in central\ngalaxies not only in the local universe, but also very likely at higher\nredshifts up to $z\\sim3$. We show that at the same present-day stellar mass,\npassive central galaxies assembled half of their final stellar mass $\\sim 2$\nGyr earlier than star-forming central galaxies, which agrees well with\nsemi-analytic model. Exploring semi-analytic model, we find that this is\nbecause passive central galaxies reside in, on average, more massive halos with\na higher halo mass increase rate across cosmic time. As a consequence, passive\ncentral galaxies are assembled faster and also quenched earlier than their\nstar-forming counterparts. While at the same present-day halo mass, different\nhalo assembly history also produces very different final stellar mass of the\ncentral galaxy within, and halos assembled earlier host more massive centrals\nwith a higher quenched fraction, in particular around the \"golden halo mass\" at\n$10^{12}\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. Our results call attention back to the dark matter\nhalo as a key driver of galaxy evolution.",

At the\nlow densities of 10^-26-10^-21 g cm-3 (10-3-10^2 cm-3) the collapse is\ndependent on H2 production, which is a function of the compressional heating\nprovided by the DM potential. Once the gas decouples from the DM, the\ntemperature-density relationship follows a well established path dictated by\nvarious chemical reactions until the formation of the protostar at 10^-4 g cm-3\n(10^19 cm-3). Here we explore the feasibility of replacing the chemical network\n(CN) with a barotropic equation of state (EoS) just before the formation of the\nfirst protostar, to reduce the computational load of simulating the further\nfragmentation, evolution and characteristics of the very high density gas. We\nfind a significant reduction in fragmentation when using the EoS. The EoS\nmethod produces a protostellar mass distribution that peaks at higher masses\nwhen compared to CN runs. The change in fragmentation behaviour is due to a\nlack of cold gas falling in through the disc around the first protostar when\nusing an EoS. Despite this, the total mass accreted across all sinks was\ninvariant to the switch to an EoS, hence the star formation rate (Msun yr^-1)\nis accurately predicted using an EoS. The EoS routine is approximately 4000\ntimes faster than the CN, however this numerical gain is offset by the lack of\naccuracy in modelling secondary protostar formation and hence its use must be\nconsidered carefully.",

In this study, we propose to shift the paradigm\nof memory from merely a target in gravitational wave searches to a unique way\nof measuring symmetries of nature. Thus, we extend previous memory detection\nefforts to the proof-of-principle parameter estimation and model selection.\nThrough simulating binary black hole (BBH) mergers in scenarios where spacetime\nexhibits certain sets of Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetries, we point out that both\nthe current and the future gravitational wave observatories are excellent\nprobes of spacetime symmetries. In particular, the design sensitivity of the\nproposed Einstein Telescope (ET) allows to constrain the strain amplitude of\nthe leading-order displacement memory, associated with superrotational\nsymmetries, to a 2% level in one year. Whereas the weaker spin memory amplitude\ncan be constrained to a 22% level, providing a pathway to probe superrotational\nsymmetries. Finally, there is almost no doubt among GR experts that\ndisplacement memory exists in nature, although its effect on parameter\nestimation was largely neglected in the predictions of the science output of\nfuture experiments such as LISA and ET.

In these cases, gravity will complicate the explosion hydrodynamics\nand conceivably cause the shock to stall at large radii within the progenitor\nstar. To understand these unique properties of weak explosions, we develop a\nperturbative approach for modeling the propagation of an initially strong shock\ninto a time-steady, infalling medium in the gravitational field of a compact\nobject. This method writes the shock position and the post-shock velocity,\ndensity, and pressure as series solutions in the (time-dependent) ratio of the\nfreefall speed to the shock speed, and predicts that the shock stalls within\nthe progenitor if the explosion energy is below a critical value. We show that\nour model agrees very well with hydrodynamic simulations, and accurately\npredicts (e.g.) the time-dependent shock position and velocity and the radius\nat which the shock stalls. Our results have implications for black hole\nformation and the newly detected class of fast X-ray transients (FXTs). In\nparticular, we propose that a ``phantom shock breakout'' -- where the outer\nedge of the star falls through a stalled shock -- can yield a burst of X-rays\nwithout a subsequent optical/UV signature, similar to FXTs.

Existing\npretraining pipelines train LMs by concatenating random sets of short documents\nto create input contexts but the prior documents provide no signal for\npredicting the next document. We instead present In-Context Pretraining, a new\napproach where language models are pretrained on a sequence of related\ndocuments, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across\ndocument boundaries. We can do In-Context Pretraining by simply changing the\ndocument ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directly\napplying existing pretraining pipelines. However, this document sorting problem\nis challenging. There are billions of documents and we would like the sort to\nmaximize contextual similarity for every document without repeating any data.\nTo do this, we introduce approximate algorithms for finding related documents\nwith efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent input contexts\nwith a graph traversal algorithm. Our experiments show In-Context Pretraining\noffers a simple and scalable approach to significantly enhance LMs'performance:\nwe see notable improvements in tasks that require more complex contextual\nreasoning, including in-context learning (+8%), reading comprehension (+15%),\nfaithfulness to previous contexts (+16%), long-context reasoning (+5%), and\nretrieval augmentation (+9%).",

Even just measuring robustness is a challenge. Adversarial\nperturbations are the default, but they can paint the wrong picture: they can\ncorrespond to human motions that are unlikely to occur during natural\ninteractions with people. A robot policy might fail under small adversarial\nperturbations but work under large natural perturbations. We propose that\ncapturing robustness in these interactive settings requires constructing and\nanalyzing the entire natural-adversarial frontier: the Pareto-frontier of human\npolicies that are the best trade-offs between naturalness and low robot\nperformance. We introduce RIGID, a method for constructing this frontier by\ntraining adversarial human policies that trade off between minimizing robot\nreward and acting human-like (as measured by a discriminator). On an Assistive\nGym task, we use RIGID to analyze the performance of standard collaborative\nReinforcement Learning, as well as the performance of existing methods meant to\nincrease robustness. We also compare the frontier RIGID identifies with the\nfailures identified in expert adversarial interaction, and with\nnaturally-occurring failures during user interaction. Overall, we find evidence\nthat RIGID can provide a meaningful measure of robustness predictive of\ndeployment performance, and uncover failure cases in human-robot interaction\nthat are difficult to find manually. https://ood-human.github.io.",

Despite their potential, the training can be\ncomputationally demanding, especially for intricate functions like wavefields.\nThis is primarily due to the neural-based (learned) basis functions, biased\ntoward low frequencies, as they are dominated by polynomial calculations, which\nare not inherently wavefield-friendly. In response, we propose an approach to\nenhance the efficiency and accuracy of neural network wavefield solutions by\nmodeling them as linear combinations of Gabor basis functions that satisfy the\nwave equation. Specifically, for the Helmholtz equation, we augment the fully\nconnected neural network model with an adaptable Gabor layer constituting the\nfinal hidden layer, employing a weighted summation of these Gabor neurons to\ncompute the predictions (output). These weights/coefficients of the Gabor\nfunctions are learned from the previous hidden layers that include nonlinear\nactivation functions. To ensure the Gabor layer's utilization across the model\nspace, we incorporate a smaller auxiliary network to forecast the center of\neach Gabor function based on input coordinates. Realistic assessments showcase\nthe efficacy of this novel implementation compared to the vanilla PINN,\nparticularly in scenarios involving high-frequencies and realistic models that\nare often challenging for PINNs.",

In this paper, we\npropose the HelmSim toward an accurate and interpretable simulator for fluid.\nInspired by the Helmholtz theorem, we design a HelmDynamic block to learn the\nHelmholtz dynamics, which decomposes fluid dynamics into more solvable\ncurl-free and divergence-free parts, physically corresponding to potential and\nstream functions of fluid. By embedding the HelmDynamic block into a Multiscale\nIntegration Network, HelmSim can integrate learned Helmholtz dynamics along\ntemporal dimension in multiple spatial scales to yield future fluid. Comparing\nwith previous velocity estimating methods, HelmSim is faithfully derived from\nHelmholtz theorem and ravels out complex fluid dynamics with physically\ninterpretable evidence. Experimentally, our proposed HelmSim achieves the\nconsistent state-of-the-art in both numerical simulated and real-world observed\nbenchmarks, even for scenarios with complex boundaries.",

            "summary": "Transport and the approach to equilibrium in interacting classical and\nquantum systems is a challenging problem of both theoretical and experimental\ninterest. One useful organizing principle characterizing equilibration is the\ndissipative universality class, the most prevalent one being diffusion. In this\npaper, we use the effective field theory (EFT) of diffusion to systematically\nobtain universal power-law corrections to diffusion. We then employ large-scale\nsimulations of classical and quantum systems to explore their validity. In\nparticular, we find universal scaling functions for the corrections to the\ndynamical structure factor $\\langle n(x,t)n\\rangle$, in the presence of a\nsingle $U(1)$ or $SU(2)$ charge in systems with and without particle-hole\nsymmetry, and present the framework to generalize the calculation to multiple\ncharges. Classical simulations show remarkable agreement with EFT predictions\nfor subleading corrections, pushing precision tests of effective theories for\nthermalizing systems to an unprecedented level. Moving to quantum systems, we\nperform large-scale tensor-network simulations in unitary and noisy 1d Floquet\nsystems with conserved magnetization. We find a qualitative agreement with EFT\nwhich becomes quantitative in the case of noisy systems. Additionally, we show\nhow the knowledge of EFT corrections allows for fitting methods, which can\nimprove the estimation of transport parameters at the intermediate times\naccessible by simulations and experiments. Finally, we explore non-linear\nresponse in quantum systems and find that EFT provides an accurate prediction\nfor its behavior. Our results provide a basis for a better understanding of the\nnon-linear phenomena present in thermalizing systems.",

            "summary": "An important challenge faced by wind farm operators is to reduce operation\nand maintenance cost. Structural health monitoring provides a means of cost\nreduction through minimising unnecessary maintenance trips as well as\nprolonging turbine service life. Population-based structural health monitoring\ncan further reduce the cost of health monitoring systems by implementing one\nsystem for multiple structures (i.e.~turbines). At the same time, shared data\nwithin a population of structures may improve the predictions of structural\nbehaviour. To monitor turbine performance at a population/farm level, an\nimportant initial step is to construct a model that describes the behaviour of\nall turbines under normal conditions. This paper proposes a population-level\nmodel that explicitly captures the spatial and temporal correlations (between\nturbines) induced by the wake effect. The proposed model is a Gaussian\nprocess-based spatial autoregressive model, named here a GP-SPARX model. This\napproach is developed since (a) it reflects our physical understanding of the\nwake effect, and (b) it benefits from a stochastic data-based learner. A case\nstudy is provided to demonstrate the capability of the GP-SPARX model in\ncapturing spatial and temporal variations as well as its potential\napplicability in a health monitoring system.",

TacticAI incorporates both a\npredictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively\nsample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and\nto select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate\nTacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot\nattempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI\nis validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at\nLiverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only\nindistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics\n90% of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval\nsystem.

However, these models\nexhibit a key limitation: they necessitate complete action observation prior to\nclassification, which constrains their applicability in real-time situations\nsuch as surveillance and robotic systems. To overcome this barrier, we\nintroduce InfoGCN++, an innovative extension of InfoGCN, explicitly developed\nfor online skeleton-based action recognition. InfoGCN++ augments the abilities\nof the original InfoGCN model by allowing real-time categorization of action\ntypes, independent of the observation sequence's length. It transcends\nconventional approaches by learning from current and anticipated future\nmovements, thereby creating a more thorough representation of the entire\nsequence. Our approach to prediction is managed as an extrapolation issue,\ngrounded on observed actions. To enable this, InfoGCN++ incorporates Neural\nOrdinary Differential Equations, a concept that lets it effectively model the\ncontinuous evolution of hidden states. Following rigorous evaluations on three\nskeleton-based action recognition benchmarks, InfoGCN++ demonstrates\nexceptional performance in online action recognition. It consistently equals or\nexceeds existing techniques, highlighting its significant potential to reshape\nthe landscape of real-time action recognition applications. Consequently, this\nwork represents a major leap forward from InfoGCN, pushing the limits of what's\npossible in online, skeleton-based action recognition.

To deal with such\nsituations, we propose a novel time-series trend-following forecaster that is\nable to quickly adapt to new market conditions, referred to as regimes. We\nleverage recent developments from the deep learning community and use few-shot\nlearning. We propose the Cross Attentive Time-Series Trend Network - X-Trend -\nwhich takes positions attending over a context set of financial time-series\nregimes. X-Trend transfers trends from similar patterns in the context set to\nmake predictions and take positions for a new distinct target regime. X-Trend\nis able to quickly adapt to new financial regimes with a Sharpe ratio increase\nof 18.9% over a neural forecaster and 10-fold over a conventional Time-series\nMomentum strategy during the turbulent market period from 2018 to 2023. Our\nstrategy recovers twice as quickly from the COVID-19 drawdown compared to the\nneural-forecaster. X-Trend can also take zero-shot positions on novel unseen\nfinancial assets obtaining a 5-fold Sharpe ratio increase versus a neural\ntime-series trend forecaster over the same period. X-Trend both forecasts\nnext-day prices and outputs a trading signal. Furthermore, the cross-attention\nmechanism allows us to interpret the relationship between forecasts and\npatterns in the context set.",

We use density functional\ntheory (DFT) with three different functionals commonly used for Si to determine\nthe coupling constants of an effective lattice Hamiltonian describing the dimer\ninteractions. Experimentally, the phase transition from the low-temperature\n$c(4 {\\times} 2)$- to the high-temperature $p(2 {\\times} 1)$-reconstructed\nsurface is followed through the intensity and width of the superstructure spots\nwithin the temperature range of 78-400 K. Near the critical temperature\n$T_\\mathrm{c} = 190.6$ K, we observe universal critical behavior of spot\nintensities and correlation lengths which falls into the universality class of\nthe two-dimensional (2D) Ising model. From the ratio of correlation lengths\nalong and across the dimer rows we determine effective nearest-neighbor\ncouplings of an anisotropic 2D Ising model, $J_\\parallel = (-24.9 \\pm\n0.9_\\mathrm{stat} \\pm 1.3_\\mathrm{sys})$ meV and $J_\\perp = (-0.8 \\pm\n0.1_\\mathrm{stat})$ meV. We find that the experimentally determined coupling\nconstants of the Ising model can be reconciled with those of the more complex\nlattice Hamiltonian from DFT when the critical behavior is of primary interest.\nThe anisotropy of the interactions derived from the experimental data via the\n2D Ising model is best matched by DFT calculations using the PBEsol functional.\nThe trends in the calculated anisotropy are consistent with the surface stress\nanisotropy predicted by the DFT functionals, pointing towards the role of\nsurface stress reduction as a driving force for establishing the $c(4 {\\times}\n2)$-reconstructed ground state.",

The magnetotransport and the capacitive response have been\ninvestigated simultaneously. It is shown that the formation of Shubnikov-de\nHaas (SdH) oscillations associated with odd v filling factors occurs in a\nmagnetic field whose strength grows monotonically with v. This behavior is\nconsistent with calculations of the electron spectrum, which predicts a\ndecrease in cyclotron gaps with increasing v. Oscillations with even filling\nfactors, corresponding to spin gaps, behave less trivially. First, the SdH\noscillations with filling factors of 4 and higher are resolved in a magnetic\nfield that is 2-2.5 times smaller than the field required to resolve\nneighboring SdH oscillations with odd filling factors of 3 and higher. This\nindicates a significant increase in the size of the spin gap caused by an\ninterface inversion asymmetry (IIA) leading to Dirac cone splitting in a zero\nmagnetic field. Using the spin splitting value gamma as a fitting parameter, we\nobtained the best agreement between experimental data and calculations at\ngamma=1.5 meV. Next, spin splitting for the zeroth and first LLs is observed in\n2-3 times stronger magnetic fields than for the other levels, indicating an\nincrease in disorder near the Dirac point, due to the lack of screening.",

In many practical\nMLC tasks, the number of possible labels is in the thousands, often exceeding\nthe number of input features and resulting in a low-rank output layer. In\nmulti-class classification, it is known that such a low-rank output layer is a\nbottleneck that can result in unargmaxable classes: classes which cannot be\npredicted for any input. In this paper, we show that for MLC tasks, the\nanalogous sigmoid bottleneck results in exponentially many unargmaxable label\ncombinations. We explain how to detect these unargmaxable outputs and\ndemonstrate their presence in three widely used MLC datasets. We then show that\nthey can be prevented in practice by introducing a Discrete Fourier Transform\n(DFT) output layer, which guarantees that all sparse label combinations with up\nto $k$ active labels are argmaxable. Our DFT layer trains faster and is more\nparameter efficient, matching the F1@k score of a sigmoid layer while using up\nto 50% fewer trainable parameters.

Neuromorphic\ncomputing, or the implementation of ML in hardware, has the potential to reduce\nthis cost. In particular, recent laboratory prototypes of self-learning\nelectronic circuits, examples of ``physical learning machines,\" open the door\nto analog hardware that directly employs physics to learn desired functions\nfrom examples. In this work, we show that this hardware platform allows for\neven further reduction of energy consumption by using good initial conditions\nas well as a new learning algorithm. Using analytical calculations, simulation\nand experiment, we show that a trade-off emerges when learning dynamics attempt\nto minimize both the error and the power consumption of the solution--greater\npower reductions can be achieved at the cost of decreasing solution accuracy.\nFinally, we demonstrate a practical procedure to weigh the relative importance\nof error and power minimization, improving power efficiency given a specific\ntolerance to error.",

Consider\na one dimensional bistable stochastic system, characterized by a deterministic\ndouble well potential and shaken by an additive noise source. When subject to\nan external periodic drive, and for a proper choice of the noise strength, the\nsystem swings regularly between the two existing deterministic fixed points,\nwith just one switch for each oscillation of the imposed forcing term. This\nresonant condition can be exploited to unravel weak periodic signals, otherwise\ninaccessible to conventional detectors.

A\ncandidate model is in particular introduced which fulfils the above\nrequirements while allowing for analytical progress to be made.

By capturing temporal patterns\nwithout external labels or supervision, longitudinal self-supervised learning\n(LSSL) has become a promising avenue. To better understand this core method, we\nexplore in this paper the LSSL algorithm under different scenarios. The\noriginal LSSL is embedded in an auto-encoder (AE) structure. However,\nconventional self-supervised strategies are usually implemented in a\nSiamese-like manner. Therefore, (as a first novelty) in this study, we explore\nthe use of Siamese-like LSSL. Another new core framework named neural ordinary\ndifferential equation (NODE). NODE is a neural network architecture that learns\nthe dynamics of ordinary differential equations (ODE) through the use of neural\nnetworks. Many temporal systems can be described by ODE, including modeling\ndisease progression. We believe that there is an interesting connection to make\nbetween LSSL and NODE. This paper aims at providing a better understanding of\nthose core algorithms for learning the disease progression with the mentioned\nchange. In our different experiments, we employ a longitudinal dataset, named\nOPHDIAT, targeting diabetic retinopathy (DR) follow-up.

In the past years, Mix-up\ntraining and pretext tasks with longitudinal context have effectively enhanced\nDR classification results and captured disease progression.

Our framework, Longitudinal Mixing\nTraining (LMT), can be considered both as a regularizer and as a pretext task\nthat encodes the disease progression in the latent space. Additionally, we\nevaluate the trained model weights on a downstream task with a longitudinal\ncontext using standard and longitudinal pretext tasks.

Existing CL\nmethods usually reduce forgetting with task priors, \\ie using task identity or\na subset of previously seen samples for model training. However, these methods\nwould be infeasible when such priors are unknown in real-world applications. To\naddress this fundamental but seldom-studied problem, we propose a Prior-Free\nContinual Learning (PFCL) method, which learns new tasks without knowing the\ntask identity or any previous data. First, based on a fixed single-head\narchitecture, we eliminate the need for task identity to select the\ntask-specific output head. Second, we employ a regularization-based strategy\nfor consistent predictions between the new and old models, avoiding revisiting\nprevious samples. However, using this strategy alone often performs poorly in\nclass-incremental scenarios, particularly for a long sequence of tasks. By\nanalyzing the effectiveness and limitations of conventional\nregularization-based methods, we propose enhancing model consistency with an\nauxiliary unlabeled dataset additionally. Moreover, since some auxiliary data\nmay degrade the performance, we further develop a reliable sample selection\nstrategy to obtain consistent performance improvement. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple image classification benchmark datasets show that our PFCL method\nsignificantly mitigates forgetting in all three learning scenarios.\nFurthermore, when compared to the most recent rehearsal-based methods that\nreplay a limited number of previous samples, PFCL achieves competitive\naccuracy.

Finally, a\nconstruction block is responsible for reconstructing high-quality images.\nDesigned heterogeneous architecture can not only facilitate richer structural\ninformation, but also be lightweight, which is suitable for mobile digital\ndevices. Experimental results shows that our method is more competitive in\nterms of performance and recovering time of image super-resolution and\ncomplexity.

            "summary": "Testing a global null is a canonical problem in statistics and has a wide\nrange of applications. In view of the fact that no uniformly most powerful test\nexists, prior and/or domain knowledge are commonly used to focus on a certain\nclass of alternatives to improve the testing power. However, it is generally\nchallenging to develop tests that are particularly powerful against a certain\nclass of alternatives. In this paper, motivated by the success of ensemble\nlearning methods for prediction or classification, we propose an ensemble\nframework for testing that mimics the spirit of random forests to deal with the\nchallenges. Our ensemble testing framework aggregates a collection of weak base\ntests to form a final ensemble test that maintains strong and robust power for\nglobal nulls. We apply the framework to four problems about global testing in\ndifferent classes of alternatives arising from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)\nassociation studies. Specific ensemble tests are proposed for each of these\nproblems, and their theoretical optimality is established in terms of Bahadur\nefficiency. Extensive simulations and an analysis of a real WGS dataset are\nconducted to demonstrate the type I error control and/or power gain of the\nproposed ensemble tests.",

While there has been work focusing on each of these\naspects individually, researchers have shied away from simultaneously\naddressing more than one of these dimensions. In this work, we address the\nproblem of building models which are both fair and calibrated. We work with a\nspecific definition of fairness, which closely matches [Biswas et. al. 2019],\nand has the nice property that Bayes optimal classifier has the maximum\npossible fairness under our definition. We show that an existing negative\nresult towards achieving a fair and calibrated model [Kleinberg et. al. 2017]\ndoes not hold for our definition of fairness. Further, we show that ensuring\ngroup-wise calibration with respect to the sensitive attributes automatically\nresults in a fair model under our definition. Using this result, we provide a\nfirst cut approach for achieving fair and calibrated models, via a simple\npost-processing technique based on temperature scaling. We then propose\nmodifications of existing calibration losses to perform group-wise calibration,\nas a way of achieving fair and calibrated models in a variety of settings.\nFinally, we perform extensive experimentation of these techniques on a diverse\nbenchmark of datasets, and present insights on the pareto-optimality of the\nresulting solutions.",

            "summary": "Meanings of words change over time and across domains. Detecting the semantic\nchanges of words is an important task for various NLP applications that must\nmake time-sensitive predictions. We consider the problem of predicting whether\na given target word, $w$, changes its meaning between two different text\ncorpora, $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\\mathcal{C}_2$. For this purpose, we propose\n$\\textit{Swapping-based Semantic Change Detection}$ (SSCD), an unsupervised\nmethod that randomly swaps contexts between $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\\mathcal{C}_2$\nwhere $w$ occurs. We then look at the distribution of contextualised word\nembeddings of $w$, obtained from a pretrained masked language model (MLM),\nrepresenting the meaning of $w$ in its occurrence contexts in $\\mathcal{C}_1$\nand $\\mathcal{C}_2$. Intuitively, if the meaning of $w$ does not change between\n$\\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\\mathcal{C}_2$, we would expect the distributions of\ncontextualised word embeddings of $w$ to remain the same before and after this\nrandom swapping process. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that even by\nusing pretrained MLMs without any fine-tuning, our proposed context swapping\nmethod accurately predicts the semantic changes of words in four languages\n(English, German, Swedish, and Latin) and across different time spans (over 50\nyears and about five years). Moreover, our method achieves significant\nperformance improvements compared to strong baselines for the English semantic\nchange prediction task.

To demonstrate how\ncurrent and SOC imbalance leads to cell degradation, we developed a successive\nupdate scheme in which the inter-cycle imbalance dynamics update the\nintra-cycle degradation dynamics, and vice versa. Using this framework, we\ndemonstrate that current imbalance can cause convergent degradation\ntrajectories, consistent with previous reports. However, we also demonstrate\nthat different degradation assumptions, such as those associated with SOC\nimbalance, may cause divergent degradation.

Bayesian methods\nare effective at characterizing uncertainty in FSC, which is crucial in\nhigh-risk fields. In this context, the logistic-softmax likelihood is often\nemployed as an alternative to the softmax likelihood in multi-class Gaussian\nprocess classification due to its conditional conjugacy property. However, the\ntheoretical property of logistic-softmax is not clear and previous research\nindicated that the inherent uncertainty of logistic-softmax leads to suboptimal\nperformance. To mitigate these issues, we revisit and redesign the\nlogistic-softmax likelihood, which enables control of the \\textit{a priori}\nconfidence level through a temperature parameter. Furthermore, we theoretically\nand empirically show that softmax can be viewed as a special case of\nlogistic-softmax and logistic-softmax induces a larger family of data\ndistribution than softmax. Utilizing modified logistic-softmax, we integrate\nthe data augmentation technique into the deep kernel based Gaussian process\nmeta-learning framework, and derive an analytical mean-field approximation for\ntask-specific updates.

            "summary": "Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction is an important and widely used technique in\ndata mining and analytics, especially for ST data in urban systems such as\ntransportation data. In practice, the ST data generation is usually influenced\nby various latent factors tied to natural phenomena or human socioeconomic\nactivities, impacting specific spatial areas selectively. However, existing ST\nprediction methods usually do not refine the impacts of different factors, but\ndirectly model the entangled impacts of multiple factors. This amplifies the\nmodeling complexity of ST data and compromises model interpretability. To this\nend, we propose a multi-factor ST prediction task that predicts partial ST data\nevolution under different factors, and combines them for a final prediction. We\nmake two contributions to this task: an effective theoretical solution and a\nportable instantiation framework. Specifically, we first propose a theoretical\nsolution called decomposed prediction strategy and prove its effectiveness from\nthe perspective of information entropy theory. On top of that, we instantiate a\nnovel model-agnostic framework, named spatio-temporal graph decomposition\nlearning (STGDL), for multi-factor ST prediction. The framework consists of two\nmain components: an automatic graph decomposition module that decomposes the\noriginal graph structure inherent in ST data into subgraphs corresponding to\ndifferent factors, and a decomposed learning network that learns the partial ST\ndata on each subgraph separately and integrates them for the final prediction.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on four real-world ST datasets of two types of\ngraphs, i.e., grid graph and network graph. Results show that our framework\nsignificantly reduces prediction errors of various ST models by 9.41% on\naverage (35.36% at most). Furthermore, a case study reveals the\ninterpretability potential of our framework.",

            "summary": "Prediction, decision-making, and motion planning are essential for autonomous\ndriving. In most contemporary works, they are considered as individual modules\nor combined into a multi-task learning paradigm with a shared backbone but\nseparate task heads. However, we argue that they should be integrated into a\ncomprehensive framework. Although several recent approaches follow this scheme,\nthey suffer from complicated input representations and redundant framework\ndesigns. More importantly, they can not make long-term predictions about future\ndriving scenarios. To address these issues, we rethink the necessity of each\nmodule in an autonomous driving task and incorporate only the required modules\ninto a minimalist autonomous driving framework. We propose BEVGPT, a generative\npre-trained large model that integrates driving scenario prediction,\ndecision-making, and motion planning. The model takes the bird's-eye-view (BEV)\nimages as the only input source and makes driving decisions based on\nsurrounding traffic scenarios. To ensure driving trajectory feasibility and\nsmoothness, we develop an optimization-based motion planning method. We\ninstantiate BEVGPT on Lyft Level 5 Dataset and use Woven Planet L5Kit for\nrealistic driving simulation. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed\nframework are verified by the fact that it outperforms previous methods in 100%\ndecision-making metrics and 66% motion planning metrics. Furthermore, the\nability of our framework to accurately generate BEV images over the long term\nis demonstrated through the task of driving scenario prediction. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first generative pre-trained large model for\nautonomous driving prediction, decision-making, and motion planning with only\nBEV images as input.",

When there is a scarcity of labeled\ndata available, the model is prone to overfit local patches. Within such\ncontexts, the conventional approach of solely improving the accuracy of local\npatch predictions through unlabeled data proves inadequate. Consequently, we\npropose a more nuanced approach: fostering the model's intrinsic 'subitizing'\ncapability. This ability allows the model to accurately estimate the count in\nregions by leveraging its understanding of the crowd scenes, mirroring the\nhuman cognitive process. To achieve this goal, we apply masking on unlabeled\ndata, guiding the model to make predictions for these masked patches based on\nthe holistic cues. Furthermore, to help with feature learning, herein we\nincorporate a fine-grained density classification task. Our method is general\nand applicable to most existing crowd counting methods as it doesn't have\nstrict structural or loss constraints. In addition, we observe that the model\ntrained with our framework exhibits a 'subitizing'-like behavior. It accurately\npredicts low-density regions with only a 'glance', while incorporating local\ndetails to predict high-density regions. Our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous approaches by a large margin\non challenging benchmarks such as ShanghaiTech A and UCF-QNRF.

Central to our method is a multi-view consistency block\nwhich enables information exchange across multiple single-view diffusion\nprocesses based on the underlying multi-view geometry principles. ConsistNet is\nan extension to the standard latent diffusion model, and consists of two\nsub-modules: (a) a view aggregation module that unprojects multi-view features\ninto global 3D volumes and infer consistency, and (b) a ray aggregation module\nthat samples and aggregate 3D consistent features back to each view to enforce\nconsistency.

We propose a conditional simulation\nscheme for SDEs that is based on lookahead strategies for sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC) and particle smoothing using backward simulation. This leads to the\nsimulation of trajectories that are consistent with the observed trajectory,\nthereby increasing the ABC acceptance rate.

However, real-world and safety-critical\napplications demand a level of transparency and reasoning beyond accuracy. The\ntask of anomaly detection (AD) focuses on finding whether a given sample\nfollows the learned distribution. Existing methods lack the ability to reason\nwith clear explanations for their outcomes. Hence to overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Transparent {A}nomaly Detection {C}oncept {E}xplanations (ACE). ACE\nis able to provide human interpretable explanations in the form of concepts\nalong with anomaly prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\npaper that proposes interpretable by-design anomaly detection. In addition to\npromoting transparency in AD, it allows for effective human-model interaction.\nOur proposed model shows either higher or comparable results to black-box\nuninterpretable models. We validate the performance of ACE across three\nrealistic datasets - bird classification on CUB-200-2011, challenging\nhistopathology slide image classification on TIL-WSI-TCGA, and gender\nclassification on CelebA. We further demonstrate that our concept learning\nparadigm can be seamlessly integrated with other classification-based AD\nmethods.",

Fluid Mech. vol.906, 2021, A21) which kinematically\ncoarse-grains the state with clusters and dynamically predicts the transitions\nin a network model. In the proposed dynamics-augmented CNM (dCNM), the\nprediction error is reduced with trajectory-based clustering using the same\nnumber of centroids. The dCNM is first exemplified for the Lorenz system and\nthen implemented for the three-dimensional sphere wake featuring quasi-periodic\nand chaotic flow regimes. For both plants, the dCNM significantly outperforms\nthe CNM in resolving the multi-frequency and multiscale dynamics. This\nincreased prediction accuracy is obtained by stratification of the state space\naligned with the direction of the trajectories. Thus, the dCNM has numerous\npotential applications to a large spectrum of shear flows, even for complex\ndynamics.",

In this work, we\npropose to learn time integration schemes based on neural networks which\nsatisfy three distinct sets of mathematical constraints, i.e., unconstrained,\nsemi-constrained with the root condition, and fully-constrained with both root\nand consistency conditions. We focus on the learning of 3-step linear multistep\nmethods, which we subsequently applied to solve three model PDEs, i.e., the\none-dimensional heat equation, the one-dimensional wave equation, and the\none-dimensional Burgers' equation. The results show that the prediction error\nof the learned fully-constrained scheme is close to that of the Runge-Kutta\nmethod and Adams-Bashforth method. Compared to the traditional methods, the\nlearned unconstrained and semi-constrained schemes significantly reduce the\nprediction error on coarse grids. On a grid that is 4 times coarser than the\nreference grid, the mean square error shows a reduction of up to an order of\nmagnitude for some of the heat equation cases, and a substantial improvement in\nphase prediction for the wave equation. On a 32 times coarser grid, the mean\nsquare error for the Burgers' equation can be reduced by up to 35% to 40%.",

            "summary": "The test-time optimization of scene flow - using a coordinate network as a\nneural prior - has gained popularity due to its simplicity, lack of dataset\nbias, and state-of-the-art performance. We observe, however, that although\ncoordinate networks capture general motions by implicitly regularizing the\nscene flow predictions to be spatially smooth, the neural prior by itself is\nunable to identify the underlying multi-body rigid motions present in\nreal-world data. To address this, we show that multi-body rigidity can be\nachieved without the cumbersome and brittle strategy of constraining the\n$SE(3)$ parameters of each rigid body as done in previous works. This is\nachieved by regularizing the scene flow optimization to encourage isometry in\nflow predictions for rigid bodies. This strategy enables multi-body rigidity in\nscene flow while maintaining a continuous flow field, hence allowing dense\nlong-term scene flow integration across a sequence of point clouds. We conduct\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art in 3D scene flow and long-term point-wise 4D\ntrajectory prediction.

However, predictions are inherently uncertain, and\nmanaging prediction uncertainty presents significant challenges in environments\ncharacterized by complex dynamics and forking trajectories. In this work, we\nassume access to a pre-designed probabilistic implicit or explicit sequence\nmodel, which may have been obtained using model-based or model-free methods. We\nintroduce probabilistic time series-conformal risk prediction (PTS-CRC), a\nnovel post-hoc calibration procedure that operates on the predictions produced\nby any pre-designed probabilistic forecaster to yield reliable error bars. In\ncontrast to existing art, PTS-CRC produces predictive sets based on an ensemble\nof multiple prototype trajectories sampled from the sequence model, supporting\nthe efficient representation of forking uncertainties. Furthermore, unlike the\nstate of the art, PTS-CRC can satisfy reliability definitions beyond coverage.\nThis property is leveraged to devise a novel model predictive control (MPC)\nframework that addresses open-loop and closed-loop control problems under\ngeneral average constraints on the quality or safety of the control policy. We\nexperimentally validate the performance of PTS-CRC prediction and control by\nstudying a number of use cases in the context of wireless networking. Across\nall the considered tasks, PTS-CRC predictors are shown to provide more\ninformative predictive sets, as well as safe control policies with larger\nreturns.",

GSEM takes two groups of images as input, each containing\ndifferent types of salient objects. Based on the mixed metric we designed, GSEM\nselects a subset of images from each group using a novel learning-based\nstrategy, then the selected images are exchanged. To simultaneously consider\nthe uncertainty introduced by irrelevant images and the consensus features of\nthe remaining relevant images in the group, we designed a latent variable\ngenerator branch and CoSOD transformer branch. The former is composed of a\nvector quantised-variational autoencoder to generate stochastic global\nvariables that model uncertainty. The latter is designed to capture\ncorrelation-based local features that include group consensus. Finally, the\noutputs of the two branches are merged and passed to a transformer-based\ndecoder to generate robust predictions. Taking into account that there are\ncurrently no benchmark datasets specifically designed for open-world scenarios,\nwe constructed three open-world benchmark datasets, namely OWCoSal, OWCoSOD,\nand OWCoCA, based on existing datasets. By breaking the group-consistency\nassumption, these datasets provide effective simulations of real-world\nscenarios and can better evaluate the robustness and practicality of models.",

Focusing on word embeddings, we\npresent a supervised-learning method that, for a given domain (e.g., sports,\nprofessions), identifies a subset of model features that strongly improve\nprediction of human similarity judgments. We show this method keeps only 20-40%\nof the original embeddings, for 8 independent semantic domains, and that it\nretains different feature sets across domains. We then present two approaches\nfor interpreting the semantics of the retained features. The first obtains the\nscores of the domain words (co-hyponyms) on the first principal component of\nthe retained embeddings, and extracts terms whose co-occurrence with the\nco-hyponyms tracks these scores' profile. This analysis reveals that humans\ndifferentiate e.g. sports based on how gender-inclusive and international they\nare. The second approach uses the retained sets as variables in a probing task\nthat predicts values along 65 semantically annotated dimensions for a dataset\nof 535 words. The features retained for professions are best at predicting\ncognitive, emotional and social dimensions, whereas features retained for\nfruits or vegetables best predict the gustation (taste) dimension.

            "summary": "This paper investigates a predictive model that considers the impact of\nstretch on the dynamic response of laminar premixed conical and V- flames; the\nflame stretch consists of two components: the flame curvature and flow strain.\nThe steady and perturbed flame fronts are determined via the linearized\n$G$-equation associated with the flame stretch model. Parameter analyses of the\neffects of Markstein length $\\mathcal{L}$, flame radius $R$ and unstretched\nflame aspect ratio $\\beta$ are also conducted. Results show that the flame\nstretch reduces the steady flame height, with this effect being more\nsignificant for larger Markstein lengths and smaller flame sizes. The effects\nof flame stretch on perturbed flames are evaluated by comparing the flame\ntransfer function (FTF) considering the flame stretch and not. For flames of\ndifferent sizes, the impact of flame stretch on FTF gain can be divided into\nthree regions. When both $\\beta$ and $R$ are relatively small, due to the\ndecrease in steady flame height and the impact of flow strain, the FTF gain\nincreases. As $\\beta$ and $R$ gradually increase, the FTF gain of the conical\nflame oscillates periodically while the FTF gain of the V-flame decreases,\nprimarily due to the flame curvature enhancing the flame front disturbance and\nthe wrinkle counteracting effect. When $\\beta$ and $R$ are large, a disruption\nin wrinkle counteracting effect ensues, leading to a significant increase in\nFTF gain. Furthermore, as the actual flame height is reduced, the flame stretch\nalso reduces the FTF phase lag which is related to the disturbance propagation\ntime from the flame root to the tip.",

The ability\nto predict court outcomes helps judges during the decision-making process and\nequips lawyers with invaluable insights, enhancing their strategic approaches\nto cases. Despite its significance, the domain of Arabic court analysis remains\nunder-explored. This paper pioneers a comprehensive predictive analysis of\nArabic court decisions on a dataset of 10,813 commercial court real cases,\nleveraging the advanced capabilities of the current state-of-the-art large\nlanguage models. Through a systematic exploration, we evaluate three prevalent\nfoundational models (LLaMA-7b, JAIS-13b, and GPT3.5-turbo) and three training\nparadigms: zero-shot, one-shot, and tailored fine-tuning. Besides, we assess\nthe benefit of summarizing and/or translating the original Arabic input texts.\nThis leads to a spectrum of 14 model variants, for which we offer a granular\nperformance assessment with a series of different metrics (human assessment,\nGPT evaluation, ROUGE, and BLEU scores). We show that all variants of LLaMA\nmodels yield limited performance, whereas GPT-3.5-based models outperform all\nother models by a wide margin, surpassing the average score of the dedicated\nArabic-centric JAIS model by 50%. Furthermore, we show that all scores except\nhuman evaluation are inconsistent and unreliable for assessing the performance\nof large language models on court decision predictions.

            "summary": "Objective: Reconstructing freehand ultrasound in 3D without any external\ntracker has been a long-standing challenge in ultrasound-assisted procedures.\nWe aim to define new ways of parameterising long-term dependencies, and\nevaluate the performance. Methods: First, long-term dependency is encoded by\ntransformation positions within a frame sequence. This is achieved by combining\na sequence model with a multi-transformation prediction. Second, two dependency\nfactors are proposed, anatomical image content and scanning protocol, for\ncontributing towards accurate reconstruction. Each factor is quantified\nexperimentally by reducing respective training variances. Results: 1) The added\nlong-term dependency up to 400 frames at 20 frames per second (fps) indeed\nimproved reconstruction, with an up to 82.4% lowered accumulated error,\ncompared with the baseline performance. The improvement was found to be\ndependent on sequence length, transformation interval and scanning protocol\nand, unexpectedly, not on the use of recurrent networks with long-short term\nmodules; 2) Decreasing either anatomical or protocol variance in training led\nto poorer reconstruction accuracy. Interestingly, greater performance was\ngained from representative protocol patterns, than from representative\nanatomical features. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm uses hyperparameter\ntuning to effectively utilise long-term dependency. The proposed dependency\nfactors are of practical significance in collecting diverse training data,\nregulating scanning protocols and developing efficient networks. Significance:\nThe proposed new methodology with publicly available volunteer data and code\nfor parametersing the long-term dependency, experimentally shown to be valid\nsources of performance improvement, which could potentially lead to better\nmodel development and practical optimisation of the reconstruction application.",

However, existing graph-level models are generally built on\ni.i.d. assumption for both training and testing graphs, which is not realistic\nin an open world, where models can encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) testing\ngraphs that are from different distributions unknown during training. A\ntrustworthy model should not only produce accurate predictions for\nin-distribution (ID) data, but also detect OOD graphs to avoid unreliable\nprediction. In this paper, we present SGOOD, a novel graph-level OOD detection\nframework. We find that substructure differences commonly exist between ID and\nOOD graphs. Hence, SGOOD explicitly utilizes substructures to learn powerful\nrepresentations to achieve superior performance. Specifically, we build a super\ngraph of substructures for every graph, and design a two-level graph encoding\npipeline that works on both original graphs and super graphs to obtain\nsubstructure-enhanced graph representations. To further distinguish ID and OOD\ngraphs, we develop three graph augmentation techniques that preserve\nsubstructures and increase expressiveness. Extensive experiments against 10\ncompetitors on numerous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of SGOOD,\noften surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.

However, a\ncommunity's seismic safety and resilience are substantially affected by network\nreliability, determined not only by component fragilities but also by network\ntopology and commodity/information flows. However, seismic reliability analyses\nof networks often encounter significant challenges due to complex network\ntopologies, interdependencies among ground motions, and low failure\nprobabilities. This paper proposes to overcome these challenges by a\nvariance-reduction method for network fragility analysis using subset\nsimulation. The binary network limit-state function in the subset simulation is\nreformulated into more informative piecewise continuous functions. The proposed\nlimit-state functions quantify the proximity of each sample to a potential\nnetwork failure domain, thereby enabling the construction of specialized\nintermediate failure events, which can be utilized in subset simulation and\nother sequential Monte Carlo approaches. Moreover, by discovering an implicit\nconnection between intermediate failure events and seismic intensity, we\npropose a technique to obtain the entire network fragility curve with a single\nexecution of specialized subset simulation.

            "summary": "We present an asymptotic theory for solving the dynamics of slender\nautophoretic loops and knots. Our formulation is valid for non-intersecting 3D\ncentrelines, with arbitrary chemical patterning and varying (circular)\ncross-sectional radius, allowing a broad class of slender active loops and\nknots to be studied. The theory is amenable to closed-form solutions in simpler\ncases, allowing us to analytically derive the swimming speed of chemically\npatterned tori, and the pumping strength (stresslet) of a uniformly active\nslender torus. Using simple numerical solutions of our asymptotic equations, we\nthen elucidate the behaviour of many exotic active colloids, such as a bumpy\nuniformly active torus that spins and a Janus trefoil knot, which rotates as it\nswims forwards.",

            "summary": "This paper proposes Koopman operator-based Stochastic Model Predictive\nControl (K-SMPC) for enhanced lateral control of autonomous vehicles. The\nKoopman operator is a linear map representing the nonlinear dynamics in an\ninfinite-dimensional space. Thus, we use the Koopman operator to represent the\nnonlinear dynamics of a vehicle in dynamic lane-keeping situations. The\nExtended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) method is adopted to approximate the\nKoopman operator in a finite-dimensional space for practical implementation. We\nconsider the modeling error of the approximated Koopman operator in the EDMD\nmethod. Then, we design K-SMPC to tackle the Koopman modeling error, where the\nerror is handled as a probabilistic signal. The recursive feasibility of the\nproposed method is investigated with an explicit first-step state constraint by\ncomputing the robust control invariant set. A high-fidelity vehicle simulator,\ni.e., CarSim, is used to validate the proposed method with a comparative study.\nFrom the results, it is confirmed that the proposed method outperforms other\nmethods in tracking performance. Furthermore, it is observed that the proposed\nmethod satisfies the given constraints and is recursively feasible.",

However, ML model developers often lack detailed\nknowledge of the underlying system architectures, while system programmers\nusually do not have a high-level understanding of the ML model that runs on the\nspecific system. To mitigate this gap between two relevant aspects of domain\nknowledge, this paper proposes GEVO-ML, a tool for automatically discovering\noptimization opportunities and tuning the performance of ML kernels, where the\nmodel and training/prediction processes are uniformly represented in a single\nintermediate language, the Multiple-Layer Intermediate Representation (MLIR).\nGEVO-ML uses multi-objective evolutionary search to find edits (mutations) to\nMLIR code that ultimately runs on GPUs, improving performance on desired\ncriteria while retaining required functionality.\n  We demonstrate GEVO-ML on two different ML workloads for both model training\nand prediction. GEVO-ML finds significant Pareto improvements for these models,\nachieving 90.43% performance improvement when model accuracy is relaxed by 2%,\nfrom 91.2% to 89.3%. For the training workloads, GEVO-ML finds a 4.88%\nimprovement in model accuracy, from 91% to 96%, without sacrificing training or\ntesting speed. Our analysis of key GEVO-ML mutations reveals diverse code\nmodifications, while might be foreign to human developers, achieving similar\neffects with how human developers improve model design, for example, by\nchanging learning rates or pruning non-essential layer parameters.",

Predictive modeling has the potential to improve outcomes through\nbetter understanding of risk factors, heightened surveillance for high risk\npatients, and more timely and appropriate interventions, thereby helping\nobstetricians deliver better care. We identify and study the most important\nrisk factors for four types of pregnancy complications: (i) severe maternal\nmorbidity, (ii) shoulder dystocia, (iii) preterm preeclampsia, and (iv)\nantepartum stillbirth. We use an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a\nhigh-accuracy glass-box learning method, for prediction and identification of\nimportant risk factors. We undertake external validation and perform an\nextensive robustness analysis of the EBM models. EBMs match the accuracy of\nother black-box ML methods such as deep neural networks and random forests, and\noutperform logistic regression, while being more interpretable. EBMs prove to\nbe robust. The interpretability of the EBM models reveals surprising insights\ninto the features contributing to risk (e.g. maternal height is the second most\nimportant feature for shoulder dystocia) and may have potential for clinical\napplication in the prediction and prevention of serious complications in\npregnancy.",

Then, the\ndistinguished topics work as adaptive features via multi-task training with\ntimestamp and class label prediction. In adaptive learning, VIBE utilizes\nretrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data\ntime.

However, due\nto the sparsity of change in large-scale satellite remote sensing images,\nexisting pixel-level CD methods suffer from a waste of computational cost and\nmemory resources on lots of unchanged areas, which reduces the processing\nefficiency of on-board platform with extremely limited computation and memory\nresources. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight patch-level CD\nnetwork (LPCDNet) to rapidly remove lots of unchanged patch pairs in\nlarge-scale bi-temporal image pairs. This is helpful to accelerate the\nsubsequent pixel-level CD processing stage and reduce its memory costs. In our\nLPCDNet, a sensitivity-guided channel pruning method is proposed to remove\nunimportant channels and construct the lightweight backbone network on basis of\nResNet18 network. Then, the multi-layer feature compression (MLFC) module is\ndesigned to compress and fuse the multi-level feature information of\nbi-temporal image patch. The output of MLFC module is fed into the\nfully-connected decision network to generate the predicted binary label.\nFinally, a weighted cross-entropy loss is utilized in the training process of\nnetwork to tackle the change/unchange class imbalance problem. Experiments on\ntwo CD datasets demonstrate that our LPCDNet achieves more than 1000 frames per\nsecond on an edge computation platform, i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, which is\nmore than 3 times that of the existing methods without noticeable CD\nperformance loss. In addition, our method reduces more than 60% memory costs of\nthe subsequent pixel-level CD processing stage.",

            "summary": "Inverse modelling with deep learning algorithms involves training deep\narchitecture to predict device's parameters from its static behaviour. Inverse\ndevice modelling is suitable to reconstruct drifted physical parameters of\ndevices temporally degraded or to retrieve physical configuration. There are\nmany variables that can influence the performance of an inverse modelling\nmethod. In this work the authors propose a deep learning method trained for\nretrieving physical parameters of Level-3 model of Power Silicon-Carbide MOSFET\n(SiC Power MOS). The SiC devices are used in applications where classical\nsilicon devices failed due to high-temperature or high switching capability.\nThe key application of SiC power devices is in the automotive field (i.e. in\nthe field of electrical vehicles). Due to physiological degradation or\nhigh-stressing environment, SiC Power MOS shows a significant drift of physical\nparameters which can be monitored by using inverse modelling. The aim of this\nwork is to provide a possible deep learning-based solution for retrieving\nphysical parameters of the SiC Power MOSFET. Preliminary results based on the\nretrieving of channel length of the device are reported. Channel length of\npower MOSFET is a key parameter involved in the static and dynamic behaviour of\nthe device. The experimental results reported in this work confirmed the\neffectiveness of a multi-layer perceptron designed to retrieve this parameter.",

The JMLA model\nconsists of an audio encoder modeled by a pretrained masked autoencoder and a\ndecoder modeled by a Falcon7B.

We introduce dense\nattention connections between encoder and decoder layers to improve the\ninformation flow between the encoder and decoder layers. We collect a\nlarge-scale music and description dataset from the internet. We propose to use\nChatGPT to convert the raw descriptions into formalized and diverse\ndescriptions to train the JMLA models. Our proposed JMLA system achieves a\nzero-shot audio tagging accuracy of $ 64.82\\% $ on the GTZAN dataset,\noutperforming previous zero-shot systems and achieves comparable results to\nprevious systems on the FMA and the MagnaTagATune datasets.",

            "summary": "This study introduces the concept of \"structural beauty\" as an objective\ncomputational approach for evaluating the aesthetic appeal of images. Through\nthe utilization of the Segment anything model (SAM), we propose a method that\nleverages recursive segmentation to extract finer-grained substructures.\nAdditionally, by reconstructing the hierarchical structure, we obtain a more\naccurate representation of substructure quantity and hierarchy. This approach\nreproduces and extends our previous research, allowing for the simultaneous\nassessment of Livingness in full-color images without the need for grayscale\nconversion or separate computations for foreground and background Livingness.\nFurthermore, the application of our method to the Scenic or Not dataset, a\nrepository of subjective scenic ratings, demonstrates a high degree of\nconsistency with subjective ratings in the 0-6 score range. This underscores\nthat structural beauty is not solely a subjective perception, but a\nquantifiable attribute accessible through objective computation. Through our\ncase studies, we have arrived at three significant conclusions. 1) our method\ndemonstrates the capability to accurately segment meaningful objects, including\ntrees, buildings, and windows, as well as abstract substructures within\npaintings. 2) we observed that the clarity of an image impacts our\ncomputational results; clearer images tend to yield higher Livingness scores.\nHowever, for equally blurry images, Livingness does not exhibit a significant\nreduction, aligning with human visual perception. 3) our approach fundamentally\ndiffers from methods employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for\npredicting image scores. Our method not only provides computational results but\nalso offers transparency and interpretability, positioning it as a novel avenue\nin the realm of Explainable AI (XAI).",

However, constructing\nsuitable contrastive pairs for CL, especially within Knowledge Graphs (KGs),\nhas been challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel node-based contrastive\nlearning method for knowledge graph embedding, NC-KGE.

This scheme can be\neasily integrated with other knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods. For\ndownstream task such as biochemical relationship prediction, we have\nincorporated a relation-aware attention mechanism into NC-KGE, focusing on the\nsemantic relationships and node interactions. Extensive experiments show that\nNC-KGE performs competitively with state-of-the-art models on public datasets\nlike FB15k-237 and WN18RR.

LLP has been applied pre-dominantly on\ntwo types of datasets - image and tabular. In image LLP, bags of fixed size are\ncreated by randomly sampling instances from an underlying dataset. Bags created\nvia this methodology are called random bags. Experimentation on Image LLP has\nbeen mostly on random bags on CIFAR-* and MNIST datasets. Despite being a very\ncrucial task in privacy sensitive applications, tabular LLP does not yet have a\nopen, large scale LLP benchmark. One of the unique properties of tabular LLP is\nthe ability to create feature bags where all the instances in a bag have the\nsame value for a given feature. It has been shown in prior research that\nfeature bags are very common in practical, real world applications [Chen et. al\n'23, Saket et. al. '22].\n  In this paper, we address the lack of a open, large scale tabular benchmark.\nFirst we propose LLP-Bench, a suite of 56 LLP datasets (52 feature bag and 4\nrandom bag datasets) created from the Criteo CTR prediction dataset consisting\nof 45 million instances. The 56 datasets represent diverse ways in which bags\ncan be constructed from underlying tabular data. To the best of our knowledge,\nLLP-Bench is the first large scale tabular LLP benchmark with an extensive\ndiversity in constituent datasets. Second, we propose four metrics that\ncharacterize and quantify the hardness of a LLP dataset. Using these four\nmetrics we present deep analysis of the 56 datasets in LLP-Bench. Finally we\npresent the performance of 9 SOTA and popular tabular LLP techniques on all the\n56 datasets.

Recent studies on OpenAI's generative\nmodel GPT-3.5 proved its superiority in predicting the natural language with\nhigh accuracy and human-like responses. GPT-3.5 has been trained over enormous\nonline language materials such as journals and Wikipedia; therefore, more than\ndirect usage of pre-trained GPT-3.5 is required for automatic scoring as\nstudents utilize a different language than trained material. These imply that a\ndomain-specific model, fine-tuned over data for specific tasks, can enhance\nmodel performance. In this study, we fine-tuned GPT-3.5 on six assessment tasks\nwith a diverse dataset of middle-school and high-school student responses and\nexpert scoring. The six tasks comprise two multi-label and four multi-class\nassessment tasks. We compare the performance of fine-tuned GPT-3.5 with the\nfine-tuned state-of-the-art Google's generated language model, BERT. The\nresults show that in-domain training corpora constructed from science questions\nand responses for BERT achieved average accuracy = 0.838, SD = 0.069. GPT-3.5\nshows a remarkable average increase (9.1%) in automatic scoring accuracy (mean\n= 9.15, SD = 0.042) for the six tasks, p =0.001 < 0.05. Specifically, for\nmulti-label tasks (item 1 with 5 labels; item 2 with 10 labels), GPT-3.5\nachieved significantly higher scoring accuracy than BERT across all the labels,\nwith the second item achieving a 7.1% increase. The average scoring increase\nfor the four multi-class items for GPT-3.5 was 10.6% compared to BERT. Our\nstudy confirmed the effectiveness of fine-tuned GPT-3.5 for automatic scoring\nof student responses on domain-specific data in education with high accuracy.\nWe have released fine-tuned models for public use and community engagement.",

These\nprinciples are instantiated in a computational model called CASPER (Concurrent\nAttention: Serial and Parallel Evaluation with Relations), originally developed\nby Hummel, that I have adapted to account for a range of phenomena in visual\nsearch. I then describe an extension of the CASPER model to account for our\nability to search for visual items defined not simply by the features composing\nthose items but by the spatial relations among those features. Seven\nexperiments (four main experiments and three replications) are described that\ntest CASPER's predictions about relational search. Finally, I evaluate the fit\nbetween CASPER's predictions and the empirical findings and show with three\nadditional simulations that CASPER can account for negative acceleration in\nsearch functions for relational stimuli if one postulates that the visual\nsystem is leveraging an emergent feature that bypasses relational processing.",

            "summary": "In computational chemistry, crystal structure prediction (CSP) is an\noptimization problem that involves discovering the lowest energy stable crystal\nstructure for a given chemical formula. This problem is challenging as it\nrequires discovering globally optimal designs with the lowest energies on\ncomplex manifolds. One approach to tackle this problem involves building\nsimulators based on density functional theory (DFT) followed by running search\nin simulation, but these simulators are painfully slow. In this paper, we study\npresent and study an alternate, data-driven approach to crystal structure\nprediction: instead of directly searching for the most stable structures in\nsimulation, we train a surrogate model of the crystal formation energy from a\ndatabase of existing crystal structures, and then optimize this model with\nrespect to the parameters of the crystal structure. This surrogate model is\ntrained to be conservative so as to prevent exploitation of its errors by the\noptimizer. To handle optimization in the non-Euclidean space of crystal\nstructures, we first utilize a state-of-the-art graph diffusion auto-encoder\n(CD-VAE) to convert a crystal structure into a vector-based search space and\nthen optimize a conservative surrogate model of the crystal energy, trained on\ntop of this vector representation. We show that our approach, dubbed LCOMs\n(latent conservative objective models), performs comparably to the best current\napproaches in terms of success rate of structure prediction, while also\ndrastically reducing computational cost.",

However, such a multi-stage strategy inevitably leads to the\naccumulation of the errors caused by each involved operation, and degrades its\nfinal estimation on global rotations accordingly. To address this problem, we\npropose an End-to-end method for estimating Absolution Rotations from\nmulti-view images based on deep neural Networks, called EAR-Net. The proposed\nEAR-Net consists of an epipolar confidence graph construction module and a\nconfidence-aware rotation averaging module. The epipolar confidence graph\nconstruction module is explored to simultaneously predict pairwise relative\nrotations among the input images and their corresponding confidences, resulting\nin a weighted graph (called epipolar confidence graph). Based on this graph,\nthe confidence-aware rotation averaging module, which is differentiable, is\nexplored to predict the absolute rotations. Thanks to the introduced\nconfidences of the relative rotations, the proposed EAR-Net could effectively\nhandle outlier cases. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate\nthat EAR-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in\nterms of accuracy and speed.",

            "summary": "In leading collaborative filtering (CF) models, representations of users and\nitems are prone to learn popularity bias in the training data as shortcuts. The\npopularity shortcut tricks are good for in-distribution (ID) performance but\npoorly generalized to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., when popularity\ndistribution of test data shifts w.r.t. the training one. To close the gap,\ndebiasing strategies try to assess the shortcut degrees and mitigate them from\nthe representations. However, there exist two deficiencies: (1) when measuring\nthe shortcut degrees, most strategies only use statistical metrics on a single\naspect (i.e., item frequency on item and user frequency on user aspect),\nfailing to accommodate the compositional degree of a user-item pair; (2) when\nmitigating shortcuts, many strategies assume that the test distribution is\nknown in advance. This results in low-quality debiased representations. Worse\nstill, these strategies achieve OOD generalizability with a sacrifice on ID\nperformance. In this work, we present a simple yet effective debiasing\nstrategy, PopGo, which quantifies and reduces the interaction-wise popularity\nshortcut without any assumptions on the test data. It first learns a shortcut\nmodel, which yields a shortcut degree of a user-item pair based on their\npopularity representations. Then, it trains the CF model by adjusting the\npredictions with the interaction-wise shortcut degrees. By taking both causal-\nand information-theoretical looks at PopGo, we can justify why it encourages\nthe CF model to capture the critical popularity-agnostic features while leaving\nthe spurious popularity-relevant patterns out. We use PopGo to debias two\nhigh-performing CF models (MF, LightGCN) on four benchmark datasets. On both ID\nand OOD test sets, PopGo achieves significant gains over the state-of-the-art\ndebiasing strategies (e.g., DICE, MACR).",

With the severe shortage of kidney supplies\nand for the clinical effectiveness of transplantation, patient's life\nexpectancy post transplantation is used to prioritize patients for\ntransplantation; however, severe comorbidity conditions and old age are the\nmost dominant factors that negatively impact post-transplantation life\nexpectancy, effectively precluding sick or old patients from receiving\ntransplants. It would be crucial to design objective measures to quantify the\ntransplantation benefit by comparing the mean residual life with and without a\ntransplant, after adjusting for comorbidity and demographic conditions. To\naddress this urgent need, we propose a new class of semiparametric\ncovariate-dependent mean residual life models. Our method estimates covariate\neffects semiparametrically efficiently and the mean residual life function\nnonparametrically, enabling us to predict the residual life increment potential\nfor any given patient. Our method potentially leads to a more fair system that\nprioritizes patients who would have the largest residual life gains.

Using unsupervised machine learning, we examined different curve\narchetypes, as well as the fundamental properties of each resilience curve\narchetype. The results show two primary archetypes for power system resilience\ncurves, triangular, and trapezoidal curves. Triangular curves characterize\nresilience behavior based on 1. critical functionality threshold, 2. critical\nfunctionality recovery rate, and 3. recovery pivot point. Trapezoidal\narchetypes explain resilience curves based on 1. duration of sustained function\nloss and 2. constant recovery rate.

            "summary": "Indoor scene generation aims at creating shape-compatible, style-consistent\nfurniture arrangements within a spatially reasonable layout. However, most\nexisting approaches primarily focus on generating plausible furniture layouts\nwithout incorporating specific details related to individual furniture pieces.\nTo address this limitation, we propose a two-stage model integrating shape\npriors into the indoor scene generation by encoding furniture as anchor latent\nrepresentations. In the first stage, we employ discrete vector quantization to\nencode furniture pieces as anchor-latents. Based on the anchor-latents\nrepresentation, the shape and location information of the furniture was\ncharacterized by a concatenation of location, size, orientation, class, and our\nanchor latent. In the second stage, we leverage a transformer model to predict\nindoor scenes autoregressively. Thanks to incorporating the proposed\nanchor-latents representations, our generative model produces shape-compatible\nand style-consistent furniture arrangements and synthesis furniture in diverse\nshapes. Furthermore, our method facilitates various human interaction\napplications, such as style-consistent scene completion, object mismatch\ncorrection, and controllable object-level editing. Experimental results on the\n3D-Front dataset demonstrate that our approach can generate more consistent and\ncompatible indoor scenes compared to existing methods, even without shape\nretrieval. Additionally, extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness\nof our design choices in the indoor scene generation model.",

            "summary": "In the sequential recommendation task, the recommender generally learns\nmultiple embeddings from a user's historical behaviors, to catch the diverse\ninterests of the user. Nevertheless, the existing approaches just extract each\ninterest independently for the corresponding sub-sequence while ignoring the\nglobal correlation of the entire interaction sequence, which may fail to\ncapture the user's inherent preference for the potential interests\ngeneralization and unavoidably make the recommended items homogeneous with the\nhistorical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Scale Interest\nExtraction framework (DSIE) to precisely estimate the user's current interests.\nSpecifically, DSIE explicitly models the user's inherent preference with\ncontrastive learning by attending over his/her entire interaction sequence at\nthe global scale and catches the user's diverse interests in a fine granularity\nat the local scale. Moreover, we develop a novel interest aggregation module to\nintegrate the multi-interests according to the inherent preference to generate\nthe user's current interests for the next-item prediction. Experiments\nconducted on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSIE\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation preciseness\nand novelty.",

            "summary": "A new resolvent-based method is developed to predict the space-time\nproperties of the flow field. To overcome the deterioration of the prediction\naccuracy with the increasing distance between the measurements and predictions\nin the Resolvent-Based Estimation (RBE), the newly proposed method utilizes the\nRBE to estimate the relative energy distribution near the wall rather than the\nabsolute energy directly estimated from the measurements. Using this extra\ninformation from RBE, the new method modifies the energy distribution of the\nspatially uniform and uncorrelated forcing that drives the flow system by\nminimizing the norm of the cross-spectral density (CSD) tensor of the error\nmatrix in the near-wall region in comparison with the RBE-estimated one, and\ntherefore it is named as the Resolvent-informed White-noise-based Estimation\n(RWE) method. For validation, three time-resolved direct numerical simulation\n(DNS) datasets with the friction Reynolds numbers $Re_\\tau = 180$, 550, and 950\nare generated, with various locations of measurements ranging from the\nnear-wall region ($y^+ = 40$) to the upper bound of the logarithmic region\n($y/h \\approx 0.2$) for the predictions. Besides the RWE, three existing\nmethods, i.e., the RBE, the $\\lambda$-model, and the White-noise-Based\nEstimation (WBE), are also included for the validation. The performance of the\nRBE and $\\lambda$-model in predicting the energy spectra shows a strong\ndependence on the measurement locations. The newly proposed RWE shows a low\nsensitivity on $Re_{\\tau}$ and the measurement locations, which may range from\nthe near-wall region to the upper bound of the logarithmic region, and has a\nhigh accuracy in predicting the energy spectra.",

Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged to become a popular\nfoundation model in computer vision due to its impressive generalization to\nunseen data and tasks. Realizing flexible attacks on SAM is beneficial for\nunderstanding the robustness of SAM in the adversarial context. To this end,\nthis work aims to achieve a targeted adversarial attack (TAA) on SAM.\nSpecifically, under a certain prompt, the goal is to make the predicted mask of\nan adversarial example resemble that of a given target image. The task of TAA\non SAM has been realized in a recent arXiv work in the white-box setup by\nassuming access to prompt and model, which is thus less practical. To address\nthe issue of prompt dependence, we propose a simple yet effective approach by\nonly attacking the image encoder. Moreover, we propose a novel regularization\nloss to enhance the cross-model transferability by increasing the feature\ndominance of adversarial images over random natural images. Extensive\nexperiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed simple techniques to\nconduct a successful black-box TAA on SAM.",

            "summary": "While machine learning (ML) has made significant contributions to the\nbiopharmaceutical field, its applications are still in the early stages in\nterms of providing direct support for quality-by-design based development and\nmanufacturing of biopharmaceuticals, hindering the enormous potential for\nbioprocesses automation from their development to manufacturing. However, the\nadoption of ML-based models instead of conventional multivariate data analysis\nmethods is significantly increasing due to the accumulation of large-scale\nproduction data. This trend is primarily driven by the real-time monitoring of\nprocess variables and quality attributes of biopharmaceutical products through\nthe implementation of advanced process analytical technologies. Given the\ncomplexity and multidimensionality of a bioproduct design, bioprocess\ndevelopment, and product manufacturing data, ML-based approaches are\nincreasingly being employed to achieve accurate, flexible, and high-performing\npredictive models to address the problems of analytics, monitoring, and control\nwithin the biopharma field. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review\nof the current applications of ML solutions in a bioproduct design, monitoring,\ncontrol, and optimisation of upstream, downstream, and product formulation\nprocesses. Finally, this paper thoroughly discusses the main challenges related\nto the bioprocesses themselves, process data, and the use of machine learning\nmodels in biopharmaceutical process development and manufacturing. Moreover, it\noffers further insights into the adoption of innovative machine learning\nmethods and novel trends in the development of new digital biopharma solutions.",

These erythrocyte aggregates are often branched porous networks\n-- a feature that existing red blood cell aggregation models and simulations\nfail to predict exactly. Here we establish that alignment-dependent attractive\nforces in a system of dimers can precisely generate branched structures similar\nto RBC aggregates observed under a microscope. Our simulations consistently\npredict that the growth rate of typical mean rouleau size remains sub-linear --\na hallmark from past studies -- which we also confirm by deriving a reaction\nkernel taking into account appropriate collision cross-section, approach\nvelocities, and an area-dependent sticking probability. The system exhibits\nunique features such as the existence of percolated and/or single giant cluster\nstates, multiple coexisting mass-size scalings, and transition to a branched\nphase upon fine-tuning of model parameters. Upon decreasing the depletion\nthickness we find that the percolation threshold increases and the morphology\nof the structures opens up towards an increased degree of branching. Remarkably\nthe system self-organizes to produce a universal power-law size distribution\nscaling irrespective of the model parameters.",

Unexplored in previous literature, relaxing symmetry in Shapley\nvalues can have counter-intuitive consequences for model explanation. To better\nunderstand the method, we first show how local contributions correspond to\nglobal contributions of variance reduction. Using variance, we demonstrate\nmultiple cases where ASV yields counter-intuitive attributions, arguably\nproducing incorrect results for root-cause analysis. Second, we identify\ngeneralized additive models (GAM) as a restricted class for which ASV exhibits\ndesirable properties.

Our\nkey innovation lies in EOF which employs boundary-sensitive sampling and\nepipolar-line constraints into optical flow to accurately establish 2D\ncorrespondences across multiple views on transparent objects.

Thus single anomalous exponents and single generalized\ndiffusion coefficients are unable to satisfactorily describe many crucial\nphenomena in cellular and molecular biology. We consider advances in the field\nof heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) highlighting: experimental\ntechniques (single molecule methods, microscopy, image analysis, fluorescence\ncorrelation spectroscopy, inelastic neutron scattering, and NMR), theoretical\ntools for data analysis (robust statistical methods such as first passage\nprobabilities, survival analysis, different varieties of mean square\ndisplacements, etc), analytic theory and generative theoretical models based on\nsimulations. Special emphasis is made on high throughput analysis techniques\nbased on machine learning and neural networks. Furthermore, we consider\nanomalous transport in the context of microrheology and the heterogeneous\nviscoelasticity of complex fluids. HAT in the wavefronts of reaction-diffusion\nsystems is also considered since it plays an important role in morphogenesis\nand signalling.

A dramatic consequence of these transitions is that\nquasistatic deformation cycles modify the reference state, facilitating the\nstorage and release of mechanical energy. Here we develop a continuum theory\nthat generalizes classical elasticity by accounting both for the absence of\nreference state, and the lack of conserved potential energy. Our theory\nincludes a new modulus describing non-conservative mechanical screening. We\nderive predictions in closed analytic form for the deformation field for\nvarious perturbations and geometries. While our theory applies to general\ndisordered solids, we focus on a two-dimensional disordered granular system and\npredict accurately the non-affine displacement fields observed in experiments\nfor both small and large deformations. The new proposed moduli satisfy\nuniversal relations that are independent of the specific experimental\nrealization.

During training, ThermaStrain incorporates a wearable electrodermal\nactivity (EDA) sensor to generate stress-indicative representations from\nthermal videos, emulating stress-indicative representations from a wearable EDA\nsensor. During testing, only thermal sensing is used, and stress-indicative\npatterns from thermal data and emulated EDA representations are extracted to\nimprove stress assessment. The study collected a comprehensive dataset with\nthermal video and EDA data under various stress conditions and distances.\nThermaStrain achieves an F1 score of 0.8293 in binary stress classification,\noutperforming the thermal-only baseline approach by over 9%. Extensive\nevaluations highlight ThermaStrain's effectiveness in recognizing\nstress-indicative attributes, its adaptability across distances and stress\nscenarios, real-time executability on edge platforms, its applicability to\nmulti-individual sensing, ability to function on limited visibility and\nunfamiliar conditions, and the advantages of its co-teaching approach.",

In this work,\nwe test alternative mPLMs, such as mBART and NLLB-200, and compare various\napproaches proposed in the literature in a unified setting. We first underline\nthe importance of tuning learning rate used for finetuning, which helps to\nsubstantially alleviate the problem of generation in the wrong language.

This approach not only\nidentifies potential anomalies but can also serve as a first step toward\nbuilding predictive maintenance policies. In this work, we demonstrate a novel\nanomaly detection system on induction motors used in pumps, compressors, fans,\nand other industrial machines. This work evaluates a combination of\npre-processing techniques and machine learning (ML) models with a low\ncomputational cost. We use a combination of pre-processing techniques such as\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT), Wavelet Transform (WT), and binning, which are\nwell-known approaches for extracting features from raw data. We also aim to\nguarantee an optimal balance between multiple conflicting parameters, such as\nanomaly detection rate, false positive rate, and inference speed of the\nsolution. To this end, multiobjective optimization and analysis are performed\non the evaluated models. Pareto-optimal solutions are presented to select which\nmodels have the best results regarding classification metrics and computational\neffort. Differently from most works in this field that use publicly available\ndatasets to validate their models, we propose an end-to-end solution combining\nlow-cost and readily available IoT sensors. The approach is validated by\nacquiring a custom dataset from induction motors. Also, we fuse vibration,\ntemperature, and noise data from these sensors as the input to the proposed ML\nmodel. Therefore, we aim to propose a methodology general enough to be applied\nin different industrial contexts in the future.",

This task is high-dimensional and highly constrained\nowing to the highly deformable DLOs, dual-arm robots with high degrees of\nfreedom, and 3-D complex environments, which render global planning\nchallenging. Furthermore, accurate DLO models needed by planning are often\nunavailable owing to their strong nonlinearity and diversity, resulting in\nunreliable planned paths. This article focuses on the global moving and shaping\nof DLOs in constrained environments by dual-arm robots. The main objectives are\n1) to efficiently and accurately accomplish this task, and 2) to achieve\ngeneralizable and robust manipulation of various DLOs. To this end, we propose\na complementary framework with whole-body planning and control using\nappropriate DLO model representations. First, a global planner is proposed to\nefficiently find feasible solutions based on a simplified DLO energy model,\nwhich considers the full system states and all constraints to plan more\nreliable paths. Then, a closed-loop manipulation scheme is proposed to\ncompensate for the modeling errors and enhance the robustness and accuracy,\nwhich incorporates a model predictive controller that real-time adjusts the\nrobot motion based on an adaptive DLO motion model. The key novelty is that our\nframework can efficiently solve the high-dimensional problem subject to\nmultiple constraints and generalize to various DLOs without elaborate model\nidentifications. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can accomplish\nconsiderably more complicated tasks than existing works, with significantly\nhigher efficiency, generalizability, and reliability.",

In this\npaper, we propose a real-time adaptive multi-contact model predictive control\nframework, which enables online adaption of the hybrid multi-contact model and\ncontinuous improvement of the control performance for contact-rich tasks. This\nframework includes an adaption module, which continuously learns a residual of\nthe hybrid model to minimize the gap between the prior model and reality, and a\nreal-time multi-contact MPC controller. We demonstrated the effectiveness of\nthe framework in synthetic examples, and applied it on hardware to solve\ncontact-rich manipulation tasks, where a robot uses its end-effector to roll\ndifferent unknown objects on a table to track given paths.

This motivates a neural radiance\nfield (NeRF)-like representation which captures photometric, geometric and\nsemantic properties of the scene grounded. This representation is well-suited\nto synthesizing new observations from different viewpoints. And thereby, a\nsampling-based planner can be used to calculate the predictive information from\nsynthetic observations along dynamically-feasible trajectories.

            "summary": "In real Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) systems, demand is subject to high and\ndynamic volatility, which is difficult to predict by conventional time-series\nforecasting approaches. Most existing forecasting approaches yield the point\nvalue as the prediction result, which ignores the uncertainty that exists in\nthe forecasting result. This will lead to the forecasting result severely\ndeviating from the true demand value due to the high volatility existing in\ndemand. To fill the gap, we propose an extended recurrent mixture density\nnetwork (XRMDN), which extends the weight and mean neural networks to recurrent\nneural networks. The recurrent neurons for mean and variance can capture the\ntrend of the historical data-series data, which enables a better forecasting\nresult in dynamic and high volatility. We conduct comprehensive experiments on\none taxi trip record and one bike-sharing real MoD data set to validate the\nperformance of XRMDN. Specifically, we compare our model to three types of\nbenchmark models, including statistical, machine learning, and deep learning\nmodels on three evaluation metrics. The validation results show that XRMDN\noutperforms the three groups of benchmark models in terms of the evaluation\nmetrics. Most importantly, XRMDN substantially improves the forecasting\naccuracy with the demands in strong volatility. Last but not least, this\nprobabilistic demand forecasting model contributes not only to the demand\nprediction in MoD systems but also to other optimization application problems,\nespecially optimization under uncertainty, in MoD applications.",

The recently proposed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product\noperator (GTEMPO) method is one of the representative methods in this\ndirection. In this work we systematically study the performance of GTEMPO in\nsolving equilibrium quantum impurity problems at a finite temperature with\nsemicircular spectrum density of the bath. Our results show that its\ncomputational cost would generally increase as the temperature goes down and\nscale exponentially with the number of orbitals.

The modular limb design allows the robot to\nmorph into reptile- or mammal-inspired forms. In contrast to the prevailing\nfocus on planar limbs, this research delves into the classical overconstrained\nlinkages, which have strong theoretical foundations in advanced kinematics but\nlimited engineering applications. The study showcases the morphological\nsuperiority of overconstrained robotic limbs that can transform into planar or\nspherical limbs, exemplifying the Bennett linkage. By conducting kinematic and\ndynamic modeling, we apply model predictive control to simulate a range of\nlocomotion tasks, revealing that overconstrained limbs outperform planar\ndesigns in omni-directional tasks like forward trotting, lateral trotting, and\nturning on the spot when considering foothold distances. These findings\nhighlight the biological distinctions in limb design between reptiles and\nmammals and represent the first documented instance of overconstrained robotic\nlimbs outperforming planar designs in dynamic locomotion.",

However, open-ended learning environments pose challenges for\naccurately modeling students due to the diverse behaviors exhibited by students\nand the absence of a well-defined set of learning skills. To approach these\nchallenges, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nin-context student modeling in open-ended learning environments. We introduce a\nnovel framework, LLM-SS, that leverages LLMs for synthesizing student's\nbehavior. More concretely, given a particular student's solving attempt on a\nreference task as observation, the goal is to synthesize the student's attempt\non a target task. Our framework can be combined with different LLMs; moreover,\nwe fine-tune LLMs using domain-specific expertise to boost their understanding\nof domain background and student behaviors. We evaluate several concrete\nmethods based on LLM-SS using the StudentSyn benchmark, an existing student's\nattempt synthesis benchmark in visual programming. Experimental results show a\nsignificant improvement compared to baseline methods included in the StudentSyn\nbenchmark.

The frequencies of maximum amplitude in DSCT stars are in poor\nagreement with unstable frequencies from the models. There is a well-defined\nupper envelope in the frequencies of maximum amplitude as a function of\neffective temperature for DSCT and MAIA stars which requires an explanation.\nThe gamma Doradus (GDOR) stars should be regarded as DSCT stars with suppressed\nhigh frequencies rather than a separate class. They are found mostly among the\ncool DSCT stars, but occur throughout the DSCT instability strip and as early\nA-type stars, where they merge with the SPB variables. The mixture of DSCT and\nGDOR stars throughout the instability strip is one example of the unexplained\nlarge variation of frequency patterns in DSCT stars. The location of beta\nCephei stars in the H-R diagram agrees quite well with the models, but the\nobserved frequencies are generally higher than predicted.

Here, we present a lens model for SMACS J0723.3-7327\nanchored on five spectroscopically-confirmed systems at $1.38 \\leq z \\leq 2.21$\nthat are multiply lensed, along with twelve other systems with proposed image\ncounterparts sharing common colours, spectral energy distributions, and\nmorphological features, but having unknown redshifts. Constrained only by their\nimage positions and, where available, redshifts, our lens model correctly\nreproduces the positions and correctly predicts the morphologies and relative\nbrightnesses of all these image counterparts, as well as providing\ngeometrically-determined redshifts spanning $1.4 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 6.7$ for\nthe twelve candidate multiply-lensed galaxies lacking spectroscopic\nmeasurements. From this lens model, we create a lens finder map that defines\nregions over which galaxies beyond a certain redshift are predicted to be\nmultiply lensed. Applying this map to three galaxies claimed to be at $10\n\\lesssim z \\lesssim 20$, we find no image counterparts at locations (with an\nuncertainty of $\\sim$$0.^{\\prime\\prime}5$) where they ought to be sufficiently\nmagnified to be detectable - suggesting instead that these galaxies lie at $z\n\\lesssim 1.7-3.2$.

Unlike old nodes, new nodes have few historical links,\nwhich poses a challenge for the dynamic link prediction task. Most existing\ndynamic models treat all nodes equally and are not specialized for new nodes,\nresulting in suboptimal performances. In this paper, we consider dynamic link\nprediction of new nodes as a few-shot problem and propose a novel model based\non the meta-learning principle to effectively mitigate this problem.\nSpecifically, we develop a temporal encoder with a node-level span memory to\nobtain a new node embedding, and then we use a predictor to determine whether\nthe new node generates a link. To overcome the few-shot challenge, we\nincorporate the encoder-predictor into the meta-learning paradigm, which can\nlearn two types of implicit information during the formation of the temporal\nnetwork through span adaptation and node adaptation. The acquired implicit\ninformation can serve as model initialisation and facilitate rapid adaptation\nto new nodes through a fine-tuning process on just a few links.

Most existing negative sampling methods assume\nthat non-existent triples with high scores are high-quality negative triples.\nHowever, negative triples sampled by these methods are likely to contain noise.\nSpecifically, they ignore that non-existent triples with high scores might also\nbe true facts due to the incompleteness of KGs, which are usually called false\nnegative triples. To alleviate the above issue, we propose an easily pluggable\ndenoising mixup method called DeMix, which generates high-quality triples by\nrefining sampled negative triples in a self-supervised manner. Given a sampled\nunlabeled triple, DeMix firstly classifies it into a marginal pseudo-negative\ntriple or a negative triple based on the judgment of the KGE model itself.\nSecondly, it selects an appropriate mixup partner for the current triple to\nsynthesize a partially positive or a harder negative triple.

            "summary": "With the development of the information age, cities provide a large amount of\ndata that can be analyzed and utilized to facilitate the decision-making\nprocess. Urban big data and analytics are particularly valuable in the analysis\nof business location decisions, providing insight and supporting informed\nchoices. By examining data relating to commercial locations, it becomes\npossible to analyze various spatial characteristics and derive the feasibility\nof different locations. This analytical approach contributes to effective\ndecision-making and the formulation of robust location strategies. To\nillustrate this, the study focuses on Starbucks cafes in the Tianhe District of\nGuangzhou City, China. Utilizing data visualization maps, the spatial\ndistribution characteristics and influencing factors of Starbucks locations are\nanalyzed. By examining the geographical coordinates of Starbucks, main\ndistribution characteristics are identified. Through this analysis, it explores\nthe factors influencing the spatial layout of commercial store locations, using\nStarbucks as a case study. The findings offer valuable insights into the\nmanagement of industrial layout and the location strategies of commercial\nbusinesses in urban environments, opening avenues for further research and\ndevelopment in this field.",

To mitigate this problem, one of the most popular solutions is\nto render images at a low resolution to reduce rendering overhead, and then\nmanage to accurately upsample the low-resolution rendered image to the target\nresolution, a.k.a. super-resolution techniques. Most existing methods focus on\nexploiting information from low-resolution inputs, such as historical frames.\nThe absence of high frequency details in those LR inputs makes them hard to\nrecover fine details in their high-resolution predictions. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient and effective super-resolution method that predicts\nhigh-quality upsampled reconstructions utilizing low-cost high-resolution\nauxiliary G-Buffers as additional input. With LR images and HR G-buffers as\ninput, the network requires to align and fuse features at multi resolution\nlevels. We introduce an efficient and effective H-Net architecture to solve\nthis problem and significantly reduce rendering overhead without noticeable\nquality deterioration. Experiments show that our method is able to produce\ntemporally consistent reconstructions in $4 \\times 4$ and even challenging $8\n\\times 8$ upsampling cases at 4K resolution with real-time performance, with\nsubstantially improved quality and significant performance boost compared to\nexisting works.",

We demonstrate that statistics of finite-time Lyapunov\nexponents have the same form as in incompressible flow due to density-velocity\ncoupling. Modulus of the smallest Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda_3$ provides the\nprincipal Lyapunov exponent of the time-reversed flow, which usually is wrong\nin a compressible flow. This exponent, along with the principal Lyapunov\nexponent $\\lambda_1$, determines all the exponents due to the vanishing of the\nsum of all Lyapunov exponents. Numerical results by high-order schemes for\nsolving the Navier-Stokes equations and tracking particles verify these\ntheoretical predictions. We found that: 1) The largest normalized Lyapunov\nexponent $\\lambda_1 \\tau_\\eta$, where $\\tau_\\eta$ is the Kolmogorov time scale,\nis a decreasing function of $M_t$. Its dependence on $Re_\\lambda$ is weak when\nthe driving force is solenoidal, while it is an increasing function of\n$Re_\\lambda$ when the solenoidal and compressible forces are comparable.\nSimilar facts hold for $|\\lambda_3|$, in contrast with well-studied\nshort-correlated model; 2) The ratio of the first two Lyapunov exponents\n$\\lambda_1/\\lambda_2$ decreases with $Re_\\lambda$, and is virtually independent\nof $M_t$ for $M_t \\le 1$ in the case of solenoidal force but decreases as $M_t$\nincreases when solenoidal and compressible forces are comparable; 3) For purely\nsolenoidal force, $\\lambda_1 :\\lambda_2 :\\lambda_3 \\approx 4:1:-5$ for\n$Re_\\lambda > 80$, which is consistent with incompressible turbulence studies;\n4) The ratio of dilation-to-vorticity is a more suitable parameter to\ncharacterize LEs than $M_t$.",

However,\nthree key challenges hinder current SGNN-based signed graph representation\nlearning: sparsity in signed graphs leaves latent structures undiscovered,\nunbalanced triangles pose representation difficulties for SGNN models, and\nreal-world signed graph datasets often lack supplementary information like node\nlabels and features. These constraints limit the potential of SGNN-based\nrepresentation learning. We address these issues with data augmentation\ntechniques. Despite many graph data augmentation methods existing for unsigned\ngraphs, none are tailored for signed graphs. Our paper introduces the novel\nSigned Graph Augmentation framework (SGA), comprising three main components.\nFirst, we employ the SGNN model to encode the signed graph, extracting latent\nstructural information for candidate augmentation structures. Second, we\nevaluate these candidate samples (edges) and select the most beneficial ones\nfor modifying the original training set. Third, we propose a novel augmentation\nperspective that assigns varying training difficulty to training samples,\nenabling the design of a new training strategy. Extensive experiments on six\nreal-world datasets (Bitcoin-alpha, Bitcoin-otc, Epinions, Slashdot, Wiki-elec,\nand Wiki-RfA) demonstrate that SGA significantly improves performance across\nmultiple benchmarks.

We apply the program to\nstudy the large-$N$ chiral perturbation theory ($\\chi$PT) and observe excellent\nconvergence of EFT bounds between the dual (rule-out) and primal (rule-in)\nmethods. This convergence aligns with the predictions of duality theory in SDP,\nenabling us to analyze the bound states and resonances in the ultra-violet (UV)\nspectrum. Furthermore, we incorporate the upper bound of unitarity to uniformly\nconstrain the EFT space from the UV scale $M$ using the primal method, thereby\nconfirming the consistency of the large-$N$ expansion. In the end, we translate\nthe large-$N$ $\\chi$PT bounds to constrain the higher derivative corrections of\nholographic QCD models.",

            "summary": "Visual active search (VAS) has been proposed as a modeling framework in which\nvisual cues are used to guide exploration, with the goal of identifying regions\nof interest in a large geospatial area. Its potential applications include\nidentifying hot spots of rare wildlife poaching activity, search-and-rescue\nscenarios, identifying illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, or people, and\nmany others. State of the art approaches to VAS include applications of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL), which yield end-to-end search policies, and\ntraditional active search, which combines predictions with custom algorithmic\napproaches. While the DRL framework has been shown to greatly outperform\ntraditional active search in such domains, its end-to-end nature does not make\nfull use of supervised information attained either during training, or during\nactual search, a significant limitation if search tasks differ significantly\nfrom those in the training distribution. We propose an approach that combines\nthe strength of both DRL and conventional active search by decomposing the\nsearch policy into a prediction module, which produces a geospatial\ndistribution of regions of interest based on task embedding and search history,\nand a search module, which takes the predictions and search history as input\nand outputs the search distribution. We develop a novel meta-learning approach\nfor jointly learning the resulting combined policy that can make effective use\nof supervised information obtained both at training and decision time. Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation and\nmeta-learning frameworks significantly outperform state of the art in visual\nactive search on several problem domains.",

However, the mechanisms behind their success\nremain largely unexplained due to the opaque nature of deep neural networks. In\nthis paper, we present a novel analytic framework that sheds light on the\nimplicit features learned by saliency models and provides principled\ninterpretation and quantification of their contributions to saliency\nprediction. Our approach decomposes these implicit features into interpretable\nbases that are explicitly aligned with semantic attributes and reformulates\nsaliency prediction as a weighted combination of probability maps connecting\nthe bases and saliency. By applying our framework, we conduct extensive\nanalyses from various perspectives, including the positive and negative weights\nof semantics, the impact of training data and architectural designs, the\nprogressive influences of fine-tuning, and common failure patterns of\nstate-of-the-art deep saliency models. Additionally, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework by exploring visual attention characteristics in\nvarious application scenarios, such as the atypical attention of people with\nautism spectrum disorder, attention to emotion-eliciting stimuli, and attention\nevolution over time.

The interactions among inner\nloops, outer loops, and the ac grid are analyzed. It reveals that inner loops\nshape the electrical damping torque coefficient and consequently influence both\nsynchronous and sub-synchronous oscillation modes. The virtual admittance and\ncurrent control-based inner-loop scheme is employed to illustrate the proposed\nanalytical approach. The case study comprises the analysis of impedance\nprofiles, the analysis of damping torque contributed by inner loops under\nvarious grid strengths, and the comparison between dq-frame and\n{\\alpha}\\b{eta}-frame realizations of inner loops.

            "summary": "We propose SelfVC, a training strategy to iteratively improve a voice\nconversion model with self-synthesized examples. Previous efforts on voice\nconversion focus on explicitly disentangling speech representations to\nseparately encode speaker characteristics and linguistic content. However,\ndisentangling speech representations to capture such attributes using\ntask-specific loss terms can lead to information loss by discarding finer\nnuances of the original signal. In this work, instead of explicitly\ndisentangling attributes with loss terms, we present a framework to train a\ncontrollable voice conversion model on entangled speech representations derived\nfrom self-supervised learning and speaker verification models. First, we\ndevelop techniques to derive prosodic information from the audio signal and SSL\nrepresentations to train predictive submodules in the synthesis model. Next, we\npropose a training strategy to iteratively improve the synthesis model for\nvoice conversion, by creating a challenging training objective using\nself-synthesized examples. In this training approach, the current state of the\nsynthesis model is used to generate voice-converted variations of an utterance,\nwhich serve as inputs for the reconstruction task, ensuring a continuous and\npurposeful refinement of the model. We demonstrate that incorporating such\nself-synthesized examples during training improves the speaker similarity of\ngenerated speech as compared to a baseline voice conversion model trained\nsolely on heuristically perturbed inputs. SelfVC is trained without any text\nand is applicable to a range of tasks such as zero-shot voice conversion,\ncross-lingual voice conversion, and controllable speech synthesis with pitch\nand pace modifications. SelfVC achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot\nvoice conversion on metrics evaluating naturalness, speaker similarity, and\nintelligibility of synthesized audio.",

            "summary": "When liquids are cooled sufficiently rapidly below their melting temperature,\nthey may bypass crystalization and, instead, enter a long-lived metastable\nsupercooled state that has long been the focus of intense research. Although\nthey exhibit strikingly different properties, both the (i) long-lived\nsupercooled liquid state and (ii) truly equilibrated (i.e., conventional\nequilibrium fluid or crystalline) phases of the same material share an\nidentical Hamiltonian. This suggests a mapping between dynamical and other\nobservables in these two different arenas. We formalize these notions via a\nsimple theorem and illustrate that given a Hamiltonian defining the dynamics:\n(1) the reduced probability densities of all possible stationary states are\nlinear combinations of reduced probability densities associated with thermal\nequilibria at different temperatures, chemical potentials, etc. (2) Excusing\nspecial cases, amongst all of these stationary states, a clustering of\ncorrelations is only consistent with conventional thermal equilibrium states\n(associated with a sharp distribution of the above state variables). (3) Other\nstationary states may be modified so as to have local correlations. These\ndeformations concomitantly lead to metastable (yet possibly very long-lived)\nstates. Since the lifetime of the supercooled state is exceptionally long\nrelative to the natural microscopic time scales, their reduced probability\ndensities may be close to those that we find for exact stationary states (i.e.,\na weighted average of equilibrium probability densities at different state\nvariables). This form suggests several new predictions such as the existence of\ndynamical heterogeneity stronger than probed for thus far and a relation\nbetween the specific heat peak and viscosities.

Instead of exchanging raw standard\ncurrent-voltage-time-usage data, our model communicates only the model\nparameters, thus reducing communication load and preserving data\nconfidentiality.

Accurate and timely\nanalysis of air pollution is crucial for understanding its underlying\nmechanisms and implementing necessary precautions to mitigate potential\nsocio-economic losses. Traditional analytical methodologies, such as\natmospheric modeling, heavily rely on domain expertise and often make\nsimplified assumptions that may not be applicable to complex air pollution\nproblems. In contrast, Machine Learning (ML) models are able to capture the\nintrinsic physical and chemical rules by automatically learning from a large\namount of historical observational data, showing great promise in various air\nquality analytical tasks. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of\nML-based air quality analytics, following a roadmap spanning from data\nacquisition to pre-processing, and encompassing various analytical tasks such\nas pollution pattern mining, air quality inference, and forecasting. Moreover,\nwe offer a systematic categorization and summary of existing methodologies and\napplications, while also providing a list of publicly available air quality\ndatasets to ease the research in this direction.

Therefore, we integrate tree structure into the\nexpression-level generation and advocate an expression tree decoding strategy.\nTo generate a tree with expression as its node, we employ a layer-wise parallel\ndecoding strategy: we decode multiple independent expressions (leaf nodes) in\nparallel at each layer and repeat parallel decoding layer by layer to\nsequentially generate these parent node expressions that depend on others.\nBesides, a bipartite matching algorithm is adopted to align multiple\npredictions with annotations for each layer.

Existing methods face several issues such as the need of\nexpensive annotations on the vertebral landmarks and being sensitive to the\nimage quality. It is challenging to achieve robust estimation and obtain\ninterpretable results, especially for low-quality images which are blurry and\nhazy. In this paper, we propose B-Spine, a novel deep learning pipeline to\nlearn B-spline curve representation of the spine and estimate the Cobb angles\nfor spinal curvature estimation from low-quality X-ray images. Given a\nlow-quality input, a novel SegRefine network which employs the unpaired\nimage-to-image translation is proposed to generate a high quality spine mask\nfrom the initial segmentation result. Next, a novel mask-based B-spline\nprediction model is proposed to predict the B-spline curve for the spine\ncenterline. Finally, the Cobb angles are estimated by a hybrid approach which\ncombines the curve slope analysis and a curve-based regression model. We\nconduct quantitative and qualitative comparisons with the representative and\nSOTA learning-based methods on the public AASCE2019 dataset and our new\nproposed CJUH-JLU dataset which contains more challenging low-quality images.\nThe superior performance on both datasets shows our method can achieve both\nrobustness and interpretability for spinal curvature estimation.",

            "summary": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) is a task that aims to predict items based\non anonymous sequences of user behaviors in a session. While there are methods\nthat leverage rich context information in sessions for SBR, most of them have\nthe following limitations: 1) they fail to distinguish the item-item edge types\nwhen constructing the global graph for exploiting cross-session contexts; 2)\nthey learn a fixed embedding vector for each item, which lacks the flexibility\nto reflect the variation of user interests across sessions; 3) they generally\nuse the one-hot encoded vector of the target item as the hard label to predict,\nthus failing to capture the true user preference. To solve these issues, we\npropose CARES, a novel context-aware session-based recommendation model with\ngraph neural networks, which utilizes different types of contexts in sessions\nto capture user interests. Specifically, we first construct a multi-relation\ncross-session graph to connect items according to intra- and cross-session\nitem-level contexts. Further, to encode the variation of user interests, we\ndesign personalized item representations. Finally, we employ a label\ncollaboration strategy for generating soft user preference distribution as\nlabels. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that CARES\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of P@20 and MRR@20.\nOur data and codes are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/brilliantZhang/CARES.",

            "summary": "Math word problem (MWP) solving aims to understand the descriptive math\nproblem and calculate the result, for which previous efforts are mostly devoted\nto upgrade different technical modules. This paper brings a different\nperspective of \\textit{reexamination process} during training by introducing a\npseudo-dual task to enhance the MWP solving. We propose a pseudo-dual (PseDual)\nlearning scheme to model such process, which is model-agnostic thus can be\nadapted to any existing MWP solvers. The pseudo-dual task is specifically\ndefined as filling the numbers in the expression back into the original word\nproblem with numbers masked. To facilitate the effective joint learning of the\ntwo tasks, we further design a scheduled fusion strategy for the number\ninfilling task, which smoothly switches the input from the ground-truth math\nexpressions to the predicted ones. Our pseudo-dual learning scheme has been\ntested and proven effective when being equipped in several representative MWP\nsolvers through empirical studies. \\textit{The codes and trained models are\navailable at:} \\url{https://github.com/steven640pixel/PsedualMWP}.\n\\end{abstract}",

            "summary": "With the emergence of multiple modern video codecs, streaming service\nproviders are forced to encode, store, and transmit bitrate ladders of multiple\ncodecs separately, consequently suffering from additional energy costs for\nencoding, storage, and transmission. To tackle this issue, we introduce an\nonline energy-efficient Multi-Codec Bitrate ladder Estimation scheme (MCBE) for\nadaptive video streaming applications. In MCBE, quality representations within\nthe bitrate ladder of new-generation codecs (e.g., High Efficiency Video Coding\n(HEVC), Alliance for Open Media Video 1 (AV1)) that lie below the predicted\nrate-distortion curve of the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) codec are removed.\nMoreover, perceptual redundancy between representations of the bitrate ladders\nof the considered codecs is also minimized based on a Just Noticeable\nDifference (JND) threshold. Therefore, random forest-based models predict the\nVMAF score of bitrate ladder representations of each codec. In a live streaming\nsession where all clients support the decoding of AVC, HEVC, and AV1, MCBE\nachieves impressive results, reducing cumulative encoding energy by 56.45%,\nstorage energy usage by 94.99%, and transmission energy usage by 77.61%\n(considering a JND of six VMAF points). These energy reductions are in\ncomparison to a baseline bitrate ladder encoding based on current industry\npractice.",

            "summary": "Much work has been dedicated to estimating and optimizing workloads in\nhigh-performance computing (HPC) and deep learning. However, researchers have\ntypically relied on few metrics to assess the efficiency of those techniques.\nMost notably, the accuracy, the loss of the prediction, and the computational\ntime with regard to GPUs or/and CPUs characteristics. It is rare to see figures\nfor power consumption, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate power\nreadings. In this paper, we introduce a composite score that aims to\ncharacterize the trade-off between accuracy and power consumption measured\nduring the inference of neural networks. For this purpose, we present a new\nopen-source tool allowing researchers to consider more metrics: granular power\nconsumption, but also RAM/CPU/GPU utilization, as well as storage, and network\ninput/output (I/O). To our best knowledge, it is the first fit test for neural\narchitectures on hardware architectures. This is made possible thanks to\nreproducible power efficiency measurements. We applied this procedure to\nstate-of-the-art neural network architectures on miscellaneous hardware. One of\nthe main applications and novelties is the measurement of algorithmic power\nefficiency. The objective is to allow researchers to grasp their algorithms'\nefficiencies better. This methodology was developed to explore trade-offs\nbetween energy usage and accuracy in neural networks. It is also useful when\nfitting hardware for a specific task or to compare two architectures more\naccurately, with architecture exploration in mind.",

Recent XAI literatures on STR only provide a simple\nanalysis and do not fully explore other XAI methods. In this study, we\nspecifically work on data explainability frameworks, called attribution-based\nmethods, that explain the important parts of an input data in deep learning\nmodels. However, integrating them into STR produces inconsistent and\nineffective explanations, because they only explain the model in the global\ncontext.

The existing methods highly rely on\nexperimental protein structure data and fail in scenarios where these data are\nunavailable. Predicted protein structures from AI tools (e.g., AlphaFold2) were\nutilized as alternatives.

While similar phenomena have been\nextensively studied in general fields (e.g., Computer Vision) as model\nrobustness, their impact on protein property prediction remains unexplored. In\nthis paper, we first investigate the reason behind the performance decrease\nwhen utilizing predicted structures, attributing it to the structure embedding\nbias from the perspective of structure representation learning. To study this\nproblem, we identify a Protein 3D Graph Structure Learning Problem for Robust\nProtein Property Prediction (PGSL-RP3), collect benchmark datasets, and present\na protein Structure embedding Alignment Optimization framework (SAO) to\nmitigate the problem of structure embedding bias between the predicted and\nexperimental protein structures.

            "summary": "Molecular docking is a structure-based computational drug design technique\nfor predicting the interaction between a small molecule (ligand) and a\nmacromolecule (receptor). Over the past three decades various docking software\nprograms have been developed, mostly for drug-like molecules. With the recent\ninterest in peptides as therapeutic molecules, several peptide docking methods\nhave also been developed. AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP), is a state-of-the-art\npeptide docking tool that predicts the interaction of peptide with up to 20\namino acids in a user defined region of a macromolecule, i.e.focused docking.\nRecent advances in deep learning (DL) approaches have shown remarkable success\nin docking linear peptides composed of natural amino acids only. Unlike ADCP,\nthese methods provide a confidence level in their predictions. Here we explore\nwhether ADCP and various DL methods (AlphaFold2 Monomer, AlphaFold2 Multimer,\nand OmegaFold) and their prediction confidence metric can be used to\ndiscriminate native and non-native substrates for HIV and FIV proteases. We\nfound that ADCP successfully predicts the interactions of native peptides but\nfails to discriminate non-native ones. This was expected as conventional\ndocking methods report solutions maximizing ligand receptor interactions for\nany ligand. Surprisingly, DL methods underperform when docking native peptides\ninto these particular docking targets but achieve high success rates with\nnon-native peptides. While AlphaFold managed to successfully dock a few of the\nnative peptides, OmegaFold failed to successfully dock any of them. Overall,\nnone of these methods is currently able to distinguish between native and\nnon-native peptides, warranting further exploration of specialized\nmethodologies.",

            "summary": "Spatiotemporal fusion aims to improve both the spatial and temporal\nresolution of remote sensing images, thus facilitating time-series analysis at\na fine spatial scale. However, there are several important issues that limit\nthe application of current spatiotemporal fusion methods. First, most\nspatiotemporal fusion methods are based on pixel-level computation, which\nneglects the valuable object-level information of the land surface. Moreover,\nmany existing methods cannot accurately retrieve strong temporal changes\nbetween the available high-resolution image at base date and the predicted one.\nThis study proposes an Object-Based Spatial Unmixing Model (OBSUM), which\nincorporates object-based image analysis and spatial unmixing, to overcome the\ntwo abovementioned problems. OBSUM consists of one preprocessing step and three\nfusion steps, i.e., object-level unmixing, object-level residual compensation,\nand pixel-level residual compensation. OBSUM can be applied using only one fine\nimage at the base date and one coarse image at the prediction date, without the\nneed of a coarse image at the base date. The performance of OBSUM was compared\nwith five representative spatiotemporal fusion methods. The experimental\nresults demonstrated that OBSUM outperformed other methods in terms of both\naccuracy indices and visual effects over time-series. Furthermore, OBSUM also\nachieved satisfactory results in two typical remote sensing applications.\nTherefore, it has great potential to generate accurate and high-resolution\ntime-series observations for supporting various remote sensing applications.",

In contrast, \\emph{edge-wise}\nmethods rely on the formation of edge-specific subgraph embeddings to enrich\nthe representation of pair-wise relationships, disambiguating isomorphic nodes\nto improve accuracy, but with the cost of increased model complexity.

FTD is seen across such developmental or psychiatric\ndisorders as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Schizophrenia, and its related\nSchizotypal Personality Disorder (SPD). This paper collected a Japanese\naudio-report dataset with score labels related to ASD and SPD through a\ncrowd-sourcing service from the general population. We measured language\ncharacteristics with the 2nd edition of the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS2)\nand the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), including an odd speech\nsubscale from SPQ to quantify the FTD symptoms. We investigated the following\nfour research questions through machine-learning-based score predictions: (RQ1)\nHow are schizotypal and autistic measures correlated? (RQ2) What is the most\nsuitable task to elicit FTD symptoms? (RQ3) Does the length of speech affect\nthe elicitation of FTD symptoms? (RQ4) Which features are critical for\ncapturing FTD symptoms? We confirmed that an FTD-related subscale, odd speech,\nwas significantly correlated with both the total SPQ and SRS scores, although\nthey themselves were not correlated significantly. Our regression analysis\nindicated that longer speech about a negative memory elicited more FTD\nsymptoms. The ablation study confirmed the importance of function words and\nboth the abstract and temporal features for FTD-related odd speech estimation.\nIn contrast, content words were effective only in the SRS predictions, and\ncontent words were effective only in the SPQ predictions, a result that implies\nthe differences between SPD-like and ASD-like symptoms.

Recently, there has been a growing trend toward the use of machine\nlearning solutions to detect hardware Trojans more effectively, with a focus on\nthe accuracy of the model as an evaluation metric. However, in a high-risk and\nsensitive domain, we cannot accept even a small misclassification.\nAdditionally, it is unrealistic to expect an ideal model, especially when\nTrojans evolve over time. Therefore, we need metrics to assess the\ntrustworthiness of detected Trojans and a mechanism to simulate unseen ones. In\nthis paper, we generate evolving hardware Trojans using our proposed novel\nconformalized generative adversarial networks and offer an efficient approach\nto detecting them based on a non-invasive algorithm-agnostic statistical\ninference framework that leverages the Mondrian conformal predictor. The method\nacts like a wrapper over any of the machine learning models and produces set\npredictions along with uncertainty quantification for each new detected Trojan\nfor more robust decision-making. In the case of a NULL set, a novel method to\nreject the decision by providing a calibrated explainability is discussed.

Their\ntypical approaches include memory extension with flash memory and direct\nstorage access. However, these techniques still suffer from suboptimal\nperformance and introduce complexity to the GPU memory management, making them\nhard to meet the scalability requirement of deep learning workloads today. In\nthis paper, we present a unified GPU memory and storage architecture named G10\ndriven by the fact that the tensor behaviors of deep learning workloads are\nhighly predictable. G10 integrates the host memory, GPU memory, and flash\nmemory into a unified memory space, to scale the GPU memory capacity while\nenabling transparent data migrations. Based on this unified GPU memory and\nstorage architecture, G10 utilizes compiler techniques to characterize the\ntensor behaviors in deep learning workloads. Therefore, it can schedule data\nmigrations in advance by considering the available bandwidth of flash memory\nand host memory. The cooperative mechanism between deep learning compilers and\nthe unified memory architecture enables G10 to hide data transfer overheads in\na transparent manner. We implement G10 based on an open-source GPU simulator.\nOur experiments demonstrate that G10 outperforms state-of-the-art GPU memory\nsolutions by up to 1.75$\\times$, without code modifications to deep learning\nworkloads.

            "summary": "In the context of legged robots, adaptive behavior involves adaptive\nbalancing and adaptive swing foot reflection. While adaptive balancing\ncounteracts perturbations to the robot, adaptive swing foot reflection helps\nthe robot to navigate intricate terrains without foot entrapment. In this\npaper, we manage to bring both aspects of adaptive behavior to quadruped\nlocomotion by combining RL and MPC while improving the robustness and agility\nof blind legged locomotion. This integration leverages MPC's strength in\npredictive capabilities and RL's adeptness in drawing from past experiences.\nUnlike traditional locomotion controls that separate stance foot control and\nswing foot trajectory, our innovative approach unifies them, addressing their\nlack of synchronization. At the heart of our contribution is the synthesis of\nstance foot control with swing foot reflection, improving agility and\nrobustness in locomotion with adaptive behavior. A hallmark of our approach is\nrobust blind stair climbing through swing foot reflection. Moreover, we\nintentionally designed the learning module as a general plugin for different\nrobot platforms. We trained the policy and implemented our approach on the\nUnitree A1 robot, achieving impressive results: a peak turn rate of 8.5 rad/s,\na peak running speed of 3 m/s, and steering at a speed of 2.5 m/s. Remarkably,\nthis framework also allows the robot to maintain stable locomotion while\nbearing an unexpected load of 10 kg, or 83\\% of its body mass. We further\ndemonstrate the generalizability and robustness of the same policy where it\nrealizes zero-shot transfer to different robot platforms like Go1 and AlienGo\nrobots for load carrying.

The experiments in this study examine numeric targets that have\nbeen binarized by comparing against a threshold.

Specifically, we\nmake this comparison at every point of a randomized hyperparameter optimization\nsearch to understand the effect of computational resource budget on the\ntradeoff between the two. We find that regression requires significantly more\ncomputational effort to converge upon the optimal performance, and is more\nsensitive to both randomness and heuristic choices in the training process.\nAlthough classification can and does benefit from systematic hyperparameter\ntuning and model selection, the improvements are much less than for regression.\nThis work comprises the first systematic comparison of regression and\nclassification within the framework of computational resource requirements.

To address these challenges, the concept of the\nautonomous supply chain (ASC), characterised by predictive and\nself-decision-making capabilities, has recently emerged as promising solution.\nHowever, research on ASCs is relatively limited, with no existing studies on\ntheir implementations. This paper aims to address this gap by presenting an\nimplementation of ASC using a multi-agent approach. It proposes a methodology\nfor the analysis and design of such an agent-based ASC system (A2SC). This\npaper provides a concrete case study, the autonomous meat supply chain, which\nshowcases the practical implementation of the A2SC system using the proposed\nmethodology. Additionally, a system architecture and a toolkit for developing\nA2SC systems are presented. Despite with limitations, this paper demonstrates a\npromising approach for implementing an effective ASC system.",

            "summary": "Transition metal dichalcogenides are investigated for various applications at\nthe nanoscale thanks to their unique combination of properties and\ndimensionality. For many of the anticipated applications, heat conduction plays\nan important role. At the same time, these materials often contain relatively\nlarge amounts of point defects. Here, we provide a systematic analysis of the\nimpact of intrinsic and selected extrinsic defects on the lattice thermal\nconductivity of MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ monolayers. We combine Boltzmann transport\ntheory and the Green's function-based T-matrix approach for the calculation of\nscattering rates. The force constants for the defect configurations are\nobtained from density functional theory calculations via a regression approach,\nwhich allows us to sample a rather large number of defects at a moderate\ncomputational cost and to systematically enforce both the translational and\nrotational acoustic sum rules. The calculated lattice thermal conductivity is\nin quantitative agreement with experimental data for heat transport and defect\nconcentrations for both MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$. Crucially, this demonstrates that\nthe strong deviation from a 1/T-temperature dependence of the lattice thermal\nconductivity observed experimentally, can be fully explained by the presence of\npoint defects. We furthermore predict the scattering strengths of the intrinsic\ndefects to decrease in the sequence $V_{Mo}\\approx\nV_{2S}^=>V_{2S}^\\perp>V_S>S_{ad}$ in both materials, while the scattering rates\nfor the extrinsic (adatom) defects decrease with increasing mass such that\nLi$_{ad}$>Na$_{ad}$>K$_{ad}$. Compared to earlier work, we find that both\nintrinsic and extrinsic adatoms are relatively weak scatterers. We attribute\nthis difference to the treatment of the translational and rotational acoustic\nsum rules, which if not enforced can lead to spurious contributions in the\nzero-frequency limit.",

Updraft proxies, like overshooting top area from\nsatellite images, have been linked to severe weather hazards but only relate to\na limited portion of the total storm updraft. This study investigates if a\nmachine learning model, namely U-Nets, can skillfully retrieve maximum vertical\nvelocity and its areal extent from 3-dimensional (3D) gridded radar\nreflectivity alone. The machine learning model is trained using simulated radar\nreflectivity and vertical velocity from the National Severe Storm Laboratory's\nconvection permitting Warn on Forecast System (WoFS). A parametric regression\ntechnique using the Sinh-arcsinh-normal (SHASH) distribution is adapted to run\nwith UNets, allowing for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions of\nmaximum vertical velocity. The best models after hyperparameter search provided\nless than 50% root mean squared error, a coefficient of determination greater\nthan 0.65 and an intersection over union (IoU) of more than 0.45 on the\nindependent test set composed of WoFS data. Beyond the WoFS analysis, a case\nstudy was conducted using real radar data and corresponding dual-Doppler\nanalyses of vertical velocity within a supercell. The U-Net consistently\nunderestimates the dual-Doppler updraft speed estimates by 50%. Meanwhile, the\narea of the 5 and 10 m s-1 updraft cores show an IoU of 0.25. While the above\nstatistics are not exceptional, the machine learning model enables quick\ndistillation of 3D radar data that is related to the maximum vertical velocity\nwhich could be useful in assessing a storm's severe potential.",

Thus, we suggest that the eLSM with its parameters is a suitable\ntheoretical approach to determine the mass spectra of the various non-charmed\nand charmed meson states, especially at vanishing temperature.",

            "summary": "Decoder-only Transformer models such as GPT have demonstrated superior\nperformance in text generation, by autoregressively predicting the next token.\nHowever, the performance of GPT is bounded by low compute-to-memory-ratio and\nhigh memory access. Throughput-oriented architectures such as GPUs target\nparallel processing rather than sequential token generation, and are not\nefficient for GPT acceleration, particularly on-device inference applications.\nProcess-in-memory (PIM) architectures can significantly reduce data movement\nand provide high computation parallelism, and are promising candidates to\naccelerate GPT inference.\n  In this work, we propose PIM-GPT that aims to achieve high throughput, high\nenergy efficiency and end-to-end acceleration of GPT inference. PIM-GPT\nleverages DRAM-based PIM solutions to perform multiply-accumulate (MAC)\noperations on the DRAM chips, greatly reducing data movement. A compact\napplication-specific integrated chip (ASIC) is designed and synthesized to\ninitiate instructions to PIM chips and support data communication along with\nnecessary arithmetic computations. At the software level, the mapping scheme is\ndesigned to maximize data locality and computation parallelism by partitioning\na matrix among DRAM channels and banks to utilize all in-bank computation\nresources concurrently. We develop an event-driven clock-cycle accurate\nsimulator to validate the efficacy of the proposed PIM-GPT architecture.\nOverall, PIM-GPT achieves 41$-$137$\\times$, 631$-$1074$\\times$ speedup and\n339$-$1085$\\times$, 890$-$1632$\\times$ energy efficiency over GPU and CPU\nbaseline, respectively, on 8 GPT models with up to 1.4 billion parameters.",

Current automated design tools\ndriven by neural networks produce appealing designs, but cannot satisfy user\nspecifications and utility requirements. Symbolic reasoning tools, such as\nconstraint programming, cannot perceive low-level visual information in images\nor capture subtle aspects such as aesthetics. We introduce the Spatial\nReasoning Integrated Generator (SPRING) for design generation. SPRING embeds a\nneural and symbolic integrated spatial reasoning module inside the deep\ngenerative network. The spatial reasoning module decides the locations of\nobjects to be generated in the form of bounding boxes, which are predicted by a\nrecurrent neural network and filtered by symbolic constraint satisfaction.\nEmbedding symbolic reasoning into neural generation guarantees that the output\nof SPRING satisfies user requirements. Furthermore, SPRING offers\ninterpretability, allowing users to visualize and diagnose the generation\nprocess through the bounding boxes. SPRING is also adept at managing novel user\nspecifications not encountered during its training, thanks to its proficiency\nin zero-shot constraint transfer. Quantitative evaluations and a human study\nreveal that SPRING outperforms baseline generative models, excelling in\ndelivering high design quality and better meeting user specifications.",

These two scenarios make different predictions about\nobservable structure in local phase space, because the morphology of debris\ndepends on how long it has had to phase mix. The recently-identified\nphase-space folds in Gaia DR3 have positive caustic velocities, making them\nfundamentally different than the phase-mixed chevrons found in simulations at\nlate times. Roughly 20% of the stars in the prograde local stellar halo are\nassociated with the observed caustics. We compare the observed phase-space\ndistribution to a time-series of FIRE-2 Latte simulations of a GSE-like merger,\nusing a quantitative metric (2D causticality) that measures how phase-mixed a\ngiven distribution is. We find that the observed local phase-space distribution\nbest matches the simulated data within 1 Gyr after the merger collides with the\nhost galaxy disk, and certainly not later than 3 Gyr after collision. This is\nfurther evidence that the progenitor of the \"last major merger\" did not collide\nwith the MW proto-disk at early times, as is thought for the GSE, but instead\ncollided with the MW disk within the last few Gyr, consistent with the body of\nwork surrounding the VRM.",

It was shown to\nbe much wider and much more collimated than 2D simulations of electromagnetic\n(Blandford-Znajek) jets from the event horizon predicted. This was an\nunanticipated discovery. The claimed detection of a jet connected to the\naccretion flow provides a direct observational constraint on the geometry and\nphysics of the jet launching region for the first time in any black hole jetted\nsystem. This landmark detection warrants further analysis. This Letter focuses\non the most rudimentary properties, the shape and size of the source of the\ndetected jet emission, the determination of which is not trivial due to\nline-of-sight effects. Simple thick-walled cylindrical shell models for the\nsource were analyzed to constrain the thickness of the jet wall. The analysis\nindicates a tubular jet source with a radius $R\\approx 144 \\mu\\rm{as}\\approx\n38M$ and that the tubular jet walls have a width $W \\approx 36\\mu\\rm{as}\n\\approx 9.5 M$, where $M$ is the geometrized mass of the black hole (a volume\ncomparable to that of the interior cavity). The observed cylindrical jet\nconnects continuously to the highly limb-brightened jet (previously described\nas a thick-walled tubular jet) that extends to $z> 0.65$ mas, and the two are\nlikely in fact the same outflow (i.e., from the same central engine).",

            "summary": "Gas cooling and heating functions play a crucial role in galaxy formation.\nBut, it is computationally expensive to exactly compute these functions in the\npresence of an incident radiation field. These computations can be greatly sped\nup by using interpolation tables of pre-computed values, at the expense of\nmaking significant and sometimes even unjustified approximations. Here we\nexplore the capacity of machine learning to approximate cooling and heating\nfunctions with a generalized radiation field. Specifically, we use the machine\nlearning algorithm XGBoost to predict cooling and heating functions calculated\nwith the photoionization code Cloudy at fixed metallicity, using different\ncombinations of photoionization rates as features. We perform a constrained\nquadratic fit in metallicity to enable a fair comparison with traditional\ninterpolation methods at arbitrary metallicity. We consider the relative\nimportance of various photoionization rates through both a principal component\nanalysis (PCA) and calculation of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values\nfor our XGBoost models. We use feature importance information to select\ndifferent subsets of rates to use in model training. Our XGBoost models\noutperform a traditional interpolation approach at each fixed metallicity,\nregardless of feature selection. At arbitrary metallicity, we are able to\nreduce the frequency of the largest cooling and heating function errors\ncompared to an interpolation table. We find that the primary bottleneck to\nincreasing accuracy lies in accurately capturing the metallicity dependence.\nThis study demonstrates the potential of machine learning methods such as\nXGBoost to capture the non-linear behavior of cooling and heating functions.",

Recent years have witnessed a\nsurge of techniques that draw inspiration from optimal transport (OT) theory.\nCombined with neural network models, these methods collectively known as\n\\textit{Neural OT} use optimal transport as an inductive bias: such mappings\nshould be optimal w.r.t. a given cost function, in the sense that they are able\nto move points in a thrifty way, within (by minimizing displacements) or across\nspaces (by being isometric). This principle, while intuitive, is often\nconfronted with several practical challenges that require adapting the OT\ntoolbox: cost functions other than the squared-Euclidean cost can be\nchallenging to handle, the deterministic formulation of Monge maps leaves\nlittle flexibility, mapping across incomparable spaces raises multiple\nchallenges, while the mass conservation constraint inherent to OT can provide\ntoo much credit to outliers. While each of these mismatches between practice\nand theory has been addressed independently in various works, we propose in\nthis work an elegant framework to unify them, called \\textit{generative\nentropic neural optimal transport} (GENOT). GENOT can accommodate any cost\nfunction; handles randomness using conditional generative models; can map\npoints across incomparable spaces, and can be used as an \\textit{unbalanced}\nsolver. We evaluate our approach through experiments conducted on various\nsynthetic datasets and demonstrate its practicality in single-cell biology.

Precedents are the previous legal cases with similar facts, which\nare the basis for the judgment of the subsequent case in national legal\nsystems. Thus, it is worthwhile to explore the utilization of precedents in the\nLJP. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled a variety of techniques to\nbe used to solve the LJP task. These can be broken down into two categories:\nlarge language models (LLMs) and domain-specific models. LLMs are capable of\ninterpreting and generating complex natural language, while domain models are\nefficient in learning task-specific information. In this paper, we propose the\nprecedent-enhanced LJP framework (PLJP), a system that leverages the strength\nof both LLM and domain models in the context of precedents. Specifically, the\ndomain models are designed to provide candidate labels and find the proper\nprecedents efficiently, and the large models will make the final prediction\nwith an in-context precedents comprehension.

Traditional CTR models convert the multi-field\ncategorical data into ID features via one-hot encoding, and extract the\ncollaborative signals among features. Such a paradigm suffers from the problem\nof semantic information loss. Another line of research explores the potential\nof pretrained language models (PLMs) for CTR prediction by converting input\ndata into textual sentences through hard prompt templates. Although semantic\nsignals are preserved, they generally fail to capture the collaborative\ninformation (e.g., feature interactions, pure ID features), not to mention the\nunacceptable inference overhead brought by the huge model size. In this paper,\nwe aim to model both the semantic knowledge and collaborative knowledge for\naccurate CTR estimation, and meanwhile address the inference inefficiency\nissue. To benefit from both worlds and close their gaps, we propose a novel\nmodel-agnostic framework (i.e., ClickPrompt), where we incorporate CTR models\nto generate interaction-aware soft prompts for PLMs. We design a\nprompt-augmented masked language modeling (PA-MLM) pretraining task, where PLM\nhas to recover the masked tokens based on the language context, as well as the\nsoft prompts generated by CTR model. The collaborative and semantic knowledge\nfrom ID and textual features would be explicitly aligned and interacted via the\nprompt interface. Then, we can either tune the CTR model with PLM for superior\nperformance, or solely tune the CTR model without PLM for inference efficiency.\nExperiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of\nClickPrompt compared with existing baselines.",

            "summary": "We present an analytical model for cosmological Lyman-limit systems (LLSs)\nthat successfully reproduces the observed evolution of the mean free path (L)\nof ionizing photons. The evolution of the co-moving mean free path is\npredominantly a consequence of the changing meta galactic photo-ionization rate\nand the increase with cosmic time of the minimum mass below which halos lose\ntheir gas due to photo-heating. In the model, Lyman-limit absorption is caused\nby highly ionized gas in the outskirt of dark matter halos. We exploit the\nassociation with halos to compute statistical properties of LLSs and of their\nbias, b. The latter increases from 1.5 to 2.6 from redshifts 2 to 6. Combined\nwith the rapid increase with redshift of the bias of the halos that host a\nquasar, the model predicts a rapid drop in the value of L when measured in\nquasar spectra from z=5 to 6, whereas the actual value of L falls more\nsmoothly. We derive an expression for the effective optical depth due to Lyman\nlimit absorption as a function of wavelength and show that it depends\nsensitively on the poorly constrained number density of LLSs as a function of\ncolumn density. The optical depth drops below unity for all wavelengths below a\nredshift of 2.5, which is therefore the epoch when the Universe first became\ntransparent to ionizing photons.",

            "summary": "Lorentz symmetry (LS), one of the most fundamental physical symmetries, has\nbeen extensively studied in the context of quantum gravity and unification\ntheories. Many of these theories predict a LS violation, which could arise from\nthe discreteness of spacetime, or extra dimensions. Standard-model extension\n(SME) is an effective field theory to describe Lorentz violation whose effects\ncan be explored using precision instruments such as atomic clocks and\ngravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Considering the pure-gravity sector and\nmatter-gravity coupling sector in the SME, we studied the leading\nLorentz-violating modifications to the time delay of light and the relativistic\nfrequency shift of the clock in the space-based GW detectors. We found that the\nsix data streams from the GW mission can construct various combinations of\nmeasurement signals, such as single-arm round-trip path, interference path,\ntriangular round-trip path, etc. These measurements are sensitive to the\ndifferent combinations of SME coefficients and provide novel linear\ncombinations of SME coefficients different from previous studies. Based on the\norbits of TianQin, LISA, and Taiji missions, we calculated the response of\nLorentz-violating effects on the combinations of the measurement signal data\nstreams. Our results allow us to estimate the sensitivities for SME\ncoefficients: $10^{-6}$ for the gravity sector coefficient $\\bar{s}^{TT}$,\n$10^{-6}$ for matter-gravity coupling coefficients\n$(\\bar{a}^{(e+p)}_{\\text{eff}})_{T}$ and $\\bar{c}^{(e+p)}_{TT}$, and $10^{-5}$\nfor $(\\bar{a}^{n}_{\\text{eff}})_{T}$ and $\\bar{c}^{n}_{TT}$.",

The\nusual method to deal with such problems was the Menelaus Theorem, explicitly\ndiscussed and extensively used by Ptolemy. It is generally assumed that\nHipparchus, who in his Exegesis explicitly states that he developed a method to\ncalculate Simultaneous Risings and Settings, used either the Menelaus' Theorem,\nor stereographic projections, even if both methods are only attested for later\nperiods and their availability to Hipparchus is debated. In this paper we argue\nthat simultaneous risings and settings could be calculated using less advanced\nmathematical tools unquestionably available to Hipparchus: the theorem of\nPythagoras, the theory of proportions, and the table of chords. Without\nclaiming that this was indeed the method that Hipparchus used, we argue that\nthere is no need to postulate the availability of more sophisticated tools to\ncarry out the calculations which Hipparchus mentions in the Exegesis.",

            "summary": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia. It is\nassociated with an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and other\ncardiovascular complications, but can be clinically silent. Passive AF\nmonitoring with wearables may help reduce adverse clinical outcomes related to\nAF. Detecting AF in noisy wearable data poses a significant challenge, leading\nto the emergence of various deep learning techniques. Previous deep learning\nmodels learn from a single modality, either electrocardiogram (ECG) or\nphotoplethysmography (PPG) signals. However, deep learning models often\nstruggle to learn generalizable features and rely on features that are more\nsusceptible to corruption from noise, leading to sub-optimal performances in\ncertain scenarios, especially with low-quality signals. Given the increasing\navailability of ECG and PPG signal pairs from wearables and bedside monitors,\nwe propose a new approach, SiamAF, leveraging a novel Siamese network\narchitecture and joint learning loss function to learn shared information from\nboth ECG and PPG signals. At inference time, the proposed model is able to\npredict AF from either PPG or ECG and outperforms baseline methods on three\nexternal test sets. It learns medically relevant features as a result of our\nnovel architecture design. The proposed model also achieves comparable\nperformance to traditional learning regimes while requiring much fewer training\nlabels, providing a potential approach to reduce future reliance on manual\nlabeling.",

Existing graph condensation methods primarily focus on optimizing the\nfeature matrices of condensed graphs while overlooking the impact of the\nstructure information from the original graphs. To investigate the impact of\nthe structure information, we conduct analysis from the spectral domain and\nempirically identify substantial Laplacian Energy Distribution (LED) shifts in\nprevious works. Such shifts lead to poor performance in cross-architecture\ngeneralization and specific tasks, including anomaly detection and link\nprediction. In this paper, we propose a novel Structure-broadcasting Graph\nDataset Distillation (SGDD) scheme for broadcasting the original structure\ninformation to the generation of the synthetic one, which explicitly prevents\noverlooking the original structure information. Theoretically, the synthetic\ngraphs by SGDD are expected to have smaller LED shifts than previous works,\nleading to superior performance in both cross-architecture settings and\nspecific tasks. We validate the proposed SGDD across 9 datasets and achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on all of them: for example, on the YelpChi dataset,\nour approach maintains 98.6% test accuracy of training on the original graph\ndataset with 1,000 times saving on the scale of the graph. Moreover, we\nempirically evaluate there exist 17.6% ~ 31.4% reductions in LED shift crossing\n9 datasets. Extensive experiments and analysis verify the effectiveness and\nnecessity of the proposed designs. The code is available in the GitHub\nrepository: https://github.com/RingBDStack/SGDD.",

This study aimed to\nexamine how muscle-tendon model calibration and metabolic energy models\ninfluenced estimation of muscle-tendon states and time-series metabolic rates,\nto evaluate the agreement with empirical data, and to provide predictions of\nthe metabolic rate of muscle groups and gait phases across walking speeds.\nThree-dimensional musculoskeletal simulations with prescribed kinematics and\ndynamics were performed. An optimal control formulation was used to compute\nmuscle-tendon states with four levels of individualization, ranging from a\nscaled generic model and muscle controls based on minimal activations, to\ncalibration of passive muscle forces, personalization of Achilles and\nquadriceps tendon stiffnesses, to finally informing muscle controls with\nelectromyography. We computed metabolic rates based on existing models.\nSimulations with calibrated passive forces and personalized tendon stiffness\nmost accurately estimate muscle excitations and fiber lengths. Interestingly,\nthe inclusion of electromyography did not improve our estimates. The whole-body\naverage metabolic cost was better estimated using Bhargava et al. 2004 and\nUmberger 2010 models. We estimated metabolic rate peaks near early stance,\npre-swing, and initial swing at all walking speeds. Plantarflexors accounted\nfor the highest cost among muscle groups at the preferred speed and was similar\nto the cost of hip adductors and abductors combined. Also, the swing phase\naccounted for slightly more than one-quarter of the total cost in a gait cycle,\nand its relative cost decreased with walking speed.",

Even though these\nmodels offer impressive performance, their practical application is often\nlimited by the prohibitive amount of resources required for every inference.\nEarly-exiting dynamic neural networks (EDNN) circumvent this issue by allowing\na model to make some of its predictions from intermediate layers (i.e.,\nearly-exit). Training an EDNN architecture is challenging as it consists of two\nintertwined components: the gating mechanism (GM) that controls early-exiting\ndecisions and the intermediate inference modules (IMs) that perform inference\nfrom intermediate representations. As a result, most existing approaches rely\non thresholding confidence metrics for the gating mechanism and strive to\nimprove the underlying backbone network and the inference modules. Although\nsuccessful, this approach has two fundamental shortcomings: 1) the GMs and the\nIMs are decoupled during training, leading to a train-test mismatch; and 2) the\nthresholding gating mechanism introduces a positive bias into the predictive\nprobabilities, making it difficult to readily extract uncertainty information.\nWe propose a novel architecture that connects these two modules.

To be specific, a large\nnumber of detected objects and optical character recognition (OCR) tokens\nresult in rich visual relationships. Existing works take all visual\nrelationships into account for answer prediction. However, there are three\nobservations: (1) a single subject in the images can be easily detected as\nmultiple objects with distinct bounding boxes (considered repetitive objects).\nThe associations between these repetitive objects are superfluous for answer\nreasoning; (2) two spatially distant OCR tokens detected in the image\nfrequently have weak semantic dependencies for answer reasoning; and (3) the\nco-existence of nearby objects and tokens may be indicative of important visual\ncues for predicting answers. Rather than utilizing all of them for answer\nprediction, we make an effort to identify the most important connections or\neliminate redundant ones. We propose a sparse spatial graph network (SSGN) that\nintroduces a spatially aware relation pruning technique to this task. As\nspatial factors for relation measurement, we employ spatial distance, geometric\ndimension, overlap area, and DIoU for spatially aware pruning. We consider\nthree visual relationships for graph learning: object-object, OCR-OCR tokens,\nand object-OCR token relationships. SSGN is a progressive graph learning\narchitecture that verifies the pivotal relations in the correlated object-token\nsparse graph, and then in the respective object-based sparse graph and\ntoken-based sparse graph. Experiment results on TextVQA and ST-VQA datasets\ndemonstrate that SSGN achieves promising performances. And some visualization\nresults further demonstrate the interpretability of our method.",

As a result, it is often appropriate to think of the\nreward function as a proxy for the true objective rather than as its\ndefinition. We study this phenomenon through the lens of Goodhart's law, which\npredicts that increasing optimisation of an imperfect proxy beyond some\ncritical point decreases performance on the true objective. First, we propose a\nway to quantify the magnitude of this effect and show empirically that\noptimising an imperfect proxy reward often leads to the behaviour predicted by\nGoodhart's law for a wide range of environments and reward functions. We then\nprovide a geometric explanation for why Goodhart's law occurs in Markov\ndecision processes. We use these theoretical insights to propose an optimal\nearly stopping method that provably avoids the aforementioned pitfall and\nderive theoretical regret bounds for this method. Moreover, we derive a\ntraining method that maximises worst-case reward, for the setting where there\nis uncertainty about the true reward function. Finally, we evaluate our early\nstopping method experimentally. Our results support a foundation for a\ntheoretically-principled study of reinforcement learning under reward\nmisspecification.",

            "summary": "Biocompatible and functionalizable hydrogels have a wide range of (potential)\nmedicinal applications. In contrast to conventional hydrogels formed by\ninterconnected or interlocked polymer chains, self-assembled hydrogels form\nfrom small building blocks like short peptide chains. This has the advantage\nthat the building blocks can be functionalized separately and then mixed to\nobtain the desired properties. However, the hydrogelation process for these\nsystems, especially those with very low polymer weight percentage (< 1 wt%), is\nnot well understood, and therefore it is hard to predict whether a given\nmolecular building block will self-assemble into a hydrogel. This severely\nhinders the rational design of self-assembled hydrogels. In this study, we\ndemonstrate the impact of an N-terminal chromophore label amino-benzoic acid on\nthe self-assembly and rheology of hydrogel hFF03 (hydrogelating, fibril\nforming) using molecular dynamics simulations, which self-assembles into\n{\\alpha}-helical coiled-coils. We find that the chromophore and even its\nspecific regioisomers have a significant influence on the microscopic structure\nand dynamics of the self-assembled fibril, and on the macroscopic mechanical\nproperties. This is because the chromophore influences the possible\nsalt-bridges which form and stabilize the fibril formation. Furthermore we find\nthat the solvation shell fibrils by itself cannot explain the viscoelasticity\nof hFF03 hydrogels. Our atomistic model of the hFF03 fibril formation enables a\nmore rational design of these hydrogels. In particular, altering the N-terminal\nchromophore emergesas a design strategy to tune the mechanic properties of\nthese self-assembled peptide hydrogels.",

These procedures sometimes yield very different\npredictions. How do we reconcile mutually incompatible scoring procedures to\nobtain coherent LM predictions? We introduce a new, a training-free,\ngame-theoretic procedure for language model decoding. Our approach casts\nlanguage model decoding as a regularized imperfect-information sequential\nsignaling game - which we term the CONSENSUS GAME - in which a GENERATOR seeks\nto communicate an abstract correctness parameter using natural language\nsentences to a DISCRIMINATOR. We develop computational procedures for finding\napproximate equilibria of this game, resulting in a decoding algorithm we call\nEQUILIBRIUM-RANKING. Applied to a large number of tasks (including reading\ncomprehension, commonsense reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and\ndialog), EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING consistently, and sometimes substantially,\nimproves performance over existing LM decoding procedures - on multiple\nbenchmarks, we observe that applying EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING to LLaMA-7B\noutperforms the much larger LLaMA-65B and PaLM-540B models. These results\nhighlight the promise of game-theoretic tools for addressing fundamental\nchallenges of truthfulness and consistency in LMs.",

Most recently, use cases for them in real-time\napplications have emerged, such as content-adaptive shading and shading reuse\nto increase performance and improve efficiency. A wide range of different\nmetrics has been established, with the most sophisticated being capable of\ncapturing the perceptual characteristics of the human visual system. However,\ntheir complexity, computational expense, and reliance on reference images to\ncompare against prevent their generalized use in real-time, restricting such\napplications to using only the simplest available metrics. In this work, we\nexplore the abilities of convolutional neural networks to predict a variety of\nvisual metrics without requiring either reference or rendered images.\nSpecifically, we train and deploy a neural network to estimate the visual error\nresulting from reusing shading or using reduced shading rates. The resulting\nmodels account for 70%-90% of the variance while achieving up to an order of\nmagnitude faster computation times. Our solution combines image-space\ninformation that is readily available in most state-of-the-art deferred shading\npipelines with reprojection from previous frames to enable an adequate estimate\nof visual errors, even in previously unseen regions. We describe a suitable\nconvolutional network architecture and considerations for data preparation for\ntraining. We demonstrate the capability of our network to predict complex error\nmetrics at interactive rates in a real-time application that implements\ncontent-adaptive shading in a deferred pipeline.

Such systems exhibit an electron-vibron\ninteraction, which can be comprised of linear and quadratic terms in the\nvibrational displacement. By employing a combination of conditional\ndisplacement and squeezing operators, we present analytical expressions based\non a quantum Langevin equations approach, to describe the emission and\nabsorption spectra of such nonlinear molecular systems.

            "summary": "The well-known Solow growth model is the workhorse model of the theory of\neconomic growth, which studies capital accumulation in a model economy as a\nfunction of time with capital stock, labour and technology efiiciency as the\nbasic ingredients. The capital is assumed to be in the form of manufacturing\nequipments and materials. Two important parameters of the model are: the saving\nfraction $s$ of the output of a production function and the technology\nefficiency parameter $A$, appearing in the production function. The saved\nfraction of the output is fully invested in the generation of new capital and\nthe rest is consumed. The capital stock also depreciates as a function of time\ndue to the wearing out of old capital and the increase in the size of the\nlabour population. We propose a stochastic Solow growth model assuming the\nsaving fraction to be a sigmoidal function of the per capita capital $k_p$. We\nderive analytically the steady state probability distribution $P(k_p)$ and\ndemonstrate the existence of a poverty trap, of central concern in development\neconomics. In a parameter regime, $P(k_p)$ is bimodal with the twin peaks\ncorresponding to states of poverty and well-being respectively. The associated\npotential landscape has two valleys with fluctuation-driven transitions between\nthem. The mean exit times from the valleys are computed and one finds that the\nescape from a poverty trap is more favourable at higher values of $A$. We\nidentify a critical value of $A_c$ below (above) which the state of poverty\n(well-being) dominates and propose two early signatures of the regime shift\noccurring at $A_c$. The economic model, with conceptual foundation in nonlinear\ndynamics and statistical mechanics, share universal features with dynamical\nmodels from diverse disciplines like ecology and cell biology.",

This study is the\nfirst to use sub-arcsecond angular resolution data of local obscured AGN to\ninvestigate the nuclear mid-IR absorption bands with a wide wavelength coverage\n(4.9-28.1 $\\mu$m). All the nuclei show the 9.7 $\\mu$m silicate band in\nabsorption. We compare the strength of the 9.7 and 18 $\\mu$m silicate features\nwith torus model predictions. The observed silicate features are generally well\nexplained by clumpy and smooth torus models. We report the detection of the 6\n$\\mu$m dirty water ice band (i.e., a mix of water and other molecules such as\nCO and CO$_2$) at sub-arcsecond scales ($\\sim$0.26 arcsec at 6 $\\mu$m; inner\n$\\sim$50 pc) in a sample of local AGN with different levels of nuclear\nobscuration in the range log N$_{\\rm H}^{\\rm X-Ray}$(cm$^{-2}$)$\\sim22-25$. We\nfind a good correlation between the 6 $\\mu$m water ice optical depths and\nN$_{\\rm H}^{\\rm X-Ray}$. This result indicates that the water ice absorption\nmight be a reliable tracer of the nuclear intrinsic obscuration in AGN. The\nweak water ice absorption in less obscured AGN (log N$_H^{X-ray}$\n(cm$^{-2}$)$\\lesssim$23.0 cm$^{-2}$) might be related to the hotter dust\ntemperature ($>$T$_{sub}^{H_2O}\\sim$110 K) expected to be reached in the outer\nlayers of the torus due to their more inhomogeneous medium.

Three different experimental designs (single image rating,\nforced choice comparison, and semi-structured interviews) provide similar but\ndifferent results.

A notable contribution of our study\nis the introduction of a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing\nmedical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues,\nsegmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our\npipeline, Qilin-Med, exhibits significant performance boosts.

We leverage tools from excursion-set theory to\nstudy distributional properties of the extremal range, propose parametric\nmodels and predict the median extremal range at extreme threshold levels. The\nextremal range captures the rate at which the spatial extent of conditional\nextreme events scales for increasingly high thresholds, and we relate its\ndistributional properties with the bivariate tail dependence coefficient and\nthe extremal index of time series in classical Extreme-Value Theory. Consistent\nestimation of the distribution function of the extremal range for stationary\nrandom fields is proven. For non-stationary random fields, we implement\ngeneralized additive median regression to predict extremal-range maps at very\nhigh threshold levels. An application to two large daily temperature datasets,\nnamely reanalyses and climate-model simulations for France, highlights\ndecreasing extremal dependence for increasing threshold levels and reveals\nstrong differences in joint tail decay rates between reanalyses and\nsimulations.",

            "summary": "We present a proof of concept for mining JWST imaging data for anomalous\ngalaxy populations using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN).\nWe train our model to predict long wavelength NIRcam fluxes (LW: F277W, F356W,\nF444W between 2.4 to 5.0\\mu m) from short wavelength fluxes (SW: F115W, F150W,\nF200W between 0.6 to 2.3\\mu m) in approximately 2000 galaxies. We test the cGAN\non a population of 37 Extremely Red Objects (EROs) discovered by the CEERS JWST\nTeam arXiv:2305.14418. Despite their red long wavelength colours, the EROs have\nblue short wavelength colours (F150W \\- F200W equivalently 0 mag) indicative of\nbimodal SEDs. Surprisingly, given their unusual SEDs, we find that the cGAN\naccurately predicts the LW NIRcam fluxes of the EROs. However, it fails to\npredict LW fluxes for other rare astronomical objects, such as a merger between\ntwo galaxies, suggesting that the cGAN can be used to detect some anomalies",

            "summary": "In the realm of future home-assistant robots, 3D articulated object\nmanipulation is essential for enabling robots to interact with their\nenvironment. Many existing studies make use of 3D point clouds as the primary\ninput for manipulation policies. However, this approach encounters challenges\ndue to data sparsity and the significant cost associated with acquiring point\ncloud data, which can limit its practicality. In contrast, RGB images offer\nhigh-resolution observations using cost effective devices but lack spatial 3D\ngeometric information. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel\nimage-based robotic manipulation framework. This framework is designed to\ncapture multiple perspectives of the target object and infer depth information\nto complement its geometry. Initially, the system employs an eye-on-hand RGB\ncamera to capture an overall view of the target object. It predicts the initial\ndepth map and a coarse affordance map. The affordance map indicates actionable\nareas on the object and serves as a constraint for selecting subsequent\nviewpoints. Based on the global visual prior, we adaptively identify the\noptimal next viewpoint for a detailed observation of the potential manipulation\nsuccess area. We leverage geometric consistency to fuse the views, resulting in\na refined depth map and a more precise affordance map for robot manipulation\ndecisions. By comparing with prior works that adopt point clouds or RGB images\nas inputs, we demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our method. In\nthe project webpage (https://sites.google.com/view/imagemanip), real world\nexperiments further highlight the potential of our method for practical\ndeployment.",

DATT builds on a novel feedforward-feedback-adaptive control structure\ntrained in simulation using reinforcement learning. When deployed on real\nhardware, DATT is augmented with a disturbance estimator using L1 adaptive\ncontrol in closed-loop, without any fine-tuning. DATT significantly outperforms\ncompetitive adaptive nonlinear and model predictive controllers for both\nfeasible smooth and infeasible trajectories in unsteady wind fields, including\nchallenging scenarios where baselines completely fail. Moreover, DATT can\nefficiently run online with an inference time less than 3.2 ms, less than 1/4\nof the adaptive nonlinear model predictive control baseline",

            "summary": "We consider the numerical solution of the inertial version of\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (iLLG), which describes high-frequency\nnutation on top of magnetization precession due to angular momentum relaxation.\nThe iLLG equation defines a higher-order nonlinear dynamical system with very\ndifferent nature compared to the classical LLG equation, requiring twice as\nmany degrees of freedom for space-time discretization. It exhibits essential\nconservation properties, namely magnetization amplitude preservation,\nmagnetization projection conservation, and a balance equation for generalized\nfree energy, leading to a Lyapunov structure (i.e. the free energy is a\ndecreasing function of time) when the external magnetic field is constant in\ntime. We propose two second-order numerical schemes for integrating the iLLG\ndynamics over time, both based on implicit midpoint rule. The first scheme\nunconditionally preserves all the conservation properties, making it the\npreferred choice for simulating inertial magnetization dynamics. However, it\nimplies doubling the number of unknowns, necessitating significant changes in\nnumerical micromagnetic codes and increasing computational costs especially for\nspatially inhomogeneous dynamics simulations. To address this issue, we present\na second time-stepping method that retains the same computational cost as the\nimplicit midpoint rule for classical LLG dynamics while unconditionally\npreserving magnetization amplitude and projection. Special quasi-Newton\ntechniques are developed for solving the nonlinear system of equations required\nat each time step due to the implicit nature of both time-steppings. The\nnumerical schemes are validated on analytical solution for macrospin terahertz\nfrequency response and the effectiveness of the second scheme is demonstrated\nwith full micromagnetic simulation of inertial spin waves propagation in a\nmagnetic thin-film.",

This feature dramatically modifies the\ndynamics, by incorporating the effect of eigenvector non-orthogonality via the\nassociated overlap matrix of Chalker-Mehlig type. In particular, the rate of\nentropy production per unit time is strongly enhanced by that matrix. We\nsuggest, that this mechanism has an impact on the studies of collective\nphenomena in neural matrix models, leading, via transient behavior, to such\nphenomena as synchronisation and emergence of the memory. We also expect, that\nthe described mechanism generating the entropy production is generic for wide\nclass of phenomena, where dynamics is driven by non-normal operators.

So far, no analytical proof of color\nconfinement has been found and the mechanism that confines colored states from\nthe space of physical states is still unknown.

One such\nrequirement, which happens to be the non-trivial one, is that a special\ncorrelation function, the Kugo-Ojima correlation function $u(p^2)$, approaches\n$-1$ at the origin ($p^2=0)$. This correlation function can be obtained on the\nlattice within the lattice formulation of gauge theories. The present work\nconsists on lattice results for this correlation function on the Landau gauge.\nWe present results obtained from 4 symmetric large volume lattices $(32^{4},\n48^{4}, 64^{4}, 80^{4})$ with $\\beta = 6.0$ on the Landau gauge. A test on the\ntransversality of the Kugo-Ojima correlation function is also performed, along\nwith some statistical considerations of the results. The results present\nfurther evidence that the Kugo-Ojima confinement scenario is not realized on\nthe lattice and that the Kugo-Ojima correlation function, in the Landau gauge,\nis transverse.

Due to the stochasticity inherent in either the parameter values\nor the state variable, the time evolution of the state variable cannot be\npredicted at a specific time instant. We observe that the state variable\nexhibits completely ergodic behavior when the minimum value of the parameter is\n2.0. However, the ensemble average of the state variable converges to a fixed\nvalue. For parameter values ranging from 2.0 to 3.5, the system demonstrates\nnonchaotic behavior, and the absolute value of the Lyapunov exponent increases\nmonotonically with the asymmetry (ap) of the distribution from which the\nbifurcation parameter values are sampled. We determine the probability density\nfunction of the random map and verify its invariance under any initial\ncondition. The most noteworthy result is the disappearance of chaotic behavior\nwhen the lower range of the distribution is varied while maintaining a fixed\nupper threshold for a particular distribution, even though the nonrandom map\nexhibits an array of periodic and chaotic behaviors within that range.",

            "summary": "Predictive Process Monitoring aims to forecast the future progress of process\ninstances using historical event data. As predictive process monitoring is\nincreasingly applied in online settings to enable timely interventions,\nevaluating the performance of the underlying models becomes crucial for\nensuring their consistency and reliability over time. This is especially\nimportant in high risk business scenarios where incorrect predictions may have\nsevere consequences. However, predictive models are currently usually evaluated\nusing a single, aggregated value or a time-series visualization, which makes it\nchallenging to assess their performance and, specifically, their stability over\ntime. This paper proposes an evaluation framework for assessing the stability\nof models for online predictive process monitoring. The framework introduces\nfour performance meta-measures: the frequency of significant performance drops,\nthe magnitude of such drops, the recovery rate, and the volatility of\nperformance. To validate this framework, we applied it to two artificial and\ntwo real-world event logs. The results demonstrate that these meta-measures\nfacilitate the comparison and selection of predictive models for different\nrisk-taking scenarios. Such insights are of particular value to enhance\ndecision-making in dynamic business environments.",

An accurate measurement and prediction of airspace density is\ncrucial for a better managed airspace, both strategically and tactically,\nyielding a higher level of automation and thereby reducing the air traffic\ncontroller's workload. Although the prior approaches have been able to address\nthe problem to some extent, data management and query processing of\never-increasing vast volume of air traffic data at high rates, for various\nanalytics purposes such as predicting aircraft counts, still remains a\nchallenge especially when only linear prediction models are used.\n  In this paper, we present a novel data management and prediction system that\naccurately predicts aircraft counts for a particular airspace sector within the\nNational Airspace System (NAS). The incoming Traffic Flow Management (TFM) data\nis streaming, big, uncorrelated and noisy. In the preprocessing step, the\nsystem continuously processes the incoming raw data, reduces it to a compact\nsize, and stores it in a NoSQL database, where it makes the data available for\nefficient query processing. In the prediction step, the system learns from\nhistorical trajectories and uses their segments to collect key features such as\nsector boundary crossings, weather parameters, and other air traffic data. The\nfeatures are fed into various regression models, including linear, non-linear\nand ensemble models, and the best performing model is used for prediction.\nEvaluation on an extensive set of real track, weather, and air traffic data\nincluding boundary crossings in the U.S. verify that our system efficiently and\naccurately predicts aircraft counts in each airspace sector.",

It provides a very flexible chatbot system that makes use of\nreinforcement learning strategies to improve user interactions and\nconversational experiences. Additionally, this system makes use of sentiment\nanalysis and natural language processing to determine user moods. The chatbot\nis a valuable tool across many fields thanks to its amazing characteristics,\nwhich include voice-to-voice conversation, multilingual support [12], advising\nskills, offline functioning, and quick help features. The complexity of chatbot\ntechnology development is also explored in this study, along with the causes\nthat have propelled these developments and their far-reaching effects on a\nrange of sectors. According to the study, three crucial elements are crucial:\n1) Even without explicit profile information, the chatbot system is built to\nadeptly understand unique consumer preferences and fluctuating satisfaction\nlevels. With the use of this capacity, user interactions are made to meet their\nwants and preferences. 2) Using a complex method that interlaces Multiview\nvoice chat information, the chatbot may precisely simulate users' actual\nexperiences. This aids in developing more genuine and interesting discussions.\n3) The study presents an original method for improving the black-box deep\nlearning models' capacity for prediction. This improvement is made possible by\nintroducing dynamic satisfaction measurements that are theory-driven, which\nleads to more precise forecasts of consumer reaction.",

Predictions for the critical bubble size and\nfrequency of the most unstable mode are found to agree well with reference data\nobtained in ultrapure water and in several silicone oils. By varying the bubble\nsize, stability diagrams are built for several specific fluids, revealing three\ndistinct regimes characterized by different bifurcation sequences. The spatial\nstructure of the corresponding unstable modes is analysed, together with the\nvariations of the bubble shape, position and orientation. For this purpose,\ndisplacements of the bubble surface are split into rigid-body components and\nvolume-preserving deformations, allowing us to determine how the relative\nmagnitude of the latter varies with the fluid properties and bubble size.\nPredictions obtained with freely-deformable bubbles are compared with those\nfound when the bubble shape determined in the base state is constrained to\nremain frozen during the stability analysis. This comparison reveals that\ndeformations leave the phenomenology of the first bifurcations unchanged in\nlow-viscosity fluids, especially water, only lowering the critical bubble size\nand increasing the frequency of path oscillations. In contrast, they introduce\na dramatic change in the nature of the primary bifurcation in oils slightly\nmore viscous than water, whereas, somewhat surprisingly, they leave the\nnear-threshold phenomenology unchanged in more viscous oils.",

            "summary": "Existing deep learning-based depth completion methods generally employ\nmassive stacked layers to predict the dense depth map from sparse input data.\nAlthough such approaches greatly advance this task, their accompanied huge\ncomputational complexity hinders their practical applications. To accomplish\ndepth completion more efficiently, we propose a novel lightweight deep network\nframework, the Long-short Range Recurrent Updating (LRRU) network. Without\nlearning complex feature representations, LRRU first roughly fills the sparse\ninput to obtain an initial dense depth map, and then iteratively updates it\nthrough learned spatially-variant kernels. Our iterative update process is\ncontent-adaptive and highly flexible, where the kernel weights are learned by\njointly considering the guidance RGB images and the depth map to be updated,\nand large-to-small kernel scopes are dynamically adjusted to capture\nlong-to-short range dependencies. Our initial depth map has coarse but complete\nscene depth information, which helps relieve the burden of directly regressing\nthe dense depth from sparse ones, while our proposed method can effectively\nrefine it to an accurate depth map with less learnable parameters and inference\ntime. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed LRRU variants achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance across different parameter regimes. In particular,\nthe LRRU-Base model outperforms competing approaches on the NYUv2 dataset, and\nranks 1st on the KITTI depth completion benchmark at the time of submission.\nProject page: https://npucvr.github.io/LRRU/.",

From the modeling\nviewpoint, the new kinetic model regards a system, composed of stochastically\ninteracting agents, under the action of an eternal force field. According to\nthe application perspectives of this paper, the external force field has a\nspecific analytical shape. In this case, some analytical results are proved,\ni.e. existence, uniqueness, positivity and boundedness of solution of the\nrelated Cauchy problem, under suitable assumptions, at least locally in time.\nThen, the models is refined to be implemented for the study of treatment\nstrategies in case of autoimmune response. Specifically, we distinguish the\nautonomous case from the nonautonomous one, representing absence or delivery of\ndrugs, respectively. The former allows to gain some stability results, still in\nterms of Hopf bifurcations. Whereas, the latter is qualitatively studied.\nNumerical simulations are provided for both schemes. They show the adherence of\nthis new framework to the realistic scenarios, confirming its impact and\npotentiality.",

However, this particular learning paradigm\nsuffers from high instability stemming from substantial variances induced by\nfactors such as the input distribution of selected examples, their ordering,\nand prompt formats. In this work, we demonstrate that even when all these\nfactors are held constant, the random selection of examples still results in\nhigh variance. Consequently, we aim to explore the informative ability of data\nexamples by quantifying the Information Gain (IG) obtained in prediction after\nobserving a given example candidate. Then we propose to sample those with\nmaximum IG. Additionally, we identify the presence of template bias, which can\nlead to unfair evaluations of IG during the sampling process. To mitigate this\nbias, we introduce Calibration Before Sampling strategy. The experimental\nresults illustrate that our proposed method can yield an average relative\nimprovement of 14.3% across six classification tasks using three LLMs.",

Drawing inspiration from unsupervised reinforcement\nlearning (RL) pretraining, EAI achieves exploration within the natural language\nspace. We accomplish this by harnessing large language models to assess the\nnovelty of generated content.

Previous work has shown that when an agent has i.i.d. values\nacross rounds, then in the worst case, she can never get more than a constant\nstrictly less than $1$ fraction of her ideal utility -- her highest achievable\nutility given her nominal share of resources. Moreover, an agent can achieve at\nleast half her utility under carefully designed `pseudo-market' mechanisms,\neven though other agents may act in an arbitrary (possibly adversarial and\ncollusive) manner.\n  We show that this robustness guarantee also holds under the much simpler DMMF\nmechanism. More significantly, under mild assumptions on the value\ndistribution, we show that DMMF in fact allows each agent to realize a $1 -\no(1)$ fraction of her ideal utility, despite arbitrary behavior by other\nagents. We achieve this by characterizing the utility achieved under a richer\nspace of strategies, wherein an agent can tune how aggressive to be in\nrequesting the item. Our new strategies also allow us to handle settings where\nan agent's values are correlated across rounds, thereby allowing an adversary\nto predict and block her future values. We prove that again by tuning one's\naggressiveness, an agent can guarantee $\\Omega(\\gamma)$ fraction of her ideal\nutility, where $\\gamma\\in [0, 1]$ is a parameter that quantifies dependence\nacross rounds (with $\\gamma = 1$ indicating full independence and lower values\nindicating more correlation). Finally, we extend our efficiency results to the\ncase of reusable resources, where an agent might need to hold the item over\nmultiple rounds to receive utility.",

            "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been gaining increasing attention and\ndemonstrated promising performance across a variety of Software Engineering\n(SE) tasks, such as Automated Program Repair (APR), code summarization, and\ncode completion. For example, ChatGPT, the latest black-box LLM, has been\ninvestigated by numerous recent research studies and has shown impressive\nperformance in various tasks. However, there exists a potential risk of data\nleakage since these LLMs are usually close-sourced with unknown specific\ntraining details, e.g., pre-training datasets.\n  In this paper, we seek to review the bug-fixing capabilities of ChatGPT on a\nclean APR benchmark with different research objectives. We first introduce\n{\\benchmark}, a new benchmark with buggy and the corresponding fixed programs\nfrom competitive programming problems starting from 2023, after the training\ncutoff point of ChatGPT. The results on {\\benchmark} show that ChatGPT is able\nto fix 109 out of 151 buggy programs using the basic prompt within 35\nindependent rounds, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs CodeT5 and PLBART by\n27.5\\% and 62.4\\% prediction accuracy. We also investigate the impact of three\ntypes of prompts, i.e., problem description, error feedback, and bug\nlocalization, leading to additional 34 fixed bugs. Besides, we provide\nadditional discussion from the interactive nature of ChatGPT to illustrate the\ncapacity of a dialog-based repair workflow with 9 additional fixed bugs.\nInspired by the findings, we further pinpoint various challenges and\nopportunities for advanced SE study equipped with such LLMs (e.g.,~ChatGPT) in\nthe near future. More importantly, our work calls for more research on the\nreevaluation of the achievements obtained by existing black-box LLMs across\nvarious SE tasks, not limited to ChatGPT on APR.",

The Leray-Burgers equation, a regularization of the inviscid Burgers\nequation, incorporates a Helmholtz filter with a characteristic wavelength\n$\\alpha$ to replace the usual convective velocity, inducing a regularized\nconvective velocity. The filter bends the equation's characteristics slightly\nand makes them not intersect each other, leading to a global solution in time.\nBy conducting computational experiments with various initial conditions, we\ndetermine the practical range of $\\alpha >0$ that closely approximates the\nsolutions of the inviscid Burgers equation. Our findings indicate that the\nvalue of $\\alpha$ depends on the initial data, with the practical range of\n$\\alpha$ being between 0.01 and 0.05 for continuous initial profiles and\nbetween 0.01 and 0.03 for discontinuous initial profiles. The Leray-Burgers\nequation captures shock and rarefaction waves within the temporal domain for\nwhich training data exists. However, as the temporal domain extends beyond the\ntraining interval, data-driven forward computation demonstrates that the\npredictions generated by the PINN start to deviate from the exact solutions.\nThis study also highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of the\nLeray-Burgers equation in real practical problems, specifically Traffic State\nEstimation.",

A highly performant object detector requires accurate\nranking for the bounding box predictions. For DETR-based detectors, the\ntop-ranked bounding boxes suffer from less accurate localization quality due to\nthe misalignment between classification scores and localization accuracy, thus\nimpeding the construction of high-quality detectors. In this work, we introduce\na simple and highly performant DETR-based object detector by proposing a series\nof rank-oriented designs, combinedly called Rank-DETR. Our key contributions\ninclude: (i) a rank-oriented architecture design that can prompt positive\npredictions and suppress the negative ones to ensure lower false positive\nrates, as well as (ii) a rank-oriented loss function and matching cost design\nthat prioritizes predictions of more accurate localization accuracy during\nranking to boost the AP under high IoU thresholds. We apply our method to\nimprove the recent SOTA methods (e.g., H-DETR and DINO-DETR) and report strong\nCOCO object detection results when using different backbones such as\nResNet-$50$, Swin-T, and Swin-L, demonstrating the effectiveness of our\napproach.

Existing methods\nstruggle to consistently address different types of overfitting, typically\ndesigning strategies that focus separately on either natural or adversarial\npatterns. In this work, we adopt a unified perspective by solely focusing on\nnatural patterns to explore different types of overfitting. Specifically, we\nexamine the memorization effect in DNNs and reveal a shared behaviour termed\nover-memorization, which impairs their generalization capacity. This behaviour\nmanifests as DNNs suddenly becoming high-confidence in predicting certain\ntraining patterns and retaining a persistent memory for them. Furthermore, when\nDNNs over-memorize an adversarial pattern, they tend to simultaneously exhibit\nhigh-confidence prediction for the corresponding natural pattern. These\nfindings motivate us to holistically mitigate different types of overfitting by\nhindering the DNNs from over-memorization natural patterns. To this end, we\npropose a general framework, Distraction Over-Memorization (DOM), which\nexplicitly prevents over-memorization by either removing or augmenting the\nhigh-confidence natural patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method in mitigating overfitting across various\ntraining paradigms.",

However, until now, there\nhas been little theoretical work to compare against. We present the first\nsimulation-based study of this population, using highly-resolved galaxies from\nthe Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, with multi-wavelength\nimages along several lines of sight forward-modelled using radiative transfer.\nWe naturally recover a population of modelled sources that meet commonly-used\nselection criteria ($H_{\\rm{AB}}>27\\,\\rm{mag}$ and\n$H_{\\rm{AB}}-\\rm{F444W}>2.3$).

            "summary": "Time series forecasting represents a significant and challenging task across\nvarious fields. Recently, methods based on mode decomposition have dominated\nthe forecasting of complex time series because of the advantages of capturing\nlocal characteristics and extracting intrinsic modes from data. Unfortunately,\nmost models fail to capture the implied volatilities that contain significant\ninformation. To enhance the prediction of contemporary diverse and complex time\nseries, we propose a novel time series forecasting paradigm that integrates\ndecomposition with the capability to capture the underlying fluctuation\ninformation of the series. In our methodology, we implement the Variational\nMode Decomposition algorithm to decompose the time series into K distinct\nsub-modes. Following this decomposition, we apply the Generalized\nAutoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to extract the\nvolatility information in these sub-modes. Subsequently, both the numerical\ndata and the volatility information for each sub-mode are harnessed to train a\nneural network. This network is adept at predicting the information of the\nsub-modes, and we aggregate the predictions of all sub-modes to generate the\nfinal output. By integrating econometric and artificial intelligence methods,\nand taking into account both the numerical and volatility information of the\ntime series, our proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in time\nseries forecasting, as evidenced by the significant decrease in MSE, RMSE, and\nMAPE in our comparative experimental results.",

A large part of electricity consumption is\naffected by weather conditions, making weather information an important\ndeterminant of electricity usage. Personal appliances and industry equipment\nalso contribute significantly to electricity demand with temporal patterns,\nmaking time a useful factor to consider in load forecasting. This work develops\nseveral machine learning (ML) models that take various time and weather\ninformation as part of the input features to predict the short-term system-wide\ntotal load. Ablation studies were also performed to investigate and compare the\nimpacts of different weather factors on the prediction accuracy. Actual load\nand historical weather data for the same region were processed and then used to\ntrain the ML models. It is interesting to observe that using all available\nfeatures, each of which may be correlated to the load, is unlikely to achieve\nthe best forecasting performance; features with redundancy may even decrease\nthe inference capabilities of ML models. This indicates the importance of\nfeature selection for ML models. Overall, case studies demonstrated the\neffectiveness of ML models trained with different weather and time input\nfeatures for ERCOT load forecasting.",

Existing related studies focus on DEL algorithm design and\noptimization but ignore the important issue of incentives, without which\nself-interested learners may be unwilling to participate in DEL. We aim to fill\nthis gap by presenting a first study on the incentive mechanism design for DEL.\nOur proposed mechanism specifies both the amount of training data and reward\nfor learners with heterogeneous computation and communication costs. One design\nchallenge is to have an accurate understanding regarding how learners'\ndiversity (in terms of training data) affects the ensemble accuracy. To this\nend, we decompose the ensemble accuracy into a diversity-precision tradeoff to\nguide the mechanism design. Another challenge is that the mechanism design\ninvolves solving a mixed-integer program with a large search space. To this\nend, we propose an alternating algorithm that iteratively updates each\nlearner's training data size and reward. We prove that under mild conditions,\nthe algorithm converges. Numerical results using MNIST dataset show an\ninteresting result: our proposed mechanism may prefer a lower level of learner\ndiversity to achieve a higher ensemble accuracy.",

We studied this\nissue by measuring the performance of DETR with different experiments and\nbenchmarking the network with convolutional neural network (CNN) based\ndetectors like YOLO and Faster-RCNN. We found that DETR performs well when it\ncomes to resistance to interference from information loss in occlusion images.\nDespite that, we found that the adversarial stickers put on the image require\nthe network to produce a new unnecessary set of keys, queries, and values,\nwhich in most cases, results in a misdirection of the network. DETR also\nperformed poorer than YOLOv5 in the image corruption benchmark. Furthermore, we\nfound that DETR depends heavily on the main query when making a prediction,\nwhich leads to imbalanced contributions between queries since the main query\nreceives most of the gradient flow.",

The\nmodels were built for two different tasks, i.e., detection and prediction, and\nthe experimental results showed that time series models outperform bag-of-words\napproaches in both tasks. In particular, a Transformer-based model, namely\nBERT, could reach 0.928 AUC in detection tasks and 0.729 AUC in prediction\ntasks.

This causes problems of domain dependency between synthetic and\nreal-scanned point clouds and issues with substantial model sizes and dataset\nrequirements. Additionally, many existing methods upsample point clouds with a\nfixed scaling rate, making them inflexible and computationally redundant. This\npaper addresses the above problems by proposing a ray-based upsampling approach\nwith an arbitrary rate, where a depth prediction is made for each query ray.\nThe method simulates the ray marching algorithm to achieve more precise and\nstable ray-depth predictions through implicit surface learning. The rule-based\nmid-point query sampling method enables a uniform output point distribution\nwithout requiring model training using the Chamfer distance loss function,\nwhich can exhibit bias towards the training dataset. Self-supervised learning\nbecomes possible with accurate ground truths within the input point cloud.

            "summary": "Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that behaviors in\nlanguage models can be successfully reverse-engineered through circuit\nanalysis. A common criticism, however, is that each circuit is task-specific,\nand thus such analysis cannot contribute to understanding the models at a\nhigher level. In this work, we present evidence that insights (both low-level\nfindings about specific heads and higher-level findings about general\nalgorithms) can indeed generalize across tasks. Specifically, we study the\ncircuit discovered in Wang et al. (2022) for the Indirect Object Identification\n(IOI) task and 1.) show that it reproduces on a larger GPT2 model, and 2.) that\nit is mostly reused to solve a seemingly different task: Colored Objects\n(Ippolito & Callison-Burch, 2023). We provide evidence that the process\nunderlying both tasks is functionally very similar, and contains about a 78%\noverlap in in-circuit attention heads. We further present a proof-of-concept\nintervention experiment, in which we adjust four attention heads in middle\nlayers in order to 'repair' the Colored Objects circuit and make it behave like\nthe IOI circuit. In doing so, we boost accuracy from 49.6% to 93.7% on the\nColored Objects task and explain most sources of error. The intervention\naffects downstream attention heads in specific ways predicted by their\ninteractions in the IOI circuit, indicating that this subcircuit behavior is\ninvariant to the different task inputs. Overall, our results provide evidence\nthat it may yet be possible to explain large language models' behavior in terms\nof a relatively small number of interpretable task-general algorithmic building\nblocks and computational components.",

However, MSI status is not routinely\ntested in prostate cancer, in part due to low prevalence and assay cost. As\nsuch, prediction of MSI status from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained\nwhole-slide images (WSIs) could identify prostate cancer patients most likely\nto benefit from confirmatory testing and becoming eligible for immunotherapy.\nProstate biopsies and surgical resections from de-identified records of\nconsecutive prostate cancer patients referred to our institution were analyzed.\nTheir MSI status was determined by next generation sequencing. Patients before\na cutoff date were split into an algorithm development set (n=4015, MSI-H 1.8%)\nand a paired validation set (n=173, MSI-H 19.7%) that consisted of two serial\nsections from each sample, one stained and scanned internally and the other at\nan external site. Patients after the cutoff date formed the temporal validation\nset (n=1350, MSI-H 2.3%). Attention-based multiple instance learning models\nwere trained to predict MSI-H from H&E WSIs. The MSI-H predictor achieved area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.78 (95% CI\n[0.69-0.86]), 0.72 (95% CI [0.63-0.81]), and 0.72 (95% CI [0.62-0.82]) on the\ninternally prepared, externally prepared, and temporal validation sets,\nrespectively. While MSI-H status is significantly correlated with Gleason\nscore, the model remained predictive within each Gleason score subgroup. In\nsummary, we developed and validated an AI-based MSI-H diagnostic model on a\nlarge real-world cohort of routine H&E slides, which effectively generalized to\nexternally stained and scanned samples and a temporally independent validation\ncohort. This algorithm has the potential to direct prostate cancer patients\ntoward immunotherapy and to identify MSI-H cases secondary to Lynch syndrome.",

Our insight is that, in these environments,\ninteresting states for exploration are states where the agent is uncertain\nwhether (as opposed to how) entities such as the agent or objects have some\ninfluence on each other. We present ELDEN, Exploration via Local DepENdencies,\na novel intrinsic reward that encourages the discovery of new interactions\nbetween entities. ELDEN utilizes a novel scheme -- the partial derivative of\nthe learned dynamics to model the local dependencies between entities\naccurately and computationally efficiently. The uncertainty of the predicted\ndependencies is then used as an intrinsic reward to encourage exploration\ntoward new interactions. We evaluate the performance of ELDEN on four different\ndomains with complex dependencies, ranging from 2D grid worlds to 3D robotic\ntasks.

            "summary": "Relational Database Management Systems designed for Online Analytical\nProcessing (RDBMS-OLAP) have been foundational to democratizing data and\nenabling analytical use cases such as business intelligence and reporting for\nmany years. However, RDBMS-OLAP systems present some well-known challenges.\nThey are primarily optimized only for relational workloads, lead to\nproliferation of data copies which can become unmanageable, and since the data\nis stored in proprietary formats, it can lead to vendor lock-in, restricting\naccess to engines, tools, and capabilities beyond what the vendor offers. As\nthe demand for data-driven decision making surges, the need for a more robust\ndata architecture to address these challenges becomes ever more critical. Cloud\ndata lakes have addressed some of the shortcomings of RDBMS-OLAP systems, but\nthey present their own set of challenges. More recently, organizations have\noften followed a two-tier architectural approach to take advantage of both\nthese platforms, leveraging both cloud data lakes and RDBMS-OLAP systems.\nHowever, this approach brings additional challenges, complexities, and\noverhead. This paper discusses how a data lakehouse, a new architectural\napproach, achieves the same benefits of an RDBMS-OLAP and cloud data lake\ncombined, while also providing additional advantages. We take today's data\nwarehousing and break it down into implementation independent components,\ncapabilities, and practices. We then take these aspects and show how a\nlakehouse architecture satisfies them. Then, we go a step further and discuss\nwhat additional capabilities and benefits a lakehouse architecture provides\nover an RDBMS-OLAP.",

            "summary": "This paper proposes an online target speaker voice activity detection system\nfor speaker diarization tasks, which does not require a priori knowledge from\nthe clustering-based diarization system to obtain the target speaker\nembeddings. By adapting the conventional target speaker voice activity\ndetection for real-time operation, this framework can identify speaker\nactivities using self-generated embeddings, resulting in consistent performance\nwithout permutation inconsistencies in the inference phase. During the\ninference process, we employ a front-end model to extract the frame-level\nspeaker embeddings for each coming block of a signal. Next, we predict the\ndetection state of each speaker based on these frame-level speaker embeddings\nand the previously estimated target speaker embedding. Then, the target speaker\nembeddings are updated by aggregating these frame-level speaker embeddings\naccording to the predictions in the current block. Our model predicts the\nresults for each block and updates the target speakers' embeddings until\nreaching the end of the signal. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the offline clustering-based diarization system on the\nDIHARD III and AliMeeting datasets. The proposed method is further extended to\nmulti-channel data, which achieves similar performance with the\nstate-of-the-art offline diarization systems.",

We use the TALYS reaction code (Koning et al. 2023) to estimate both\nthe model and parameter uncertainties affecting the photon strength function\nand the nuclear level densities, hence the radiative neutron capture rates. The\nSTAREVOL code (Siess et al. 2006) is used to determine the impact of nuclear\nuncertainties on the i-process nucleosynthesis in a 1 $M_{\\odot}$ [Fe/H] = -\n2.5 model star during the proton ingestion event in the early AGB phase. A\nlarge nuclear network of 1160 species coherently coupled to the transport\nprocesses is solved to follow the i-process nucleosynthesis. We find that the\nnon-correlated parameter uncertainties lead the surface abundances\nuncertainties of element with $Z\\geq 40$ to range between 0.5 and 1.0 dex, with\nodd-$Z$ elements displaying higher uncertainties. The correlated model\nuncertainties are of the same order of magnitude, and both model and parameter\nuncertainties have an important impact on potential observable tracers such as\nEu and La. Both the correlated model and uncorrelated parameter uncertainties\nneed to be estimated coherently before being propagated to astrophysical\nobservables through multi-zone stellar evolution models.

            "summary": "The design of electromagnetic coils may require evaluation of several\nquantities that are challenging to compute numerically. These quantities\ninclude Lorentz forces, which may be a limiting factor due to stresses; the\ninternal magnetic field, which is relevant for determining stress as well as a\nsuperconducting coil's proximity to its quench limit; and the inductance, which\ndetermines stored magnetic energy and dynamics. When computing the effect on\none coil due to the current in another, these quantities can often be\napproximated quickly by treating the coils as infinitesimally thin. When\ncomputing the effect on a coil due to its own current (e.g., self-force or\nself-inductance), evaluation is difficult due to the presence of a singularity;\ncoils cannot be treated as infinitesimally thin as each quantity diverges at\nzero conductor width. Here, we present novel and well-behaved methods for\nevaluating these quantities using non-singular integral formulae of reduced\ndimensions. These formulae are determined rigorously by dividing the domain of\nintegration of the magnetic vector potential into two regions, exploiting\nappropriate approximations in each region, and expanding in high aspect ratio.\nOur formulae show good agreement to full finite-thickness calculations even at\nlow aspect ratio, both analytically for a torus and numerically for a\nnon-planar coil of a stellarator fusion device, the Helically Symmetric\neXperiment (HSX). Because the integrands of these formulae develop fine\nstructure as the minor radius becomes infinitely thin, we also develop a method\nof evaluating the self-force and self-inductance with even greater efficiency\nby integrating this sharp feature analytically. We demonstrate with this method\nthat the self-force can be accurately computed for the HSX coil with as few as\n12 grid points.",

As such, developing controllers in\nsimulation is often desirable as it provides a safer and more economical\nalternative. However, accurately modeling robot dynamics is difficult due to\nthe complex robot dynamics and terrain interactions in unstructured\nenvironments. Domain randomization addresses this problem by randomizing\nsimulation dynamics parameters, however this approach sacrifices performance\nfor robustness leading to policies that are sub-optimal for any target\ndynamics. We introduce a novel model-based reinforcement learning approach that\naims to balance robustness with adaptability. Our approach trains a System\nIdentification Transformer (SIT) and an Adaptive Dynamics Model (ADM) under a\nvariety of simulated dynamics. The SIT uses attention mechanisms to distill\nstate-transition observations from the target system into a context vector,\nwhich provides an abstraction for its target dynamics. Conditioned on this, the\nADM probabilistically models the system's dynamics. Online, we use a Risk-Aware\nModel Predictive Path Integral controller (MPPI) to safely control the robot\nunder its current understanding of the dynamics. We demonstrate in simulation\nas well as in multiple real-world environments that this approach enables safer\nbehaviors upon initialization and becomes less conservative (i.e. faster) as\nits understanding of the target system dynamics improves with more\nobservations.

We begin with baseline approaches to targeting. First, we target\nbased on a causal forest that estimates heterogeneous treatment effects and\nthen assigns students to treatment according to those estimated to have the\nhighest treatment effects. Next, we evaluate two alternative targeting\npolicies, one targeting students with low predicted probability of renewing\nfinancial aid in the absence of the treatment, the other targeting those with\nhigh probability. The predicted baseline outcome is not the ideal criterion for\ntargeting, nor is it a priori clear whether to prioritize low, high, or\nintermediate predicted probability. Nonetheless, targeting on low baseline\noutcomes is common in practice, for example because the relationship between\nindividual characteristics and treatment effects is often difficult or\nimpossible to estimate with historical data. We propose hybrid approaches that\nincorporate the strengths of both predictive approaches (accurate estimation)\nand causal approaches (correct criterion); we show that targeting intermediate\nbaseline outcomes is most effective, while targeting based on low baseline\noutcomes is detrimental.

This one-shot\napproach leaves little room for error correction, as the models lack the\ncapability to integrate multiple observations for enhanced accuracy. Inspired\nby work on semantic change detection, we address this limitation by introducing\na methodology that leverages a sequence of observables generated for each\nstatic input image. By adding this \"temporal\" dimension, we exploit strong\nsignal correlations between successive observations in the sequence to reduce\nerror rates. Our framework, dubbed SSG2 (Semantic Segmentation Generation 2),\nemploys a dual-encoder, single-decoder base network augmented with a sequence\nmodel. The base model learns to predict the set intersection, union, and\ndifference of labels from dual-input images. Given a fixed target input image\nand a set of support images, the sequence model builds the predicted mask of\nthe target by synthesizing the partial views from each sequence step and\nfiltering out noise. We evaluate SSG2 across three diverse datasets:\nUrbanMonitor, featuring orthoimage tiles from Darwin, Australia with five\nspectral bands and 0.2m spatial resolution; ISPRS Potsdam, which includes true\northophoto images with multiple spectral bands and a 5cm ground sampling\ndistance; and ISIC2018, a medical dataset focused on skin lesion segmentation,\nparticularly melanoma. The SSG2 model demonstrates rapid convergence within the\nfirst few tens of epochs and significantly outperforms UNet-like baseline\nmodels with the same number of gradient updates.

            "summary": "Afghanistan has witnessed many armed conflicts throughout history, especially\nin the past 20 years; these events have had a significant impact on human\nlives, including military and civilians, with potential fatalities. In this\nresearch, we aim to leverage state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to\nclassify the outcomes of Afghanistan armed conflicts to either fatal or\nnon-fatal based on their textual descriptions provided by the Armed Conflict\nLocation & Event Data Project (ACLED) dataset. The dataset contains\ncomprehensive descriptions of armed conflicts in Afghanistan that took place\nfrom August 2021 to March 2023. The proposed approach leverages the power of\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a cutting-edge\nlanguage representation model in natural language processing. The classifier\nutilizes the raw textual description of an event to estimate the likelihood of\nthe event resulting in a fatality. The model achieved impressive performance on\nthe test set with an accuracy of 98.8%, recall of 98.05%, precision of 99.6%,\nand an F1 score of 98.82%. These results highlight the model's robustness and\nindicate its potential impact in various areas such as resource allocation,\npolicymaking, and humanitarian aid efforts in Afghanistan. The model indicates\na machine learning-based text classification approach using the ACLED dataset\nto accurately classify fatality in Afghanistan armed conflicts, achieving\nrobust performance with the BERT model and paving the way for future endeavors\nin predicting event severity in Afghanistan.",

            "summary": "Stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and sparse training\ndata are common in scientific problems. This paper describes efficient,\nimplicit, vectorized methods for integrating stiff systems of ordinary\ndifferential equations through time and calculating parameter gradients with\nthe adjoint method. The main innovation is to vectorize the problem both over\nthe number of independent times series and over a batch or \"chunk\" of\nsequential time steps, effectively vectorizing the assembly of the implicit\nsystem of ODEs. The block-bidiagonal structure of the linearized implicit\nsystem for the backward Euler method allows for further vectorization using\nparallel cyclic reduction (PCR). Vectorizing over both axes of the input data\nprovides a higher bandwidth of calculations to the computing device, allowing\neven problems with comparatively sparse data to fully utilize modern GPUs and\nachieving speed ups of greater than 100x, compared to standard, sequential time\nintegration. We demonstrate the advantages of implicit, vectorized time\nintegration with several example problems, drawn from both analytical stiff and\nnon-stiff ODE models as well as neural ODE models. We also describe and provide\na freely available open-source implementation of the methods developed here.",

Here, we propose a physically-interpretable Mass\nConserving Perceptron (MCP) as a way to bridge the gap between PC-based and\nML-based modeling approaches. The MCP exploits the inherent isomorphism between\nthe directed graph structures underlying both PC models and GRNNs to explicitly\nrepresent the mass-conserving nature of physical processes while enabling the\nfunctional nature of such processes to be directly learned (in an interpretable\nmanner) from available data using off-the-shelf ML technology. As a proof of\nconcept, we investigate the functional expressivity (capacity) of the MCP,\nexplore its ability to parsimoniously represent the rainfall-runoff (RR)\ndynamics of the Leaf River Basin, and demonstrate its utility for scientific\nhypothesis testing. To conclude, we discuss extensions of the concept to enable\nML-based physical-conceptual representation of the coupled nature of\nmass-energy-information flows through geoscientific systems.",

            "summary": "The lowest possible mass of ONeMg white dwarfs (WDs) has not been clarified\ndespite its importance in the formation and evolution of WDs. We tackle this\nissue by studying the properties of V1405 Cas (Nova Cassiopeiae 2021), which is\nan outlier given a combination of its very slow light-curve evolution and the\nrecently reported neon-nova identification. We report its rapid spectral\nevolution in the initial phase, covering 9.88, 23.77, 33.94, 53.53, 71.79, and\n81.90 hours after the discovery. The first spectrum is characterized by lines\nfrom highly-ionized species, most noticeably He II and N III. These lines are\nquickly replaced by lower-ionization lines, e.g., N II, Si II, and O I. In\naddition, Al II (6237 \\r{A}) starts emerging as an emission line at the second\nepoch. We perform emission-line strength diagnostics, showing that the density\nand temperature quickly decrease toward later epochs. This behavior, together\nwith the decreasing velocity seen in H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, and He I, indicates\nthat the initial nova dynamics is reasonably well described by an expanding\nfireball on top of an expanding photosphere. Interestingly, the strengths of\nthe N III and Al II indicate large abundance enhancement, pointing to an ONeMg\nWD progenitor as is consistent with its neon-nova classification. Given its\nlow-mass nature inferred by the slow light-curve evolution and relatively\nnarrow emission lines, it provides a challenge to the stellar evolution theory\nthat predicts the lower limit of the ONeMg WD mass being $\\sim$ 1.1 $M_\\odot$.",

For transiting exoplanets, we know if clouds are present\nbecause they mute spectral features and cause wavelength-dependent scattering.\nWhile the exact composition of these clouds is largely unknown, this\ninformation is vital to understanding the chemistry and energy budget of\nplanetary atmospheres. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter\nWASP-17b with JWST's MIRI LRS and generate a transmission spectrum from 5-12\n$\\rm{\\mu}$m. These wavelengths allow us to probe absorption due to the\nvibrational modes of various predicted cloud species. Our transmission spectrum\nshows additional opacity centered at 8.6 $\\rm{\\mu}$m, and detailed atmospheric\nmodeling and retrievals identify this feature as SiO$_2$(s) (quartz) clouds.\nThe SiO$_2$(s) clouds model is preferred at 3.5-4.2$\\sigma$ versus a cloud-free\nmodel and at 2.6$\\sigma$ versus a generic aerosol prescription. We find the\nSiO$_2$(s) clouds are comprised of small ${\\sim}0.01$ $\\rm{\\mu}$m particles,\nwhich extend to high altitudes in the atmosphere. The atmosphere also shows a\ndepletion of H$_2$O, a finding consistent with the formation of\nhigh-temperature aerosols from oxygen-rich species.

            "summary": "An effective field theory (EFT) for dynamical axions in Weyl semimetals\n(WSMs) is presented. A pseudoscalar axion excitation is predicted in WSMs at\nsufficiently low temperatures, independently of the strength of the Weyl\nfermion self-coupling. For strong fermion self-coupling the axion is the\ngapless Goldstone boson of chiral $U(1)^{\\text{ch}}$ spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking. For weak fermion self-coupling an axion is also generated at non-zero\nchiral density for Weyl nodes displaced in energy, as a gapless collective mode\nof correlated fermion pair excitations of the Fermi surface. This is an\nexplicit example of the extension of Goldstone's theorem to symmetry breaking\nby the axial anomaly itself. In both cases the axion is a chiral density wave\nor phason mode of the superfluid state of the WSM, and the Weyl fermions form a\nchiral condensate $\\langle\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\rangle$ at low temperatures. In the\npresence of an applied magnetic field the axion mode becomes gapped, in analogy\nto the Anderson-Higgs mechanism in a superconductor. 't Hooft anomaly matching\nfrom ultraviolet to infrared scales is directly verified in the EFT approach.\nWSMs thus provide an interesting quantum system in which superfluid, non-Fermi\nliquid behavior, and a dynamical axion are predicted to follow directly from\nthe axial anomaly in a consistent EFT that may be tested experimentally.",

A core-collapse\nsupernova can be host to a number of hydrodynamic instabilities which occur\nbehind the shockfront. Such instabilities between the forward shock and a\npossible reverse shock can lead to cascades introducing turbulence in the\nassociated matter profile, which can imprint itself in the neutrino signal. In\nthis work, we consider realistic matter profiles and seed in the turbulence\nusing a randomization scheme to study its effects on neutrino propagation in an\neffective two-flavor framework. In particular, we find that the double-dip\nfeature, originally predicted in the neutrino spectra associated with forward\nand reverse shocks, can be completely washed away in the presence of\nturbulence, leading to total flavor depolarization. We also study the\nsensitivity of upcoming neutrino detectors - DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande- to the\npower spectrum of turbulence to check for deviations from the usual Kolmogorov\n($5/3$) inverse power law. We find that while these experiments can effectively\nconstrain the parameter space for the amplitude of the turbulence power\nspectra, they will only be mildly sensitive to the spectral index.",

            "summary": "This paper aims to tackle the challenge of dynamic view synthesis from\nmulti-view videos. The key observation is that while previous grid-based\nmethods offer consistent rendering, they fall short in capturing appearance\ndetails of a complex dynamic scene, a domain where multi-view image-based\nrendering methods demonstrate the opposite properties. To combine the best of\ntwo worlds, we introduce Im4D, a hybrid scene representation that consists of a\ngrid-based geometry representation and a multi-view image-based appearance\nrepresentation. Specifically, the dynamic geometry is encoded as a 4D density\nfunction composed of spatiotemporal feature planes and a small MLP network,\nwhich globally models the scene structure and facilitates the rendering\nconsistency. We represent the scene appearance by the original multi-view\nvideos and a network that learns to predict the color of a 3D point from image\nfeatures, instead of memorizing detailed appearance totally with networks,\nthereby naturally making the learning of networks easier. Our method is\nevaluated on five dynamic view synthesis datasets including DyNeRF, ZJU-MoCap,\nNHR, DNA-Rendering and ENeRF-Outdoor datasets. The results show that Im4D\nexhibits state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality and can be trained\nefficiently, while realizing real-time rendering with a speed of 79.8 FPS for\n512x512 images, on a single RTX 3090 GPU.",

Unlike previous methods that can only control\nthe pelvis trajectory, OmniControl can incorporate flexible spatial control\nsignals over different joints at different times with only one model.\nSpecifically, we propose analytic spatial guidance that ensures the generated\nmotion can tightly conform to the input control signals. At the same time,\nrealism guidance is introduced to refine all the joints to generate more\ncoherent motion. Both the spatial and realism guidance are essential and they\nare highly complementary for balancing control accuracy and motion realism. By\ncombining them, OmniControl generates motions that are realistic, coherent, and\nconsistent with the spatial constraints. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML\ndatasets show that OmniControl not only achieves significant improvement over\nstate-of-the-art methods on pelvis control but also shows promising results\nwhen incorporating the constraints over other joints.",

            "summary": "Despite significant advances in large-scale text-to-image models, achieving\nhyper-realistic human image generation remains a desirable yet unsolved task.\nExisting models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 tend to generate human\nimages with incoherent parts or unnatural poses. To tackle these challenges,\nour key insight is that human image is inherently structural over multiple\ngranularities, from the coarse-level body skeleton to fine-grained spatial\ngeometry. Therefore, capturing such correlations between the explicit\nappearance and latent structure in one model is essential to generate coherent\nand natural human images. To this end, we propose a unified framework,\nHyperHuman, that generates in-the-wild human images of high realism and diverse\nlayouts. Specifically, 1) we first build a large-scale human-centric dataset,\nnamed HumanVerse, which consists of 340M images with comprehensive annotations\nlike human pose, depth, and surface normal. 2) Next, we propose a Latent\nStructural Diffusion Model that simultaneously denoises the depth and surface\nnormal along with the synthesized RGB image. Our model enforces the joint\nlearning of image appearance, spatial relationship, and geometry in a unified\nnetwork, where each branch in the model complements to each other with both\nstructural awareness and textural richness. 3) Finally, to further boost the\nvisual quality, we propose a Structure-Guided Refiner to compose the predicted\nconditions for more detailed generation of higher resolution. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our framework yields the state-of-the-art\nperformance, generating hyper-realistic human images under diverse scenarios.\nProject Page: https://snap-research.github.io/HyperHuman/",

The\nreliability range of this network was aimed for conditions between 500 - 2500 K\nand 100 - 10^-6 bar. We compared the predictions of seven networks over a large\nset of experiments, covering a wide range of conditions (pressures,\ntemperatures, and initial compositions). To examine the consequences of this\nnew chemical network on exoplanets atmospheric studies, we generated abundances\nprofiles for GJ 436 b, GJ 1214 b, HD 189733 b, and HD 209458 b, using the 1D\nkinetic model FRECKLL and calculated the corresponding transmission spectra\nusing TauREx 3.1. These spectra and abundance profiles have been compared with\nresults obtained with our previous chemical network. Our new kinetic network is\ncomposed of 174 species and 1293 reactions mostly reversible. This network\nproves to be more accurate than our previous one for the tested experimental\nconditions. The nitrogen chemistry update is found to be impactful on the\nabundance profiles, particularly for HCN, with differences up to four orders of\nmagnitude. The CO2 profiles are also significantly affected, with important\nrepercussions on the transmission spectrum of GJ 436 b. These effects highlight\nthe importance of using extensively validated chemical networks to gain\nconfidence in our models predictions.

The\npresent work examines a generalization of a recently proposed rule-of-thumb\n\\cite{Marolf:2022ntb} for selecting this contour at quadratic order about a\nsaddle. The original proposal depended on the choice of an indefinite-signature\nmetric on the space of perturbations, which was taken to be a DeWitt metric\nwith parameter $\\alpha =-1$. This choice was made to match previous results,\nbut was otherwise admittedly {\\it ad hoc}. To begin to investigate the physics\nassociated with the choice of such a metric, we now explore contours defined\nusing analogous prescriptions for $\\alpha \\neq -1$. We study such contours for\nEuclidean gravity linearized about AdS-Schwarzschild black holes in reflecting\ncavities with thermal (canonical ensemble) boundary conditions, and we compare\npath-integral stability of the associated saddles with thermodynamic stability\nof the classical spacetimes. While the contour generally depends on the choice\nof DeWitt parameter $\\alpha$, the precise agreement between these two notions\nof stability found at $\\alpha =-1$ continues to hold over the finite interval\n$(-2,-2/d)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the bulk spacetime. This agreement\nmanifestly fails for $\\alpha > -2/d$ when the DeWitt metric becomes positive\ndefinite. However, we also find dramatic failures for $\\alpha< -2$ that\ncorrelate with breakdowns of the de Donder-like gauge condition defined by\n$\\alpha$, and at which the relevant fluctuation operator fails to be\ndiagonalizable. This provides criteria that may be useful in predicting metrics\non the space of perturbations that give physically-useful contours in more\ngeneral settings. Along the way, we also identify an interesting error in\n\\cite{Marolf:2022ntb}, though we show this error to be harmless.",

In recent times, significant progress has been\nmade in utilizing deep-learning approaches to automate PCI estimation process.\nHowever, the current approaches rely on at least two separate models to\nestimate PCI values -- one model dedicated to determining the type and extent\nand another for estimating their severity. This approach presents several\nchallenges, including complexities, high computational resource demands, and\nmaintenance burdens that necessitate careful consideration and resolution. To\novercome these challenges, the current study develops a unified multi-tasking\nmodel that predicts the PCI directly from a top-down pavement image. The\nproposed architecture is a multi-task model composed of one encoder for feature\nextraction and four decoders to handle specific tasks: two detection heads, one\nsegmentation head and one PCI estimation head. By multitasking, we are able to\nextract features from the detection and segmentation heads for automatically\nestimating the PCI directly from the images. The model performs very well on\nour benchmarked and open pavement distress dataset that is annotated for\nmultitask learning (the first of its kind).

            "summary": "The rise of deep learning has ushered in significant progress in computer\nvision (CV) tasks, yet the \"black box\" nature of these models often precludes\ninterpretability. This challenge has spurred the development of Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) by generating explanations to AI's\ndecision-making process. An explanation is aimed to not only faithfully reflect\nthe true reasoning process (i.e., faithfulness) but also align with humans'\nreasoning (i.e., alignment). Within XAI, visual explanations employ visual cues\nto elucidate the reasoning behind machine learning models, particularly in\nimage processing, by highlighting images' critical areas important to\npredictions. Despite the considerable body of research in visual explanations,\nstandardized benchmarks for evaluating them are seriously underdeveloped. In\nparticular, to evaluate alignment, existing works usually merely illustrate a\nfew images' visual explanations, or hire some referees to report the\nexplanation quality under ad-hoc questionnaires. However, this cannot achieve a\nstandardized, quantitative, and comprehensive evaluation. To address this\nissue, we develop a benchmark for visual explanation, consisting of eight\ndatasets with human explanation annotations from various domains, accommodating\nboth post-hoc and intrinsic visual explanation methods. Additionally, we devise\na visual explanation pipeline that includes data loading, explanation\ngeneration, and method evaluation. Our proposed benchmarks facilitate a fair\nevaluation and comparison of visual explanation methods. Building on our\ncurated collection of datasets, we benchmarked eight existing visual\nexplanation methods and conducted a thorough comparison across four selected\ndatasets using six alignment-based and causality-based metrics. Our benchmark\nwill be accessible through our website https://xaidataset.github.io.",

The empirical analysis explores the predictive\ncontent of numerous macroeconomic and financial indicators with respect to NBER\nrecession indicator. The predictive ability of the underlying models is\nevaluated using a set of statistical evaluation metrics. The results strongly\nsupport the application of penalized logistic regression models in the area of\nrecession prediction. Specifically, the analysis indicates that a mixed usage\nof different penalized logistic regression models over different forecast\nhorizons largely outperform standard logistic regression models in the\nprediction of Great recession in the US, as they achieve higher predictive\naccuracy across 5 different forecast horizons. The Great Recession is largely\npredictable, whereas the Covid-19 recession remains unpredictable, given that\nthe Covid-19 pandemic is a real exogenous event.

To achieve real-time dynamic scene\nrendering while also enjoying high training and storage efficiency, we propose\n4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) as a holistic representation for dynamic scenes\nrather than applying 3D-GS for each individual frame. In 4D-GS, a novel\nexplicit representation containing both 3D Gaussians and 4D neural voxels is\nproposed.

Protocluster candidates are selected as regions with a significantly\nenhanced surface density of dropout galaxies. With this large sample, we\ncharacterise the properties of their individual member galaxies. We compare the\nnumber counts of dropout galaxies in protocluster candidates with that of\ncoeval field galaxies. Rest-frame UV bright galaxies are over-abundant in\nprotocluster candidates, a trend seen across the full redshift range studied.\nWe do not find evidence for their spatial distribution within protocluster\ncandidates to be distinct from their fainter counterparts, nor for their UV\ncolour to be different from that of field galaxies with the same brightness.\nCosmological simulations predict this bright-end excess, with the main cause\nbeing a richer population of massive galaxies, with only a minor contribution\nfrom an enhancement in star formation activity (and therefore UV emission) at\nfixed mass. $U$-to-$K$ SED modelling of our observed samples supports this\ninterpretation. This environmental differentiation in number counts is already\nin place at $z\\sim5$, with no significant redshift dependence over the range in\nlookback times probed.

            "summary": "An elastic rod, straight in its undeformed state, has a mass attached at one\nend and a variable length, due to a constraint at the other end by a\nfrictionless sliding sleeve. The constraint is arranged with the sliding\ndirection parallel to a gravity field, in a way that the rod can freely slip\ninside of the sleeve, when the latter is not moving. In this case, the free\nfall of the mass continues until the rod is completely injected into the\nconstraint. However, when the sliding sleeve is subject to a harmonic\ntransverse vibration, it is shown that the fall of the mass and the rod\ninjection are hindered by the presence of a configurational force developing at\nthe sliding sleeve and acting oppositely to gravity. During the dynamic motion,\nsuch a configurational force is varying in time because it is associated with\nthe variable bending moment at the sleeve entrance. It is (experimentally,\nanalytically, and numerically) demonstrated that, in addition to the states of\ncomplete injection or ejection of the elastic rod (for which the mass falls\ndown or is thrown out), a stable sustained oscillation around a finite height\ncan be realized. This 'suspended motion' is the signature of a new attractor,\nthat arises by the constraint oscillation. This behaviour shares similarities\nwith parametric oscillators, as for instance the Kapitza inverted pendulum.\nHowever, differently from the classical parametric oscillators, the 'suspended'\nconfiguration of the rod violates equilibrium and the stabilization occurs\nthrough a transverse mechanical input, instead of a longitudinal one. By\nvarying the sliding sleeve oscillation amplitude and frequency within specific\nsets of values, the system spontaneously adjusts the sustained motion through a\nself-tuning of the rod's external length. This self-tuning property opens the\nway to the design of vibration-based devices with extended frequency range.",

Those learnt embeddings can be used to delineate\nindividual objects and thus obtain instance segmentations. Here, we show\ntheoretically that, under assumptions commonly found in microscopy images, OCEs\ncan be learnt through a self-supervised task that predicts the spatial offset\nbetween image patches. Together, this forms an unsupervised cell instance\nsegmentation method which we evaluate on nine diverse large-scale microscopy\ndatasets. Segmentations obtained with our method lead to substantially improved\nresults, compared to state-of-the-art baselines on six out of nine datasets,\nand perform on par on the remaining three datasets. If ground-truth annotations\nare available, our method serves as an excellent starting point for supervised\ntraining, reducing the required amount of ground-truth needed by one order of\nmagnitude, thus substantially increasing the practical applicability of our\nmethod.

Adopting a\ntime series analytic technique and robust causal inference-based design, we\nconduct a large-scale observational study analyzing over 32 million COVID-19\ntweets and 16 million historical timeline tweets. We focus on understanding the\nbehavior and psychology of users disseminating misinformation during COVID-19\nand its relationship with the historical inclinations towards sharing\nmisinformation on Non-COVID topics before the pandemic. Our analysis\nunderscores the intricacies inherent to cross-topic misinformation, and\nhighlights that users' historical inclination toward sharing misinformation is\npositively associated with their present behavior pertaining to misinformation\nsharing on emergent topics and beyond.

We\ninvestigate this issue in two-dimensional fermionic wires described by a\nhopping model on an $N_x\\times N_y$ rectangular lattice comprised of vertical\nchains with a Hermitian intra-chain and inter-chain hopping matrices given by\n$H_0$ and $H_1$, respectively. We study particle transport using the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism, and show that the asymptotic\nbehavior of the conductance, $T(\\omega)$, at the Fermi level $\\omega$, is\ncontrolled by the spectrum of a dimensionless matrix\n$A(\\omega)=(-\\omega+H_0)H_1^{-1}$. This gives three simple conditions on the\nspectrum of $A(\\omega)$ for observing ballistic, subdiffusive, and\nexponentially decaying $T(\\omega)$ with respect to $N_x$. We show that certain\neigenvalues of $A(\\omega)$ give rise to subdiffusive contributions in the\nconductance, and correspond to the band edges of the isolated wire. We\ndemonstrate that the condition for observing the subdiffusive behavior can be\nsatisfied if $A(\\omega)$ has nontrivial topology. In that case, a transition\nfrom ballistic behavior to subdiffusive behavior of the conductance is observed\nas the hopping parameters are tuned within the topological regime. We argue\nthat at the transition point, different behaviors of the conductance can arise\nas the trivial bulk bands of $A(\\omega)$ also contribute subdiffusively. We\nillustrate our findings in a simple model by numerically computing the\nvariation of the conductance with $N_x$. Our numerical results indicate a\ndifferent subdiffusive behavior ($1/N_x^3$) of the conductance at the\ntransition point.

Recognizing the pivotal role of\npredictive information, the model quantifies and integrates the associated\nuncertainty to optimize resource allocation in anticipation of extreme events.\nConsidering the changes in operation objectives prior to and during ice storms,\nthe model adopts a dual-objective approach to strike a balance between economic\nand resiliency objectives across both normal and emergency operational\nconditions. To accurately model the uncertain contingencies under ice storms,\nthe model encapsulates the decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) introduced by\ninvestment decisions and various exogenous uncertainties related to extreme\nevents. The model is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer linear problem.\nThe first stage makes line hardening decisions, as well as the optimal sitting\nand sizing of energy storage. The second stage evaluates the risk-informed\noperation costs by taking into account both the normal operation prior to the\nevents and the emergent operation during the events, respectively. Case studies\ndemonstrate that predictive information can fortify resilience enhancement by\nfacilitating judicious investment decision-making and optimizing the\nutilization of dispatchable resources during risk-informed operations. The\nfindings highlight the essentiality and efficacy of incorporating predictive\ninformation during planning and operation.The model also provides valuable\ninsights for grid operators and planners in making risk-informed decisions on\ninfrastructure investments and operational strategies to better prepare for and\nrespond to future extreme weather events.",

            "summary": "The CMS and ATLAS collaborations recently published their results searching\nfor light Higgs bosons, using the complete Run 2 data of the LHC. Both reported\nan excess in the diphoton invariant mass distribution at $m_{\\gamma \\gamma}\n\\simeq 95.4~{\\rm GeV}$ with compatible signal strengths. The combined result\ncorresponded to a local significance of $3.1\\sigma$. Besides, the mass of the\ndiphoton signal coincided with that of the $b\\bar{b}$ excess observed at the\nLEP. Given the remarkable theoretical advantages of the general Next-to-Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model, we interpret these excesses by the resonant\nproductions of the singlet-dominated CP-even Higgs boson predicted by the\ntheory. Using both analytic formulae and numerical results, we show that the\nidea can interpret the excesses by broad parameter space without contradicting\ncurrent experimental restrictions, including those from the 125~{\\rm GeV} Higgs\ndata, the dark matter relic abundance and direct detection experiments, and the\ncollider searches for supersymmetry and extra Higgs bosons. Although the\nexplanations are scarcely affected by present Higgs data and the LHC search for\nsupersymmetry, the dark matter physics may leave footprints on them. We also\nsurvey the other signals of the light Higgs boson at the LHC.",

Much literature collects large amounts of annotated\nimage-text pairs to train text-conditioned generative models from scratch,\nwhich is expensive and not efficient. After that, some approaches that leverage\npre-trained vision-language models are put forward to avoid data collection,\nbut they are also limited by either per text-prompt optimization or\ninference-time hyper-parameters tuning. To address these issues, we investigate\nand identify a specific space, referred to as CLIP DeltaSpace, where the CLIP\nvisual feature difference of two images is semantically aligned with the CLIP\ntextual feature difference of their corresponding text descriptions. Based on\nDeltaSpace, we propose a novel framework called DeltaEdit, which maps the CLIP\nvisual feature differences to the latent space directions of a generative model\nduring the training phase, and predicts the latent space directions from the\nCLIP textual feature differences during the inference phase. And this design\nendows DeltaEdit with two advantages: (1) text-free training; (2)\ngeneralization to various text prompts for zero-shot inference. Extensive\nexperiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of DeltaEdit with\ndifferent generative models, including both the GAN model and the diffusion\nmodel, in achieving flexible text-guided image editing.

Nevertheless, the improvements were mostly limited to\nclassification tasks; moreover, few studies have evaluated visual SSL models in\nreal-world scenarios, while the majority considered datasets containing\nclass-wise portrait images, notably ImageNet. Thus, here, we have considered\ndense prediction tasks on security inspection x-ray images to evaluate our\nproposed model Segmentation Localization (SegLoc). Based upon the model\nInstance Localization (InsLoc), our model has managed to address one of the\nmost challenging downsides of contrastive learning, i.e., false negative pairs\nof query embeddings. To do so, our pre-training dataset is synthesized by\ncutting, transforming, then pasting labeled segments, as foregrounds, from an\nalready existing labeled dataset (PIDray) onto instances, as backgrounds, of an\nunlabeled dataset (SIXray;) further, we fully harness the labels through\nintegration of the notion, one queue per class, into MoCo-v2 memory bank,\navoiding false negative pairs.

We discuss\nhow, and in which sense, the phenomenon of noise-induced barren plateaus\nemerges in parameterized quantum circuits with a layered noise model. Previous\nresults have shown the existence of noise-induced barren plateaus in the\npresence of local Pauli noise [arXiv:2007.14384]. We extend these results\nanalytically to arbitrary completely-positive trace preserving maps in two\ncases: 1) when a parameter-shift rule holds, 2) when the parameterized quantum\ncircuit at each layer forms a unitary $2$-design. The second example shows how\nhighly expressive unitaries give rise not only to standard barren plateaus\n[arXiv:1803.11173], but also to noise-induced ones.

            "summary": "Aims. We aim to improve a previous model for the prediction of column\ndensities and deuterium fractions of non- and singly deuterated methanol.\nThereby, we try to identify crucial chemical and physical parameters, for which\nthe study of deuteration could provide valuable additional constraints.\n  Methods. We employed a gas-grain chemical code to devise a model that is in\nagreement with the observed column density and deuterium fraction profiles of\nthe innermost region of the pre-stellar core L1544. For that purpose, we\ndeveloped a new treatment of reactive desorption, deriving an individual\nreactive desorption efficiency for every product species in a chemical\nreaction, that depends on the reaction enthalpy and type of underlying surface.\nFurthermore, we explored several options to promote the diffusion of hydrogen\nand deuterium atoms over the surface of interstellar dust grains, in order to\nincrease methanol formation.\n  Results. Our fiducial model employs diffusion by quantum tunneling of\nhydrogen and deuterium atoms, resulting in CH$_3$OH and CH$_2$DOH column\ndensities that are approximately an order of magnitude lower than the observed\nvalues, which improves the results compared to the previous model by a factor\n10. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratio is reproduced within a factor of 1.2\nfor the centre and 1.8 for the position of the methanol peak. Given the large\nuncertainties that chemical models typically have, we consider our predictions\nto be in agreement with the observations. In general, we conclude that a\ndiffusion process with a high diffusion rate needs to be employed to obtain\nmethanol column densities that are in accordance with the observed values.\nAlso, we find that the introduction of abstraction reactions into the methanol\nformation scheme suppresses deuteration, when used in combination with a high\ndiffusion rate.",

            "summary": "The photon-blockade breakdown bistability can be intuitively explained\ninvoking the energy spectrum of the interacting qubit-mode system. Yet, the\nneoclassical solution of the driven-dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model has been\nshown to capture several key aspects of the phenomenon. In this paper, we set\nout to compare a fully quantum solution with the neo- and semi-classical\nsolutions. Although the neoclassical theory is founded on the assumption of a\npure partial state for the qubit, it is not simply the $\\gamma \\to 0$ limit of\nthe semiclassical theory; the semi- vs. neo-classical duality being a case of\nnon-commutativity of limits. Furthermore, we show that the neoclassical\npredictions still hold in case of a small qubit decay. Tracing the bistable\nbehavior for different detunings, we show that it is robust over a significant\nrange of $\\Delta$ values. We demonstrate that the aptitude of the neoclassical\ndescription is founded on the high quantum purity of the bright state of the\nphoton-blockade breakdown bistability, which sharply differentiates this\nphenomenology from conventional optical bistability. It is thereby demonstrated\nthat driven-dissipative dynamics can produce closely separable pure steady\nstates in an interacting bipartite.",

            "summary": "The wind mission Aeolus of the European Space Agency was a groundbreaking\nachievement for Earth observation. Between 2018 and 2023, the space-borne lidar\ninstrument ALADIN onboard the Aeolus satellite measured atmospheric wind\nprofiles with global coverage which contributed to improving the accuracy of\nnumerical weather prediction. The precision of the wind observations, however,\ndeclined over the course of the mission due to a progressive loss of the\natmospheric backscatter signal. The analysis of the root cause was supported by\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina whose fluorescence detector\nregistered the ultraviolet laser pulses emitted from the instrument in space,\nthereby offering an estimation of the laser energy at the exit of the\ninstrument for several days in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The reconstruction of the\nlaser beam not only allowed for an independent assessment of the Aeolus\nperformance, but also helped to improve the accuracy in the determination of\nthe laser beam's ground track on single pulse level. The results presented in\nthis paper set a precedent for the monitoring of space lasers by ground-based\ntelescopes and open new possibilities for the calibration of cosmic-ray\nobservatories.",

Although ground-based gravitational-wave detectors have successfully\nconstrained the velocity of gravitational waves in the high-frequency range,\nextending this constraint to the lower frequency range remains a challenge.

By analyzing\nthe NANOGrav 15-year data set, we obtain a well-constrained lower bound for the\nvelocity of gravitational waves that $v \\gtrsim 0.87\\,c$, where $c$ is the\nspeed of light.",

We revisit the\nrim-lamella model of Roisman et al. [\\textit{Proceedings of the Royal Society\nof London. Series A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences},\n458(2022), pp.1411-1430.]. This model comprises a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs); we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of\nthese ODEs, and derive upper and lower bounds for the maximum spreading radius.\nBoth bounds possess a $\\mathrm{We}^{1/2}$ scaling behaviour, and by a sandwich\nresult, the spreading radius itself also possesses this scaling. We demonstrate\nrigorously that the rim-lamella model is self-consistent: once a rim forms, its\nheight will invariably exceed that of the lamella. We introduce a rational\nprocedure to obtain initial conditions for the rim-lamella model. Our approach\nto solving the rim-lamella model gives predictions for the maximum droplet\nspread that are in close agreement with existing experimental studies and\ndirect numerical simulations.",

            "summary": "The multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem seeks collision-free paths for a\nteam of agents from their current positions to their pre-set goals in a known\nenvironment, and is an essential problem found at the core of many logistics,\ntransportation, and general robotics applications. Existing learning-based MAPF\napproaches typically only let each agent make decisions based on a limited\nfield-of-view (FOV) around its position, as a natural means to fix the input\ndimensions of its policy network. However, this often makes policies\nshort-sighted, since agents lack the ability to perceive and plan for\nobstacles/agents beyond their FOV. To address this challenge, we propose ALPHA,\na new framework combining the use of ground truth proximal (local) information\nand fuzzy distal (global) information to let agents sequence local decisions\nbased on the full current state of the system, and avoid such myopicity. We\nfurther allow agents to make short-term predictions about each others' paths,\nas a means to reason about each others' path intentions, thereby enhancing the\nlevel of cooperation among agents at the whole system level. Our neural\nstructure relies on a Graph Transformer architecture to allow agents to\nselectively combine these different sources of information and reason about\ntheir inter-dependencies at different spatial scales. Our simulation\nexperiments demonstrate that ALPHA outperforms both globally-guided MAPF\nsolvers and communication-learning based ones, showcasing its potential towards\nscalability in realistic deployments.",

            "summary": "Deploying an algorithmically informed policy is a significant intervention in\nthe structure of society. As is increasingly acknowledged, predictive\nalgorithms have performative effects: using them can shift the distribution of\nsocial outcomes away from the one on which the algorithms were trained.\nAlgorithmic fairness research is usually motivated by the worry that these\nperformative effects will exacerbate the structural inequalities that gave rise\nto the training data. However, standard retrospective fairness methodologies\nare ill-suited to predict these effects. They impose static fairness\nconstraints that hold after the predictive algorithm is trained, but before it\nis deployed and, therefore, before performative effects have had a chance to\nkick in. However, satisfying static fairness criteria after training is not\nsufficient to avoid exacerbating inequality after deployment. Addressing the\nfundamental worry that motivates algorithmic fairness requires explicitly\ncomparing the change in relevant structural inequalities before and after\ndeployment. We propose a prospective methodology for estimating this\npost-deployment change from pre-deployment data and knowledge about the\nalgorithmic policy.

We perform a conformal bootstrap study of $SO(5)$\ninvariant fixed points with one relevant $SO(5)$ singlet operator, which would\ncorrespond to two relevant $SU(2)\\times U(1)$ singlets, i.e. a tricritical\npoint. We find that the bootstrap bounds are saturated by four different\npredictions from the large $N$ computation of monopole operator scaling\ndimensions, which were recently shown to be very accurate even for small $N$.\nThis suggests that the Neel-VBS phase transition is described by this bootstrap\nbound, which predicts that the second relevant singlet has dimension $\\approx\n2.34$.",

One of the major dilemmas in Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nwhere an autonomous agent has to balance two contrasting needs in making its\ndecisions is: exploiting the current knowledge of the environment to maximize\nthe cumulative reward as well as exploring actions that allow improving the\nknowledge of the environment, hopefully leading to higher reward values\n(exploration-exploitation trade-off). Concurrently, another relevant issue\nregards the full observability of the states, which may not be assumed in all\napplications. Such as when only 2D images are considered as input in a RL\napproach used for finding the optimal action within a 3D simulation\nenvironment. In this work, we address these issues by deploying and testing\nseveral techniques to balance exploration and exploitation trade-off on\npartially observable systems for predicting steering wheels in autonomous\ndriving scenario. More precisely, the final aim is to investigate the effects\nof using both stochastic and deterministic multi-armed bandit strategies\ncoupled with a Deep Recurrent Q-Network. Additionally, we adapted and evaluated\nthe impact of an innovative method to improve the learning phase of the\nunderlying Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network. We aim to show that adaptive\nstochastic methods for exploration better approximate the trade-off between\nexploration and exploitation as, in general, Softmax and Max-Boltzmann\nstrategies are able to outperform epsilon-greedy techniques.",

Traffic flow data are\nspatial-temporal, which are not only correlated to spatial locations in road\nnetworks, but also vary with temporal time indices. Existing methods have\nsolved the challenges in traffic flow prediction partly, focusing on modeling\nspatial-temporal dependencies effectively, while not all intrinsic properties\nof traffic flow data are utilized fully. Besides, there are very few attempts\nat incremental learning of spatial-temporal data mining, and few previous works\ncan be easily transferred to the traffic flow prediction task. Motivated by the\nchallenge of incremental learning methods for traffic flow prediction and the\nunderutilization of intrinsic properties of road networks, we propose a\nTransport-Hub-aware Spatial-Temporal adaptive graph transFormer (H-STFormer)\nfor traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we first design a novel spatial\nself-attention module to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Three graph\nmasking matrices are integrated into spatial self-attentions to highlight both\nshort- and long-term dependences. Additionally, we employ a temporal\nself-attention module to detect dynamic temporal patterns in the traffic flow\ndata. Finally, we design an extra spatial-temporal knowledge distillation\nmodule for incremental learning of traffic flow prediction tasks. Through\nextensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of H-STFormer in normal and\nincremental traffic flow prediction tasks.

Given\na video of an ongoing procedural activity, we predict a plausible next\nprocedure step described in rich natural language. While most previous work\nfocus on the problem of data scarcity in procedural video datasets, another\ncore challenge of future anticipation is how to account for multiple plausible\nfuture realizations in natural settings. This problem has been largely\noverlooked in previous work. To address this challenge, we frame future step\nprediction as modelling the distribution of all possible candidates for the\nnext step. Specifically, we design a generative model that takes a series of\nvideo clips as input, and generates multiple plausible and diverse candidates\n(in natural language) for the next step. Following previous work, we side-step\nthe video annotation scarcity by pretraining our model on a large text-based\ncorpus of procedural activities, and then transfer the model to the video\ndomain. Our experiments, both in textual and video domains, show that our model\ncaptures diversity in the next step prediction and generates multiple plausible\nfuture predictions. Moreover, our model establishes new state-of-the-art\nresults on YouCookII, where it outperforms existing baselines on the next step\nanticipation. Finally, we also show that our model can successfully transfer\nfrom text to the video domain zero-shot, ie, without fine-tuning or adaptation,\nand produces good-quality future step predictions from video.",

Nonetheless, the current practice of ICL treats all demonstration\nexamples equally, which still warrants improvement, as the quality of examples\nis usually uneven. In this paper, we investigate how to determine approximately\noptimal weights for demonstration examples and how to apply them during ICL. To\nassess the quality of weights in the absence of additional validation data, we\ndesign a masked self-prediction (MSP) score that exhibits a strong correlation\nwith the final ICL performance. To expedite the weight-searching process, we\ndiscretize the continuous weight space and adopt beam search. With\napproximately optimal weights obtained, we further propose two strategies to\napply them to demonstrations at different model positions. Experimental results\non 8 text classification tasks show that our approach outperforms conventional\nICL by a large margin. Our code are publicly available at\nhttps:github.com/Zhe-Young/WICL.",

In the simplest case, such PDEs can be reduced to a single autonomous\nsecond order ODE with one dependent variable. For certain parameter values it\nhas been shown using perturbations methods in combination with ans\\\"{a}tze that\nnumerous such second order ODEs have analytical travelling wave solutions\ndescribed by a simple sigmoid function. However, this methodology provides no\nleverage on the problem of finding a generalised class of models possessing\nsuch analytical travelling wave solutions. The most efficient methods for both\nfinding analytical solutions and constructing classes of ODEs are based on Lie\nsymmetries which are transformations known as one parameter\n$\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ diffeomorphisms mapping solutions to other solutions.\nRecently, analytical solutions of a second order ODE encapsulating numerous\noscillatory models as well as some of the previously mentioned travelling wave\nmodels with simple analytical solutions have been found by means of a two\ndimensional Lie algebra. Based on this Lie algebra, we construct the most\ngeneral class of integrable autonomous second order ODEs for which these\nsymmetries are manifest. Moreover, we show that a sub-class of second order\nODEs has simple analytical travelling wave solutions described by a sigmoid\nfunction.

Our focus was on Track 1 of\nthe challenge, where the parameters are constrained to a maximum of 1 billion,\nand the inclusion of entity descriptions within the prompt is prohibited.\n  Although the masked language model offers sufficient flexibility to extend\nits vocabulary, it is not inherently designed for multi-token prediction. To\naddress this, we present Vocabulary Expandable BERT for knowledge base\nconstruction, which expand the language model's vocabulary while preserving\nsemantic embeddings for newly added words. We adopt task-specific\nre-pre-training on masked language model to further enhance the language model.\n  Through experimentation, the results show the effectiveness of our\napproaches. Our framework achieves F1 score of 0.323 on the hidden test set and\n0.362 on the validation set, both data set is provided by the challenge.\nNotably, our framework adopts a lightweight language model (BERT-base, 0.13\nbillion parameters) and surpasses the model using prompts directly on large\nlanguage model (Chatgpt-3, 175 billion parameters).

To this end, several\ntrajectory prediction algorithms have been presented in the existing\nliterature.

However, existing planners cannot handle the\nmulti-modality based on just sample-level information of the predictions. With\nthis motivation, this paper proposes a trajectory optimizer that can leverage\nthe distributional aspects of the prediction in a computationally tractable and\nsample-efficient manner. Our optimizer can work with arbitrarily complex\ndistributions and thus can be used with output distribution represented as a\ndeep neural network. The core of our approach is built on embedding\ndistribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which we leverage in\ntwo ways. First, we propose an RKHS embedding approach to select probable\nsamples from the obstacle trajectory distribution. Second, we rephrase\nchance-constrained optimization as distribution matching in RKHS and propose a\nnovel sampling-based optimizer for its solution.

This motivates a vendor-client paradigm, where\na vendor trains a large-scale VLM and grants only input-output access to\nclients on a pay-per-query basis in a black-box setting. The client aims to\nminimize inference cost by distilling the VLM to a student model using the\nlimited available task-specific data, and further deploying this student model\nin the downstream application. While naive distillation largely improves the\nIn-Domain (ID) accuracy of the student, it fails to transfer the superior\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of the VLM teacher using the limited\navailable labeled images. To mitigate this, we propose Vision-Language to\nVision-Align, Distill, Predict (VL2V-ADiP), which first aligns the vision and\nlanguage modalities of the teacher model with the vision modality of a\npre-trained student model, and further distills the aligned VLM embeddings to\nthe student. This maximally retains the pre-trained features of the student,\nwhile also incorporating the rich representations of the VLM image encoder and\nthe superior generalization of the text embeddings.

In the direct measurement method, we compare\nthe performance of popular international commercial temperature, conductivity,\nand depth profilers (CTD).

The traditional direct measurement\nmethod has good accuracy performance, but it usually takes a long time. The\nproposal of SSP inversion method greatly improves the convenience and\nreal--time performance, but the accuracy is not as good as the direct\nmeasurement method. Currently, the SSP inversion relies on sonar observation\ndata, making it difficult to apply to areas that couldn't be covered by\nunderwater observation systems, and these methods are unable to predict the\ndistribution of sound velocity at future times.

Additionally, we see how the properties of\nthese simulated observations are interpreted through the use of traditional 1D\nprominence modelling.\n  Methods: We used a cylindrical non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) 2D\ncomplete redistribution (CRD) code to generate a set of cylindrical prominence\nstrands, which we stacked behind each other to produce complex line profiles.\nThen, with the use of the point spread functions (PSFs) of IRIS, we were able\nto predict how IRIS would observe these line profiles. We then used the 1D NLTE\ncode PROM in combination with the Cross Root Mean Square method (xRMS) to find\nthe properties recovered by traditional 1D prominence modelling.\n  Results: Velocities of magnitude lower than 10 km/s are sufficient to produce\nasymmetries in the Mgii h&k lines. However, convolution of these with the PSFs\nof IRIS obscures this detail and returns standard looking single peaks. By\nincreasing the velocities by a factor of three, we recover asymmetric profiles\neven after this convolution. The properties recovered by xRMS appear adequate\nat first, but the line profiles chosen to fit these profiles do not\nsatisfactorily represent the line profiles. This is likely due to the large\nline width of the simulated profiles.\n  Conclusions: Asymmetries can be introduced by multithread models with\nindependent Doppler velocities. The large line width created by these models\nmakes it difficult for traditional 1D forward modelling to find good matches.\nThis may also demonstrate degeneracies in the solution recovered by\nsingle-species 1D modelling.",

A major challenge for realizing high performance sensing in PMNs is how\nto deal with spatially separated asynchronous transceivers. Asynchronicity\nresults in timing offsets (TOs) and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs), which\nfurther cause ambiguity in ranging and velocity sensing. Most existing\nalgorithms mitigate TOs and CFOs based on the line-of-sight (LOS) propagation\npath between sensing transceivers. However, LOS paths may not exist in\nrealistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a cooperation based joint active\nand passive sensing scheme for the non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios having asynchronous\ntransceivers. This scheme relies on the cross-correlation cooperative sensing\n(CCCS) algorithm, which regards active sensing as a reference and mitigates TOs\nand CFOs by correlating active and passive sensing information. Another major\nchallenge for realizing high performance sensing in PMNs is how to realize high\naccuracy angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation with low complexity.\nCorrespondingly, we propose a low complexity AoA algorithm based on cooperative\nsensing, which comprises coarse AoA estimation and fine AoA estimation.\nAnalytical and numerical simulation results verify the performance advantages\nof the proposed CCCS algorithm and the low complexity AoA estimation algorithm.",

Currently many multi-legged robots, such\nas Boston Dynamic's Spot robot, have preset gaits for different surface types,\nbut struggle over terrains where the surface type changes frequently. Being\nable to automatically detect changes within an environment would allow a robot\nto autonomously adjust its method of locomotion to better suit conditions,\nwithout requiring a human user to manually set the change in surface type. In\nthis paper we report on the first detailed investigation of the properties of a\nparticular bio-inspired tactile sensor, the TacTip, to test its suitability for\nthis kind of automatic detection of surface conditions. We explored different\nprocessing techniques and a regression model, using a custom made rig for data\ncollection to determine how a robot could sense directional and general force\non the sensor in a variety of conditions. This allowed us to successfully\ndemonstrate how the sensor can be used to distinguish between soft, hard, dry\nand (wet) slippery surfaces. We further explored a neural model to classify\nspecific surface textures. Pin movement (the movement of optical markers within\nthe sensor) was key to sensing this information, and all models relied on some\nform of temporal information. Our final trained models could successfully\ndetermine the direction the sensor is heading in, the amount of force acting on\nit, and determine differences in the surface texture such as Lego vs smooth\nhard surface, or concrete vs smooth hard surface.",

Efforts to automate\ntext classification processes for social science research purposes have so far\nachieved remarkable results, but there is still a large room for progress. In\nthis work, we test the prediction performance of an alternative strategy, which\nrequires human involvement much less than full manual coding. We use the GPT\n3.5 and GPT 4 models of the OpenAI, which are pre-trained instruction-tuned\nLarge Language Models (LLM), to classify congressional bills and congressional\nhearings into Comparative Agendas Project's 21 major policy issue topics. We\npropose three use-case scenarios and estimate overall accuracies ranging from\n%58-83 depending on scenario and GPT model employed. The three scenarios aims\nat minimal, moderate, and major human interference, respectively. Overall, our\nresults point towards the insufficiency of complete reliance on GPT with\nminimal human intervention, an increasing accuracy along with the human effort\nexerted, and a surprisingly high accuracy achieved in the most humanly\ndemanding use-case. However, the superior use-case achieved the %83 accuracy on\nthe %65 of the data in which the two models agreed, suggesting that a similar\napproach to ours can be relatively easily implemented and allow for mostly\nautomated coding of a majority of a given dataset. This could free up resources\nallowing manual human coding of the remaining %35 of the data to achieve an\noverall higher level of accuracy while reducing costs significantly.",

            "summary": "Given an image and an associated textual question, the purpose of\nKnowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) is to provide a correct\nanswer to the question with the aid of external knowledge bases. Prior KB-VQA\nmodels are usually formulated as a retriever-classifier framework, where a\npre-trained retriever extracts textual or visual information from knowledge\ngraphs and then makes a prediction among the candidates. Despite promising\nprogress, there are two drawbacks with existing models. Firstly, modeling\nquestion-answering as multi-class classification limits the answer space to a\npreset corpus and lacks the ability of flexible reasoning. Secondly, the\nclassifier merely consider \"what is the answer\" without \"how to get the\nanswer\", which cannot ground the answer to explicit reasoning paths. In this\npaper, we confront the challenge of \\emph{explainable open-set} KB-VQA, where\nthe system is required to answer questions with entities at wild and retain an\nexplainable reasoning path. To resolve the aforementioned issues, we propose a\nnew retriever-ranker paradigm of KB-VQA, Graph pATH rankER (GATHER for\nbrevity). Specifically, it contains graph constructing, pruning, and path-level\nranking, which not only retrieves accurate answers but also provides inference\npaths that explain the reasoning process. To comprehensively evaluate our\nmodel, we reformulate the benchmark dataset OK-VQA with manually corrected\nentity-level annotations and release it as ConceptVQA. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world questions demonstrate that our framework is not only able to perform\nopen-set question answering across the whole knowledge base but provide\nexplicit reasoning path.",

In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale\nSpatial-Temporal Recurrent Network for traffic flow prediction, namely MSSTRN,\nwhich consists of two different recurrent neural networks: the single-step gate\nrecurrent unit and the multi-step gate recurrent unit to fully capture the\ncomplex spatial-temporal information in the traffic data under different time\nwindows. Moreover, we propose a spatial-temporal synchronous attention\nmechanism that integrates adaptive position graph convolutions into the\nself-attention mechanism to achieve synchronous capture of spatial-temporal\ndependencies.

In\nthis paper, we formulate the novel problem of counterfactual generation for\ntime series forecasting, and propose an algorithm, called ForecastCF, that\nsolves the problem by applying gradient-based perturbations to the original\ntime series. ForecastCF guides the perturbations by applying constraints to the\nforecasted values to obtain desired prediction outcomes.

            "summary": "Quintessence models have been widely examined in the context of\nscalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a subclass of Horndeski's theory, and were\nproposed as viable candidates for Dark Energy. However, the relatively recent\nobservational constraints on the speed of gravitational waves $c_{\\textrm{GW}}$\nhave resulted in many of those models being ruled out because they predict\n$c_{\\textrm{GW}} \\neq c$ generally. While these were formulated in the metric\nformalism of gravity, it was found later that some Horndeski models could be\nrescued in the Palatini formalism, where the connection is independent of the\nmetric and the underlying geometry no longer corresponds to the\npseudo-Riemannian one. Motivated by this and the relation between\nscalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Horndeski's theory, we put forward a new\nquintessence model with the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet action but in Weyl geometry. We\nfind the fixed points of the dynamical system under some assumptions and\ndetermine their stability via linear analysis. Although the past evolution of\nthe Universe as we know it is correctly reproduced, the constraints on\n$c_{\\textrm{GW}}$ are shown to be grossly violated for the coupling function\nunder consideration. The case of $c_{\\textrm{GW}} = c$ is regarded also, but no\nevolution consistent with other cosmological observations is obtained.",

            "summary": "Reliable detection and tracking of surrounding objects are indispensable for\ncomprehensive motion prediction and planning of autonomous vehicles. Due to the\nlimitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is\nrequired to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust\nmotion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and\nimproving state estimation accuracy. The reliability of the autonomous vehicle\nsoftware becomes even more relevant in complex, adversarial high-speed\nscenarios at the vehicle handling limits in autonomous racing. In this paper,\nwe present a modular multi-modal sensor fusion and tracking method for\nhigh-speed applications. The method is based on the Extended Kalman Filter\n(EKF) and is capable of fusing heterogeneous detection inputs to track\nsurrounding objects consistently. A novel delay compensation approach enables\nto reduce the influence of the perception software latency and to output an\nupdated object list. It is the first fusion and tracking method validated in\nhigh-speed real-world scenarios at the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and the\nAutonomous Challenge at CES (AC@CES) 2022, proving its robustness and\ncomputational efficiency on embedded systems. It does not require any labeled\ndata and achieves position tracking residuals below 0.1 m. The related code is\navailable as open-source software at https://github.com/TUMFTM/FusionTracking.",

            "summary": "Text entry is an essential task in our day-to-day digital interactions.\nNumerous intelligent features have been developed to streamline this process,\nmaking text entry more effective, efficient, and fluid. These improvements\ninclude sentence prediction and user personalization. However, as deep\nlearning-based language models become the norm for these advanced features, the\nnecessity for data collection and model fine-tuning increases. These challenges\ncan be mitigated by harnessing the in-context learning capability of large\nlanguage models such as GPT-3.5. This unique feature allows the language model\nto acquire new skills through prompts, eliminating the need for data collection\nand fine-tuning. Consequently, large language models can learn various text\nprediction techniques. We initially showed that, for a sentence prediction\ntask, merely prompting GPT-3.5 surpassed a GPT-2 backed system and is\ncomparable with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, with the latter two methods\nrequiring costly data collection, fine-tuning and post-processing. However, the\ntask of prompting large language models to specialize in specific text\nprediction tasks can be challenging, particularly for designers without\nexpertise in prompt engineering. To address this, we introduce Promptor, a\nconversational prompt generation agent designed to engage proactively with\ndesigners. Promptor can automatically generate complex prompts tailored to meet\nspecific needs, thus offering a solution to this challenge. We conducted a user\nstudy involving 24 participants creating prompts for three intelligent text\nentry tasks, half of the participants used Promptor while the other half\ndesigned prompts themselves. The results show that Promptor-designed prompts\nresult in a 35% increase in similarity and 22% in coherence over those by\ndesigners.",

The presence of zeroes\naffects the models' learning and may result in poor performance. Furthermore,\nzeroes also distort the metrics used to compute the model's prediction quality.\nThis paper showcases two real-world use cases (home appliances classification\nand airport shuttle demand prediction) where a hierarchical model applied in\nthe context of zero-inflated data leads to excellent results. In particular,\nfor home appliances classification, the weighted average of Precision, Recall,\nF1, and AUC ROC was increased by 27%, 34%, 49%, and 27%, respectively.\nFurthermore, it is estimated that the proposed approach is also four times more\nenergy efficient than the SOTA approach against which it was compared to.\nTwo-fold models performed best in all cases when predicting airport shuttle\ndemand, and the difference against other models has been proven to be\nstatistically significant.",

The shell expansion seemed to be halted by an\nobstacle located to the northeast of VLA2. Here we present our findings from\nobserving the 1.3 mm continuum and H$_2$CO and SiO emission lines. Within a\nregion of $\\sim 30\"$ ($\\sim 39,000$ au) diameter, we have detected 40 compact\nmm-continuum sources, three of them coinciding with VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3. While\nthe H$_2$CO emission is mainly distributed in a fragmented structure around the\nthree massive protostars, but without any of the main H$_2$CO clumps spatially\ncoinciding with them, the SiO is highly concentrated on VLA2, indicating the\npresence of very strong shocks generated near this protostar. The SiO emission\nis clearly resolved into an elongated structure ($\\sim 0.6\"\\times0.3\"$; $\\sim\n780$ au$\\times$390 au) perpendicular to the major axis of the wind-driven maser\nshell. The structure and kinematics of the SiO emission are consistent with a\ntoroid and a wide-angle outflow surrounding a central mass of $\\sim 10$\nM$_{\\odot}$, thus supporting previous theoretical predictions regarding the\nevolution of the outflow.

However,\ndue to a lack of structure supervision on regions of interest (ROIs), existing\nscribble-based methods suffer from poor boundary localization. Furthermore,\nmost current methods are designed for 2D image segmentation, which do not fully\nleverage the volumetric information if directly applied to each image slice. In\nthis paper, we propose a scribble-based volumetric image segmentation,\nScribble2D5, which tackles 3D anisotropic image segmentation and aims to its\nimprove boundary prediction. To achieve this, we augment a 2.5D attention UNet\nwith a proposed label propagation module to extend semantic information from\nscribbles and use a combination of static and active boundary prediction to\nlearn ROI's boundary and regularize its shape. Also, we propose an optional\nadd-on component, which incorporates the shape prior information from unpaired\nsegmentation masks to further improve model accuracy. Extensive experiments on\nthree public datasets and one private dataset demonstrate our Scribble2D5\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on volumetric image segmentation using\nscribbles and shape prior if available.",

            "summary": "Despite the great progress of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with the\ndeep neural networks, current UDA models are opaque and cannot provide\npromising explanations, limiting their applications in the scenarios that\nrequire safe and controllable model decisions. At present, a surge of work\nfocuses on designing deep interpretable methods with adequate data annotations\nand only a few methods consider the distributional shift problem. Most existing\ninterpretable UDA methods are post-hoc ones, which cannot facilitate the model\nlearning process for performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose an\ninherently interpretable method, named Transferable Conceptual Prototype\nLearning (TCPL), which could simultaneously interpret and improve the processes\nof knowledge transfer and decision-making in UDA. To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a hierarchically prototypical module that transfers categorical basic\nconcepts from the source domain to the target domain and learns domain-shared\nprototypes for explaining the underlying reasoning process. With the learned\ntransferable prototypes, a self-predictive consistent pseudo-label strategy\nthat fuses confidence, predictions, and prototype information, is designed for\nselecting suitable target samples for pseudo annotations and gradually\nnarrowing down the domain gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed\nmethod can not only provide effective and intuitive explanations but also\noutperform previous state-of-the-arts.",

Thus,\nunderstanding the dynamics of disease spread in the wildlife-livestock\ninterface is crucial for mitigating these risks of transmission. Specifically,\nthe interactions between pigeons and in-door cows at dairy farms can lead to\nsignificant disease transmission and economic losses for farmers; putting\nlivestock, adjacent human populations, and other wildlife species at risk. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal multi-pathogen model with\ncontinuous spatial movement. The model expands on the\nSusceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) framework and accounts for\nboth within-species and cross-species transmission of pathogens, as well as the\nexploration-exploitation movement dynamics of pigeons, which play a critical\nrole in the spread of infection agents. In addition to model formulation, we\nalso implement it as an agent-based simulation approach and use empirical field\ndata to investigate different biologically realistic scenarios, evaluating the\neffect of various parameters on the epidemic spread. Namely, in agreement with\ntheoretical expectations, the model predicts that the heterogeneity of the\npigeons' movement dynamics can drastically affect both the magnitude and\nstability of outbreaks. In addition, joint infection by multiple pathogens can\nhave an interactive effect unobservable in single-pathogen SIR models,\nreflecting a non-intuitive inhibition of the outbreak. Our findings highlight\nthe impact of heterogeneity in host behavior on their pathogens and allow\nrealistic predictions of outbreak dynamics in the multi-pathogen\nwildlife-livestock interface with consequences to zoonotic diseases in various\nsystems.",

In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential\ncontrol (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the\ncontrol objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC\nproblem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we\ndevelop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation.\nThis approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and\noffers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We\nevaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in\ndifferent scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based\nMPC.

Whereas synthetic samples are often generated based on\nfeatures extracted from training data, rendering them less effective when the\ntraining and OoD data are highly overlapped in the feature space. In this work,\nwe propose a Wasserstein-score-based generative adversarial training scheme to\nenhance OoD detection accuracy, which, for the first time, performs data\naugmentation and exploration simultaneously under the supervision of limited\nOoD samples. Specifically, the generator explores OoD spaces and generates\nsynthetic OoD samples using feedback from the discriminator, while the\ndiscriminator exploits both the observed and synthesized samples for OoD\ndetection using a predefined Wasserstein score. We provide theoretical\nguarantees that the optimal solutions of our generative scheme are\nstatistically achievable through adversarial training in empirical settings.

            "summary": "Height estimation has long been a pivotal topic within measurement and remote\nsensing disciplines, proving critical for endeavours such as 3D urban\nmodelling, MR and autonomous driving. Traditional methods utilise stereo\nmatching or multisensor fusion, both well-established techniques that typically\nnecessitate multiple images from varying perspectives and adjunct sensors like\nSAR, leading to substantial deployment costs. Single image height estimation\nhas emerged as an attractive alternative, boasting a larger data source variety\nand simpler deployment. However, current methods suffer from limitations such\nas fixed receptive fields, a lack of global information interaction, leading to\nnoticeable instance-level height deviations. The inherent complexity of height\nprediction can result in a blurry estimation of object edge depth when using\nmainstream regression methods based on fixed height division. This paper\npresents a comprehensive solution for monocular height estimation in remote\nsensing, termed HeightFormer, combining multilevel interactions and\nimage-adaptive classification-regression. It features the Multilevel\nInteraction Backbone (MIB) and Image-adaptive Classification-regression Height\nGenerator (ICG). MIB supplements the fixed sample grid in CNN of the\nconventional backbone network with tokens of different interaction ranges. It\nis complemented by a pixel-, patch-, and feature map-level hierarchical\ninteraction mechanism, designed to relay spatial geometry information across\ndifferent scales and introducing a global receptive field to enhance the\nquality of instance-level height estimation. The ICG dynamically generates\nheight partition for each image and reframes the traditional regression task,\nusing a refinement from coarse to fine classification-regression that\nsignificantly mitigates the innate ill-posedness issue and drastically improves\nedge sharpness.",

We observe a plateau at magnetization 1/9 Bohr magneton per\nmagnetic ion (Cu). Furthermore, in the vicinity of this plateau we observe sets\nof strong oscillations in the magnetic torque, reminiscent of quantum\noscillations in metals. Such oscillations have never been seen in a wide gap\ninsulator and point to an exotic origin. While the temperature dependence of\nthese oscillations follows Fermi-liquid-theory predictions, they are\napproximately periodic in the magnetic field $H$, as opposed to $1/H$ in\nconventional metals. Furthermore, a strong angular dependence is observed for\nthe period, which indicates an orbital origin for this effect. We show that the\n1/9 plateau and the associated oscillations are consistent with the appearance\nof a quantum-spin-liquid state whose excitations are fermionic spinons that\nobey a Dirac spectrum. The oscillations are in response to an emergent gauge\nfield. Our results provide strong evidence that fractionalized particles\ncoupled to the elusive emergent gauge field have been observed.",

However, they have yet to demonstrate advanced\napplications in natural science. Here we show how large language models can\nperform scientific synthesis, inference, and explanation. We present a method\nfor using general-purpose large language models to make inferences from\nscientific datasets of the form usually associated with special-purpose machine\nlearning algorithms.

When a conventional\nmachine learning system is augmented with this synthesized and inferred\nknowledge it can outperform the current state of the art across a range of\nbenchmark tasks for predicting molecular properties.

            "summary": "Across a wide array of disciplines, many researchers use machine learning\n(ML) algorithms to identify a subgroup of individuals, called exceptional\nresponders, who are likely to be helped by a treatment the most. A common\napproach consists of two steps. One first estimates the conditional average\ntreatment effect or its proxy using an ML algorithm. They then determine the\ncutoff of the resulting treatment prioritization score to select those\npredicted to benefit most from the treatment. Unfortunately, these estimated\ntreatment prioritization scores are often biased and noisy. Furthermore,\nutilizing the same data to both choose a cutoff value and estimate the average\ntreatment effect among the selected individuals suffer from a multiple testing\nproblem. To address these challenges, we develop a uniform confidence band for\nexperimentally evaluating the sorted average treatment effect (GATES) among the\nindividuals whose treatment prioritization score is at least as high as any\ngiven quantile value, regardless of how the quantile is chosen. This provides a\nstatistical guarantee that the GATES for the selected subgroup exceeds a\ncertain threshold. The validity of the proposed methodology depends solely on\nrandomization of treatment and random sampling of units without requiring\nmodeling assumptions or resampling methods. This widens its applicability\nincluding a wide range of other causal quantities. A simulation study shows\nthat the empirical coverage of the proposed uniform confidence bands is close\nto the nominal coverage when the sample is as small as 100. We analyze a\nclinical trial of late-stage prostate cancer and find a relatively large\nproportion of exceptional responders with a statistical performance guarantee.",

We illuminate the fine-grained\nrelationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship\nbetween diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual\ninformation and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the\ndenoising model. Furthermore, pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as\nwell, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific\nimages and captions.

            "summary": "Deep learning vulnerability detection has shown promising results in recent\nyears. However, an important challenge that still blocks it from being very\nuseful in practice is that the model is not robust under perturbation and it\ncannot generalize well over the out-of-distribution (OOD) data, e.g., applying\na trained model to unseen projects in real world. We hypothesize that this is\nbecause the model learned non-robust features, e.g., variable names, that have\nspurious correlations with labels. When the perturbed and OOD datasets no\nlonger have the same spurious features, the model prediction fails. To address\nthe challenge, in this paper, we introduced causality into deep learning\nvulnerability detection. Our approach CausalVul consists of two phases. First,\nwe designed novel perturbations to discover spurious features that the model\nmay use to make predictions. Second, we applied the causal learning algorithms,\nspecifically, do-calculus, on top of existing deep learning models to\nsystematically remove the use of spurious features and thus promote causal\nbased prediction. Our results show that CausalVul consistently improved the\nmodel accuracy, robustness and OOD performance for all the state-of-the-art\nmodels and datasets we experimented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work that introduces do calculus based causal learning to software\nengineering models and shows it's indeed useful for improving the model\naccuracy, robustness and generalization.

To address this limitation, Liu and Lee\n(2017) proposed a Black-Box Importance Sampling (BBIS) algorithm that computes\nthe importance weights for arbitrary simulated samples by minimizing the\nkernelized Stein discrepancy. However, this requires knowing the score function\nof the target distribution, which is not easy to compute for many Bayesian\nproblems. Hence, in this paper we propose another novel BBIS algorithm using\nminimum energy design, BBIS-MED, that requires only the unnormalized density\nfunction, which can be utilized as a post-processing step to improve the\nquality of Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples.

These bounds are achieved by our Li-Yau type and Harnack\nestimates for weighted Ricci potential functions of the K\\\"ahler-Ricci flow. We\nfurther prove that the Type I blow-ups of the finite time solution always\nsub-converge in Gromov-Hausdorff sense to an ancient solution on a family of\nanalytic normal varieties with suitable choices of base points. As a\nconsequence, the Type I diameter bound is proved for almost every fibre of\ncollapsing solutions of the K\\\"ahler-Ricci flow on a Fano fibre bundle. We also\napply our estimates to show that every solution of the K\\\"ahler-Ricci flow with\nCalabi symmetry must develop Type I singularities, including both cases of high\ncodimensional contractions and fibre collapsing.",

            "summary": "Mathematical models describing the spatial spreading and invasion of\npopulations of biological cells are often developed in a continuum modelling\nframework using reaction-diffusion equations. While continuum models based on\nlinear diffusion are routinely employed and known to capture key experimental\nobservations, linear diffusion fails to predict well-defined sharp fronts that\nare often observed experimentally. This observation has motivated the use of\nnonlinear degenerate diffusion, however these nonlinear models and the\nassociated parameters lack a clear biological motivation and interpretation.\nHere we take a different approach by developing a stochastic discrete\nlattice-based model incorporating biologically-inspired mechanisms and then\nderiving the reaction-diffusion continuum limit. Inspired by experimental\nobservations, agents in the simulation deposit extracellular material, that we\ncall a substrate, locally onto the lattice, and the motility of agents is taken\nto be proportional to the substrate density. Discrete simulations that mimic a\ntwo--dimensional circular barrier assay illustrate how the discrete model\nsupports both smooth and sharp-fronted density profiles depending on the rate\nof substrate deposition. Coarse-graining the discrete model leads to a novel\npartial differential equation (PDE) model whose solution accurately\napproximates averaged data from the discrete model. The new discrete model and\nPDE approximation provides a simple, biologically motivated framework for\nmodelling the spreading, growth and invasion of cell populations with\nwell-defined sharp fronts",

We analytically integrated two-, three-, four- and\nfive-particle final-state matrix elements for the decay of a virtual photon and\na Higgs boson into partons, considering up to third-order corrections in the\nstrong coupling constant $\\alpha_s$. The integration over the inclusive phase\nspace is performed relying on well-established reverse unitarity and IBP\nreduction techniques.

Since robots will rely on raw perceptual inputs like\nRGB images, their rewards will inevitably use visual representations. Recently\nthere has been excitement in using representations from pre-trained visual\nmodels, but key to making these work in robotics is fine-tuning, which is\ntypically done via proxy tasks like dynamics prediction or enforcing temporal\ncycle-consistency. However, all these proxy tasks bypass the human's input on\nwhat matters to them, exacerbating spurious correlations and ultimately leading\nto robot behaviors that are misaligned with user preferences. In this work, we\npropose that robots should leverage human feedback to align their visual\nrepresentations with the end-user and disentangle what matters for the task. We\npropose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), a method for\nsolving the visual representation alignment problem and visual reward learning\nproblem through the lens of preference-based learning and optimal transport.\nAcross experiments in X-MAGICAL and in robotic manipulation, we find that\nRAPL's reward consistently generates preferred robot behaviors with high sample\nefficiency, and shows strong zero-shot generalization when the visual\nrepresentation is learned from a different embodiment than the robot's.",

Moreover, a model can be\ntrained on a lower compute budget without compromising performance if a dataset\ncan be stripped of its redundancies. Coreset selection (or data pruning) seeks\nto select a subset of the training data so as to maximize the performance of\nmodels trained on this subset, also referred to as coreset. There are two\ndominant approaches: (1) geometry-based data selection for maximizing data\ndiversity in the coreset, and (2) functions that assign difficulty scores to\nsamples based on training dynamics. Optimizing for data diversity leads to a\ncoreset that is biased towards easier samples, whereas, selection by difficulty\nranking omits easy samples that are necessary for the training of deep learning\nmodels. This demonstrates that data diversity and importance scores are two\ncomplementary factors that need to be jointly considered during coreset\nselection. We represent a dataset as an undirected graph and propose a novel\npruning algorithm, D2 Pruning, that uses forward and reverse message passing\nover this dataset graph for coreset selection. D2 Pruning updates the\ndifficulty scores of each example by incorporating the difficulty of its\nneighboring examples in the dataset graph. Then, these updated difficulty\nscores direct a graph-based sampling method to select a coreset that\nencapsulates both diverse and difficult regions of the dataset space. We\nevaluate supervised and self-supervised versions of our method on various\nvision and language datasets. Results show that D2 Pruning improves coreset\nselection over previous state-of-the-art methods for up to 70% pruning rates.\nAdditionally, we find that using D2 Pruning for filtering large multimodal\ndatasets leads to increased diversity in the dataset and improved\ngeneralization of pretrained models.",

This suggests that corrugations and mechanical\ndefects in graphene are the cause of finite experimentally measurable magnetic\nsusceptibility. Furthermore, a mechanical effect is also found due to an\nelectronic contribution, which produces a pseudo-de Haas van Alphen (dHvA)\neffect.

            "summary": "Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision\npolicies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing\na tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits\ndata-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit\nmedical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of\ndecision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors.\nFundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they\nrepresent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact\nhuman decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual\ninformation. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which\nre-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task\nlearning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of\ncontext-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear\nobservation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models\n$\\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. CPR is\ncompatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments,\nand can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or\ninterpretable decision model. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and\nreal data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of\npredicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\\%$ AUROC vs.\nprevious SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients\n($+7.7\\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement in predictive\nperformance, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box\nmethods for policy learning, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis\nof context-specific decision models.",

            "summary": "Random walks on graphs are a fundamental concept in graph theory and play a\ncrucial role in solving a wide range of theoretical and applied problems in\ndiscrete math, probability, theoretical computer science, network science, and\nmachine learning. The connection between Markov chains on graphs and their\ngeometric and topological structures is the main reason why such a wide range\nof theoretical and practical applications exist. Graph connectedness ensures\nirreducibility of a Markov chain. The convergence rate to the stationary\ndistribution is determined by the spectrum of the graph Laplacian which is\nassociated with lower bounds on graph curvature. Furthermore, walks on graphs\nare used to infer structural properties of underlying manifolds in data\nanalysis and manifold learning. However, an important question remains: can\nsimilar connections be established between Markov chains on simplicial\ncomplexes and the topology, geometry, and spectral properties of complexes?\nAdditionally, can we gain topological, geometric, or analytic information about\na manifold by defining appropriate Markov chains on its triangulations? These\nquestions are not only theoretically important but answers to them provide\npowerful tools for the analysis of complex networks that go beyond the analysis\nof pairwise interactions. In this paper, we provide an integrated overview of\nthe existing results on random walks on simplicial complexes, using the novel\nperspective of signed graphs. This perspective sheds light on previously\nunknown aspects such as irreducibility conditions. We show that while up-walks\non higher dimensional simplexes can never be irreducible, the down walks become\nirreducible if and only if the complex is orientable. We believe that this new\nintegrated perspective can be extended beyond discrete structures and enables\nexploration of classical problems for triangulable manifolds.",

Total energy optimization and dynamic stability\ncalculations reveal that the thinnest possible crystal structure is a\ndouble-layered structure consisting of alternating layers formed by trigonal\narrangements of Cd atoms. Excessive softening of optical phonons occurs as a\nresult of structural relaxation when going from a bulk to a single layer (SL)\nstructure. It is also shown that thinnest structure obtained from bulk Cd\ncrystals maintains its metallic feature despite the dimensional crossover. In\naddition, it is predicted through calculations that the SL Cd crystal strongly\ninteracts with oxygen and that the oxidized regions even undergo chemical\ntransformation to form the CdO crystal. In the double-layer CdO crystal\nresulting from the oxidation of individual Cd layers, the layers are connected\nto each other with strong covalent bonds, and this structure is a semiconductor\nwith a band gap of 2.10 eV. While the robust metallic structure of the thinnest\npossible Cd crystal provides flexibility in terms of its use in nanoscale\napplications, on the other hand, the fact that its electronic properties can be\nchanged by oxidation is important for optoelectronic device applications.",

We evaluate our method using\nsynthetic data and field data acquired in the Aquistore project. In the\nsynthetic experiments, we simulate time-lapse noise by incorporating random\nnear-surface effects in the elastic properties of the subsurface model. We\ntrain our neural networks exclusively on pre-injection seismic images and\nsubsequently predict CO2 locations from post-injection seismic images. In the\nfield data analysis from Aquistore, the images from pre-injection surveys are\nutilized to train the neural networks with the characteristics of time-lapse\nnoise, followed by identifying CO2 plumes within two post-injection surveys.\nThe outcomes demonstrate the improved accuracy achieved by the DeepNRMS,\neffectively addressing the strong time-lapse noise.",

            "summary": "Station keeping is an essential maneuver for Autonomous Surface Vehicles\n(ASVs), mainly when used in confined spaces, to carry out surveys that require\nthe ASV to keep its position or in collaboration with other vehicles where the\nrelative position has an impact over the mission. However, this maneuver can\nbecome challenging for classic feedback controllers due to the need for an\naccurate model of the ASV dynamics and the environmental disturbances. This\nwork proposes a Model Predictive Controller using Neural Network Simulation\nError Minimization (NNSEM-MPC) to accurately predict the dynamics of the ASV\nunder wind disturbances. The performance of the proposed scheme under wind\ndisturbances is tested and compared against other controllers in simulation,\nusing the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and the multipurpose simulation\nenvironment Gazebo. A set of six tests were conducted by combining two wind\nspeeds (3 m/s and 6 m/s) and three wind directions (0$^\\circ$, 90$^\\circ$, and\n180$^\\circ$). The simulation results clearly show the advantage of the\nNNSEM-MPC over the following methods: backstepping controller, sliding mode\ncontroller, simplified dynamics MPC (SD-MPC), neural ordinary differential\nequation MPC (NODE-MPC), and knowledge-based NODE MPC (KNODE-MPC). The proposed\nNNSEM-MPC approach performs better than the rest in 4 out of the 6 test\nconditions, and it is the second best in the 2 remaining test cases, reducing\nthe mean position and heading error by at least 31\\% and 46\\% respectively\nacross all the test cases. In terms of execution speed, the proposed NNSEM-MPC\nis at least 36\\% faster than the rest of the MPC controllers. The field\nexperiments on two different ASV platforms showed that ASVs can effectively\nkeep the station utilizing the proposed method, with a position error as low as\n$1.68$ m and a heading error as low as $6.14^{\\circ}$ within time windows of at\nleast $150$s.",

We discuss implications for theories of equilibrium selection in\ninformation transmission games, for work on emerging communication among\nalgorithms in computer science, and for the economics of collusions in markets\npopulated by artificially intelligent agents.",

Peebles pointed out that the brightest extra-galactic radio sources tend\nto be aligned with the plane of the de Vaucouleur Local Supercluster up to\nredshifts of $z=0.02$ ($d_{\\rm MW}\\approx 85~\\rm{Mpc}$). He then asked whether\nsuch an alignment of clusters is anomalous in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nframework. In this letter, we define an alternative, absolute orientation\nagnostic, measure of the anisotropy of these brightest sources and use a large\ncosmological simulation to measure how common such an alignment of structures\nis. We find that only 3.5% of randomly selected regions display an anisotropy\nof their clusters more extreme than the one found in the local Universe's radio\ndata. This sets the region around the Milky Way as a $1.85\\sigma$ outlier.\nVarying the selection parameters of the objects in the catalogue, we find that\nthe clusters in the local volume are never more than $2\\sigma$ away from the\nsimulations' prediction for the same selection. We thus conclude that the\nreported anisotropy, whilst note-worthy, is not in tension with the\n$\\Lambda$CDM paradigm.",

As researchers and\ndomain scientists seek to unify and consolidate chemical knowledge, the case\nfor models with potential to generalize across different tasks within materials\nscience - so-called \"foundation models\" - grows with ambitions. This manuscript\nreviews our recent progress with development of Open MatSci ML Toolkit, and\ndetails experiments that lay the groundwork for foundation model research and\ndevelopment with our framework. First, we describe and characterize a new\npretraining task that uses synthetic data generated from symmetry operations,\nand reveal complex training dynamics at large scales. Using the pretrained\nmodel, we discuss a number of use cases relevant to foundation model\ndevelopment: semantic architecture of datasets, and fine-tuning for property\nprediction and classification. Our key results show that for simple\napplications, pretraining appears to provide worse modeling performance than\ntraining models from random initialization. However, for more complex\ninstances, such as when a model is required to learn across multiple datasets\nand types of targets simultaneously, the inductive bias from pretraining\nprovides significantly better performance. This insight will hopefully inform\nsubsequent efforts into creating foundation models for materials science\napplications.",

Instead, ideally, we\nwould want to have local coverage guarantees that hold for each possible value\nof the test point's features. While the impossibility of achieving pointwise\nlocal coverage is well established in the literature, many variants of\nconformal prediction algorithm show favorable local coverage properties\nempirically. Relaxing the definition of local coverage can allow for a\ntheoretical understanding of this empirical phenomenon. We aim to bridge this\ngap between theoretical validation and empirical performance by proving\nachievable and interpretable guarantees for a relaxed notion of local coverage.\nBuilding on the localized CP method of Guan (2023) and the weighted CP\nframework of Tibshirani et al. (2019), we propose a new method,\nrandomly-localized conformal prediction (RLCP), which returns prediction\nintervals that are not only marginally valid but also achieve a relaxed local\ncoverage guarantee and guarantees under covariate shift. Through a series of\nsimulations and real data experiments, we validate these coverage guarantees of\nRLCP while comparing it with the other local conformal prediction methods.",

Such transitive dependencies, which often amount to a\ngreater number than direct dependencies, can become infected with\nvulnerabilities and put software projects at risk. To mitigate this risk,\nPractitioners need to select dependencies that respond quickly to\nvulnerabilities to prevent the propagation of vulnerable code to their project.\nTo identify such dependencies, we analyze more than 450 vulnerabilities in the\nnpm ecosystem to understand why dependent packages remain vulnerable. We\nidentify over 200,000 npm packages that are infected through their dependencies\nand use 9 features to build a prediction model that identifies packages that\nquickly adopt the vulnerability fix and prevent further propagation of\nvulnerabilities.

However, this theoretical picture neglects both the dynamics of,\nand the elasticity-induced long-ranged interactions between, the mesoscopic\nmaterial constituents. Here, we address these two aspects and provide a unified\ntheory building on the H\\'ebraud-Lequeux elastoplastic description. The first\naspect is crucial to understanding the competition between the imposed\ndeformation rate and the finite timescale of plastic rearrangements: we provide\na dynamical description of the macroscopic stress drop and predictions for the\ndivergence of the peak susceptibility with inverse shear rate. The second is\nessential in order to capture properly the behaviour in the limit of\nquasistatic driving, where avalanches of plasticity diverge with system size at\nany value of the strain. We fully characterise the avalanche behaviour, which\nis radically different to that of the RFIM. In the quasistatic, infinite size\nlimit, we find that both models have mean-field Landau exponents, obscuring the\neffect of the interactions. We show, however, that the latter profoundly affect\nthe behaviour of finite systems approaching the spinodal-like brittle yield\npoint, where we recover qualitatively the finite-size trends found in particle\nsimulations, and modify the nature of the random critical point separating\nductile and brittle yielding, where we predict critical behaviour on top of the\nmarginality present at any value of the strain.",

            "summary": "Learning rate schedules used in practice bear little resemblance to those\nrecommended by theory. We close much of this theory/practice gap, and as a\nconsequence are able to derive new problem-adaptive learning rate schedules.\nOur key technical contribution is a refined analysis of learning rate schedules\nfor a wide class of optimization algorithms (including SGD). In contrast to\nmost prior works that study the convergence of the average iterate, we study\nthe last iterate, which is what most people use in practice. When considering\nonly worst-case analysis, our theory predicts that the best choice is the\nlinear decay schedule: a popular choice in practice that sets the stepsize\nproportionally to $1 - t/T$, where $t$ is the current iteration and $T$ is the\ntotal number of steps. To go beyond this worst-case analysis, we use the\nobserved gradient norms to derive schedules refined for any particular task.\nThese refined schedules exhibit learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate\nannealing near the end of training. Ours is the first systematic approach to\nautomatically yield both of these properties. We perform the most comprehensive\nevaluation of learning rate schedules to date, evaluating across 10 diverse\ndeep learning problems, a series of LLMs, and a suite of logistic regression\nproblems. We validate that overall, the linear-decay schedule matches or\noutperforms all commonly used default schedules including cosine annealing, and\nthat our schedule refinement method gives further improvements.",

            "summary": "We review our current understanding on the outer envelope structures of\nmassive stars based on three dimensional (3D) radiation hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We briefly summarize the fundamental issues to construct\nhydrostatic one dimensional (1D) stellar evolution models when stellar\nluminosity approaches the Eddington value. Radiation hydrodynamic simulations\nin 3D covering the mass range from $13M_{\\odot}$ to $80M_{\\odot}$ always find a\ndynamic envelope structure with the time-averaged radial profiles matching 1D\nmodels with an adjusted mixing length parameter when convection is subsonic.\nSupersonic turbulence and episodic mass loss are generally found in 3D models\nwhen stellar luminosity is super-Eddington locally due to the opacity peaks and\nconvection is inefficient. Turbulent pressure plays an important role in\nsupporting the outer envelope, which makes the photosphere more extended than\npredictions from 1D models. Massive star lightcurves are always found to vary\nwith a characteristic timescale consistent with the thermal time scale at the\nlocation of the iron opacity peak. The amplitude of the variability as well as\nthe power spectrum can explain the commonly observed stochastic low frequency\nvariability of mass stars observed by TESS over a wide range of parameters in\nthe HR diagram. The 3D simulations can also explain the ubiquitous\nmacro-turbulence that is needed for spectroscopic fitting in massive stars.\nImplications of the 3D simulations for improving 1D stellar evolution models\nare also discussed.",

We prove that all these fluctuations are normalizable and\nprovide examples of their spectra. Therefore, the AdS soliton can be\ninterpreted as giving a holographic RG flow between an universal UV theory at\nthe AdS boundary and these infinitely many possibilities in the IR, obtained by\ndeformations. The massive spectrum of the double trace deformation in $AdS_5$\nallows the matching of the large-$N$ glueball masses of lattice $QCD_3$; the\nratio of the ground states of the $2^{++}$ and $0^{++}$ channels are in full\nagreement with the lattice prediction.

To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for\neffectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions\nover tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the\nsuccess of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent\nmultimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and\nrepetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as\nrepeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing\ndata without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side\ninformation, and answer questions to help explain predictions.

Unfortunately, such\nexplanations are often wrong despite being persuasive. Therefore, it is\nessential to measure their faithfulness. One such metric is if tokens are truly\nimportant, then masking them should result in worse model performance. However,\ntoken masking introduces out-of-distribution issues and existing solutions are\ncomputationally expensive and employ proxy-models. Furthermore, other metrics\nare very limited in scope. In this work, we propose an inherently faithfulness\nmeasurable model that addresses these challenges. This is achieved by using a\nnovel fine-tuning method that incorporates masking, such that masking tokens\nbecome in-distribution by design. This differs from existing approaches, which\nare completely model-agnostic but are inapplicable in practice. We demonstrate\nthe generality of our approach by applying it to various tasks and validate it\nusing statistical in-distribution tests. Additionally, because masking is\nin-distribution, importance measures which themselves use masking become more\nfaithful, thus our model becomes more explainable.",

While a number of\nnon-stationary contextual bandit learning algorithms have been proposed in the\nliterature, they excessively explore due to a lack of prioritization for\ninformation of enduring value, or are designed in ways that do not scale in\nmodern applications with high-dimensional user-specific features and large\naction set, or both. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-stationary\ncontextual bandit algorithm that addresses these concerns. It combines a\nscalable, deep-neural-network-based architecture with a carefully designed\nexploration mechanism that strategically prioritizes collecting information\nwith the most lasting value in a non-stationary environment. Through empirical\nevaluations on two real-world recommendation datasets, which exhibit pronounced\nnon-stationarity, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art baselines.",

This research empirically investigates a novel theory positing\nthat online hate may be driven primarily by the pursuit of social approval\nrather than a direct desire to harm the targets. Results show that toxicity is\nhomophilous in users' social networks and that a user's propensity for\nhostility can be predicted by their social networks. We also illustrate how\nreceiving greater or fewer social engagements in the form of likes, retweets,\nquotes, and replies affects a user's subsequent toxicity. We establish a clear\nconnection between receiving social approval signals and increases in\nsubsequent toxicity. Being retweeted plays a particularly prominent role in\nescalating toxicity.

A fundamental dipole moment would\ngive rise to rich phenomenology, for example to intrinsic precession and extra\nemission channels in binary systems. We show that extreme mass-ratio inspirals\n(EMRIs) detectable by future gravitational-wave interferometers allow us to\nstudy a fundamental dipole on the secondary object in a model-agnostic fashion.\nBy developing a general model for a fundamental scalar dipole, we compute the\nextra flux associated with it. This effect is suppressed by the square of the\nmass ratio relative to the case of fundamental charges, making its detection\nwith EMRIs very challenging for the typical dipole moments predicted in various\nmodels. On the other hand, for the same reason the impact of an extra dipole\nfor constraints on extra fundamental charges is likely negligible, making the\nlatter constraints more robust.",

Signatures of an orbiting hot spot have been\nidentified in the polarized millimeter wavelength light curves observed with\nALMA in 2017 immediately after an X-ray flare. The nature of these hot spots\nremains uncertain. We expanded existing theoretical hot spot models created to\ndescribe the Sgr~A* polarized emission at millimeter wavelengths. We sample the\nposterior space, identifying best-fitting parameters and characterizing\nuncertainties. Using the numerical radiative transfer code IPOLE we defined a\nsemi-analytical model describing a ball of plasma orbiting Sgr~A*, threaded\nwith a magnetic field and emitting synchrotron radiation. We then explore the\nposterior space in the Bayesian framework of DYNESTY. We fitted the static\nbackground emission separately, using a radiatively inefficient accretion flow\nmodel. We considered eight models with a varying level of complexity. All\nmodels converge to realisations that fit the data, but two models, one with\ncooling and one with non-Keplerian motion, improve the fit significantly, while\nadditionally matching the expected synchrotron cooling timescale and observed\ncircular polarization. Our models represent observational data well, and allow\nfor testing of the impact of various effects in a systematic manner. From our\nanalysis we have inferred an inclination of $\\sim150-160$ deg, corroborating\nprevious estimates, a preferred period of $\\sim$ $90$ minutes and an orbital\nradius of $10.7 - 13.0$ gravitational radii. Our non-Keplerian models indicate\na preference for an orbital velocity of $0.8-0.9$ times the Keplerian value.\nLastly, our best models agree on a low dimensionless spin value ($a_* < 0.6$),\nhowever, the impact of spin on the corresponding light curves is subdominant\nwith respect to other parameters.",

In this work\nwe investigate how a velocity dependence alters the evolution of the DM\ndistribution for frequent DM scatterings and compare to the\nvelocity-independent case. We demonstrate that these cases are qualitatively\ndifferent using a test problem. Moreover, we study the evolution of the density\nprofile of idealised DM haloes and find that a velocity dependence can lead to\nlarger core sizes and different time scales of core formation and core\ncollapse. In cosmological simulations, we investigate the effect of\nvelocity-dependent self-interaction on haloes and satellites in the mass range\nof $\\approx 10^{11} - 10^{14}$ M$_\\odot$. We study the abundance of satellites,\ndensity and shape profiles and try to infer qualitative differences between\nvelocity-dependent and velocity-independent scatterings as well as between\nfrequent and rare self-interactions. We find that a strongly velocity-dependent\ncross-section can significantly amplify the diversity of rotation curves,\nindependent of the angular dependence of the differential cross-section.

            "summary": "The interaction between the supermassive black hole at the center of the\nMilky Way, Sagittarius A$^*$, and its accretion disk, occasionally produces\nhigh energy flares seen in X-ray, infrared and radio. One mechanism for\nobserved flares is the formation of compact bright regions that appear within\nthe accretion disk and close to the event horizon. Understanding these flares\ncan provide a window into black hole accretion processes. Although\nsophisticated simulations predict the formation of these flares, their\nstructure has yet to be recovered by observations. Here we show the first\nthree-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an emission flare in orbit recovered\nfrom ALMA light curves observed on April 11, 2017. Our recovery results show\ncompact bright regions at a distance of roughly 6 times the event horizon.\nMoreover, our recovery suggests a clockwise rotation in a low-inclination\norbital plane, a result consistent with prior studies by EHT and GRAVITY\ncollaborations. To recover this emission structure we solve a highly ill-posed\ntomography problem by integrating a neural 3D representation (an emergent\nartificial intelligence approach for 3D reconstruction) with a gravitational\nmodel for black holes. Although the recovered 3D structure is subject, and\nsometimes sensitive, to the model assumptions, under physically motivated\nchoices we find that our results are stable and our approach is successful on\nsimulated data. We anticipate that in the future, this approach could be used\nto analyze a richer collection of time-series data that could shed light on the\nmechanisms governing black hole and plasma dynamics.",

This paper attempts to confront some pending questions in that\nregard: Can the concept of homophily play a crucial role in Hypergraph Neural\nNetworks (HGNNs), similar to its significance in graph-based research? Is there\nroom for improving current hypergraph architectures and methodologies? (e.g. by\ncarefully addressing the specific characteristics of higher-order networks) Do\nexisting datasets provide a meaningful benchmark for HGNNs? Diving into the\ndetails, this paper proposes a novel conceptualization of homophily in\nhigher-order networks based on a message passing scheme; this approach\nharmonizes the analytical frameworks of datasets and architectures, offering a\nunified perspective for exploring and interpreting complex, higher-order\nnetwork structures and dynamics. Further, we propose MultiSet, a novel message\npassing framework that redefines HGNNs by allowing hyperedge-dependent node\nrepresentations, as well as introduce a novel architecture MultiSetMixer that\nleverages a new hyperedge sampling strategy. Finally, we provide an extensive\nset of experiments that contextualize our proposals and lead to valuable\ninsights in hypergraph representation learning.",

Challenges in\nidentifying patients for these therapies include lack of access to validated\ntesting, such as standardized immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment, and\nconsumption of valuable tissue for a single gene/protein assay. Development of\npre-screening algorithms using routinely available digitized hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E)-stained slides to predict MET overexpression could promote testing\nfor those who will benefit most. While assessment of MET expression using IHC\nis currently not routinely performed in NSCLC, next-generation sequencing is\ncommon and in some cases includes RNA expression panel testing. In this work,\nwe leveraged a large database of matched H&E slides and RNA expression data to\ntrain a weakly supervised model to predict MET RNA overexpression directly from\nH&E images. This model was evaluated on an independent holdout test set of 300\nover-expressed and 289 normal patients, demonstrating an ROC-AUC of 0.70 (95th\npercentile interval: 0.66 - 0.74) with stable performance characteristics\nacross different patient clinical variables and robust to synthetic noise on\nthe test set.

            "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in\nNLP-related tasks such as translation, summarizing, and generation. The\napplication of LLMs in specific areas, notably AIOps (Artificial Intelligence\nfor IT Operations), holds great potential due to their advanced abilities in\ninformation summarizing, report analyzing, and ability of API calling.\nNevertheless, the performance of current LLMs in AIOps tasks is yet to be\ndetermined. Furthermore, a comprehensive benchmark is required to steer the\noptimization of LLMs tailored for AIOps. Compared with existing benchmarks that\nfocus on evaluating specific fields like network configuration, in this paper,\nwe present \\textbf{OpsEval}, a comprehensive task-oriented AIOps benchmark\ndesigned for LLMs. For the first time, OpsEval assesses LLMs' proficiency in\nthree crucial scenarios (Wired Network Operation, 5G Communication Operation,\nand Database Operation) at various ability levels (knowledge recall, analytical\nthinking, and practical application). The benchmark includes 7,200 questions in\nboth multiple-choice and question-answer (QA) formats, available in English and\nChinese. With quantitative and qualitative results, we show how various LLM\ntricks can affect the performance of AIOps, including zero-shot,\nchain-of-thought, and few-shot in-context learning. We find that GPT4-score is\nmore consistent with experts than widely used Bleu and Rouge, which can be used\nto replace automatic metrics for large-scale qualitative evaluations.",

            "summary": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained computer vision models is infeasible for\nresource-limited users. Visual prompt learning (VPL) has thus emerged to\nprovide an efficient and flexible alternative to model fine-tuning through\nVisual Prompt as a Service (VPPTaaS). Specifically, the VPPTaaS provider\noptimizes a visual prompt given downstream data, and downstream users can use\nthis prompt together with the large pre-trained model for prediction. However,\nthis new learning paradigm may also pose security risks when the VPPTaaS\nprovider instead provides a malicious visual prompt. In this paper, we take the\nfirst step to explore such risks through the lens of backdoor attacks.\nSpecifically, we propose BadVisualPrompt, a simple yet effective backdoor\nattack against VPL. For example, poisoning $5\\%$ CIFAR10 training data leads to\nabove $99\\%$ attack success rates with only negligible model accuracy drop by\n$1.5\\%$. In particular, we identify and then address a new technical challenge\nrelated to interactions between the backdoor trigger and visual prompt, which\ndoes not exist in conventional, model-level backdoors. Moreover, we provide\nin-depth analyses of seven backdoor defenses from model, prompt, and input\nlevels. Overall, all these defenses are either ineffective or impractical to\nmitigate our BadVisualPrompt, implying the critical vulnerability of VPL.",

Global climate change and the consequent sea-level rise have\nincreased the occurrence of extreme weather events, resulting in elevated and\nfrequent flood risk. Therefore, accurate and timely flood forecasting in\ncoastal river systems is critical to facilitate good flood management. However,\nthe computational tools currently used are either slow or inaccurate. In this\npaper, we propose a Flood prediction tool using Graph Transformer Network\n(FloodGTN) for river systems. More specifically, FloodGTN learns the\nspatio-temporal dependencies of water levels at different monitoring stations\nusing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and an LSTM. It is currently implemented to\nconsider external covariates such as rainfall, tide, and the settings of\nhydraulic structures (e.g., outflows of dams, gates, pumps, etc.) along the\nriver. We use a Transformer to learn the attention given to external covariates\nin computing water levels. We apply the FloodGTN tool to data from the South\nFlorida Water Management District, which manages a coastal area prone to\nfrequent storms and hurricanes. Experimental results show that FloodGTN\noutperforms the physics-based model (HEC-RAS) by achieving higher accuracy with\n70% improvement while speeding up run times by at least 500x.",

To address this, we propose the Question-guided Multi-hop\nFact-Checking (QACHECK) system, which guides the model's reasoning process by\nasking a series of questions critical for verifying a claim. QACHECK has five\nkey modules: a claim verifier, a question generator, a question-answering\nmodule, a QA validator, and a reasoner. Users can input a claim into QACHECK,\nwhich then predicts its veracity and provides a comprehensive report detailing\nits reasoning process, guided by a sequence of (question, answer) pairs.\nQACHECK also provides the source of evidence supporting each question,\nfostering a transparent, explainable, and user-friendly fact-checking process.\nA recorded video of QACHECK is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju8kxSldM64",

In this\nstudy, we attribute the bias to the model's misuse of label dependency, i.e.,\nthe model tends to utilize the correlation shortcut in label dependency rather\nthan fusing text information and label dependency for prediction. Motivated by\ncausal inference, we propose a CounterFactual Text Classifier (CFTC) to\neliminate the correlation bias, and make causality-based predictions.\nSpecifically, our CFTC first adopts the predict-then-modify backbone to extract\nprecise label information embedded in label dependency, then blocks the\ncorrelation shortcut through the counterfactual de-bias technique with the help\nof the human causal graph.

A\nbipartite graph is formed where hashtags are nodes and weighted edges connect\nthe hashtags reflecting the number of Twitter users that interacted with both\nhashtags. The graph is then transformed into a maximum-spanning tree with the\nmost popular hashtag as its root node to construct a hierarchy amongst the\nhashtags. We then provide a vector feature for each user based on this tree. To\nvalidate the usefulness of our semantic feature we performed a regression\nexperiment to predict the response rate of each user with six emotions like\nanger, enjoyment, or disgust.

            "summary": "A key challenge in materials discovery is to find a viable high temperature\nsuperconductor. Hydrogen and hydride materials have long been considered\npromising materials displaying conventional phonon-mediated superconductivity.\nHowever, the high pressures required to stabilise these materials have\nrestricted their application. Here, we present results from high-throughput\ncomputation, considering a wide range of high-symmetry ternary hydrides from\nacross the periodic table at ambient-pressure. This large composition space is\nthen reduced by considerations of thermodynamic, dynamic and magnetic\nstability, before direct estimations of the superconducting critical\ntemperature. This approach, combined with first-principles structure prediction\nhas revealed a metastable ambient-pressure hydride superconductor,\nMg$_2$IrH$_6$, with a predicted critical temperature of 160K, comparable to the\nhighest temperature superconducting cuprates. We propose a synthesis route via\na structurally related insulator, Mg$_2$IrH$_7$, which is thermodynamically\nstable above 15GPa and discuss the potential challenges in doing so. This\nsupports a long-held hypothesis that, hydrogen, in the right chemical\nenvironment, can promote high-temperature superconductivity at ambient\npressure.",

In this work, we consider a more general but\nchallenging MBO setting, named constrained MBO (CoMBO), where only part of the\ndesign space can be optimized while the rest is constrained by the environment.\nA new challenge arising from CoMBO is that most observed designs that satisfy\nthe constraints are mediocre in evaluation. Therefore, we focus on optimizing\nthese mediocre designs in the offline dataset while maintaining the given\nconstraints rather than further boosting the best observed design in the\ntraditional MBO setting. We propose retrieval-enhanced offline model-based\noptimization (ROMO), a new derivable forward approach that retrieves the\noffline dataset and aggregates relevant samples to provide a trusted\nprediction, and use it for gradient-based optimization. ROMO is simple to\nimplement and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in the CoMBO setting.\nEmpirically, we conduct experiments on a synthetic Hartmann (3D) function\ndataset, an industrial CIO dataset, and a suite of modified tasks in the\nDesign-Bench benchmark.

            "summary": "High Throughput Satellites (HTSs) outpace traditional satellites due to their\nmulti-beam transmission. The rise of low Earth orbit mega constellations\namplifies HTS data rate demands to terabits/second with acceptable latency.\nThis surge in data rate necessitates multiple modems, often exceeding single\ndevice capabilities. Consequently, satellites employ several processors,\nforming a complex packet-switch network. This can lead to potential internal\ncongestion and challenges in adhering to strict quality of service (QoS)\nconstraints. While significant research exists on constellation-level routing,\na literature gap remains on the internal routing within a singular HTS. The\nintricacy of this internal network architecture presents a significant\nchallenge to achieve high data rates.\n  This paper introduces an online optimal flow allocation and scheduling method\nfor HTSs. The problem is treated as a multi-commodity flow instance with\ndifferent priority data streams. An initial full time horizon model is proposed\nas a benchmark. We apply a model predictive control (MPC) approach to enable\nadaptive routing based on current information and the forecast within the\nprediction time horizon while allowing for deviation of the latter.\nImportantly, MPC is inherently suited to handle uncertainty in incoming flows.\nOur approach minimizes packet loss by optimally and adaptively managing the\npriority queue schedulers and flow exchanges between satellite processing\nmodules. Central to our method is a routing model focusing on optimal priority\nscheduling to enhance data rates and maintain QoS. The model's stages are\ncritically evaluated, and results are compared to traditional methods via\nnumerical simulations. Through simulations, our method demonstrates performance\nnearly on par with the hindsight optimum, showcasing its efficiency and\nadaptability in addressing satellite communication challenges.",

In addition, aligning\nattribute features with class-level semantics ignores potential intra-class\nattribute variation. To mitigate these disadvantages, we present Attribute\nLocalization and Revision Network in this paper. First, we design Attribute\nLocalization Module (ALM) to capture both local and global features from image\nregions, a novel module called Scale Control Unit is incorporated to fuse\nglobal and local representations. Second, we propose Attribute Revision Module\n(ARM), which generates image-level semantics by revising the ground-truth value\nof each attribute, compensating for performance degradation caused by ignoring\nintra-class variation. Finally, the output of ALM will be aligned with revised\nsemantics produced by ARM to achieve the training process.

We operate under the unsupervised\nregime where only a small set of unlabeled test samples along with a labeled\ntraining set is available. Towards this problem, we make three contributions.\nFirst is a novel composite weighted entropy based objective for prediction\naccuracy which is optimized along with a representation matching loss for\nfairness. We experimentally verify that optimizing with our loss formulation\noutperforms a number of state-of-the-art baselines in the pareto sense with\nrespect to the fairness-accuracy tradeoff on several standard datasets. Our\nsecond contribution is a new setting we term Asymmetric Covariate Shift that,\nto the best of our knowledge, has not been studied before. Asymmetric covariate\nshift occurs when distribution of covariates of one group shifts significantly\ncompared to the other groups and this happens when a dominant group is\nover-represented. While this setting is extremely challenging for current\nbaselines, We show that our proposed method significantly outperforms them. Our\nthird contribution is theoretical, where we show that our weighted entropy term\nalong with prediction loss on the training set approximates test loss under\ncovariate shift.

            "summary": "Urban metro systems can provide highly efficient and effective movements of\nvast passenger volumes in cities, but they are often affected by disruptions,\ncausing delays, crowding, and ultimately a decline in passenger satisfaction\nand patronage. To manage and mitigate such adverse consequences, metro\noperators could benefit greatly from a quantitative understanding of the causal\nimpact of disruptions. Such information would allow them to predict future\ndelays, prepare effective recovery plans, and develop real-time information\nsystems for passengers on trip re-routing options. In this paper, we develop a\nperformance evaluation tool for metro operators that can quantify the causal\neffects of service disruptions on passenger flows, journey times, travel speeds\nand crowding densities. Our modelling framework is simple to implement, robust\nto statistical sources of bias, and can be used with high-frequency large-scale\nsmart card data (over 4.85 million daily trips in our case) and train movement\ndata. We recover disruption effects at the points of disruption (e.g. at\ndisrupted stations) as well as spillover effects that propagate throughout the\nmetro network. This allows us to deliver novel insights on the spatio-temporal\npropagation of delays in densely used urban public transport networks. We find\nrobust empirical evidence that the causal impacts of disruptions adversely\naffect service quality throughout the network, in ways that would be hard to\npredict absent a causal model.",

Such complex data is commonly\nanalyzed in an individual level, using personalized models. However, it is\nbelieved that additional information of similar individuals is likely to\nenhance these models leading to better individuals' description. Thus,\nclustering is investigated with an aim to group together the most similar\nindividuals, and subsequently use this information in group-based models in\norder to improve individuals' predictive performance. More specifically, two\nmodel-based clustering approaches are examined, where the first is using\nmodel-extracted parameters of personalized models, whereas the second is\noptimized on the model-based forecasting performance. Both methods are then\nanalyzed using intrinsic clustering evaluation measures (e.g. Silhouette\ncoefficients) as well as the performance of a downstream forecasting scheme,\nwhere each forecasting group-model is devoted to describe all individuals\nbelonging to one cluster. Among these, clustering based on performance shows\nthe best results, in terms of all examined evaluation measures. As another\nlevel of evaluation, those group-models' performance is compared to three\nbaseline scenarios, the personalized, the all-in-one group and the random\ngroup-based concept. According to this comparison, the superiority of\nclustering-based methods is again confirmed, indicating that the utilization of\ngroup-based information could be effectively enhance the overall performance of\nall individuals' data.",

Just like in metallurgic annealing\none slowly cools a ferrous metal, quantum annealers seek good solutions by\nslowly removing the transverse magnetic field at the lowest possible\ntemperature. The field removal diminishes quantum fluctuations but forces the\nsystem to traverse the critical point that separates the disordered phase (at\nlarge fields) from the spin-glass phase (at small fields). A full understanding\nof this phase transition is still missing. A debated, crucial question regards\nthe closing of the energy gap separating the ground state from the first\nexcited state. All hopes of achieving an exponential speed-up, as compared to\nclassical computers, rest on the assumption that the gap will close\nalgebraically with the number of qspins, but renormalization group calculations\npredict that the closing will be instead exponential. Here we solve this debate\nthrough extreme-scale numerical simulations, finding that both parties grasped\nparts of the truth. While the closing of the gap at the critical point is\nindeed super-algebraic, it remains algebraic if one restricts the symmetry of\npossible excitations. Since this symmetry restriction is experimentally\nachievable (at least nominally), there is still hope for the Quantum Annealing\nparadigm.",

Besides, the students' response\nrecords contain valuable relational information between questions and knowledge\nconcepts. The previous methods ignore this relational information, resulting in\nthe selection of sub-optimal test questions. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Graph-Enhanced Multi-Objective method for CAT (GMOCAT). Firstly,\nthree objectives, namely quality, diversity and novelty, are introduced into\nthe Scalarized Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning framework of CAT, which\nrespectively correspond to improving the prediction accuracy, increasing the\nconcept diversity and reducing the question exposure. We use an Actor-Critic\nRecommender to select questions and optimize three objectives simultaneously by\nthe scalarization function. Secondly, we utilize the graph neural network to\nlearn relation-aware embeddings of questions and concepts. These embeddings are\nable to aggregate neighborhood information in the relation graphs between\nquestions and concepts. We conduct experiments on three real-world educational\ndatasets, and show that GMOCAT not only outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods in the ability prediction, but also achieve superior performance in\nimproving the concept diversity and alleviating the question exposure.

            "summary": "Learning to navigate to an image-specified goal is an important but\nchallenging task for autonomous systems. The agent is required to reason the\ngoal location from where a picture is shot. Existing methods try to solve this\nproblem by learning a navigation policy, which captures semantic features of\nthe goal image and observation image independently and lastly fuses them for\npredicting a sequence of navigation actions. However, these methods suffer from\ntwo major limitations. 1) They may miss detailed information in the goal image,\nand thus fail to reason the goal location. 2) More critically, it is hard to\nfocus on the goal-relevant regions in the observation image, because they\nattempt to understand observation without goal conditioning. In this paper, we\naim to overcome these limitations by designing a Fine-grained Goal Prompting\n(FGPrompt) method for image-goal navigation. In particular, we leverage\nfine-grained and high-resolution feature maps in the goal image as prompts to\nperform conditioned embedding, which preserves detailed information in the goal\nimage and guides the observation encoder to pay attention to goal-relevant\nregions. Compared with existing methods on the image-goal navigation benchmark,\nour method brings significant performance improvement on 3 benchmark datasets\n(i.e., Gibson, MP3D, and HM3D). Especially on Gibson, we surpass the\nstate-of-the-art success rate by 8% with only 1/50 model size. Project page:\nhttps://xinyusun.github.io/fgprompt-pages",

            "summary": "Blockchain promises to enhance distributed machine learning (ML) approaches\nsuch as federated learning (FL) by providing further decentralization,\nsecurity, immutability, and trust, which are key properties for enabling\ncollaborative intelligence in next-generation applications. Nonetheless, the\nintrinsic decentralized operation of peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain nodes leads\nto an uncharted setting for FL, whereby the concepts of FL round and global\nmodel become meaningless, as devices' synchronization is lost without the\nfigure of a central orchestrating server. In this paper, we study the practical\nimplications of outsourcing the orchestration of FL to a democratic network\nsuch as in a blockchain. In particular, we focus on the effects that model\nstaleness and inconsistencies, endorsed by blockchains' modus operandi, have on\nthe training procedure held by FL devices asynchronously. Using simulation, we\nevaluate the blockchained FL operation on the well-known CIFAR-10 dataset and\nfocus on the accuracy and timeliness of the solutions. Our results show the\nhigh impact of model inconsistencies on the accuracy of the models (up to a\n~35% decrease in prediction accuracy), which underscores the importance of\nproperly designing blockchain systems based on the characteristics of the\nunderlying FL application.",

To overcome these challenges, we propose an interpretable\ndeep learning pipeline, a Multi-Biomarker Histomorphology Discoverer\n(Multi-Beholder) model based on the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework,\nto predict the status of five biomarkers in LGG using only hematoxylin and\neosin-stained whole slide images and slide-level biomarker status labels.\nSpecifically, by incorporating the one-class classification into the MIL\nframework, accurate instance pseudo-labeling is realized for instance-level\nsupervision, which greatly complements the slide-level labels and improves the\nbiomarker prediction performance. Multi-Beholder demonstrates superior\nprediction performance and generalizability for five LGG biomarkers\n(AUROC=0.6469-0.9735) in two cohorts (n=607) with diverse races and scanning\nprotocols. Moreover, the excellent interpretability of Multi-Beholder allows\nfor discovering the quantitative and qualitative correlations between biomarker\nstatus and histomorphology characteristics.

This\nnecessitates a profound understanding of heart aging processes to diagnose\nconstraints in cardiovascular fitness. Traditionally, most of such insights\nhave been drawn from the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) feature changes of\nindividuals as they age. However, these features, while informative, may\npotentially obscure underlying data relationships. In this paper, we employ a\ndeep-learning model and a tree-based model to analyze ECG data from a robust\ndataset of healthy individuals across varying ages in both raw signals and ECG\nfeature format. Explainable AI techniques are then used to identify ECG\nfeatures or raw signal characteristics are most discriminative for\ndistinguishing between age groups. Our analysis with tree-based classifiers\nreveal age-related declines in inferred breathing rates and identifies notably\nhigh SDANN values as indicative of elderly individuals, distinguishing them\nfrom younger adults. Furthermore, the deep-learning model underscores the\npivotal role of the P-wave in age predictions across all age groups, suggesting\npotential changes in the distribution of different P-wave types with age. These\nfindings shed new light on age-related ECG changes, offering insights that\ntranscend traditional feature-based approaches.",

            "summary": "During the outbursts of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs), their accretion\nflows transition through several states. The source luminosity rises in the\nhard state, dominated by non-thermal emission, before transitioning to the\nblackbody-dominated soft state. As the luminosity decreases, the source\ntransitions back into the hard state and fades to quiescence. This picture does\nnot always hold, as $\\approx$ 40$\\%$ of the outbursts never leave the hard\nstate. Identifying the physics that govern state transitions remains one of the\noutstanding open questions in black hole astrophysics. In this paper we present\nan analysis of archival RXTE data of multiple outbursts of GX 339-4. We compare\nthe properties of the X-ray variability and time-averaged energy spectrum and\ndemonstrate that the variability (quantified by the power spectral hue)\nsystematically evolves $\\approx$ 10-40 days ahead of the canonical state\ntransition (quantified by a change in spectral hardness); no such evolution is\nfound in hard state only outbursts. This indicates that the X-ray variability\ncan be used to predict if and when the hard-to-soft state transition will\noccur. Finally, we find a similar behavior in ten outbursts of four additional\nBHXRBs with more sparse observational coverage. Based on these findings, we\nsuggest that state transitions in BHXRBs might be driven by a change in the\nturbulence in the outer regions of the disk, leading to a dramatic change in\nvariability. This change is only seen in the spectrum days to weeks later, as\nthe fluctuations propagate inwards towards the corona.",

By fixing $m_b$ and varying $m_c$ from $1.25$ to\n$1.9$ GeV, we find the branching fraction can change a factor of $2$, $3$, and\n$6$ for $\\eta_b$, $\\chi_{b0}$, and $\\chi_{b1}$, respectively. In the\nphenomenological analysis, with the integrate luminosity $\\mathcal{L}=100\\,{\\rm\nfb}^{-1}$, we expect about $(5-10)\\times 10^3$ $\\eta_b(\\chi_{bJ})\\to J/\\psi\nJ/\\psi\\to \\ell \\bar{\\ell}\\ell \\bar{\\ell}$ events produced at the {\\tt LHC},\nthus it might be hopeful to search for these processes. On the other hand,\nthere are less than $100$ $\\eta_b(\\chi_{bJ})\\to J/\\psi J/\\psi$ signal events at\nthe B factory, so it seems the experimental measurements on these channels are\nquite challenging based on current dataset.",

Extreme values in time series often significantly impact human and\nnatural systems, but predicting them is challenging due to their rare\noccurrence. Statistical methods based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provide a\nsystematic approach to modeling the distribution of extremes, particularly the\nGeneralized Pareto (GP) distribution for modeling the distribution of\nexceedances beyond a threshold. To overcome the subpar performance of deep\nlearning in dealing with heavy-tailed data, we propose a novel framework to\nenhance the focus on extreme events. Specifically, we propose a Deep Extreme\nMixture Model with Autoencoder (DEMMA) for time series prediction. The model\ncomprises two main modules: 1) a generalized mixture distribution based on the\nHurdle model and a reparameterized GP distribution form independent of the\nextreme threshold, 2) an Autoencoder-based LSTM feature extractor and a\nquantile prediction module with a temporal attention mechanism.

To validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted experiments\non datasets from three major stock markets: the China A-share market, the Hong\nKong stock market, and the US stock market. Experimental results revealed that\ncompared to the classical GAF method, the QGAF approach significantly improved\ntime series prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by an average of\n25% for Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 48% for Mean Squared Error (MSE).

            "summary": "Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) translates speech from one\nlanguage into another using a single model. However, due to the presence of\nlinguistic and acoustic diversity, the target speech follows a complex\nmultimodal distribution, posing challenges to achieving both high-quality\ntranslations and fast decoding speeds for S2ST models. In this paper, we\npropose DASpeech, a non-autoregressive direct S2ST model which realizes both\nfast and high-quality S2ST. To better capture the complex distribution of the\ntarget speech, DASpeech adopts the two-pass architecture to decompose the\ngeneration process into two steps, where a linguistic decoder first generates\nthe target text, and an acoustic decoder then generates the target speech based\non the hidden states of the linguistic decoder. Specifically, we use the\ndecoder of DA-Transformer as the linguistic decoder, and use FastSpeech 2 as\nthe acoustic decoder. DA-Transformer models translations with a directed\nacyclic graph (DAG). To consider all potential paths in the DAG during\ntraining, we calculate the expected hidden states for each target token via\ndynamic programming, and feed them into the acoustic decoder to predict the\ntarget mel-spectrogram. During inference, we select the most probable path and\ntake hidden states on that path as input to the acoustic decoder. Experiments\non the CVSS Fr-En benchmark demonstrate that DASpeech can achieve comparable or\neven better performance than the state-of-the-art S2ST model Translatotron 2,\nwhile preserving up to 18.53x speedup compared to the autoregressive baseline.\nCompared with the previous non-autoregressive S2ST model, DASpeech does not\nrely on knowledge distillation and iterative decoding, achieving significant\nimprovements in both translation quality and decoding speed. Furthermore,\nDASpeech shows the ability to preserve the speaker's voice of the source speech\nduring translation.",

We also demonstrate a high efficiency of the\ndeveloped analytic nonlinear mode theory for description of the long-lived\nsolitary patterns up to remarkably steep waves. We show robustness of the\nsolitons in the course of interactions, and the possibility of extreme wave\ngeneration as a result of solitons' collisions.

            "summary": "The large-scale pretrained model CLIP, trained on 400 million image-text\npairs, offers a promising paradigm for tackling vision tasks, albeit at the\nimage level. Later works, such as DenseCLIP and LSeg, extend this paradigm to\ndense prediction, including semantic segmentation, and have achieved excellent\nresults. However, the above methods either rely on CLIP-pretrained visual\nbackbones or use none-pretrained but heavy backbones such as Swin, while\nfalling ineffective when applied to lightweight backbones. The reason for this\nis that the lightweitht networks, feature extraction ability of which are\nrelatively limited, meet difficulty embedding the image feature aligned with\ntext embeddings perfectly. In this work, we present a new feature fusion module\nwhich tackles this problem and enables language-guided paradigm to be applied\nto lightweight networks. Specifically, the module is a parallel design of CNN\nand transformer with a two-way bridge in between, where CNN extracts spatial\ninformation and visual context of the feature map from the image encoder, and\nthe transformer propagates text embeddings from the text encoder forward. The\ncore of the module is the bidirectional fusion of visual and text feature\nacross the bridge which prompts their proximity and alignment in embedding\nspace. The module is model-agnostic, which can not only make language-guided\nlightweight semantic segmentation practical, but also fully exploit the\npretrained knowledge of language priors and achieve better performance than\nprevious SOTA work, such as DenseCLIP, whatever the vision backbone is.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod.",

Admitting the modified Chaplygin equation of state\n$p=H\\rho-\\frac{K}{\\rho^{n}}$, where $H$, $K$ and $n$ are constants with\n$0<n\\leq1$, and employing the Buchdahl-I metric within the framework of the\ngeneral relativity stellar model is obtained. Recent observations on pulsars\nand GW events reveal that the observed maximum mass of compact stars detected\nso far is approximately $2.59^{+0.08}_{-0.09}~M_{\\odot}$. Since massive stars\ncannot be supported by a soft equation of state, a constraint of the equation\nof state must hold. The choice of a suitable equation of state for the interior\nmatter of compact objects may predict useful information compatible with recent\nobservations. TOV equations have been solved using the modified Chaplygin\nequation of state to find the maximum mass in this model. In particular, the\ntheory can achieve $3.72~M_{\\odot}$, when $H=1.0$, $K=10^{-7}$ and $n=1$. The\nmodel is suitable for describing the mass of pulsars PSR J2215+5135 and PSR\nJ0952-0607 and the mass $2.59^{+0.08}_{-0.09}~M_{\\odot}$ of the companion star\nin the GW 190814 event. The $3.72~M_{\\odot}$ is hardly achievable theoretically\nin general relativity considering fast rotation effects too. To check the\nphysical viability of this model, we have opted for the stability analysis and\nenergy conditions. We have found that our model satisfies all the necessary\ncriteria to be a physically realistic model.",

            "summary": "We present an analytic model of nonlinear correlators of galaxy/halo\nellipticities in redshift space. The three-dimensional ellipticity field is not\naffected by the redshift-space distortion (RSD) at linear order, but by the\nnonlinear one, known as the Finger-of-God effect, caused by the coordinate\ntransformation from real to redshift space. Adopting a simple Gaussian damping\nfunction to describe the nonlinear RSD effect and the nonlinear alignment model\nfor the relation between the observed ellipticity and underlying tidal fields,\nwe derive analytic formulas for the multipole moments of the power spectra of\nthe ellipticity field in redshift space expanded in not only the associated\nLegendre basis, a natural basis for the projected galaxy shape field, but also\nthe standard Legendre basis, conventionally used in literature. The multipoles\nof the corresponding correlation functions of the galaxy shape field are shown\nto be expressed by a simple Hankel transform, as is the case for those of the\nconventional galaxy density correlations. We measure these multipoles of the\npower spectra and correlation functions of the halo ellipticity field using\nlarge-volume N-body simulations. We then show that the measured alignment\nsignals can be better predicted by our nonlinear model than the existing linear\nalignment model. The formulas derived here have already been used to place\ncosmological constraints using from the redshift-space correlation functions of\nthe galaxy shape field measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Okumura and\nTaruya, 2023).",

To address it, we propose a novel\nframework, CAusal Unsupervised Semantic sEgmentation (CAUSE), which leverages\ninsights from causal inference. Specifically, we bridge intervention-oriented\napproach (i.e., frontdoor adjustment) to define suitable two-step tasks for\nunsupervised prediction. The first step involves constructing a concept\nclusterbook as a mediator, which represents possible concept prototypes at\ndifferent levels of granularity in a discretized form. Then, the mediator\nestablishes an explicit link to the subsequent concept-wise self-supervised\nlearning for pixel-level grouping.

In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the damping\ndensity, which characterizes the overall multi-slope energy decay. The\nomnidirectional energy decay over time is directly derived from the damping\ndensity. The resulting energy decay model accurately matches the late\nreverberation simulated via the image-source method. The proposed model allows\nthe fast stochastic synthesis of late reverberation by shaping noise with the\nenergy envelope. Simulations of various wall damping coefficients demonstrate\nthe model's accuracy. The proposed model consistently outperforms the energy\ndecay prediction accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art approximation method.\nThe paper elaborates on the proposed damping density's applicability to\nmodeling multi-sloped sound energy decay, predicting reverberation time in\nnon-diffuse sound fields, and fast frequency-dependent RIR synthesis.",

            "summary": "Recently, Graph Transformer (GT) models have been widely used in the task of\nMolecular Property Prediction (MPP) due to their high reliability in\ncharacterizing the latent relationship among graph nodes (i.e., the atoms in a\nmolecule). However, most existing GT-based methods usually explore the basic\ninteractions between pairwise atoms, and thus they fail to consider the\nimportant interactions among critical motifs (e.g., functional groups consisted\nof several atoms) of molecules. As motifs in a molecule are significant\npatterns that are of great importance for determining molecular properties\n(e.g., toxicity and solubility), overlooking motif interactions inevitably\nhinders the effectiveness of MPP. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nAtom-Motif Contrastive Transformer (AMCT), which not only explores the\natom-level interactions but also considers the motif-level interactions. Since\nthe representations of atoms and motifs for a given molecule are actually two\ndifferent views of the same instance, they are naturally aligned to generate\nthe self-supervisory signals for model training. Meanwhile, the same motif can\nexist in different molecules, and hence we also employ the contrastive loss to\nmaximize the representation agreement of identical motifs across different\nmolecules. Finally, in order to clearly identify the motifs that are critical\nin deciding the properties of each molecule, we further construct a\nproperty-aware attention mechanism into our learning framework. Our proposed\nAMCT is extensively evaluated on seven popular benchmark datasets, and both\nquantitative and qualitative results firmly demonstrate its effectiveness when\ncompared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

A\npractical approach to the multi-constraint routing problem is to, first,\ncombine the metrics into a single `composite' metric, and then apply one-to-all\nshortest path algorithms, e.g. Dijkstra, in order to find shortest path trees.\nWe show that, in general, even if a feasible path exists and is known for every\nsource and destination pair, it is impossible to guarantee a distributed\nrouting under several constraints. We also study the question of choosing the\noptimal `composite' metric. We show that under certain mathematical assumptions\nwe can efficiently find a convex combination of several metrics that maximizes\nthe number of discovered feasible paths.

            "summary": "Significant progress has been made recently in point cloud segmentation\nutilizing an encoder-decoder framework, which initially encodes point clouds\ninto low-resolution representations and subsequently decodes high-resolution\npredictions. Inspired by the success of high-resolution architectures in image\ndense prediction, which always maintains a high-resolution representation\nthroughout the entire learning process, we consider it also highly important\nfor 3D dense point cloud analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we explore\nhigh-resolution architectures for 3D point cloud segmentation. Specifically, we\ngeneralize high-resolution architectures using a unified pipeline named\nPointHR, which includes a knn-based sequence operator for feature extraction\nand a differential resampling operator to efficiently communicate different\nresolutions. Additionally, we propose to avoid numerous on-the-fly computations\nof high-resolution architectures by pre-computing the indices for both sequence\nand resampling operators. By doing so, we deliver highly competitive\nhigh-resolution architectures while capitalizing on the benefits of\nwell-designed point cloud blocks without additional effort. To evaluate these\narchitectures for dense point cloud analysis, we conduct thorough experiments\nusing S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets, where the proposed PointHR outperforms\nrecent state-of-the-art methods without any bells and whistles.

Prior work has suggested that some attention heads and MLP layers may\nperform a \"memory management\" role. That is, clearing residual stream\ndirections set by earlier layers by reading in information and writing out the\nnegative version. In this work, we present concrete evidence for this\nphenomenon in a 4-layer transformer. We identify several heads in layer 2 that\nconsistently remove the output of a single layer 0 head. We then verify that\nthis erasure causally depends on the original written direction. We further\ndemonstrate that direct logit attribution (DLA) suggests that writing and\nerasing heads directly contribute to predictions, when in fact their effects\ncancel out. Then we present adversarial prompts for which this effect is\nparticularly salient. These findings reveal that memory management can make DLA\nresults misleading.

SNOiC combines Soft Labeling and Noisy Mixup strategies to\nreduce the biasing and generate pseudo-data for open intent class. The\nexperimental results on four benchmark datasets show that the SNOiC model\nachieves a minimum and maximum performance of 68.72\\% and 94.71\\%,\nrespectively, in identifying open intents. Moreover, compared to\nstate-of-the-art models, the SNOiC model improves the performance of\nidentifying open intents by 0.93\\% (minimum) and 12.76\\% (maximum). The model's\nefficacy is further established by analyzing various parameters used in the\nproposed model.

We propose uxSense, a visual analytics\nsystem using machine learning methods to extract user behavior from audio and\nvideo recordings as parallel time-stamped data streams. Our implementation\ndraws on pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, and\nmachine learning to extract user sentiment, actions, posture, spoken words, and\nother features from such recordings. These streams are visualized as parallel\ntimelines in a web-based front-end, enabling the researcher to search, filter,\nand annotate data across time and space. We present the results of a user study\ninvolving professional UX researchers evaluating user data using uxSense. In\nfact, we used uxSense itself to evaluate their sessions.",

To this end, we subtly leverage the visual and\nlinguistic-compatible feature character of ViT (i.e., student), and its\ncapacity gap with the CNN (i.e., teacher) and propose a novel CNN-to-ViT KD\nframework, dubbed C2VKD. Importantly, as the teacher's features are\nheterogeneous to those of the student, we first propose a novel\nvisual-linguistic feature distillation (VLFD) module that explores efficient KD\namong the aligned visual and linguistic-compatible representations. Moreover,\ndue to the large capacity gap between the teacher and student and the\ninevitable prediction errors of the teacher, we then propose a pixel-wise\ndecoupled distillation (PDD) module to supervise the student under the\ncombination of labels and teacher's predictions from the decoupled target and\nnon-target classes. Experiments on three semantic segmentation benchmark\ndatasets consistently show that the increment of mIoU of our method is over\n200% of the SoTA KD methods",

We searched for indications of\nshocks toward 366 massive star-forming regions by observing the ground\nrotational transition of SiO ($v=0$, $J=1-0$) at 43 GHz with the Korean VLBI\nNetwork (KVN) 21 m telescopes to extend our understanding on the origins of SiO\nin star-forming regions. We detected SiO emission toward 104 regions that\nconsist of 57 IRDCs, 21 HMPOs, and 26 UCHIIs. The determined median SiO column\ndensity, $N$(SiO), and abundance, $X$(SiO), relative to $N$(H$_2$) are\n$8.12\\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.28\\times10^{-10}$, respectively. These\nvalues are similar to those obtained toward other star-forming regions and also\nconsistent with predicted values from shock models with low-velocity shocks\n($\\lesssim$10 - 15 km s$^{-1}$). While the $X$(SiO) does not exhibit any strong\ncorrelation with the evolutionary stages of their host clumps, $L_{\\rm SiO}$ is\nhighly correlated with dust clump mass, and $L_{\\rm SiO}/L_{\\rm bol}$ also has\na strong negative correlation with $T_{\\rm dust}$. This shows that colder and\nyounger clumps have high $L_{\\rm SiO}/L_{\\rm bol}$ suggestive of an\nevolutionary trend. This trend is not due to excess emission at higher\nvelocities, such as SiO wing features, as the colder sources with high $L_{\\rm\nSiO}/L_{\\rm bol}$ ratios lack wing features. Comparing SiO emission with H$_2$O\nand Class I CH$_3$OH masers, we find a significant correlation between $L_{\\rm\nSiO}$/$L_{\\rm bol}$ and $L_{\\rm CH_3OH}/L_{\\rm bol}$ ratios, whereas no similar\ncorrelation is seen for the H$_2$O maser emission. This suggests a similar\norigin for the SiO and Class I CH$_3$OH emission in these sources.",

This study proposes a novel\nbenchmark ADMEOOD, a systematic OOD dataset curator and benchmark specifically\ndesigned for drug property prediction. ADMEOOD obtained 27 ADME (Absorption,\nDistribution, Metabolism, Excretion) drug properties from Chembl and relevant\nliterature. Additionally, it includes two kinds of OOD data shifts: Noise Shift\nand Concept Conflict Drift (CCD). Noise Shift responds to the noise level by\ncategorizing the environment into different confidence levels. On the other\nhand, CCD describes the data which has inconsistent label among the original\ndata. Finally, it tested on a variety of domain generalization models, and the\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed partition\nmethod in ADMEOOD: ADMEOOD demonstrates a significant difference performance\nbetween in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

            "summary": "Box-supervised polyp segmentation attracts increasing attention for its\ncost-effective potential. Existing solutions often rely on learning-free\nmethods or pretrained models to laboriously generate pseudo masks, triggering\nDice constraint subsequently. In this paper, we found that a model guided by\nthe simplest box-filled masks can accurately predict polyp locations/sizes, but\nsuffers from shape collapsing. In response, we propose two innovative learning\nfashions, Improved Box-dice (IBox) and Contrastive Latent-Anchors (CLA), and\ncombine them to train a robust box-supervised model IBoxCLA. The core idea\nbehind IBoxCLA is to decouple the learning of location/size and shape, allowing\nfor focused constraints on each of them. Specifically, IBox transforms the\nsegmentation map into a proxy map using shape decoupling and confusion-region\nswapping sequentially. Within the proxy map, shapes are disentangled, while\nlocations/sizes are encoded as box-like responses. By constraining the proxy\nmap instead of the raw prediction, the box-filled mask can well supervise\nIBoxCLA without misleading its shape learning. Furthermore, CLA contributes to\nshape learning by generating two types of latent anchors, which are learned and\nupdated using momentum and segmented polyps to steadily represent polyp and\nbackground features. The latent anchors facilitate IBoxCLA to capture\ndiscriminative features within and outside boxes in a contrastive manner,\nyielding clearer boundaries. We benchmark IBoxCLA on five public polyp\ndatasets. The experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of\nIBoxCLA compared to recent fully-supervised polyp segmentation methods, and its\nsuperiority over other box-supervised state-of-the-arts with a relative\nincrease of overall mDice and mIoU by at least 6.5% and 7.5%, respectively.",

Accurately\nrepresenting different sources of uncertainty in stochastic crack growth (SCG)\nprocesses is a non-trivial task. The present work builds on previous research\non physics-based SCG modeling under both material and load-related uncertainty.\nThe aim here is to construct computationally efficient, probabilistic surrogate\nmodels for SCG processes that successfully encode these different sources of\nuncertainty. An approach inspired by latent variable modeling is employed that\nutilizes Gaussian Process (GP) regression models to enable the surrogates to be\nused to generate prior distributions for different Bayesian SHM tasks as the\napplication of interest. Implementation is carried out in a numerical setting\nand model performance is assessed for two fundamental crack SHM problems;\nnamely crack length monitoring (damage quantification) and crack growth\nmonitoring (damage prognosis).",

            "summary": "Prompt-based continual learning is an emerging direction in leveraging\npre-trained knowledge for downstream continual learning, and has almost reached\nthe performance pinnacle under supervised pre-training. However, our empirical\nresearch reveals that the current strategies fall short of their full potential\nunder the more realistic self-supervised pre-training, which is essential for\nhandling vast quantities of unlabeled data in practice. This is largely due to\nthe difficulty of task-specific knowledge being incorporated into instructed\nrepresentations via prompt parameters and predicted by uninstructed\nrepresentations at test time. To overcome the exposed sub-optimality, we\nconduct a theoretical analysis of the continual learning objective in the\ncontext of pre-training, and decompose it into hierarchical components:\nwithin-task prediction, task-identity inference, and task-adaptive prediction.\nFollowing these empirical and theoretical insights, we propose Hierarchical\nDecomposition (HiDe-)Prompt, an innovative approach that explicitly optimizes\nthe hierarchical components with an ensemble of task-specific prompts and\nstatistics of both uninstructed and instructed representations, further with\nthe coordination of a contrastive regularization strategy. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superior performance of HiDe-Prompt and its\nrobustness to pre-training paradigms in continual learning (e.g., up to 15.01%\nand 9.61% lead on Split CIFAR-100 and Split ImageNet-R, respectively).

However, the experimental verification of the\ntopological phase transition and the topological ground state in ZrTe$_{5}$ is\nfull of controversies, mostly due to the difficulty of precisely capturing the\nsmall gap evolution with single-particle band structure measurements.\nAlternatively, the collective excitations of electric charges, known as\nplasmons, in Dirac systems exhibiting unique behavior, can well reflect the\ntopological nature of the band structure. Here, using reflective\nhigh-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), we investigate the\ntemperature-dependent collective excitations of ZrTe$_{5}$, and discover that\nthe plasmon energy in ZrTe$_{5}$ is proportional to the $1/3$ power of the\ncarrier density $n$, which is a unique feature of plasmons in three-dimensional\nDirac systems.

            "summary": "Pocket representations play a vital role in various biomedical applications,\nsuch as druggability estimation, ligand affinity prediction, and de novo drug\ndesign. While existing geometric features and pretrained representations have\ndemonstrated promising results, they usually treat pockets independent of\nligands, neglecting the fundamental interactions between them. However, the\nlimited pocket-ligand complex structures available in the PDB database (less\nthan 100 thousand non-redundant pairs) hampers large-scale pretraining\nendeavors for interaction modeling. To address this constraint, we propose a\nnovel pocket pretraining approach that leverages knowledge from high-resolution\natomic protein structures, assisted by highly effective pretrained small\nmolecule representations. By segmenting protein structures into drug-like\nfragments and their corresponding pockets, we obtain a reasonable simulation of\nligand-receptor interactions, resulting in the generation of over 5 million\ncomplexes. Subsequently, the pocket encoder is trained in a contrastive manner\nto align with the representation of pseudo-ligand furnished by some pretrained\nsmall molecule encoders. Our method, named ProFSA, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various tasks, including pocket druggability prediction,\npocket matching, and ligand binding affinity prediction. Notably, ProFSA\nsurpasses other pretraining methods by a substantial margin. Moreover, our work\nopens up a new avenue for mitigating the scarcity of protein-ligand complex\ndata through the utilization of high-quality and diverse protein structure\ndatabases.",

            "summary": "Dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning contains two phases: model\nrollouts to generate sample for policy learning and real environment\nexploration using current policy for dynamics model learning. However, due to\nthe complex real-world environment, it is inevitable to learn an imperfect\ndynamics model with model prediction error, which can further mislead policy\nlearning and result in sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose\n$\\texttt{COPlanner}$, a planning-driven framework for model-based methods to\naddress the inaccurately learned dynamics model problem with conservative model\nrollouts and optimistic environment exploration. $\\texttt{COPlanner}$ leverages\nan uncertainty-aware policy-guided model predictive control (UP-MPC) component\nto plan for multi-step uncertainty estimation. This estimated uncertainty then\nserves as a penalty during model rollouts and as a bonus during real\nenvironment exploration respectively, to choose actions. Consequently,\n$\\texttt{COPlanner}$ can avoid model uncertain regions through conservative\nmodel rollouts, thereby alleviating the influence of model error.\nSimultaneously, it explores high-reward model uncertain regions to reduce model\nerror actively through optimistic real environment exploration.\n$\\texttt{COPlanner}$ is a plug-and-play framework that can be applied to any\ndyna-style model-based methods.

The extent to which an agent is influenced by unseen\nco-players depends on the agent's policy and the specific scenario. A\nquantitative examination of this relationship sheds light on effectively\ntraining agents for diverse scenarios. In this study, we present the Level of\nInfluence (LoI), a metric quantifying the interaction intensity among agents\nwithin a given scenario and environment. We observe that, generally, a more\ndiverse set of co-play agents during training enhances the generalization\nperformance of the ego agent; however, this improvement varies across distinct\nscenarios and environments. LoI proves effective in predicting these\nimprovement disparities within specific scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a\nLoI-guided resource allocation method tailored to train a set of policies for\ndiverse scenarios under a constrained budget.

These two\nmodels invoke different emission regions and have distinct predictions on the\norigin of light curve variability and spectral evolution. The second brightest\nGRB in history, GRB230307A, provides an ideal laboratory to study the details\nof GRB prompt emission thanks to its extraordinarily high photon statistics and\nthe single broad pulse shape characterized by an energy-dependent\nfast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) profile. Here we demonstrate that its broad\npulse is composed of many rapidly variable short pulses, rather than being the\nsuperposition of many short pulses on top of a slow component. Such a feature\nis consistent with the ICMART picture, which envisages many mini-jets due to\nlocal magnetic reconnection events in a large emission zone far from the GRB\ncentral engine, but raises a great challenge to the internal shock model that\nattributes fast and slow variability components to shocks at different radii\nwith the emission being the superposition of various components.

            "summary": "Junctions are fundamental elements that support qubit locomotion in\ntwo-dimensional ion trap arrays and enhance connectivity in emerging\ntrapped-ion quantum computers. In surface ion traps they have typically been\nimplemented by shaping radio frequency (RF) electrodes in a single plane to\nminimize the disturbance to the pseudopotential. However, this method\nintroduces issues related to RF lead routing that can increase power\ndissipation and the likelihood of voltage breakdown. Here, we propose and\nsimulate a novel two-layer junction design incorporating two perpendicularly\nrotoreflected linear ion traps. The traps are vertically separated, and create\na trapping potential between their respective planes. The orthogonal\norientation of the RF electrodes of each trap relative to the other provides\nperpendicular axes of confinement that can be used to realize transport in two\ndimensions. While this design introduces manufacturing and operating\nchallenges, as now two separate structures have to be precisely positioned\nrelative to each other in the vertical direction and optical access from the\ntop is obscured, it obviates the need to route RF leads below the top surface\nof the trap and eliminates the pseudopotential bumps that occur in typical\njunctions. In this paper the stability of idealized ion transfer in the new\nconfiguration is demonstrated, both by solving the Mathieu equation\nanalytically to identify the stable regions and by numerically modeling ion\ndynamics. Our novel junction layout enhances the flexibility of microfabricated\nion trap control to enable large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing.",

To accurately predict clinical outcomes, it is vital\nto build an accurate predictive model that relates patients' molecular profiles\nwith patients' survival. With complex relationships between survival and\nhigh-dimensional molecular predictors, it is challenging to conduct\nnon-parametric modeling and irrelevant predictors removing simultaneously. In\nthis paper, we build a kernel Cox proportional hazards semi-parametric model\nand propose a novel regularized garrotized kernel machine (RegGKM) method to\nfit the model. We use the kernel machine method to describe the complex\nrelationship between survival and predictors, while automatically removing\nirrelevant parametric and non-parametric predictors through a LASSO penalty. An\nefficient high-dimensional algorithm is developed for the proposed method.\nComparison with other competing methods in simulation shows that the proposed\nmethod always has better predictive accuracy. We apply this method to analyze a\nmultiple myeloma dataset and predict patients' death burden based on their gene\nexpressions.

Consequently, we build upon the\nFisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, which is foundational to human population\ndynamics, to incorporate diffusiophoretic advection. Through simulations, we\ndemonstrate that diffusiophoresis can predict the emergence of population\nhotspots from initially dispersed populations and can enable precise control\nover inter- and intra-population segregation, a capability not achievable\nthrough Fisher-KPP alone.

While recent advances in the Neural Radiance Field have\npredominantly targeted pin-hole cameras, and models for satellite cameras often\ndemand sufficient input views. This paper presents rpcPRF, a Multiplane Images\n(MPI) based Planar neural Radiance Field for Rational Polynomial Camera (RPC).\nUnlike coordinate-based neural radiance fields in need of sufficient views of\none scene, our model is applicable to single or few inputs and performs well on\nimages from unseen scenes. To enable generalization across scenes, we propose\nto use reprojection supervision to induce the predicted MPI to learn the\ncorrect geometry between the 3D coordinates and the images. Moreover, we remove\nthe stringent requirement of dense depth supervision from deep\nmultiview-stereo-based methods by introducing rendering techniques of radiance\nfields. rpcPRF combines the superiority of implicit representations and the\nadvantages of the RPC model, to capture the continuous altitude space while\nlearning the 3D structure. Given an RGB image and its corresponding RPC, the\nend-to-end model learns to synthesize the novel view with a new RPC and\nreconstruct the altitude of the scene. When multiple views are provided as\ninputs, rpcPRF exerts extra supervision provided by the extra views. On the TLC\ndataset from ZY-3, and the SatMVS3D dataset with urban scenes from WV-3, rpcPRF\noutperforms state-of-the-art nerf-based methods by a significant margin in\nterms of image fidelity, reconstruction accuracy, and efficiency, for both\nsingle-view and multiview task.",

            "summary": "Speculative decoding is a pivotal technique to accelerate the inference of\nlarge language models (LLMs) by employing a smaller draft model to predict the\ntarget model's outputs. However, its efficacy can be limited due to the low\npredictive accuracy of the draft model, particularly when faced with diverse\ntext inputs and a significant capability gap between the draft and target\nmodels. We introduce online speculative decoding (OSD) to address this\nchallenge. The main idea is to continually update (multiple) draft model(s) on\nobserved user query data using the abundant excess computational power in an\nLLM serving cluster. Given that LLM inference is memory-bounded, the surplus\ncomputational power in a typical LLM serving cluster can be repurposed for\nonline retraining of draft models, thereby making the training cost-neutral.\nSince the query distribution of an LLM service is relatively simple, retraining\non query distribution enables the draft model to more accurately predict the\ntarget model's outputs, particularly on data originating from query\ndistributions. As the draft model evolves online, it aligns with the query\ndistribution in real time, mitigating distribution shifts. We develop a\nprototype of online speculative decoding based on online knowledge distillation\nand evaluate it using both synthetic and real query data on several popular\nLLMs. The results show a substantial increase in the token acceptance rate by\n0.1 to 0.65, which translates into 1.22x to 3.06x latency reduction.",

Entropy-based adversarial networks are proposed\nto improve source domain prediction; however, they disregard significant\nexternal information, such as edges, which have the potential to identify and\ndistinguish various objects within an image accurately. To address this issue,\nwe introduce a novel approach to domain adaptation, leveraging the synergy of\ninternal and external information within entropy-based adversarial networks. In\nthis approach, we enrich the discriminator network with edge-predicted\nprobability values within this innovative framework to enhance the clarity of\nclass boundaries. Furthermore, we devised a probability-sharing network that\nintegrates diverse information for more effective segmentation. Incorporating\nobject edges addresses a pivotal aspect of unsupervised domain adaptation that\nhas frequently been neglected in the past -- the precise delineation of object\nboundaries. Conventional unsupervised domain adaptation methods usually center\naround aligning feature distributions and may not explicitly model object\nboundaries. Our approach effectively bridges this gap by offering clear\nguidance on object boundaries, thereby elevating the quality of domain\nadaptation. Our approach undergoes rigorous evaluation on the established\nunsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks, specifically in adapting SYNTHIA\n$\\rightarrow$ Cityscapes and SYNTHIA $\\rightarrow$ Mapillary.

Before fixing, developers need to reproduce the crash, which is an\nextremely time-consuming and tedious task. Existing studies conducted the\nautomatic crash reproduction with the natural language described reproducing\nsteps. Yet we find a non-neglectable portion of crash reports only contain the\nstack trace when the crash occurs. Such stack-trace-only crashes merely reveal\nthe last GUI page when the crash occurs, and lack step-by-step guidance.\nDevelopers tend to spend more effort in understanding the problem and\nreproducing the crash, and existing techniques cannot work on this, thus\ncalling for a greater need for automatic support. This paper proposes an\napproach named CrashTranslator to automatically reproduce mobile application\ncrashes directly from the stack trace. It accomplishes this by leveraging a\npre-trained Large Language Model to predict the exploration steps for\ntriggering the crash, and designing a reinforcement learning based technique to\nmitigate the inaccurate prediction and guide the search holistically. We\nevaluate CrashTranslator on 75 crash reports involving 58 popular Android apps,\nand it successfully reproduces 61.3% of the crashes, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art baselines by 109% to 206%.

            "summary": "Video steganography has the potential to be used to convey illegal\ninformation, and video steganalysis is a vital tool to detect the presence of\nthis illicit act. Currently, all the motion vector (MV)-based video\nsteganalysis algorithms extract feature sets directly on the MVs, but ignoring\nthe steganograhic operation may perturb the statistics distribution of other\nvideo encoding elements, such as the skipped macroblocks (no direct MVs). This\npaper proposes a novel 11-dimensional feature set to detect MV-based video\nsteganography based on the above observation. The proposed feature is extracted\nbased on the skipped macroblocks by recompression calibration. Specifically,\nthe feature consists of two components. The first is the probability\ndistribution of motion vector prediction (MVP) difference, and the second is\nthe probability distribution of partition state transfer. Extensive experiments\non different conditions demonstrate that the proposed feature set achieves good\ndetection accuracy, especially in lower embedding capacity. In addition, the\nloss of detection performance caused by recompression calibration using\nmismatched quantization parameters (QP) is within the acceptable range, so the\nproposed method can be used in practical scenarios.",

            "summary": "The classical field approximation is widely used to better understand the\npredictions of ultra-light dark matter. Here, we use the truncated Wigner\napproximation method to test the classical field approximation of ultra-light\ndark matter. This method approximates a quantum state as an ensemble of\nindependently evolving realizations drawn from its Wigner function. The method\nis highly parallelizable and allows the direct simulation of quantum\ncorrections and decoherence times in systems many times larger than have been\npreviously studied in reference to ultra-light dark matter. Our study involves\nsimulation of systems in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions. We simulate three\nsystems, the condensation of a Gaussian random field in three spatial\ndimensions, a stable collapsed object in three spatial dimensions, and the\nmerging of two stable objects in two spatial dimensions. We study the quantum\ncorrections to the classical field theory in each case. We find that quantum\ncorrections grow exponentially during nonlinear growth with the timescale being\napproximately equal to the system dynamical time. In stable systems the\ncorrections grow quadratically. We also find that the primary effect of quantum\ncorrections is to reduce the amplitude of fluctuations on the deBroglie scale\nin the spatial density. Finally, we find that the timescale associated with\ndecoherence due to gravitational coupling to Baryonic matter is at least as\nfast as the quantum corrections due to gravitational interactions. These\nresults strongly imply that quantum corrections do not impact the predictions\nof the classical field theory.",

            "summary": "Engineering regulatory compliance in complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),\nsuch as smart warehouse logistics, is challenging due to the open and dynamic\nnature of these systems, scales, and unpredictable modes of human-robot\ninteractions that can be best learnt at runtime. Traditional offline approaches\nfor engineering compliance often involve modelling at a higher, more abstract\nlevel (e.g. using languages like SysML). These abstract models only support\nanalysis in offline-designed and simplified scenarios. However, open and\ncomplex systems may be unpredictable, and their behaviours are difficult to be\nfully captured by abstract models. These systems may also involve other\nbusiness goals, possibly conflicting with regulatory compliance. To overcome\nthese challenges, fine-grained simulation models are promising to complement\nabstract models and support accurate runtime predictions and performance\nevaluation with trade-off analysis. The novel contribution of this work is a\nDigital Twin-oriented architecture for adaptive compliance leveraging abstract\ngoal modelling, fine-grained agent-based modelling and runtime simulation for\nmanaging compliance trade-offs. A case study from smart warehouse logistics is\nused to demonstrate the approach considering safety and productivity\ntrade-offs.",

            "summary": "At the peak of the tech bubble, only 0.57% of market valuation comes from\ndividends in the next year. Taking the ratio of total market value to the value\nof one-year dividends, we obtain a valuation-based duration of 175 years. In\ncontrast, at the height of the global financial crisis, more than 2.2% of\nmarket value is from dividends in the next year, implying a duration of 46\nyears. What drives valuation duration? We find that market participants have\nlimited information about cash flow beyond one year. Therefore, an increase in\nvaluation duration is due to a decrease in the discount rate rather than good\nnews about long-term growth. Accordingly, valuation duration negatively\npredicts annual market return with an out-of-sample R2 of 15%, robustly\noutperforming other predictors in the literature. While the price-dividend\nratio reflects the overall valuation level, our valuation-based measure of\nduration captures the slope of the valuation term structure. We show that\nvaluation duration, as a discount rate proxy, is a critical state variable that\naugments the price-dividend ratio in spanning the (latent) state space for\nstock-market dynamics.",

In this\npaper we show evidence that the layered hierarchy of DLMs may be used to model\nthe temporal dynamics of language comprehension in the brain by demonstrating a\nstrong correlation between DLM layer depth and the time at which layers are\nmost predictive of the human brain. Our ability to temporally resolve\nindividual layers benefits from our use of electrocorticography (ECoG) data,\nwhich has a much higher temporal resolution than noninvasive methods like fMRI.\nUsing ECoG, we record neural activity from participants listening to a\n30-minute narrative while also feeding the same narrative to a high-performing\nDLM (GPT2-XL). We then extract contextual embeddings from the different layers\nof the DLM and use linear encoding models to predict neural activity. We first\nfocus on the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG, or Broca's area) and then extend our\nmodel to track the increasing temporal receptive window along the linguistic\nprocessing hierarchy from auditory to syntactic and semantic areas. Our results\nreveal a connection between human language processing and DLMs, with the DLM's\nlayer-by-layer accumulation of contextual information mirroring the timing of\nneural activity in high-order language areas.",

However, the\nefficacy of this approach in the graph domain remains unexplored. To bridge\nthis gap, this paper introduces GraphCloak to safeguard against the\nunauthorized usage of graph data. Compared with prior work, GraphCloak offers\nunique significant innovations: (1) graph-oriented, the perturbations are\napplied to both topological structures and descriptive features of the graph;\n(2) effective and stealthy, our cloaking method can bypass various inspections\nwhile causing a significant performance drop in GNNs trained on the cloaked\ngraphs; and (3) stable across settings, our methods consistently perform\neffectively under a range of practical settings with limited knowledge. To\naddress the intractable bi-level optimization problem, we propose two\nerror-minimizing-based poisoning methods that target perturbations on the\nstructural and feature space, along with a subgraph injection poisoning method.\nOur comprehensive evaluation of these methods underscores their effectiveness,\nstealthiness, and stability.

However, a meticulous analysis of qualitative\ndata often requires a significant amount of time, especially during the crucial\ncoding stage. Although there is software specifically designed for qualitative\nevaluation, many of these platforms fall short in terms of automatic coding,\nintuitive usability, and cost-effectiveness. With the rise of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and its successors, we are at the forefront of a\ntransformative era for enhancing qualitative analysis. In this paper, we\nintroduce QualiGPT, a specialized tool designed after considering challenges\nassociated with ChatGPT and qualitative analysis. It harnesses the capabilities\nof the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) and its API for thematic\nanalysis of qualitative data. By comparing traditional manual coding with\nQualiGPT's analysis on both simulated and actual datasets, we verify that\nQualiGPT not only refines the qualitative analysis process but also elevates\nits transparency, credibility, and accessibility. Notably, compared to existing\nanalytical platforms, QualiGPT stands out with its intuitive design,\nsignificantly reducing the learning curve and operational barriers for users.",

We evaluate DKEC on\ntwo real-world medical datasets: the RAA dataset, a collection of 4,417 patient\ncare reports from emergency medical services (EMS) incidents, and a subset of\n53,898 reports from the MIMIC-III dataset. Experimental results show that our\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art, particularly for the few-shot (tail)\nclasses.

To date, most ML approaches for XANES have primarily focused on using\nthe raw spectral intensities as input, overlooking the potential benefits of\nincorporating spectral transformations and dimensionality reduction techniques\ninto ML predictions. In this work, we focused on systematically comparing the\nimpact of different featurization methods on the performance of ML models for\nXAS analysis. We evaluated the classification and regression capabilities of\nthese models on computed datasets and validated their performance on previously\nunseen experimental datasets. Our analysis revealed an intriguing discovery:\nthe cumulative distribution function (CDF) feature achieves both high\nprediction accuracy and exceptional transferability. This remarkably robust\nperformance can be attributed to its tolerance to horizontal shifts in spectra,\nwhich is crucial when validating models using experimental data.

On the other hand, by the works\n\\cite{KQW21,KQ22}, for continuous potentials the topological pressure function\ncan be wild; in particular, it can be infinite phase transitions. In this\npaper, we study the possibilities of behaviour of the topological pressure\nfunction and transfer operator for transitive local diffeomorphism with break\npoints on the circle and Holder continuous potentials. In particular, we showed\nthat: 1-that there is an open and dense subset of continuous potentials such\nthat if a Holder continuous potential belongs to subset then it has no phase\ntransition and the transfer operator has spectral gap property; 2-for Holder\ncontinuous potentials, not cohomologous to constant, the existence of a phase\ntransition is equivalent to the topological pressure function not being\nstrictly convex; 3-if a Holder continuous potential has phase transition, then\nthe topological pressure function and the transfer operator associated have\nbehaviour similar to \\cite{BC21}. Consequently, every Holder continuous\npotential has at most two phase transitions and the set of smooth potential\nsuch that $\\mathcal{L}_{f,\\phi}$ has spectral gap, acting on the Holder\ncontinuous space, is dense in the uniform topology.

We evaluated performance on six clinically relevant tasks\nfrom three anatomic sites and two institutions: breast cancer detection,\ninflammatory bowel disease detection, breast cancer estrogen receptor\nprediction, lung adenocarcinoma EGFR mutation prediction, and lung cancer\nimmunotherapy response prediction.

Typically, the robot builds the navigation\nmaps incrementally from local observations using onboard sensors. Recent works\nhave shown that predicting the structural patterns in the environment through\nlearning-based approaches can greatly enhance task efficiency. While many such\nworks build task-specific networks using limited datasets, we show that the\nexisting foundational vision networks can accomplish the same without any\nfine-tuning. Specifically, we use Masked Autoencoders, pre-trained on street\nimages, to present novel applications for field-of-view expansion, single-agent\ntopological exploration, and multi-agent exploration for indoor mapping, across\ndifferent input modalities. Our work motivates the use of foundational vision\nmodels for generalized structure prediction-driven applications, especially in\nthe dearth of training data.

This approach is based on\nthe combination of advanced imaging techniques, experimental nanostructure\ncharacterization and stochastic modeling of the 3D nanostructure consisting of\nNVP, carbon and pores. By 3D imaging and subsequent post-processing involving\nimage segmentation, the spatial distribution of NVP is resolved in 3D, and the\nspatial distribution of carbon and pores is resolved in 2D. Based on this\ninformation, a parametric stochastic model, specifically a Pluri-Gaussian\nmodel, is calibrated to the 3D morphology of the nanostructured NVP/C\nparticles. Model validation is performed by comparing the nanostructure of\nsimulated NVP/C composites with image data in terms of morphological\ndescriptors which have not been used for model calibration. Finally, the\nstochastic model is used for predictive simulation to quantify the effect of\nvarying the amount of carbon while keeping the amount of NVP constant.

However, in many cases brute force CV is too computationally burdensome\nto form part of interactive modeling workflows, especially when inference\nrelies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper we present a method\nfor conducting fast Bayesian CV by massively parallel MCMC. On suitable\naccelerator hardware, for many applications our approach is about as fast (in\nwall clock time) as a single full-data model fit.\n  Parallel CV is more flexible than existing fast CV approximation methods\nbecause it can easily exploit a wide range of scoring rules and data\npartitioning schemes. This is particularly useful for CV methods designed for\nnon-exchangeable data. Our approach also delivers accurate estimates of Monte\nCarlo and CV uncertainty. In addition to parallelizing computations, parallel\nCV speeds up inference by reusing information from earlier MCMC adaptation and\ninference obtained during initial model fitting and checking of the full-data\nmodel.\n  We propose MCMC diagnostics for parallel CV applications, including a summary\nof MCMC mixing based on the popular potential scale reduction factor\n($\\hat{R}$) and MCMC effective sample size ($\\widehat{ESS}$) measures.\nFurthermore, we describe a method for determining whether an $\\hat{R}$\ndiagnostic indicates approximate stationarity of the chains, that may be of\nmore general interest for applications beyond parallel CV.\n  For parallel CV to work on memory-constrained computing accelerators, we show\nthat parallel CV and associated diagnostics can be implemented using online\n(streaming) algorithms ideal for parallel computing environments with limited\nmemory. Constant memory algorithms allow parallel CV to scale up to very large\nblocking designs.",

This begs the question: can we re-purpose these large-scale\npre-trained static image models for open-vocabulary video tracking? In this\npaper, we re-purpose an open-vocabulary detector, segmenter, and dense optical\nflow estimator, into a model that tracks and segments objects of any category\nin 2D videos. Our method predicts object and part tracks with associated\nlanguage descriptions in monocular videos, rebuilding the pipeline of Tractor\nwith modern large pre-trained models for static image detection and\nsegmentation: we detect open-vocabulary object instances and propagate their\nboxes from frame to frame using a flow-based motion model, refine the\npropagated boxes with the box regression module of the visual detector, and\nprompt an open-world segmenter with the refined box to segment the objects. We\ndecide the termination of an object track based on the objectness score of the\npropagated boxes, as well as forward-backward optical flow consistency. We\nre-identify objects across occlusions using deep feature matching. We show that\nour model achieves strong performance on multiple established video object\nsegmentation and tracking benchmarks, and can produce reasonable tracks in\nmanipulation data. In particular, our model outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art in UVO and BURST, benchmarks for open-world object tracking\nand segmentation, despite never being explicitly trained for tracking.

            "summary": "As a promising fashion for visual localization, scene coordinate regression\n(SCR) has seen tremendous progress in the past decade. Most recent methods\nusually adopt neural networks to learn the mapping from image pixels to 3D\nscene coordinates, which requires a vast amount of annotated training data. We\npropose to leverage Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to generate training samples\nfor SCR. Despite NeRF's efficiency in rendering, many of the rendered data are\npolluted by artifacts or only contain minimal information gain, which can\nhinder the regression accuracy or bring unnecessary computational costs with\nredundant data. These challenges are addressed in three folds in this paper:\n(1) A NeRF is designed to separately predict uncertainties for the rendered\ncolor and depth images, which reveal data reliability at the pixel level. (2)\nSCR is formulated as deep evidential learning with epistemic uncertainty, which\nis used to evaluate information gain and scene coordinate quality. (3) Based on\nthe three arts of uncertainties, a novel view selection policy is formed that\nsignificantly improves data efficiency. Experiments on public datasets\ndemonstrate that our method could select the samples that bring the most\ninformation gain and promote the performance with the highest efficiency.",

In this paper, we explore how a mechanism\nstudied in developmental psychology known as Violation of Expectation (VoE) can\nbe implemented to reduce errors in LLM prediction about users by leveraging\nemergent ToM affordances. And we introduce a \\textit{metacognitive prompting}\nframework to apply VoE in the context of an AI tutor. By storing and retrieving\nfacts derived in cases where LLM expectation about the user was violated, we\nfind that LLMs are able to learn about users in ways that echo theories of\nhuman learning.

The key quantities of band offsets and interface charge\npolarization are examined for different crystallographic orientations [(110),\n(111), or (100)], bond terminations (C-B or C-N), and substrates (diamond or\nc-BN). The results indicate that both the (111) and (100) structures with polar\ninterfaces are likely to be a type-I alignment with the diamond conduction and\nvalence band extrema nested within the c-BN bandgap, whereas the non-polar\n(110) counterpart may form type II as the valence band of c-BN is shifted down\nsubstantially lower. The (111) and (100) structures also show net charge\npolarization in a narrow region at the interface. The electron-deficient and\nelectron-rich nature of the C-B and C-N bonding are found to induce charge\nredistribution leading to an essentially 2D sheet of negative and positive\npolarization. With the predicted band alignments suitable for carrier\nconfinement as well as the possibility of the modulation and polarization\ndoping, the diamond/c-BN heterostructures are a promising candidate for\nhigh-performance electronic devices with a highly conductive 2D channel. Both\np-type and n-type devices appear possible with a judicious choice of the\nheterojunction configuration.",

            "summary": "We propose a geometrically motivated mathematical model which reveals the key\nfeatures of coastal and fluvial fragment shape evolution from the earliest\nstages of the abrasion. Our \\textit{collisional polygon model} governs the\nevolution through an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that determines the\nrounding rate of initially sharp corners in the function of the size reduction.\nAs an approximation, the basic structure of our model adopts the concept of\nBloore's partial differential equation (PDE) in terms of the curvature\ndependent local collisional frequency. We tested our model under various\nconditions and made comparisons with the predictions of Bloore's PDE. Moreover,\nwe applied the model to discover and quantify the mathematical conditions\ncorresponding to typical and special shape evolution. By further extending our\nmodel to investigate the self-dual and mixed cases, we outline a possible\nexplanation of the long-term preservation of initial pebble shape\ncharacteristics.",

However, audiobook narrations involve\ndramatic vocalizations and intonations by the reader, with greater reliance on\nemotions, dialogues, and descriptions in the narrative. Using our dataset of 93\naligned book-audiobook pairs, we present improved models for prosody prediction\nproperties (pitch, volume, and rate of speech) from narrative text using\nlanguage modeling. Our predicted prosody attributes correlate much better with\nhuman audiobook readings than results from a state-of-the-art commercial TTS\nsystem: our predicted pitch shows a higher correlation with human reading for\n22 out of the 24 books, while our predicted volume attribute proves more\nsimilar to human reading for 23 out of the 24 books. Finally, we present a\nhuman evaluation study to quantify the extent that people prefer\nprosody-enhanced audiobook readings over commercial text-to-speech systems.",

            "summary": "In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully employed for\naugmenting low-resolution cosmological simulations with small-scale\ninformation, a task known as \"super-resolution\". So far, these cosmological\nsuper-resolution models have relied on generative adversarial networks (GANs),\nwhich can achieve highly realistic results, but suffer from various\nshortcomings (e.g. low sample diversity). We introduce denoising diffusion\nmodels as a powerful generative model for super-resolving cosmic large-scale\nstructure predictions (as a first proof-of-concept in two dimensions). To\nobtain accurate results down to small scales, we develop a new \"filter-boosted\"\ntraining approach that redistributes the importance of different scales in the\npixel-wise training objective. We demonstrate that our model not only produces\nconvincing super-resolution images and power spectra consistent at the percent\nlevel, but is also able to reproduce the diversity of small-scale features\nconsistent with a given low-resolution simulation. This enables uncertainty\nquantification for the generated small-scale features, which is critical for\nthe usefulness of such super-resolution models as a viable surrogate model for\ncosmic structure formation.",

We show that in certain parameter\nregions the scalar reheaton transfers a substantial energy density to the\nsector with the smallest positive Higgs squared mass while remaining consistent\nwith bounds on additional effective relativistic species. In this sector, all\nsix quarks are much lighter than the corresponding QCD confinement scale,\nallowing for the possibility of a first-order chiral symmetry-breaking phase\ntransition and an associated stochastic gravitational wave signal. We consider\nseveral scenarios characterizing the strongly-coupled phase transition dynamics\nand estimate the gravitational wave spectrum for each. Pulsar timing arrays\n(SKA), spaced-based interferometers (BBO, Ultimate-DECIGO, $\\mu$Ares, asteroid\nranging), and astrometric measurements (THEIA) all have the potential to\nexplore new regions of Nnaturalness parameter space, complementing probes from\nnext generation cosmic microwave background radiation experiments.",

            "summary": "We discuss the unique phenomenology of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs)\ncatalyzed by primordial black holes (BHs). Because of the enhancement of the\nvacuum nucleation rate around a BH, vacuum nucleation can be triggered only\naround BHs. If the average number of BHs within one Hubble volume is smaller\nthan unity at the time of bubble nucleation, each bubble catalyzed around them\nexpands to the Hubble size, and the Hubble patches containing BHs transition to\nthe true vacuum, whereas the rest of the universe remains in the false vacuum.\nAssuming that the vacuum energy difference is negligible in relation to the\ntotal energy until a time close to the bubble collision, most false-vacuum\npatches do not undergo inflation, and the entire universe is eventually filled\nwith true-vacuum bubbles much after BH formation and bubble nucleation. This\n\"super-slow phase transition\" scenario predicts enhanced gravitational wave\nsignals from bubble collisions and can be tested in future observations.\nMoreover, a small fraction of the universe remains in the false vacuum and\ninflates by chance, and the corresponding region can be seen as a BH from an\noutside observer. This scenario of \"birth of baby BHs from parent BHs\" via the\ncatalyzed phase transition can account for the entire dark matter in our\nuniverse.",
