Computer Vision has progressed considerably over the years. From methods only applicable to simple images, it has developed to deal with increasingly complex scenes, volumes and time sequences. A substantial part of this book deals with the problem of designing models that can be used for several purposes with computer vision. These partial models have some general properties of invariance generation and generality in model generation. Signal Processing for Computer Vision is the first book to give a unified treatment of representation and filtering of higher order data, such as vectors and tensors in multidimensional space. Included is a systematic organisation for the implementation of complex models in a hierarchical modular structure and novel material on adaptive filtering using tensor data representation. Signal Processing for Computer Vision is intended for final year undergraduate and graduate students as well as engineers and researchers in the field of computer vision and image processing.",

This cluster of symptoms is known as computer vision syndrome which is characterized by the visual symptoms which result from interaction with computer display or its environment. Three major mechanisms that lead to computer vision syndrome are extraocular mechanism, accommodative mechanism and ocular surface mechanism. The visual effects of the computer such as brightness, resolution, glare and quality all are known factors that contribute to computer vision syndrome. Prevention is the most important strategy in managing computer vision syndrome. Modification in the ergonomics of the working environment, patient education and proper eye care are crucial in managing computer vision syndrome.",

Challenges remain toward belter understanding of stem cell biology and cost-effective strategies for stem cell manufacturing. These challenges call for novel engineering toolsets to study stem cell behaviors and the associated sternness. Towards this goal, we are developing a computer vision based system to automatically and reliably follow the behaviors of individual stem cells in expanding populations. This paper reports on significant progress in our development. In particular, we present a machine-learning approach for detecting spatiotemporal mitosis events without image segmentation. This approach not only improves tracking performance, but can also independently quantify mitoses and cellular divisions. We also employ bilateral filtering to improve cell detection performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system on tracking C2C12 mouse myoblast stem cells.",

In this paper, we discuss the use of GPUs in approximately the reverse way: to assist in ldquoconverting pictures into numbersrdquo (i.e. computer vision). For graphical operations, GPUs currently provide many hundreds of gigaflops of processing power. This paper discusses how this processing power is being harnessed for image processing and computer vision, thereby providing dramatic speedups on commodity, readily available graphics hardware. A brief review of algorithms mapped to the GPU by using the graphics API for vision is presented. The NVIDIA CUDA programming model is then introduced as a way of expressing program parallelism without the need for graphics expertise.",

The central component of the framework is a standalone application for fast and robust tracking of fiducial markers in a real-time video stream. The framework also defines a transport protocol for efficient and reliable transmission of object states via a local or wide area network. In addition, the distribution includes a collection of client example projects for various programming environments that allow the rapid development of unique tangible user interfaces. This article also provides a discussion of key points relevant to the construction of the necessary table hardware and surveys some projects that have been based on this technology.",

When people play the game they help determine the contents of images by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is played as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem. Rather than using computer vision techniques, which don't work well enough, we encourage people to do the work by taking advantage of their desire to be entertained.",

We consider vision systems, which cannot only look out of the vehicle to detect and track roads and avoid hitting obstacles or pedestrians but simultaneously look inside the vehicle to monitor the attentiveness of the driver and even predict her intentions. In this paper, a systems-oriented framework for developing computer-vision technology for safer automobiles is presented. We will consider three main components of the system: environment, vehicle, and driver. We will discuss various issues and ideas for developing models for these main components as well as activities associated with the complex task of safe driving. This paper includes a discussion of novel sensory systems and algorithms for capturing not only the dynamic surround information of the vehicle but also the state, intent, and activity patterns of drivers",

In many cases, unary costs of the energy depend linearly on parameter lambda. In this paper we study vision applications for which it is important to solve the maxflow problem for different lambda's. An example is a weighting between data and regularization terms in image segmentation or stereo: it is desirable to vary it both during training (to learn lambda from ground truth data) and testing (to select best lambda using high-knowledge constraints, e.g. user input). We review algorithmic aspects of this parametric maximum flow problem previously unknown in vision, such as the ability to compute all breakpoints of lambda and corresponding optimal configurations infinite time. These results allow, in particular, to minimize the ratio of some geometric functional, such as flux of a vector field over length (or area). Previously, such functional were tackled with shortest path techniques applicable only in 2D. We give theoretical improvements for \"PDE cuts\" [5]. We present experimental results for image segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and the cosegmentation problem.",

Our system is suitable for embedded computer vision application based on three reasons. Firstly, the system was based on a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier where classification progress can be implemented easily and quickly in embedded hardware. Secondly, we use compacted motion features easily obtained from videos. We address the limitations of the well known motion history image (MHI) and propose a new hierarchical motion history histogram (HMHH) feature to represent the motion information. HMHH not only provides rich motion information, but also remains computationally inexpensive. Finally, we combine MHI and HMHH together and extract a low dimension feature vector to be used in the SVM classifiers. Experimental results show that our system achieves significant improvement on the recognition performance.",

            "abstract": "Measuring the effects of mutation, natural variation or treatment on the development of plant form is often complicated by the shapes, dynamics or small size of the organismal structures under study. This limits accuracy and throughput of measurement and thereby limits progress toward understanding the underlying gene networks and signaling systems. A computer-vision platform based on electronic image capture and shape-analysis algorithms was developed as an alternative to the mostly manual methods of measuring seedling development currently in use. The spatial and temporal resolution of the method is in the range of microns and minutes, respectively. The algorithm simultaneously quantifies apical hook opening and inhibition of hypocotyl elongation during photomorphogenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. It can determine when and where gravitropic curvature develops along the root axis in A. thaliana and Medicago truncatula seedlings. Novel features of gravitropic curvature development were discovered as a result of the high resolution. The computer-vision algorithms developed and demonstrated here could be used to study mutant phenotypes in detail, to form the basis of a high-throughput screening platform, or to quantify natural variation in a population of plants.",

            "abstract": "Personal computers are one of the commonest office tools in Malaysia today. Their usage, even for three hours per day, leads to a health risk of developing Occupational Overuse Syndrome (OOS), Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS), low back pain, tension headaches and psychosocial stress. The study was conducted to investigate how a multiethnic society in Malaysia is coping with these problems that are increasing at a phenomenal rate in the west. This study investigated computer usage, awareness of ergonomic modifications of computer furniture and peripherals, symptoms of CVS and risk of developing OOS. A cross-sectional questionnaire study of 136 computer users was conducted on a sample population of university students and office staff. A 'Modified Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) for office work' technique was used for evaluation of OOS. The prevalence of CVS was surveyed incorporating a 10-point scoring system for each of its various symptoms. It was found that many were using standard keyboard and mouse without any ergonomic modifications. Around 50% of those with some low back pain did not have an adjustable backrest. Many users had higher RULA scores of the wrist and neck suggesting increased risk of developing OOS, which needed further intervention. Many (64%) were using refractive corrections and still had high scores of CVS commonly including eye fatigue, headache and burning sensation. The increase of CVS scores (suggesting more subjective symptoms) correlated with increase in computer usage spells. It was concluded that further onsite studies are needed, to follow up this survey to decrease the risks of developing CVS and OOS amongst young computer users.",

Computer vision-based sorting of fillets according to their color was studied on 2 separate groups of salmon fillets. The images of fillets were captured using a digital camera of high resolution. Images of salmon fillets were then segmented in the regions of interest and analyzed in red, green, and blue (RGB) and CIE Lightness, redness, and yellowness (Lab) color spaces, and classified according to the Roche color card industrial standard. Comparisons of fillet color between visual evaluations were made by a panel of human inspectors, according to the Roche SalmoFan lineal standard, and the color scores generated from computer vision algorithm showed that there were no significant differences between the methods. Overall, computer vision can be used as a powerful tool to sort fillets by color in a fast and nondestructive manner. The low cost of implementing computer vision solutions creates the potential to replace manual labor in fish processing plants with automation.",

Starting with the sentence: \u201cThe most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.\u201d Weiser envisioned a world where you are surrounded by hidden, embedded, invisible, and yet networked systems, which he called ubiquitous computers. In this paper, we will look at the main points from Weiser's paper, and discuss it's impact on the field of computer science and our current lifestyle.",

A target image in a sequence of nontarget distractor images elicits in the EEG a stereotypical spatiotemporal response, which can be detected. A pattern classifier uses this response to reprioritize the image sequence, placing detected targets in the front of an image stack. We use single-trial analysis based on linear discrimination to recover spatial components that reflect differences in EEG activity evoked by target versus nontarget images. We find an optimal set of spatial weights for 59 EEG sensors within a sliding 50-ms time window. Using this simple classifier allows us to process EEG in real time. The detection accuracy across five subjects is on average 92%, i.e., in a sequence of 2500 images, resorting images based on detector output results in 92% of target images being moved from a random position in the sequence to one of the first 250 images (first 10% of the sequence). The approach leverages the highly robust and invariant object recognition capabilities of the human visual system, using single-trial EEG analysis to efficiently detect neural signatures correlated with the recognition event.",

            "abstract": "Estimation techniques in computer vision applications must estimate accurate model parameters despite small-scale noise in the data, occasional large-scale measurement errors (outliers), and measurements from multiple populations in the same data set. Increasingly, robust estimation techniques, some borrowed from the statistics literature and others described in the computer vision literature, have been used in solving these parameter estimation problems. Ideally, these techniques should effectively ignore the outliers and measurements from other populations, treating them as outliers, when estimating the parameters of a single population. Two frequently used techniques are least-median of squares (LMS) [P. J. Rousseeuw, {J. Amer. Statist. Assoc., 79 (1984), pp. 871--880] and M-estimators [Robust Statistics: The Approach Based on Influence Functions, F. R. Hampel et al., John Wiley, 1986; Robust Statistics, P. J. Huber, John Wiley, 1981]. LMS handles large fractions of outliers, up to the theoretical limit of 50% for estimators invariant to affine changes to the data, but has low statistical efficiency. M-estimators have higher statistical efficiency but tolerate much lower percentages of outliers unless properly initialized. \nWhile robust estimators have been used in a variety of computer vision applications, three are considered here. In analysis of range images---images containing depth or X, Y, Z measurements at each pixel instead of intensity measurements---robust estimators have been used successfully to estimate surface model parameters in small image regions. In stereo and motion analysis, they have been used to estimate parameters of what is called the ''fundamental matrix,'' which characterizes the relative imaging geometry of two cameras imaging the same scene. Recently, robust estimators have been applied to estimating a quadratic image-to-image transformation model necessary to create a composite, ''mosaic image'' from a series of images of the human retina. In each case, a straightforward application of standard robust estimators is insufficient, and carefully developed extensions are used to solve the problem.",

This framework integrates boundary- and region-based frame partition modules under a curve-based objective function, which aims at finding a set of minimal length curves that preserve three main properties: (i) they are regular and smooth, (ii) they are attracted by the boundary points (boundary-based information), (iii) and they create a partition that is optimal according to the expected region properties of the different hypotheses (region-based information). The defined objective function is minimized using a gradient descent method. According to the obtained motion equations, the set of initial curves is propagated toward the best partition under the influence of boundary- and region-based forces, and is constrained by a regularity force. The changes of topology are naturally handled thanks to the level set implementation. Furthermore, a coupled multiphase propagation that imposes the idea of mutually exclusive propagating curves and increases the robustness as well as the convergence rate is proposed. The proposed framework has been validated using three important applications in computer vision, the tasks of image and supervised texture segmentation in low-level vision and the task of motion estimation and tracking in motion analysis.",

            "abstract": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been widely used for the representation of shape, appearance and motion. One drawback of typical PCA methods is that they are least squares estimation techniques and hence fail to account for \"outliers\" which are common in realistic training sets. In computer vision applications, outliers typically occur within a sample (image) due to pixels that are corrupted by noise, alignment errors, or occlusion. We review previous approaches for making PCA robust to outliers and present a new method that uses an intra-sample outlier process to account for pixel outliers. We develop the theory of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and describe a robust M-estimation algorithm for learning linear multi-variate representations of high dimensional data such as images. Quantitative comparisons with traditional PCA and previous robust algorithms illustrate the benefits of RPCA when outliers are present. Details of the algorithm are described and a software implementation is being made publically available.",

In this paper, we propose using GPUs in approximately the reverse way: to assist in \"converting pictures into numbers\" (i.e. computer vision). The OpenVIDIA project uses single or multiple graphics cards to accelerate image analysis and computer vision. It is a library and API aimed at providing a graphics hardware accelerated processing framework for image processing and computer vision. OpenVIDIA explores the creation of a parallel computer architecture consisting of multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) built entirely from commodity hardware. OpenVIDIA uses multiple Graphic.Processing Units in parallel to operate as a general-purpose parallel computer architecture. It provides a simple API which implements some common computer vision algorithms. Many components can be used immediately and because the project is Open Source, the code is intended to serve as templates and examples for how similar algorithms are mapped onto graphics hardware. Implemented are image processing techniques (Canny edge detection, filtering), image feature handling (identifying and matching features) and image registration, to name a few.",

Traffic engineers, however, are more interested in monitoring freeways when there is congestion, and current systems break down for congested traffic due to the problem of partial occlusion. We are developing a feature-based tracking approach for the task of tracking vehicles under congestion. Instead of tracking entire vehicles, vehicle sub-features are tracked to make the system robust to partial occlusion. In order to group together sub-features that come from the same vehicle, the constraint of common motion is used. In this paper we describe the system, a real-time implementation using a network of DSP chips, and experiments of the system on approximately 44 lane hours of video data.",

We assume a training set of images in which corresponding landmark points have been marked on every image. From this data we can compute a statistical model of the shape variation, a model of the texture variation and a model of the correlations between shape and texture. With enough training examples such models should be able to synthesize any image of normal anatomy. By finding the parameters which optimize the match between a synthesized model image and a target image we can locate all the structures represented by the model. Two approaches to the matching will be described. The Active Shape Model essentially matches a model to boundaries in an image. The Active Appearance Model finds model parameters which synthesize a complete image which is as similar as possible to the target image. By using a difference decomposition approach the current difference between target image and synthesized model image can be used to update the model parameters, leading to rapid matching of complex models. We will demonstrate the application of such models to a variety of different problems.",

Main topics are static and dynamic stereo analysis, shape from shading, photometric stereo analysis, and structured lighting. The selected procedures, e.g., complex algorithms as Tsai calibration, Frankot-Chellapa depth map generation, or Lee-Rosenfeld shape from shading, are discussed at a detailed level such that implementations can follow the given descriptions. Fundamentals are given for these application oriented approaches with respect to camera modeling and calibration, to geometric surface modeling, and to surface reflectance models. New research and laboratory results in shape reconstruction and depth analysis, e.g., based on color images, have been included. The text is suitable for graduate courses in computer science, in several engineering disciplines, or in applied mathematics. Theoretical and applied exercises accompany each chapter.",

Where the application of this technique differs in computer vision from other fields is in the variety and severity of the registration transformation between the images. In particular this transformation is generally unknown, and a significant component of solving the SR problem in computer vision is the estimation of the transformation. The transformation may have a simple parametric form, or it may be scene dependent and have to be estimated for every point. In either case the transformation is estimated directly and automatically from the images. We describe the two key components that are necessary for successful SR restoration: the accurate alignment or registration of the LR images and the formulation of an SR estimator that uses a generative image model together with a prior model of the super-resolved image itself. As with many other problems in computer vision, these different aspects are tackled in a robust, statistical framework.",

This paper focuses on the problem of music identification, where the goal is to reliably identify a song given a few seconds of noisy audio. Our approach treats the spectrogram of each music clip as a 2D image and transforms music identification into a corrupted sub-image retrieval problem. By employing pairwise boosting on a large set of Viola-Jones features, our system learns compact, discriminative, local descriptors that are amenable to efficient indexing. During the query phase, we retrieve the set of song snippets that locally match the noisy sample and employ geometric verification in conjunction with an EM-based \"occlusion\" model to identify the song that is most consistent with the observed signal. We have implemented our algorithm in a practical system that can quickly and accurately recognize music from short audio samples in the presence of distortions such as poor recording quality and significant ambient noise. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in content-based music identification.",

            "abstract": "Energy minimization is an elegant approach to computer vision. Vision problems usually have many solutions due to uncertainties in the imaging process and ambiguities in visual interpretation. The energy function encodes the problem constraints, and its minimum gives the optimal solution. Despite numerous advantages, this approach is severely limited by the high computational cost. \nThe main contribution of my thesis lies in developing efficient combinatorial optimization algorithms for several important classes of energy functions which incorporate everywhere smooth, piecewise constant, and piecewise smooth priors. These priors assume, respectively, that the quantity to be estimated varies smoothly over its domain, consist of several pieces with constant values, or consist of several pieces with smoothly varying values. The algorithms rely on graph cuts as a powerful optimization technique. \nFor a certain everywhere smooth prior we develop an algorithm which finds the exact minimum by computing a single graph cut. This method is most suitable to estimate quantities without discontinuities. But even when discontinuities exist, the method produces good results in certain cases. The running time is low order polynomial. \nFor several wide classes of piecewise smooth priors we develop two approximation algorithms (we show that exact minimization in NP-hard in these cases). These algorithms produce a local minimum in interesting large move spaces. Furthermore, one of them finds a solution within a known factor from the optimum. The algorithms are iterative and compute several graph cuts at each iteration. The running time at each iteration is effectively linear due to the special graph structure. In practice it takes just a few iterations to converge. Moreover most of the progress happens during the first iteration. \nFor a certain piecewise constant prior we adapt the algorithms developed for the piecewise smooth prior. One of them finds a solution within a factor of two from the optimum. In addition we develop a third algorithm which finds a local minimum in yet another move space. \nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo, and motion. For the data with ground truth, our methods significantly outperform standard methods.",

The viability of the proposed biometric is shown both theoretically in terms of the uniqueness and measurability over time of the ear, and in practice through the implementation of a computer vision based system. Each subject's ear is modeled as an adjacency graph built from the Voronoi diagram of its curve segments. We introduce a novel graph matching based algorithm for authentication which takes into account the erroneous curve segments which can occur due to changes (e.g., lighting, shadowing, and occlusion) in the ear image. This class of biometrics is ideal for passive identification because the features are robust and can be reliably extracted from a distance.",

The proposed robust competitive agglomeration (RCA) algorithm starts with a large number of clusters to reduce the sensitivity to initialization, and determines the actual number of clusters by a process of competitive agglomeration. Noise immunity is achieved by incorporating concepts from robust statistics into the algorithm. RCA assigns two different sets of weights for each data point: the first set of constrained weights represents degrees of sharing, and is used to create a competitive environment and to generate a fuzzy partition of the data set. The second set corresponds to robust weights, and is used to obtain robust estimates of the cluster prototypes. By choosing an appropriate distance measure in the objective function, RCA can be used to find an unknown number of clusters of various shapes in noisy data sets, as well as to fit an unknown number of parametric models simultaneously. Several examples, such as clustering/mixture decomposition, line/plane fitting, segmentation of range images, and estimation of motion parameters of multiple objects, are shown.",

As the state-space of a model grows, the dependencies between the dimensions lead to an exponential growth in computation when performing inference. Many common computer vision problems naturally map onto the graphical model framework; the representation is a graph where each node contains a portion of the state-space and there is an edge between two nodes only if they are not independent conditional on the other nodes in the graph. When this graph is sparsely connected, belief propagation algorithms can turn an exponential inference computation into one, which is linear in the size of the graph. However belief propagation is only applicable when the variables in the nodes are discrete-valued or jointly represented by a single multivariate Gaussian distribution, and this rules out many computer vision applications. This paper combines belief propagation with ideas from particle filtering; the resulting algorithm performs inference on graphs containing both cycles and continuous-valued latent variables with general conditional probability distributions. Such graphical models have wide applicability in the computer vision domain and we test the algorithm on example problems of low-level edge linking and locating jointed structures in clutter.",

            "abstract": "During the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) landings, the descent image motion estimation system (DIMES) was used for horizontal velocity estimation. The DIMES algorithm combined measurements from a descent camera, a radar altimeter, and an inertial measurement unit. To deal with large changes in scale and orientation between descent images, the algorithm used altitude and attitude measurements to rectify images to a level ground plane. Feature selection and tracking were employed in the rectified images to compute the horizontal motion between images. Differences of consecutive motion estimates were then compared to inertial measurements to verify correct feature tracking. DIMES combined sensor data from multiple sources in a novel way to create a low-cost, robust, and computationally efficient velocity estimation solution, and DIMES was the first use of computer vision to control a spacecraft during planetary landing. This paper presents the detailed implementation of the DIMES algorithm and the results from the two landings on Mars.",

On the one hand the algorithms require considerable computing power to work reliably in real-time and under a wide range of lighting conditions. On the other hand, the cost must be kept low, the package size must be small and the power consumption must be low. In addition, automotive qualified parts must be used both to withstand the harsh operating environment and to guarantee long product life. To meet all these conflicting requirements Mobileye developed the EyeQ, a complete \u2019system on a chip\u2019 (SoC) which has the computing power to support a variety of applications such as lane, vehicle and pedestrian detection. This paper describes the process of designing an ASIC to support a family of vision algorithms.",

The method is based on solving an analogous template problem over a finite field, and then using the elimination order established for this problem for the original class of problems. A strength of this method is that this permits pivoting in the elimination. Solvers for several minimal problems in computer vision are presented. Relative pose is solved both for a generalised camera, and for a camera with unknown focal length, both in two positions with six visible points. A solver for optimal triangulation in three images is presented. Model-free calibration for pinhole cameras is investigated. It is shown that for a smooth deformation of the image plane, the image plane can be projectively reconstructed from two flow-fields from purely translating cameras. Methods for hand-eye calibration using the multilinear constraints and vehicle-eye for laser-scanner based navigation systems are presented. (Less)",

In computer vision geometric models provide a goal for descriptive image analysis, an origin for verification image synthesis, and a context for spatial problem solving.

The MVE estimator identifies the least volume region containing h percent of the data points. The clustering algorithm iteratively partitions the space into clusters without prior information about their number. At each iteration, the MVE estimator is applied several times with values of h decreasing from 0.5. A cluster is hypothesized for each ellipsoid. The shapes of these clusters are compared with shapes corresponding to a known unimodal distribution by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The best fitting cluster is then removed from the space, and a new iteration starts. Constrained random sampling keeps the computation low. The clustering algorithm was successfully applied to several computer vision problems formulated in the feature space paradigm: multithresholding of gray level images, analysis of the Hough space, and range image segmentation. >",

            "abstract": "A review of previous studies to automate the location of fruit on trees using computer vision methods was \nperformed. The main features of these approaches are described, paying special attention to the sensors and accessories \nutilized for capturing tree images, the image processing strategy used to detect the fruit, and the results obtained in terms \nof the correct/false detection rates and the ability to detect fruit independent of its maturity stage. The majority of these \nworks use CCD cameras to capture the images and use local or shape-based analysis to detect the fruit. Systems using \nlocal analysis, like intensity or color pixel classification, allow for rapid detection and were able to detect fruit at specific \nmaturity stages, i.e., fruit with a color different from the background. However, systems based on shape analysis were \nmore independent of hue changes, were not limited to detecting fruit with a color different from the color of the \nbackground; however, their algorithms were more time consuming. The best results obtained indicate that more than 85% \nof visible fruits are usually detectable, although with CCD sensors there were a number of false detections that in most \ncases were above >5%. The approaches using range images and shape analysis were capable of detecting fruit of any \ncolor, did not generate false alarms, and gave precise information about the fruit three-dimensional position. In spite of \nthese promising results, the problem of total fruit occlusion limits the amount of fruit that can be harvested, ranging from \n40 to 100% of total fruit, depending on fruiting and viewing conditions. This fact seriously affects the feasibility of future \nharvesting robots relying on images that do not contain a high percentage of visible fruit. Therefore, new techniques to \nreduce total occlusion should be studied in order to make the process feasible.",

As an example computer vision algorithm, we implement a real-time projective camera motion tracking routine on modern, GeForce FX class GPUs (graphics processing units). Algorithms are implemented using OpenGL and the nVIDIA Cg fragment shaders. Trade-offs between computer vision requirements and GPU resources are discussed. Algorithm implementation is examined closely, and hardware bottlenecks are addressed to examine the performance of GPU architecture for computer vision. It is shown that significant speedups can be achieved, while leaving the CPU free for other signal processing tasks. Applications of our work include wearable, computer mediated reality systems that use both computer vision and computer graphics, and require realtime processing with low-latency and high throughput provided by modem GPUs.",

A WOz study was carried out with 34 children of ages 7 to 9 in order to find out the most intuitive movements for game controls and to evaluate the relationship between avatar and player actions. Our study extends the previous Wizard of Oz studies by showing that WOz prototyping of perceptive action games is feasible despite the delay caused by the wizard. The results also show that distinctive movement categories and gesture patterns can be found by observing the children playing games controlled by a human wizard. The approach minimizes the need for fully functional prototypes in the early stages of the design and provides video material for testing and developing computer vision algorithms, as well as guidelines for animating the game character.",

The reconfigurable parallel-processing system assumed for the discussions is a multiprocessor system capable of mixed-mode parallelism; that is, it can operate in either the SIMD or MIMD modes of parallelism and can dynamically switch between modes at instruction-level granularity with generally negligible overhead. In addition, it can be partitioned into independent or communicating submachines, each having the same characteristics as the original machine. Furthermore, this reconfigurable system model uses a flexible multistage cube interconnection network, which allows the connection patterns among the processors to be varied. It is demonstrated how reconfigurability can be used by reviewing and examining five computer-vision-related algorithms, each one emphasizing a different aspect of reconfigurability.<<ETX>>",

In this article, four applications are surveyed: nonlinear diffusion filtering, variational image regularization, optic flow estimation, and geodesic active contours. For each of these techniques we explain the main ideas, discuss theoretical properties and present an appropriate numerical scheme. The numerical schemes are based on additive operator splittings (AOS). In contrast to traditional multiplicative splittings such as ADI, LOD or D'yakonov splittings, all axes are treated in the same manner, and additional possibilities for efficient realizations on parallel and distributed architectures appear. Geodesic active contours lead to equations that resemble mean curvature motion. For this application, a novel AOS scheme is presented that uses harmonie averaging and does not require reinitializations of the distance function in each iteration step.",

They compare knowledge representation schemes of formal logic, semantic nets, production systems, and frames with respect to procedural and descriptive capability. They discuss control strategies, highlighting issues of parallel vs. sequential control, local vs. global control, distributed vs. centralized control, and top-down vs. bottom-up approaches. The authors develop these concepts within the framework of well-known systems such as Acronym, Hearsay, and VISIONS, providing a review of the major issues in computer vision.<<ETX>>",

The perceptual organization work in computer vision in the context of this classificatory structure is reviewed.

In order to move the cursor on the computer screen the user simply moves the mouse shaped passive device placed on a surface within the viewing area of the camera. The video generated by the camera is analyzed using computer vision techniques and the computer moves the cursor according to mouse movements. The computer vision based mouse has regions corresponding to buttons for clicking. To click a button the user simply covers one of these regions with his/her finger.",

The approach is tailored to a well structured highway environment with good lanemarkings. Contour correlation and high order world models are the basic elements of the method, realised in a special multi-microprocessor (on board) computer system. Perspec-tive projection and dynamical models (Kalman filter) are used in an integrated approach for the design of the visual feedback control system. By determining road curvature explicity from the visual input, previously encountered steady state errors in curves are eliminated. The performance of the system will be demonstrated by a video film. The operation of the image sequence processing system has been tested on a typical Autobahn-scene at velocities up to 100 km/h.",
