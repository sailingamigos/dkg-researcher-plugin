Unlike systems that are designed principally to support image processing, Vista provides for the easy creation and use of arbitrary data types, such as are needed for many areas of computer vision research.<<ETX>>",

A brief history of perceptual organization research in both humans and computer vision is offered. A classificatory structure in which to cast perceptual organization research to clarify both the nomenclature and the relationships among the many contributions is proposed. The perceptual organization work in computer vision in the context of this classificatory structure is reviewed. The array of computational techniques applied to perceptual organization problems in computer vision is surveyed. >",

            "abstract": "The Errors-in-Variables (EIV) model from statistics is often employed in computer vision though only rarely under this name. In an EIV model all the measurements are corrupted by noise while the a priori information is captured with a nonlinear constraint among the true (unknown) values of these measurements. To estimate the model parameters and the uncorrupted data, the constraint can be linearized, i.e., embedded in a higher dimensional space. We show that linearization introduces data-dependent (heteroscedastic) noise and propose an iterative procedure, the heteroscedastic EIV (HEIV) estimator to obtain consistent estimates in the most general, multivariate case. Analytical expressions for the covariances of the parameter estimates and corrected data points, a generic method for the enforcement of ancillary constraints arising from the underlying geometry are also given. The HEIV estimator minimizes the first order approximation of the geometric distances between the measurements and the true data points, and thus can be a substitute for the widely used Levenberg-Marquardt based direct solution of the original nonlinear problem. The HEIV estimator has however the advantage of a weaker dependence on the initial solution and a faster convergence. In comparison to Kanatani's renormalization paradigm (an earlier solution of the same problem) the HEIV estimator has more solid theoretical foundations which translate into better numerical behavior We show that the HEIV estimator can provide an accurate solution to most 3D vision estimation tasks, and illustrate its performance through two case studies: calibration and the estimation of the fundamental matrix.",

In mammography, computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques have been used successfully to detect or to characterize abnormalities on digital images. Radiologists supplied with this information often perform better at mammographic detection or characterization tasks in observer studies than do unaided radiologists. This technology therefore could decrease errors in mammographic interpretation that continue to plague human observers.",

In this article, four applications are surveyed: nonlinear diffusion filtering, variational image regularization, optic flow estimation, and geodesic active contours. For each of these techniques we explain the main ideas, discuss theoretical properties and present an appropriate numerical scheme. The numerical schemes are based on additive operator splittings (AOS). In contrast to traditional multiplicative splittings such as ADI, LOD or D'yakonov splittings, all axes are treated in the same manner, and additional possibilities for efficient realizations on parallel and distributed architectures appear. Geodesic active contours lead to equations that resemble mean curvature motion. For this application, a novel AOS scheme is presented that uses harmonie averaging and does not require reinitializations of the distance function in each iteration step.",

They compare knowledge representation schemes of formal logic, semantic nets, production systems, and frames with respect to procedural and descriptive capability. They discuss control strategies, highlighting issues of parallel vs. sequential control, local vs. global control, distributed vs. centralized control, and top-down vs. bottom-up approaches. The authors develop these concepts within the framework of well-known systems such as Acronym, Hearsay, and VISIONS, providing a review of the major issues in computer vision.<<ETX>>",

The convergence of these two specialties in the field of Computer Vision and Image Processing (CVIP) is the subject of this pragmatic book, written from an applications perspective and accompanied by its own educational and developmentsoftware environment, CVIPtools. Illustrated with hundreds of examples, Computer Vision and Image Processing brings together the theory of computer imaging with the tools needed for practical research and development. \n \nThe first part of Computer Vision and Image Processing presents a system model for each of the major application areas of CVIP, relating each specific algorithm to the overall process of applications development. \n \nThe areas covered are: \n \n \n \nImage analysis \n \nImage restoration \n \nImage enhancement \n \nImage compression \n \n \n \nComputer Vision and Image Processing's second half focuses on the use of the CVIPtools environment, the software developed especially by the author and included on the accompanying CD-ROM. These advanced chapters discuss: \n \n \n \nSoftware features and applications \n \n \n \nCVIPtools software development environment \n \n \n \nLibrary descriptions and function prototypes \n \n \n \nCVIPtools is a GUI-based application, which includes an extended Tcl shell, that is ANSI-C compatible and runs on most flavors of UNIX and Windows NT/95. \n \nTo get the most out of Computer Vision and Image Processing, a basic background in mathematics and computers is necessary. Knowledge of the C programming language will enhance the usefulness of the algorithms used in programming, and an understanding of signal and system theory is helpful in mastering transforms and compression. \n \nEngineers, programmers, graphics specialists, multimedia developers, and medical imaging professionals will all appreciate Computer Vision and Image Processing's solid introduction for anyone who uses computer imaging.",

Although the two \u00ae elds have a long-standing tradition and can be considered technologically mature, past research in applying ML techniques to CV problems has been limited. After a short introduction in the \u00ae elds of computer vision and machine learning, we highlight some important issues in the intersection of the two areas and sketch both current achievements and future research directions. Our goal is to help the reader put the six contributions of this special issue into the proper context.",

This paper proposes a new paradigm for a modular computer vision system which is both data directed and knowledge based. The system consists of three different types of units, two of which are associative data memories implemented as relational databases. The short-term memory (STM) contains the raw color picture data and the most current interpretations and deductions about the original scene. The long-term memory (LTM) contains a detailed model of the scene under consideration. A collection of analysis processors, each of which is specialized for a particular task, can communicate with both of these memories. The information in the LTM remains unchanged during the analysis, while the STM is being continually updated and revised by the appropriate processors. The latter may be conceived of as being activated by certain data conditions in the STM, and using the information in both the LTM and STM to alter the status of the STM.",

Algorithms in computer vision are characterized by complex and repetitive operations on large amounts of data involving a variety of data interactions (e.g., point operations, neighborhood operations, global operations). In this paper, we describe the use of the custom computing approach to meet the computation and communication needs of computer vision algorithms. By customizing hardware architecture at the instruction level for every application, the optimal grain size needed for the problem at hand and the instruction granularity can be matched. A custom computing approach can also reuse the same hardware by reconfiguring at the software level for different levels of the computer vision application. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach using Splash 2-a Xilinx 4010-based custom computer.",

Determination of the performance of a total computer vision algorithm is possible if the performance of each of the sub-algorithm constituents is given. The problem, however, is that for most published algorithms, there is no performance characterization which has been established in the research literature. This is an awful state of affairs for the engineers whose job it is to design and build image analysis or machine vision systems.",

It covers even the most recent research and will provide a useful and current reference for professionals working in the fields of machine vision, image processing, and pattern recognition. \nAn outgrowth of the author's course at MIT, Robot Vision presents a solid framework for understanding existing work and planning future research. Its coverage includes a great deal of material that is important to engineers applying machine vision methods in the real world. The chapters on binary image processing, for example, help explain and suggest how to improve the many commercial devices now available. And the material on photometric stereo and the extended Gaussian image points the way to what may be the next thrust in commercialization of the results in this area. \nChapters in the first part of the book emphasize the development of simple symbolic descriptions from images, while the remaining chapters deal with methods that exploit these descriptions. The final chapter offers a detailed description of how to integrate a vision system into an overall robotics system, in this case one designed to pick parts out of a bin. \nThe many exercises complement and extend the material in the text, and an extensive bibliography will serve as a useful guide to current research. \nErrata (164k PDF)",

We describe some of our experiences in attempting to employ contextual information in computer vision systems. By making explicit the built-in assumptions inherent in all computer vision algorithms, an architecture can be designed in which context can innuence the recognition process. This paper describes such an architecture for context-based vision (CBV).",

Fortunately, the interactive application often constrains the vision problem to be solved, allowing fast and simple vision algorithms to be used. This paper gives a brief survey of existing vision-based interactive systems. These systems typically use a number of basic vision algorithms. We describe the basic algorithms used by some systems we have built at MERL: vision-based computer games, a television set controlled by hand gestures, and 3-D head tracking.

A rich description of a scene is obtained by integrating range data and color data. Interpretation of a scene requires the use of the knowledge or models of objects. Based on the knowledge, most effective process is triggered at each stage depending on what kind of information is obtained at that stage. In this paradigm, a monocular image of a 3D scene can also be interpreted. The author describes applications of 3D computer vision and his approach to a more flexible 3D computer vision.<<ETX>>",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional model-based computer vision uses geometric models of objects and sensed data to recognize objects in a scene. Likewise, Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) systems are used to interactively generate three-dimensional models during the design process. Despite this similarity, there has been a dichotomy between these fields. Recently, the unification of CAGD and vision systems has become the focus of research in the context of manufacturing automation. This paper explores the connection between CAGD and computer vision. A method for the automatic generation of recognition strategies based on the geometric properties of shape has been devised and implemented. This uses a novel technique developed for quantifying the following properties of features which compose models used in computer vision: robustness, completeness, consistency, cost, and uniqueness. By utilizing this information, the automatic synthesis of a specialized recognition scheme, called a Strategy Tree, is accomplished. Strategy Trees describe, in a systematic and robust manner, the search process used for recognition and localization of particular objects in the given scene. They consist of selected featureS which satisfy system constraints and Corroborating Evidence Subtrees which are used in the formation of hypotheses. Verification techniques, used to substantiate or refute these hypotheses, are explored.",

However, many visualization tasks involve processing large amounts of data or manipulating complex computer models of 3D objects. For example, in the field of computer aided engineering it is often necessary to display an edit solid object (see Plate 1) which can take many minutes even on the fastest serial processors. Another example of a computationally intensive problem, this time from computer vision, is the recognition of objects in a 3D scene from a stereo image pair. To perform visualization tasks of this type in real and reasonable time it is necessary to exploit the advances in parallel processing that have taken place over the last decade. This book uniquely provides a collection of papers from leading visualization researchers with a common interest in the application and exploitation of parallel processing techniques.",

            "abstract": "robots that \"see\" and \"feel\" can perform more complex tasks, industry has employed various computer vision techniques to enhance the abilities of intelligent machines. The recent widespread interest in robotics and automation in the US originates from American industry's most fundamental problem: a staggering drop in productivity. From 1947 to 1965, US productivity increased at an average rate of 3.4 percent a year. The growth rate decreased to 2.3 percent in the following decade, then dropped to below one percent in the late 1970's and down to-0.9 percent in 1980. Japan's productivity growth, the contrasting example most often cited in the literature, has been climbing at an average annual rate of about 7.3 percent. ' Although there are many ways to influence manufacturing productivity and product quality-regulatory, fiscal, and social-the emphasis in the following discussion is technological. In particular, we are interested in the computer vision aspects of industrial inspection and robot control. The principal motivation behind computer vision is increased flexibility and lower cost. The use of sensing technology to endow-a machine with a greater degree of \"intelligence\" in dealing with its environment is receiving increased attention. A robot that can \"see\" and \"feel\" should be easier to train in the performance of complex tasks while at the same time requiring less stringent control mechanisms than preprogrammed machines. A sensory, trainable system is also adaptable to a much larger variety of tasks, thus achieving a degree of universality that ultimately translates into lower production and maintenance costs. The computer vision process can be divided into five principal areas: sensing, segmentation, description, recognition , and interpretation. These categories are suggested to a large extent by the way computer vision systems are generally implemented. It is not implied that human vision and reasoning can be so neatly subdivided nor that these processes are carried out independently of each other. For instance, we can logically assume that recognition and interpretation are highly interrelated functions in a human. These relationships, however, are not yet understood to the point where they can be mod-eled analytically. Thus, the subdivision of functions discussed below can be viewed as a practical (albeit limited) approach for implementing state-of-the-art computer vision systems, given our level of understanding and the analytical tools currently available in this field. Visual sensing Imaging devices. Visual information is converted to electrical signals by visual sensors. The most commonly used visual sensors are vidicon cameras \u2026",

The environment consists of three principle components: DISC, Cloner, and Graph Matcher. DISC (dynamic intelligent scheduling and control) supports experimentation at the CVIP task level by creating a dynamic schedule from a user's specification of the algorithms that constitute a complex task. Cloner is aimed at the algorithm development process and is an interactive system that helps a user design new parallel algorithms by building on and modifying existing library algorithms. Graph Matcher performs the critical step of mapping new algorithms onto the target parallel architecture. Initial implementations of DISC and Graph Matcher have been completed, and work on Cloner is in progress.<<ETX>>",

            "abstract": "With more powerful algorithms and greater computing power, the once \"unreachable\" pattern recognition and computer vision problems can now be resolved, simplifying complex decisions about input data. 274 In the last 20 years, interest in pattern recognition and computer vision problems has increased dramatically. This interest has in turn created a need for theoretical methods and experimental software and hardware to aid the design of computer vision and pattern recognition systems. Over 25 books have been published on these topics as have a number of conference proceedings and special issues of journals. * Pattern recognition machines and computer vision systems have been designed and built for everything from character recognition , target detection, medical diagnosis , analysis of biomedical signals and images, remote sensing, and identification of human faces and fingerprints , to reliability, socioeconomics, archaeology, speech recognition and understanding, machine part recognition , and automatic inspection. 1,2 In this article, we briefly review the most recent developments in pattern recognition and computer vision. Many definitions of pattern recognition have been proposed. We view pattern recognition here as being concerned primarily with the description and analysis of measurements taken from physical or mental processes. Pattern recognition often begins with some kind of preprocessing to remove noise and redundancy in the measurements , thereby ensuring an effective and efficient pattern description. Next, a set of characteristic measurements , numerical and/or nonnumeri-cal, and relations among these measurements are extracted to represent patterns. Patterns are then analyzed (classified and/or described) on the basis of the representation. Naturally, we need a good set of characteristic measurements and a firm idea of how they interrelate in representing patterns so that patterns can be easily recognized. Knowledge of the statistical and structural characteristics of patterns is vital to achieving this goal and should be fully utilized. From this point of view, then, pattern recognition means analyzing pattern characteristics as well as designing recognition systems.",

The problem can be summarized as follows: given information about the environment as well as information about the task that the vision system is to accomplish, develop strategies to automatically determine sensor parameter values that achieve this task with a certain degree of satisfaction. With such strategies, sensor parameters values can be selected and can be purposefully changed in order to effectively perform the task at hand. The focus here is on vision sensor planning for the task of robustly detecting object features. For this task, camera and illumination parameters such as position, orientation, and optical settings are determined so that object features are, for example, visible, in focus, within the sensor field of view, magnified as required, and imaged with sufficient contrast. References to, and a brief description of, representative sensing strategies for the tasks of object recognition and scene reconstruction are also presented. For these tasks, sensor configurations are sought that will prove most useful when trying to identify an object or reconstruct a scene. >",

The algorithm correctly handled approximately 92% of the objects and identified approximately 89% of the fruit found in images obtained at night. Computer vision was determined to be a viable technique for detecting and identifying fruit on trees..",

Applications are then provided for several domains of 3-D computer vision, including location of the viewer for uncalibrated cameras, properties of epipolar lines in stereovision and object recognition.",

While there is no shortage of proposed methods for quantifying how the human eye perceives color differences, it is difficult to apply these perceptual metrics directly to the color images sensed by a computer vision system. The metric developed can be applied to images sensed using color filters (e.g. red, green, or blue) as is often done in computer vision. The metric is defined in terms of the spectral characteristics of the filters and camera and accounts for their noise properties. The color distance function is derived as an estimate of the physical distance between normalized spectral power distributions. Components of this distance are weighted to account for sensor noise properties. A color metric has several possible uses in a computer vision system. The usefulness of the color metric is demonstrated by evaluating its performance on regions of real images.<<ETX>>",

The architecture features a polymorphic-torus network which inserts an individually controllable switch into every node of the two-dimensional torus such that the network is dynamically reconfigurable to match the algorithm. Reconfiguration is accomplished by circuit switching and is achieved at fine-grained level. Using both the processor coordinate in the torus and the data for reconfiguration, the polymorphic-torus achieves solution time that is superior or equivalent to that of popular vision architectures such as mesh, tree, pyramid and hypercube for many vision algorithms discussed. Implementation of the architecture is given to illustrate its VLSI efficiency. >",

The response time of the vision interface should be less than a video frame time and the interface should cost less than $50 U.S. We meet these constraints with algorithms tailored to particular hardware. We have developed a special detector, called the artificial retina chip, which allows for fast, on-chip image processing. We describe two algorithms, based on image moments and orientation histograms, which exploit the capabilities of the chip to provide interactive response to the player's hand or body positions at 10 msec frame time and at low-cost. We show several possible game interactions.",

ISR mediates access to intermediate-level vision data and forms an active interface to the higher-level inference processes that construct an image's interpretation. The system supports important types of data and operations and can be adapted to the changing needs of ongoing research. It provides a centralized data representation that supports integration of results from multiple avenues of research into the overall vision system. ISR's underlying computational paradigm is explained, database requirements for image interpretation are identified, the ISR data management system is described, and the use of ISR is discussed.<<ETX>>",

Some of the key elements for robust intersection monitoring are camera calibration, motion tracking, incident detection, etc. In this paper, we consider the motion-tracking problem. A multilevel tracking approach using Kalman filter is presented for tracking vehicles and pedestrians at intersections. The approach combines low-level image-based blob tracking with high-level Kalman filtering for position and shape estimation. An intermediate occlusion-reasoning module serves the purpose of detecting occlusions and filtering relevant measurements. Motion segmentation is performed by using a mixture of Gaussian models which helps us achieve fairly reliable tracking in a variety of complex outdoor scenes. A visualization module is also presented. This module is very useful for visualizing the results of the tracker and serves as a platform for the incident detection module.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes how to propagate approximately additive random perturbations through any kind of vision algorithm step in which the appropriate random perturbation model for the estimated quantity produced by the vision step is also an additive random perturbation. The author assumes that the vision algorithm step can be modeled as a calculation (linear or nonlinear) that produces an estimate that minimizes an implicit scaler function of the input quantity and the calculated estimate. The only assumption is that the scaler functions have finite second partial derivatives and that the random perturbations are small enough so that the relationship between the scaler function evaluated at the ideal but unknown input and output quantities and the observed input quantity and perturbed output quantity can be approximated sufficiently well by a first order Taylor series expansion. The paper finally discusses the issues of verifying that the derived statistical behavior agrees with the experimentally observed statistical behavior.",

            "abstract": "A variety of analytic and probabilistic models in connection with Markov random fields (MRFs) have been proposed in the last decade for solving low level vision problems involving discontinuities. This paper presents a systematic study of these models and defines a general discontinuity adaptive (DA) MRF model. By analyzing the Euler equation associated with the energy minimization, it shows that the fundamental difference between different models lies in the behavior of interaction between neighboring points, which is determined by the a priori smoothness constraint encoded into the energy function. An important necessary condition is derived for the interaction to be adaptive to discontinuities to avoid oversmoothing. This forms the basis on which a class of adaptive interaction functions (AIFs) is defined. The DA model is defined in terms of the Euler equation constrained by this class of AIFs. Its solution is C/sup 1/ continuous and allows arbitrarily large but bounded slopes in dealing with discontinuities. Because of the continuous nature, it is stable to changes in parameters and data, a good property for regularizing ill-posed problems. Experimental results are shown. >",

A key to this remarkable performance seems to be that biological systems construct representations of their visual image data at multiple scales. A Pyramid Framework for Early Vision describes a multiscale, or 'pyramid', approach to vision, including its theoretical foundations, a set of pyramid-based modules for image processing, object detection, texture discrimination, contour detection and processing, feature detection and description, and motion detection and tracking. It also shows how these modules can be implemented very efficiently on hypercube-connected processor networks. The volume is intended for both students of vision and vision system designers; it provides a general approach to vision systems design as well as a set of robust, efficient vision modules.",

            "abstract": "MINPRAN is a new robust estimator capable of finding good fits in data sets containing more than 50% outliers. Unlike other techniques that handle large outlier percentages, MINPRAN does not rely on a known error bound for the good data. Instead, it assumes the bad data are randomly distributed within the dynamic range of the sensor. Based on this, MINPRAN uses random sampling to search for the fit and the inliers to the fit that are least likely to have occurred randomly. It runs in time O(N/sup 2/+SN log N), where S is the number of random samples and N is the number of data points. We demonstrate analytically that MINPRAN distinguished good fits to random data and MINPRAN finds accurate fits and nearly the correct number of inliers, regardless of the percentage of true inliers. We confirm MINPRAN's properties experimentally on synthetic data and show it compares favorably to least median of squares. Finally, we apply MINPRAN to fitting planar surface patches and eliminating outliers in range data taken from complicated scenes. >",

A human user of such a system could still see and interact with the real world, but have valuable additional information, such as descriptions of important features or instructions for performing physical tasks, superimposed on the world. For example, the computer could identify and overlay them with graphic outlines, labels, and schematics. The graphics are registered to the real-world objects and appear to be 'painted' onto those objects. Augmented reality systems can be used to make productivity aids for tasks such as inspection, manufacturing, and navigation. One of the most critical requirements for augmented reality is to recognize and locate real-world objects with respect to the person's head. Accurate registration is necessary in order to overlay graphics accurately on top of the real-world objects. At the Colorado School of Mines, we have developed a prototype augmented reality system that uses head-mounted cameras and computer vision techniques to accurately register the head to the scene. The current system locates and tracks a set of pre-placed passive fiducial targets placed on the real-world objects. The system computes the pose of the objects and displays graphics overlays using a see-through head-mounted display. This paper describes the architecture of the system and outlines the computer vision techniques used.",

Geometrically acceptable solutions require close contact between corresponding patches of surfaces of the receptor and of the ligand and no overlap between the van der Waals spheres of the remainder of the receptor and ligand atoms. In the quest for favorable chemical interactions, the next step involves minimization of the energy between the docked molecules. This work addresses the geometrical aspect of the problem. It is assumed that we have the atomic coordinates of each of the molecules. In principle, since optimally matching surfaces are sought, the entire conformational space needs to be considered. As the number of atoms residing on molecular surfaces can be several hundred, sampling of all rotations and translations of every patch of a surface of one molecule with respect to the other can reach immense proportions. The problem we are faced with here is reminiscent of object recognition problems in computer vision. Here we borrow and adapt the geometric hashing paradigm developed in computer vision to a central problem in molecular biology. Using an indexing approach based on a transformation invariant representation, the algorithm efficiently scans groups of surface dots (or atoms) and detects optimally matched surfaces. Potential solutions displaying receptor--ligand atomic overlaps are discarded. Our technique has been applied successfully to seven cases involving docking of small molecules, where the structures of the receptor--ligand complexes are available in the crystallographic database and to three cases where the receptors and ligands have been crystallized separately. In two of these three latter tests, the correct transformations have been obtained.",

Our method works by first segmenting the image into features, finding the approximate medial axes of these features, and using the medial axes to guide brush stroke creation. System parameters may be interactively manipulated by a user to effect image segmentation, brush stroke characteristics, stroke size, and stroke frequency. This process creates images reminiscent of those contemporary representational painters whose work has an abstract or sketchy quality.

Geometric matching benefits greatly from taking advantage of symmetries and special features, e.g. dihedral edges and circles or any three reliably identifiable feature points. Volume matching and representation techniques are also presented. Texture and fractal representations are briefly described. >",

            "abstract": "Direct analytical methods are discussed for solving Poisson equations of the general form Delta u=f on a rectangular domain. Some embedding techniques that may be useful when boundary conditions (obtained from stereo and occluding boundary) are defined on arbitrary contours are described. The suggested algorithms are computationally efficient owing to the use of fast orthogonal transforms. Applications to shape from shading, lightness and optical flow problems are also discussed. A proof for the existence and convergence of the flow estimates is given. Experiments using synthetic images indicate that results comparable to those using multigrid can be obtained in a very small number of iterations. >",

First, we prove that a special type of eikonal equation has only one convex and positive C2 solution in some neighborhood of a singular point. Using this result, we show that a restricted form of this equation has exactly two solutions. These results have application in scanning electron microscopy.",

            "abstract": "The authors develop the mathematical tools for the computation of the average error due to quantization. They can be used in estimating the actual error occurring in the implementation of a method. Also derived is the analytic expression for the probability density of error distribution of a function of an arbitrarily large number of independently quantized variables. The probability of the error of the function to be within a given range can thus be obtained accurately. In analyzing the applicability of an approach; it is necessary to determine whether the approach is capable of withstanding the quantization error. If it is not, then regardless of the accuracy with which the experiments are carried out, the approach will yield unacceptable results. The tools developed can be used in the analysis of the applicability of a given algorithm, hence revealing the intrinsic limitations of the approach.<<ETX>>",

They successfully apply the theory to the problem of matching and recognizing aerial road network images based on road network models and to the problem of edge matching in a stereo pair. For this purpose, each line network is represented by an attributed relational graph where each node is a straight line segment characterized by certain attributes and related with every other node via a set of binary relations.<<ETX>>",
