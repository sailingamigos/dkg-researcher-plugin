            "abstract": "Transformer, first applied to the field of natural language processing, is a type of deep neural network mainly based on the self-attention mechanism. Thanks to its strong representation capabilities, researchers are looking at ways to apply transformer to computer vision tasks. In a variety of visual benchmarks, transformer-based models perform similar to or better than other types of networks such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Given its high performance and less need for vision-specific inductive bias, transformer is receiving more and more attention from the computer vision community. In this paper, we review these vision transformer models by categorizing them in different tasks and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. The main categories we explore include the backbone network, high/mid-level vision, low-level vision, and video processing. We also include efficient transformer methods for pushing transformer into real device-based applications. Furthermore, we also take a brief look at the self-attention mechanism in computer vision, as it is the base component in transformer. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide several further research directions for vision transformers.",

We propose a novel classification method based on a multi-class kernel support vector machine (kSVM) with the desirable goal of accurate and fast classification of fruits. First, fruit images were acquired by a digital camera, and then the background of each image was removed by a split-and-merge algorithm; Second, the color histogram, texture and shape features of each fruit image were extracted to compose a feature space; Third, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensions of feature space; Finally, three kinds of multi-class SVMs were constructed, i.e., Winner-Takes-All SVM, Max-Wins-Voting SVM, and Directed Acyclic Graph SVM. Meanwhile, three kinds of kernels were chosen, i.e., linear kernel, Homogeneous Polynomial kernel, and Gaussian Radial Basis kernel; finally, the SVMs were trained using 5-fold stratified cross validation with the reduced feature vectors as input. The experimental results demonstrated that the Max-Wins-Voting SVM with Gaussian Radial Basis kernel achieves the best classification accuracy of 88.2%. For computation time, the Directed Acyclic Graph SVMs performs swiftest.",

The depth sensor is able to return images like an ordinary camera, but instead of color, each pixel value represents the distance to the point. As such, the sensor can be seen as a range- or 3D-camera. We have used the sensor in several different computer vision projects and this document collects our experiences with the sensor. We are only focusing on the depth sensing capabilities of the sensor since this is the real novelty of the product in relation to computer vision. The basic technique of the depth sensor is to emit an infrared light pattern (with an IR laser diode) and calculate depth from the reflection of the light at different positions (using a traditional IR sensitive camera). In this report, we perform an extensive evaluation of the depth sensor and investigate issues such as 3D resolution and precision, structural noise, multi-cam setups and transient response of the sensor. The purpose is to give the reader a well-founded background to choose whether or not the Kinect sensor is applicable to a specific problem.",

The interface is in Python, a dynamic programming language, which is appropriate for fast development, but the algorithms are implemented in C++ and are tuned for speed. The library is designed to fit in with the scientific software ecosystem in this language and can leverage the existing infrastructure developed in that language.

            "abstract": "Significance The botanical value of angiosperm leaf shape and venation (\u201cleaf architecture\u201d) is well known, but the astounding complexity and variation of leaves have thwarted efforts to access this underused resource. This challenge is central for paleobotany because most angiosperm fossils are isolated, unidentified leaves. We here demonstrate that a computer vision algorithm trained on several thousand images of diverse cleared leaves successfully learns leaf-architectural features, then categorizes novel specimens into natural botanical groups above the species level. The system also produces heat maps to display the locations of numerous novel, informative leaf characters in a visually intuitive way. With assistance from computer vision, the systematic and paleobotanical value of leaves is ready to increase significantly. Understanding the extremely variable, complex shape and venation characters of angiosperm leaves is one of the most challenging problems in botany. Machine learning offers opportunities to analyze large numbers of specimens, to discover novel leaf features of angiosperm clades that may have phylogenetic significance, and to use those characters to classify unknowns. Previous computer vision approaches have primarily focused on leaf identification at the species level. It remains an open question whether learning and classification are possible among major evolutionary groups such as families and orders, which usually contain hundreds to thousands of species each and exhibit many times the foliar variation of individual species. Here, we tested whether a computer vision algorithm could use a database of 7,597 leaf images from 2,001 genera to learn features of botanical families and orders, then classify novel images. The images are of cleared leaves, specimens that are chemically bleached, then stained to reveal venation. Machine learning was used to learn a codebook of visual elements representing leaf shape and venation patterns. The resulting automated system learned to classify images into families and orders with a success rate many times greater than chance. Of direct botanical interest, the responses of diagnostic features can be visualized on leaf images as heat maps, which are likely to prompt recognition and evolutionary interpretation of a wealth of novel morphological characters. With assistance from computer vision, leaves are poised to make numerous new contributions to systematic and paleobotanical studies.",

            "abstract": "Coding of pictures for transmission through cables was attempted way back in 1920 (even before the advent of digital computer), but serious attempts for digital image processing commenced in late 60s and early 70s. Importance of computer vision increases due to the fact that vision is one of the most dominant human senses. The use of computer vision for the inspection of fruits and vegetables has increased during recent years. Computer vision technique has been a subject of research and application for more than four decades. This technique is used in many engineering fields such as robotics, industrial image processing, food processing and other fields. Quickness, nondestructive evaluation possibilities, easy procedures for application, quantum of output per unit time are some advantages favouring application of computer vision to engineering problems. Application of computer vision to food processing fields evolved first in 1989 for grain quality inspection [1].",

Nowadays the continuous request to achieve photorealistic 3D models has led to testing different techniques and methodologies to speed up both data acquisition and the data processing phase. There are many examples of surveys conducted with the use of range-based and image-based techniques, but, in the last few years, the scientific research has been increasingly moving towards automatic procedures using Computer Vision approach to reduce time during data processing. Computer Vision approach offers a great opportunity for archaeological survey since it can be very easily used by existing Computer Vision interfaces such as 3D web services and open source or low cost software.

            "abstract": "This Special Issue of International Journal of Computer Mathematics (IJCM) offers a venue to present innovative approaches in computer vision and pattern recognition, which have been changing our everyday life dramatically over the last few years. Below we present the origin of this Special Issue and then give an overview of the papers included. The papers emanate from the International Workshop on Intelligent Computing in Pattern Analysis/Synthesis (IWICPAS 2006), which ran as a satellite workshop of the 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition. The former took place in Xi\u2019an on 26\u201327 August 2006 and the latter in Hong Kong on 20\u201324 August 2006, both in P. R. China. IWICPAS brought together people from academia and industry in the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition, and most of the pattern recognition algorithms presented have been employed on vision-related applications. The IWICPAS Workshop attracted a record number of 264 paper submissions from 20 countries. From these 264 papers, 51 were accepted. The proceedings were published as a book in the LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) series of Springer-Verlag. Thereafter, out of these 51 papers, nine were selected for this Special Issue. These were then substantially extended and went through another round of reviewing. We strongly believe that it is now an ideal time to publish this Special Issue with the aforesaid selected papers. The contents will provide readers of IJCM with cutting-edge and topical information for their related research. As we look forward to the future, we envisage computer vision and pattern recognition research to significantly benefit from cognitive science and psychology, as evidenced in the paper by Oyekoya and Stentiford. This Special Issue starts with three papers on feature generation and selection. The next two papers focus on the classical segmentation problem, which is a basic task in various image processing systems. After three compression and coding related papers, the last paper deals with the interaction between the human vision system and a computerized visual information management system. We now highlight the core contributions of each of the papers. In the paper \u2018BTF modelling using BRDF texels\u2019, Filip and Haindl developed two schemes to enlarge Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) data. The two schemes perform best for spatially random BTF. In their paper \u2018Combinatorial and statistical methods for part selection for object recognition\u2019, Zhao et al. presented a statistical method for choosing image patches and then using these patches for object detection and classification.

Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can realize medical image segmentation, whilst transformers can be used to perform machine vision tasks, because they have a better ability to capture long-range relationships than CNNs. The combination of CNN and transformers to complete the task of semantic segmentation has attracted intense research. Currently, it is challenging to segment medical images on limited data sets like that on COVID-19. Methods: This study proposes a lightweight transformer+CNN model",

We present here a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art computer vision for traffic video with a critical analysis and an outlook to future research directions. This field is of increasing relevance for intelligent transport systems (ITSs). The decreasing hardware cost and, therefore, the increasing deployment of cameras have opened a wide application field for video analytics. Several monitoring objectives such as congestion, traffic rule violation, and vehicle interaction can be targeted using cameras that were typically originally installed for human operators. Systems for the detection and classification of vehicles on highways have successfully been using classical visual surveillance techniques such as background estimation and motion tracking for some time. The urban domain is more challenging with respect to traffic density, lower camera angles that lead to a high degree of occlusion, and the variety of road users. Methods from object categorization and 3-D modeling have inspired more advanced techniques to tackle these challenges. There is no commonly used data set or benchmark challenge, which makes the direct comparison of the proposed algorithms difficult. In addition, evaluation under challenging weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and darkness) would be desirable but is rarely performed. Future work should be directed toward robust combined detectors and classifiers for all road users, with a focus on realistic conditions during evaluation.",

When complemented by stereo\u2010matching algorithms, detailed three\u2010dimensional models can be built from such photograph collections in a fully automated way. Since 2010, a computer vision software package called PhotoScan has been available from the Russian manufacturer AgiSoft LLC. Even though the programme has a straightforward and simple interface, state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art SFM and other computer vision algorithms are implemented that enable PhotoScan to generate very dense and accurate three\u2010dimensional meshes of various (archaeological) settings captured in two\u2010dimensional imagery. Using a mixture of archaeological case studies, it will be shown that this low\u2010cost application produces excellent results from aerial imagery in a minimum of time with almost no effort needed. Because of its solid and uncomplicated operation, it looks like this application could become an essential part of the aerial archaeologist's toolkit. Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

It uses up to four cameras in parallel on a miniature rotary wing platform. The MAV navigates based on onboard processed computer vision in GPS-denied in- and outdoor environments. It can process in parallel images and inertial measurement information from multiple cameras for multiple purposes (localization, pattern recognition, obstacle avoidance) by distributing the images on a central, low-latency image hub. Furthermore the system can utilize low-bandwith radio links for communication and is designed and optimized to scale to swarm use. Experimental results show successful flight with a range of onboard computer vision algorithms, including localization, obstacle avoidance and pattern recognition.",

These models possess a rich internal structure reflecting task-specific relations and constraints. This monograph introduces the reader to the most popular classes of structured models in computer vision. Our focus is discrete undirected graphical models which we cover in detail together with a description of algorithms for both probabilistic inference and maximum a posteriori inference. We discuss separately recently successful techniques for prediction in general structured models. In the second part of this monograph we describe methods for parameter learning where we distinguish the classic maximum likelihood based methods from the more recent prediction-based parameter learning methods. We highlight developments to enhance current models and discuss kernelized models and latent variable models. To make the monograph more practical and to provide links to further study we provide examples of successful application of many methods in the computer vision literature.",

Different technologies and different computational models thereof exist and algorithms and theoretical studies for geometric computer vision (\"structure-from-motion\") are often re-developed without highlighting common underlying principles. One of the goals of this survey is to give an overview of image acquisition methods used in computer vision and especially, of the vast number of camera models that have been proposed and investigated over the years, where we try to point out similarities between different models. Results on epipolar and multi-view geometry for different camera models are reviewed as well as various calibration and self-calibration approaches, with an emphasis on non-perspective cameras. We finally describe what we consider are fundamental building blocks for geometric computer vision or structure-from-motion: epipolar geometry, pose and motion estimation, 3D scene modeling, and bundle adjustment. The main goal here is to highlight the main principles of these, which are independent of specific camera models.",

            "abstract": "The success of deep learning in visual recognition tasks has driven advancements in multiple fields of research. Particularly, increasing attention has been drawn towards its application in agriculture. Nevertheless, while visual pattern recognition on farmlands carries enormous economic values, little progress has been made to merge computer vision and crop sciences due to the lack of suitable agricultural image datasets. Meanwhile, problems in agriculture also pose new challenges in computer vision. For example, semantic segmentation of aerial farmland images requires inference over extremely large-size images with extreme annotation sparsity. These challenges are not present in most of the common object datasets, and we show that they are more challenging than many other aerial image datasets. To encourage research in computer vision for agriculture, we present Agriculture-Vision: a large-scale aerial farmland image dataset for semantic segmentation of agricultural patterns. We collected 94,986 high-quality aerial images from 3,432 farmlands across the US, where each image consists of RGB and Near-infrared (NIR) channels with resolution as high as 10 cm per pixel. We annotate nine types of field anomaly patterns that are most important to farmers. As a pilot study of aerial agricultural semantic segmentation, we perform comprehensive experiments using popular semantic segmentation models; we also propose an effective model designed for aerial agricultural pattern recognition. Our experiments demonstrate several challenges Agriculture-Vision poses to both the computer vision and agriculture communities. Future versions of this dataset will include even more aerial images, anomaly patterns and image channels.",

Within this area, face recognition and interpretation has attracted increasing attention owing to the possibility of unveiling human perception mechanisms, and for the development of practical biometric systems. This book and the accompanying website, focus on template matching, a subset of object recognition techniques of wide applicability, which has proved to be particularly effective for face recognition applications. Using examples from face processing tasks throughout the book to illustrate more general object recognition approaches, Roberto Brunelli: examines the basics of digital image formation, highlighting points critical to the task of template matching; presents basic and advanced template matching techniques, targeting grey-level images, shapes and point sets; discusses recent pattern classification paradigms from a template matching perspective; illustrates the development of a real face recognition system; explores the use of advanced computer graphics techniques in the development of computer vision algorithms. Template Matching Techniques in Computer Vision is primarily aimed at practitioners working on the development of systems for effective object recognition such as biometrics, robot navigation, multimedia retrieval and landmark detection. It is also of interest to graduate students undertaking studies in these areas.",

First, we discuss the automatic recognition of weave pattern and the accurate measurement of yarn counts by analyzing fabric sample images. We propose a surface roughness indicator FDFFT, which is the 3-D surface fractal dimension measurement calculated from the 2-D fast Fourier transform of high-resolution 3-D surface scan. The proposed weave pattern recognition method was validated by using computer-simulated woven samples and real woven fabric images. All weave patterns of the tested fabric samples were successfully recognized, and computed yarn counts were consistent with the manual counts. The rotation invariance and scale invariance of FDFFT were validated with fractal Brownian images. Moreover, to evaluate the correctness of FDFFT, we provide a method of calculating standard roughness parameters from the 3-D fabric surface. According to the test results, we demonstrated that FDFFT is a fast and reliable parameter for fabric roughness measurement based on 3-D surface data.",

Computationally intensive mobile vision applications, such as augmented reality or object recognition, place significant performance and power demands on existing embedded platforms, often leading to degraded application quality. With a better understanding of this growing application space, it will be possible to more effectively optimize future embedded platforms. In this work, we introduce and evaluate a custom benchmark suite for mobile embedded vision applications named MEVBench. MEVBench provides a wide range of mobile vision applications such as face detection, feature classification, object tracking and feature extraction. To better understand mobile vision processing characteristics at the architectural level, we analyze single and multithread implementations of many algorithms to evaluate performance, scalability, and memory characteristics. We provide insights into the major areas where architecture can improve the performance of these applications in embedded systems.",

            "abstract": "Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned. \n \nIn this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.",

In this paper, we review dynamic programming and graph algorithms, and discuss representative examples of how these discrete optimization techniques have been applied to some classical vision problems. We focus on the low-level vision problem of stereo, the mid-level problem of interactive object segmentation, and the high-level problem of model-based recognition.",

Human-level visual recognition abilities are coming within reach of artificial systems. Artificial neural networks are inspired by the brain and their computations could be implemented in biological neurons. Convolutional feedforward networks, which now dominate computer vision, take further inspiration from the architecture of the primate visual hierarchy. However, the current models are designed with engineering goals and not to model brain computations. Nevertheless, initial studies comparing internal representations between these models and primate brains find surprisingly similar representational spaces. With human-level performance no longer out of reach, we are entering an exciting new era, in which we will be able to build neurobiologically faithful feedforward and recurrent computational models of how biological brains perform high-level feats of intelligence, including vision.",

            "abstract": "\"Computer and Machine Vision: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities\" (previously entitled \"Machine Vision\") clearly and systematically presents the basic methodology of computer and machine vision, covering the essential elements of the theory while emphasizing algorithmic and practical design constraints. This fully revised fourth edition has brought in more of the concepts and applications of computer vision, making it a very comprehensive and up-to-date tutorial text suitable for graduate students, researchers and RD new chapters containing case studies on surveillance and driver assistance systems give practical methods on these cutting-edge applications in computer vision; necessary mathematics and essential theory are made approachable by careful explanations and well-illustrated examples; updated content and new sections cover topics such as human iris location, image stitching, line detection using RANSAC, performance measures, and hyperspectral imaging; and, the 'recent developments' section now included in each chapter will be useful in bringing students and practitioners up to date with the subject. Roy Davies is Emeritus Professor of Machine Vision at Royal Holloway, University of London. He has worked on many aspects of vision, from feature detection to robust, real-time implementations of practical vision tasks. His interests include automated visual inspection, surveillance, vehicle guidance and crime detection. He has published more than 200 papers, and three books - \"Machine Vision: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities\" (1990), \"Electronics, Noise and Signal Recovery\" (1993), and \"Image Processing for the Food Industry\" (2000); the first of these has been widely used internationally for more than 20 years, and is now out in this much enhanced fourth edition. Roy holds a DSc at the University of London, and has been awarded Distinguished Fellow of the British Machine Vision Association, and Fellow of the International Association of Pattern Recognition. In this title, mathematics and essential theory are made approachable by careful explanations and well-illustrated examples. Updated content and new sections cover topics such as human iris location, image stitching, line detection using RANSAC, performance measures, and hyperspectral imaging.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is the current standard for these measurements but requires bulky instruments mounted on commercial aircraft. Here we demonstrate that high spatial resolution 3D measurements of vegetation structure and spectral characteristics can be produced by applying open-source computer vision algorithms to ordinary digital photographs acquired using inexpensive hobbyist aerial platforms. Digital photographs were acquired using a kite aerial platform across two 2.25 ha test sites in Baltimore, MD, USA. An open-source computer vision algorithm generated 3D point cloud datasets with RGB spectral attributes from the photographs and these were geocorrected to a horizontal precision of 0.82) than computer vision (R2 > 0.64), primarily because of difficulties observing terrain under closed canopy forest. Results confirm that computer vision can support ultra-low-cost, user-deployed high spatial resolution 3D remote sensing of vegetation structure.",

This paper presents a new approach to GUI testing using computer vision for testers to automate their tasks. Testers can write a visual test script that uses images to specify which GUI components to interact with and what visual feedback to be observed. Testers can also generate visual test scripts by demonstration. By recording both input events and screen images, it is possible to extract the images of components interacted with and the visual feedback seen by the demonstrator, and generate a visual test script automatically. We show that a variety of GUI behavior can be tested using this approach. Also, we show how this approach can facilitate good testing practices such as unit testing, regression testing, and test-driven development.",

            "abstract": "1. Introduction. Computer vision refers to a variety of applications involving a sensing device, a computer, and software for restoring and possibly interpreting the sensed data. Most commonly, visible light is sensed by a video camera and converted to an array of measured light intensities, each element corresponding to a small patch in the scene (a picture element, or \"pixel\"). The image is thereby \"digitized,\" and this format is suitable for computer analysis. In some applications, the sensing mechanism responds to other forms of light, such as in infrared imaging where the camera is tuned to the invisible part of the spectrum neighboring the color red. Infrared light is emitted in proportion to temperature, and thus infrared imaging is suitable for detecting and analyzing the temperature profile of a scene. Applications include automated inspection in industrial settings, medical diagnosis, and targeting and tracking of military objects. In single photon emission tomography, as a diagnostic tool, individual photons, emitted from a \"radiopharmaceutical\" (isotope combined with a suitable pharmaceutical) are detected. The object is to reconstruct the distribution of isotope density inside the body from the externally-collected counts. Depending on the pharmaceutical, the isotope density may correspond to local blood flow (\"perfusion\") or local metabolic activity. Other applications of computer vision include satellite imaging for weather and crop yield prediction, radar imaging in military applications, ultrasonic imaging for industrial inspection and a host of medical applications, and there is a growing role for video imaging in robotics. The variety of applications has yielded an equal variety of algorithms for restoration and interpretation. Unfortunately, few general principals have emerged and no common foundation has been layed. Algorithms are by and-large-ad=hoet=they=are=typic^^ ically tuned to the particulars of the environment (lighting, weather conditions, magnification, and so on) in which they are implemented.

Likewise, a computational treatment of symmetry and group theory (the ultimate mathematical formalization of symmetry) has the potential to play an important role in computational sciences. Though the term computational symmetry was formally defined a decade ago by the first author, referring to algorithmic treatment of symmetries, seeking symmetry from digital data has been attempted for over four decades. Computational symmetry on real world data turns out to be challenging enough that, after decades of effort, a fully automated symmetry\u2013savvy system remains elusive for real world applications. The recent resurging interests in computational symmetry for computer vision and computer graphics applications have shown promising results. Recognizing the fundamental relevance and potential power that computational symmetry affords, we offer this survey to the computer vision and computer graphics communities. This survey provides a succinct summary of the relevant mathematical theory, a historic perspective of some important symmetry-related ideas, a partial yet timely report on the state of the arts symmetry detection algorithms along with its first quantitative benchmark, a diverse set of real world applications, suggestions for future directions and a comprehensive reference list.",

            "abstract": "Our society's information technology advancements have resulted in the increasingly problematic issue of information overload-i.e., we have more access to information than we can possibly process. This is nowhere more apparent than in the volume of imagery and video that we can access on a daily basis-for the general public, availability of YouTube video and Google Images, or for the image analysis professional tasked with searching security video or satellite reconnaissance. Which images to look at and how to ensure we see the images that are of most interest to us, begs the question of whether there are smart ways to triage this volume of imagery. Over the past decade, computer vision research has focused on the issue of ranking and indexing imagery. However, computer vision is limited in its ability to identify interesting imagery, particularly as \u00bfinteresting\u00bf might be defined by an individual. In this paper we describe our efforts in developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) which synergistically integrate computer vision and human vision so as to construct a system for image triage. Our approach exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals which are recorded noninvasively via electroencephalography (EEG). The signals we decode are specific for events related to imagery attracting a user's attention. We describe two architectures we have developed for this type of cortically coupled computer vision and discuss potential applications and challenges for the future.",

It is argued that such robustness requires loss functions that penalize both large positive and negative margins. The probability elicitation view of classifier design is adopted, and a set of necessary conditions for the design of such losses is identified. These conditions are used to derive a novel robust Bayes-consistent loss, denoted Tangent loss, and an associated boosting algorithm, denoted TangentBoost. Experiments with data from the computer vision problems of scene classification, object tracking, and multiple instance learning show that TangentBoost consistently outperforms previous boosting algorithms.",

            "abstract": "This monograph reviews both the theory and practice of the numerical computation of geodesic distances on Riemannian manifolds. The notion of Riemannian manifold allows one to define a local metric (a symmetric positive tensor field) that encodes the information about the problem one wishes to solve. This takes into account a local isotropic cost (whether some point should be avoided or not) and a local anisotropy (which direction should be preferred). Using this local tensor field, the geodesic distance is used to solve many problems of practical interest such as segmentation using geodesic balls and Voronoi regions, sampling points at regular geodesic distance or meshing a domain with geodesic Delaunay triangles. The shortest paths for this Riemannian distance, the so-called geodesics, are also important because they follow salient curvilinear structures in the domain. We show several applications of the numerical computation of geodesic distances and shortest paths to problems in surface and shape processing, in particular segmentation, sampling, meshing and comparison of shapes. All the figures from this review paper can be reproduced by following the Numerical Tours of Signal Processing. \n \nhttp://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~peyre/numerical-tour/ \n \nSeveral textbooks exist that include description of several manifold methods for image processing, shape and surface representation and computer graphics. In particular, the reader should refer to [42, 147, 208, 209, 213, 255] for fascinating applications of these methods to many important problems in vision and graphics. This review paper is intended to give an updated tour of both foundations and trends in the area of geodesic methods in vision and graphics.",

In this paper, we review the state of the art in such systems by first presenting the installation, the visual features used for skin lesion classification, and the methods for defining them. Then, we describe how to extract these features through digital image processing methods, i.e., segmentation, border detection, and color and texture processing, and we present the most prominent techniques for skin lesion classification. The paper reports the statistics and the results of the most important implementations that exist in the literature, while it compares the performance of several classifiers on the specific skin lesion diagnostic problem and discusses the corresponding findings.",

            "abstract": "The investment in an automated fabric defect detection system is more than economical when reduction in labor cost and associated benefits are considered. The development of a fully automated web inspection system requires robust and efficient fabric defect detection algorithms. The inspection of real fabric defects is particularly challenging due to the large number of fabric defect classes, which are characterized by their vagueness and ambiguity. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect fabric defects and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and/or describe these algorithms. This paper attempts to present the first survey on fabric defect detection techniques presented in about 160 references. Categorization of fabric defect detection techniques is useful in evaluating the qualities of identified features. The characterization of real fabric surfaces using their structure and primitive set has not yet been successful. Therefore, on the basis of the nature of features from the fabric surfaces, the proposed approaches have been characterized into three categories; statistical, spectral and model-based. In order to evaluate the state-of-the-art, the limitations of several promising techniques are identified and performances are analyzed in the context of their demonstrated results and intended application. The conclusions from this paper also suggest that the combination of statistical, spectral and model-based approaches can give better results than any single approach, and is suggested for further research.",

This has positive as well as negative effects on our lives. Negative effects are mostly health related and one major concern is the increasing number of people affected by the Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) [1]. Most CVS-related problems can be avoided by suitable preventive actions, but the majority of computer users ignore them. To help remedy the situation we present a prototype of a computer vision system for real-time eye blink based detection of eye fatigue, which is a common symptom leading towards CVS. Our program records video of the user by a computer monitor mounted web-camera, processes the frames and detects hazardous behaviour based on user\u2019s eye dynamics and blink patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed system is capable of detecting common cases of fatigued behaviour linked with long-term computer use. We believe regular use of the proposed system could significantly reduce the CVS symptoms for long-time computer workers. However, the techniques used can also be applied to other similar applications, such as driver fatigue detection, human-computer interaction, etc.",

It is based on the graph theoretical work and leads to an efficient method that we apply on shape matching and image segmentation. In contrast to currently used methods in computer vision, the presented approach provides an upper bound for its runtime behavior that is almost linear. In particular, we are able to match two different planar shapes of N points in O(N2 log N) and segment a given image of N pixels in O(N log N). We present two experimental benchmark studies which demonstrate that the presented method is also in practice faster than previously proposed graph cut methods: On planar shape matching and image segmentation we observe a speed-up of an order of magnitude, depending on resolution.",

Additionally, we give an outlook on very recent, non-classical techniques for the prediction of structure data, for the estimation of statistical dependency, and for learning the kernel function itself. All methods are illustrated with examples of successful application from the recent computer vision research literature.",

In statistics and machine learning, the sparsity principle is used to perform model selection - that is, automatically selecting a simple model among a large collection of them. In signal processing, sparse coding consists of representing data with linear combinations of a few dictionary elements. Subsequently, the corresponding tools have been widely adopted by several scientific communities such as neuroscience, bioinformatics, or computer vision. The goal of this monograph is to offer a self-contained view of sparse modeling for visual recognition and image processing. More specifically, we focus on applications where the dictionary is learned and adapted to data, yielding a compact representation that has been successful in various contexts.",

            "abstract": "This article discusses the challenges in computer systems research posed by the emerging field of pervasive computing. It first examines the relationship of this new field to its predecessors: distributed systems and mobile computing. It then identifies four new research thrusts: effective use of smart spaces, invisibility, localized scalability, and masking uneven conditioning. Next, it sketches a couple of hypothetical pervasive computing scenarios, and uses them to identify key capabilities missing from today's systems. The article closes with a discussion of the research necessary to develop these capabilities.",

To this end, it is imperative that computational researchers know of the key findings from experimental studies of face recognition by humans. These findings provide insights into the nature of cues that the human visual system relies upon for achieving its impressive performance and serve as the building blocks for efforts to artificially emulate these abilities. In this paper, we present what we believe are 19 basic results, with implications for the design of computational systems. Each result is described briefly and appropriate pointers are provided to permit an in-depth study of any particular result",
