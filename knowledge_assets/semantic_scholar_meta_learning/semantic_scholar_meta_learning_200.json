            "abstract": "Imitation learning allows agents to learn complex behaviors from demonstrations. However, learning a complex vision-based task may require an impractical number of demonstrations. Meta-imitation learning is a promising approach towards enabling agents to learn a new task from one or a few demonstrations by leveraging experience from learning similar tasks. In the presence of task ambiguity or unobserved dynamics, demonstrations alone may not provide enough information; an agent must also try the task to successfully infer a policy. In this work, we propose a method that can learn to learn from both demonstrations and trial-and-error experience with sparse reward feedback. In comparison to meta-imitation, this approach enables the agent to effectively and efficiently improve itself autonomously beyond the demonstration data. In comparison to meta-reinforcement learning, we can scale to substantially broader distributions of tasks, as the demonstration reduces the burden of exploration. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches on a set of challenging, vision-based control tasks.",

It is based on a formalism that extends our previous work on adaptive impedance control with meta parameter learning and compatible skill specifications. This way the system is also able to make use of abstract expert knowledge by incorporating process descriptions and quality evaluation metrics. We evaluate various state-of-the-art schemes for meta parameter learning and experimentally compare selected ones. Our results clearly indicate that the combination of our adaptive impedance controller with a carefully defined skill formalism significantly reduces the complexity of manipulation tasks even for learning peg-in-hole with submillimeter industrial tolerances. Overall, the considered system is able to learn variations of this skill in under 20 minutes. In fact, experimentally the system was able to perform the learned tasks without visual feedback faster than humans, leading to the first learning-based solution of complex assembly at such real-world performance.",

For example, to classify sentiment without any training examples, we can\"prompt\"the LM with the review and the label description\"Does the user like this movie?\", and ask whether the next word is\"yes\"or\"no\". However, the next word prediction training objective is still misaligned with the target zero-shot learning objective. To address this weakness, we propose meta-tuning, which directly optimizes the zero-shot learning objective by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on a collection of datasets. We focus on classification tasks, and construct the meta-dataset by aggregating 43 existing datasets and annotating 441 label descriptions in a question-answering (QA) format. When evaluated on unseen tasks, meta-tuned models outperform a same-sized QA model and the previous SOTA zero-shot learning system based on natural language inference. Additionally, increasing parameter count from 220M to 770M improves AUC-ROC scores by 6.3%, and we forecast that even larger models would perform better. Therefore, measuring zero-shot learning performance on language models out-of-the-box might underestimate their true potential, and community-wide efforts on aggregating datasets and unifying their formats can help build models that answer prompts better.",

Under the assumption that future tasks are 'related' to previous tasks, the accumulated knowledge should be learned in a way which captures the common structure across learned tasks, while allowing the learner sufficient flexibility to adapt to novel aspects of new tasks. We present a framework for meta-learning that is based on generalization error bounds, allowing us to extend various PAC-Bayes bounds to meta-learning. Learning takes place through the construction of a distribution over hypotheses based on the observed tasks, and its utilization for learning a new task. Thus, prior knowledge is incorporated through setting an experience-dependent prior for novel tasks. We develop a gradient-based algorithm which minimizes an objective function derived from the bounds and demonstrate its effectiveness numerically with deep neural networks. In addition to establishing the improved performance available through meta-learning, we demonstrate the intuitive way by which prior information is manifested at different levels of the network.",

            "abstract": "Many real-world problems, including multi-speaker text-to-speech synthesis, can greatly benefit from the ability to meta-learn large models with only a few task-specific components. Updating only these task-specific modules then allows the model to be adapted to low-data tasks for as many steps as necessary without risking overfitting. Unfortunately, existing meta-learning methods either do not scale to long adaptation or else rely on handcrafted task-specific architectures. Here, we propose a meta-learning approach that obviates the need for this often sub-optimal hand-selection. In particular, we develop general techniques based on Bayesian shrinkage to automatically discover and learn both task-specific and general reusable modules. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method discovers a small set of meaningful task-specific modules and outperforms existing meta-learning approaches in domains like few-shot text-to-speech that have little task data and long adaptation horizons. We also show that existing meta-learning methods including MAML, iMAML, and Reptile emerge as special cases of our method.",

In this work, we focus on leveraging DNNs in the often-encountered practical scenario where access to labeled training data is difficult, and where DNNs would be prone to overfitting. We leverage recent advancements in gradient-based meta-learning, and propose an approach to train a residual neural network with convolutional layers as a meta-learning agent for few-shot TSC. The network is trained on a diverse set of few-shot tasks sampled from various domains (e.g. healthcare, activity recognition, etc.) such that it can solve a target task from another domain using only a small number of training samples from the target task. Most existing meta-learning approaches are limited in practice as they assume a fixed number of target classes across tasks. We overcome this limitation in order to train a common agent across domains with each domain having different number of target classes, we utilize a triplet-loss based learning procedure that does not require any constraints to be enforced on the number of classes for the few-shot TSC tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use meta-learning based pre-training for TSC. Our approach sets a new benchmark for few-shot TSC, outperforming several strong baselines on few-shot tasks sampled from 41 datasets in UCR TSC Archive. We observe that pre-training under the meta-learning paradigm allows the network to quickly adapt to new unseen tasks with small number of labeled instances.",

A popular approach to meta-learning is to train a recurrent model to read in a training dataset as input and output the parameters of a learned model, or output predictions for new test inputs. Alternatively, a more recent approach to meta-learning aims to acquire deep representations that can be effectively fine-tuned, via standard gradient descent, to new tasks. In this paper, we consider the meta-learning problem from the perspective of universality, formalizing the notion of learning algorithm approximation and comparing the expressive power of the aforementioned recurrent models to the more recent approaches that embed gradient descent into the meta-learner. In particular, we seek to answer the following question: does deep representation combined with standard gradient descent have sufficient capacity to approximate any learning algorithm? We find that this is indeed true, and further find, in our experiments, that gradient-based meta-learning consistently leads to learning strategies that generalize more widely compared to those represented by recurrent models.",

In this setting, a neural data structure is instantiated by training a network over many epochs of its inputs until convergence. In applications where inputs arrive at high throughput, or are ephemeral, training a network from scratch is not practical. This motivates the need for few-shot neural data structures. In this paper we explore the learning of approximate set membership over a set of data in one-shot via meta-learning.

However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on task distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used meta-reinforcement learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a simulated robot as different tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new behaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop algorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out tasks. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly, while each task and its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with reasonable success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at the same time, even with as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis and open-source environments pave the way for future research in multi-task learning and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization, thereby unlocking the full potential of these methods.",

While a plethora of models have emerged to tackle it, we find the procedure and datasets that are used to assess their progress lacking. To address this limitation, we propose Meta-Dataset: a new benchmark for training and evaluating models that is large-scale, consists of diverse datasets, and presents more realistic tasks. We experiment with popular baselines and meta-learners on Meta-Dataset, along with a competitive method that we propose. We analyze performance as a function of various characteristics of test tasks and examine the models' ability to leverage diverse training sources for improving their generalization. We also propose a new set of baselines for quantifying the benefit of meta-learning in Meta-Dataset. Our extensive experimentation has uncovered important research challenges and we hope to inspire work in these directions.",

Recent work in meta-learning seeks to overcome this shortcoming by training a meta-learner on a distribution of similar tasks; the goal is for the meta-learner to generalize to novel but related tasks by learning a high-level strategy that captures the essence of the problem it is asked to solve. However, most recent approaches to meta-learning are extensively hand-designed, either using architectures that are specialized to a particular application, or hard-coding algorithmic components that tell the meta-learner how to solve the task. We propose a class of simple and generic meta-learner architectures, based on temporal convolutions, that is domain- agnostic and has no particular strategy or algorithm encoded into it. We validate our temporal-convolution-based meta-learner (TCML) through experiments pertaining to both supervised and reinforcement learning, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are less general and more complex.",

Item cold-start problems are particularly acute in settings such as Tweet recommendation where new items arrive continuously. In this paper, we present a meta-learning strategy to address item cold-start when new items arrive continuously. We propose two deep neural network architectures that implement our meta-learning strategy. The first architecture learns a linear classifier whose weights are determined by the item history while the second architecture learns a neural network whose biases are instead adjusted. We evaluate our techniques on the real-world problem of Tweet recommendation. On production data at Twitter, we demonstrate that our proposed techniques significantly beat the MF baseline and also outperform production models for Tweet recommendation.",

Leading approaches derived from meta-learning on images with a single visual object. Obfuscated by a complex background and multiple objects in one image, they are hard to promote the research of low-shot object detection/segmentation. In this work, we present a flexible and general methodology to achieve these tasks. Our work extends Faster /Mask R-CNN by proposing meta-learning over RoI (Region-of-Interest) features instead of a full image feature. This simple spirit disentangles multi-object information merged with the background, without bells and whistles, enabling Faster /Mask R-CNN turn into a meta-learner to achieve the tasks. Specifically, we introduce a Predictor-head Remodeling Network (PRN) that shares its main backbone with Faster /Mask R-CNN. PRN receives images containing low-shot objects with their bounding boxes or masks to infer their class attentive vectors. The vectors take channel-wise soft-attention on RoI features, remodeling those R-CNN predictor heads to detect or segment the objects consistent with the classes these vectors represent. In our experiments, Meta R-CNN yields the new state of the art in low-shot object detection and improves low-shot object segmentation by Mask R-CNN.

We train different modular structures on a set of related tasks and generalize to new tasks by composing the learned modules in new ways. By reusing modules to generalize we achieve combinatorial generalization, akin to the \"infinite use of finite means\" displayed in language. Finally, we show this improves performance in two robotics-related problems.",

This metacognition of learning, or \u2018meta-learning\u2019, helps students to become more effective learners, as they become more aware of their self-regulatory processes and recognise the effectiveness of their study strategies. To increase biomedical science students\u2019 self-awareness, we have designed and implemented meta-learning assessment tasks across our biomedical science courses. Most students reported that meta-learning tasks had a positive impact on their learning, as they prompted self-regulatory processes of forethought and self-reflection. We found that students were equally likely to change or not change their study strategies across subsequent semesters. Those students that did not change were generally high achievers, believing their study approaches were most effective, but their performance did not improve across semesters. In contrast, students who adapted, mostly by modifying how they appraised and rearranged records or improved planning and time management, performed less well overall but significantly improved their performance across semesters. Meta-learning tasks may prompt students to become more self-reflective and independent learners by affecting their approach to learning, enabling them to reflect on their study strategies, adapt and improve performance, and may enable the development of lifelong learning skills.",

The focus of this paper is on urban remote sensing images. We review and perform a meta-analysis to juxtapose recent papers in terms of research problems, data source, data preparation methods including pre-processing and augmentation techniques, training details on architectures, backbones, frameworks, optimizers, loss functions and other hyper-parameters and performance comparison. Our detailed review and meta-analysis show that deep learning not only outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, but also addresses several challenges previously faced. Further, we provide future directions of research in this domain.",

While in principle meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms enable agents to learn new skills from small amounts of experience, several major challenges preclude their practicality. Current methods rely heavily on on-policy experience, limiting their sample efficiency. The also lack mechanisms to reason about task uncertainty when adapting to new tasks, limiting their effectiveness in sparse reward problems. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing an off-policy meta-RL algorithm that disentangles task inference and control. In our approach, we perform online probabilistic filtering of latent task variables to infer how to solve a new task from small amounts of experience. This probabilistic interpretation enables posterior sampling for structured and efficient exploration. We demonstrate how to integrate these task variables with off-policy RL algorithms to achieve both meta-training and adaptation efficiency. Our method outperforms prior algorithms in sample efficiency by 20-100X as well as in asymptotic performance on several meta-RL benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown dramatic improvements in single image super-resolution (SISR) by using large-scale external samples. Despite their remarkable performance based on the external dataset, they cannot exploit internal information within a specific image. Another problem is that they are applicable only to the specific condition of data that they are supervised. For instance, the low-resolution (LR) image should be a \"bicubic\" downsampled noise-free image from a high-resolution (HR) one. To address both issues, zero-shot super-resolution (ZSSR) has been proposed for flexible internal learning. However, they require thousands of gradient updates, i.e., long inference time. In this paper, we present Meta-Transfer Learning for Zero-Shot Super-Resolution (MZSR), which leverages ZSSR. Precisely, it is based on finding a generic initial parameter that is suitable for internal learning. Thus, we can exploit both external and internal information, where one single gradient update can yield quite considerable results. With our method, the network can quickly adapt to a given image condition. In this respect, our method can be applied to a large spectrum of image conditions within a fast adaptation process.",

            "abstract": "Currently, the state-of-the-art methods treat few-shot semantic segmentation task as a conditional foreground-background segmentation problem, assuming each class is independent. In this paper, we introduce the concept of meta-class, which is the meta information (e.g. certain middle-level features) shareable among all classes. To explicitly learn meta-class representations in few-shot segmentation task, we propose a novel Meta-class Memory based few-shot segmentation method (MM-Net), where we introduce a set of learnable memory embeddings to memorize the meta-class information during the base class training and transfer to novel classes during the inference stage. Moreover, for the k-shot scenario, we propose a novel image quality measurement module to select images from the set of support images. A high-quality class prototype could be obtained with the weighted sum of support image features based on the quality measure. Experiments on both PASCAL-5i and COCO datasets show that our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Particularly, our proposed MM-Net achieves 37.5% mIoU on the COCO dataset in 1-shot setting, which is 5.1% higher than the previous state-of-the-art.",

However, existing SG-MCMC schemes are not tailored to any specific probabilistic model, even a simple modification of the underlying dynamical system requires significant physical intuition. This paper presents the first meta-learning algorithm that allows automated design for the underlying continuous dynamics of an SG-MCMC sampler. The learned sampler generalizes Hamiltonian dynamics with state-dependent drift and diffusion, enabling fast traversal and efficient exploration of neural network energy landscapes. Experiments validate the proposed approach on both Bayesian fully connected neural network and Bayesian recurrent neural network tasks, showing that the learned sampler out-performs generic, hand-designed SG-MCMC algorithms, and generalizes to different datasets and larger architectures.",

Specifically, a set of primitives are shared within a distribution of tasks, and are switched between by task-specific policies. We provide a concrete metric for measuring the strength of such hierarchies, leading to an optimization problem for quickly reaching high reward on unseen tasks. We then present an algorithm to solve this problem end-to-end through the use of any off-the-shelf reinforcement learning method, by repeatedly sampling new tasks and resetting task-specific policies. We successfully discover meaningful motor primitives for the directional movement of four-legged robots, solely by interacting with distributions of mazes. We also demonstrate the transferability of primitives to solve long-timescale sparse-reward obstacle courses, and we enable 3D humanoid robots to robustly walk and crawl with the same policy.",

We present a meta-learning algorithm, ADML (ADversarial Meta-Learner), which leverages clean and adversarial samples to optimize the initialization of a learning model in an adversarial manner. ADML leads to the following desirable properties: 1) it turns out to be very effective even in the cases with only clean samples; 2) it is robust to adversarial samples, i.e., unlike other meta-learning algorithms, it only leads to a minor performance degradation when there are adversarial samples; 3) it sheds light on tackling the cases with limited and even contaminated samples. It has been shown by extensive experimental results that ADML consistently outperforms three representative meta-learning algorithms in the cases involving adversarial samples, on two widely-used image datasets, MiniImageNet and CIFAR100, in terms of both accuracy and robustness.",

The network was evaluated using 3 gradient steps with the same step size \u03b1 = 0.4. The 20-way convolutional MAML model was trained and evaluated with 5 gradient steps with step size \u03b1 = 0.1. During training, the meta batch-size was set to 16 tasks. For MiniImagenet, both models were trained using 5 gradient steps of size \u03b1 = 0.01, and evaluated using 10 gradient steps at test time. Following Ravi & Larochelle (2017), 15 examples per class were used for evaluating the post-update meta-gradient. We used a meta batch-size of 4 and 2 tasks for 1-shot and 5-shot training respectively. All models were trained for 60000 iterations on a single NVIDIA Pascal Titan X GPU.",

To overcome these two significant limitations of existing meta learning algorithms, we introduce the cross-domain meta learning framework and propose a new trans-ferable meta learning (TML) algorithm. TML performs meta task adaptation jointly with meta model learning, which effectively nar-rows divergence between source and target tasks and enables transferring source meta-knowledge to solve target tasks. Thus, the resulted transferable meta model can solve new learning tasks in new domains quickly. We apply the proposed TML to cross-domain few-shot classi\ufb01cation problems and evaluate its performance on multiple benchmarks. It performs signi\ufb01cantly better and faster than well-established meta learning algorithms and \ufb01ne-tuned domain-adapted models.",

However, both modes of task specification have their disadvantages: reward functions require manual engineering, while demonstrations require a human expert to be able to actually perform the task in order to generate the demonstration. Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufficient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufficient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task. In this work, we propose an interactive formulation of the task specification problem, where iterative language corrections are provided to an autonomous agent, guiding it in acquiring the desired skill. Our proposed language-guided policy learning algorithm can integrate an instruction and a sequence of corrections to acquire new skills very quickly. In our experiments, we show that this method can enable a policy to follow instructions and corrections for simulated navigation and manipulation tasks, substantially outperforming direct, non-interactive instruction following.",

            "abstract": "Meta-learning is increasingly used to support the recommendation of machine learning algorithms and their configurations. Such recommendations are made based on meta-data, consisting of performance evaluations of algorithms on prior datasets, as well as characterizations of these datasets. These characterizations, also called meta-features, describe properties of the data which are predictive for the performance of machine learning algorithms trained on them. Unfortunately, despite being used in a large number of studies, meta-features are not uniformly described and computed, making many empirical studies irreproducible and hard to compare. This paper aims to remedy this by systematizing and standardizing data characterization measures used in meta-learning, and performing an in-depth analysis of their utility. Moreover, it presents MFE, a new tool for extracting meta-features from datasets and identify more subtle reproducibility issues in the literature, proposing guidelines for data characterization that strengthen reproducible empirical research in meta-learning.",

            "abstract": "Current deep neural networks (DNNs) can easily overfit to biased training data with corrupted labels or class imbalance. Sample re-weighting strategy is commonly used to alleviate this issue by designing a weighting function mapping from training loss to sample weight, and then iterating between weight recalculating and classifier updating. Current approaches, however, need manually pre-specify the weighting function as well as its additional hyper-parameters. It makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice due to the significant variation of proper weighting schemes relying on the investigated problem and training data. To address this issue, we propose a method capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting function directly from data. The weighting function is an MLP with one hidden layer, constituting a universal approximator to almost any continuous functions, making the method able to fit a wide range of weighting functions including those assumed in conventional research. Guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data, the parameters of the weighting function can be finely updated simultaneously with the learning process of the classifiers. Synthetic and real experiments substantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper weighting functions in class imbalance and noisy label cases, fully complying with the common settings in traditional methods, and more complicated scenarios beyond conventional cases. This naturally leads to its better accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods.",

A promising approach is to learn a weight initialization such that a small number of weight changes results in low generalization error. We show that this form of meta-learning can be improved by letting the learning algorithm decide which weights to change, i.e., by learning where to learn. We find that patterned sparsity emerges from this process, with the pattern of sparsity varying on a problem-by-problem basis. This selective sparsity results in better generalization and less interference in a range of few-shot and continual learning problems. Moreover, we find that sparse learning also emerges in a more expressive model where learning rates are meta-learned. Our results shed light on an ongoing debate on whether meta-learning can discover adaptable features and suggest that learning by sparse gradient descent is a powerful inductive bias for meta-learning systems.",

            "abstract": "Meta-reinforcement learning (RL) methods can meta-train policies that adapt to new tasks with orders of magnitude less data than standard RL, but meta-training itself is costly and time-consuming. If we can meta-train on offline data, then we can reuse the same static dataset, labeled once with rewards for different tasks, to meta-train policies that adapt to a variety of new tasks at meta-test time. Although this capability would make meta-RL a practical tool for real-world use, offline meta-RL presents additional challenges beyond online meta-RL or standard offline RL settings. Meta-RL learns an exploration strategy that collects data for adapting, and also meta-trains a policy that quickly adapts to data from a new task. Since this policy was meta-trained on a fixed, offline dataset, it might behave unpredictably when adapting to data collected by the learned exploration strategy, which differs systematically from the offline data and thus induces distributional shift. We propose a hybrid offline meta-RL algorithm, which uses offline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive policy, and then collects additional unsupervised online data, without any reward labels to bridge this distribution shift. By not requiring reward labels for online collection, this data can be much cheaper to collect. We compare our method to prior work on offline meta-RL on simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks and find that using additional unsupervised online data collection leads to a dramatic improvement in the adaptive capabilities of the meta-trained policies, matching the performance of fully online meta-RL on a range of challenging domains that require generalization to new tasks.",

            "abstract": "Meta-learning has been proposed as a framework to address the challenging few-shot learning setting. The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, meta-learning typically uses shallow neural networks (SNNs), thus limiting its effectiveness. In this paper we propose a novel few-shot learning method called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to adapt a deep NN for few shot learning tasks. Specifically, \"meta\" refers to training multiple tasks, and \"transfer\" is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum for MTL. We conduct experiments using (5-class, 1-shot) and (5-class, 5-shot) recognition tasks on two challenging few-shot learning benchmarks: miniImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our meta-transfer learning approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.",

Conventional deep convolutional feature-based discriminative visual tracking algorithms require continuous re-training of classifiers or correlation filters, which involve solving complex optimization tasks to adapt to the new appearance of a target object. To alleviate this complex process, our proposed algorithm incorporates and utilizes a meta-learner network to provide the matching network with new appearance information of the target objects by adding target-aware feature space. The parameters for the target-specific feature space are provided instantly from a single forward-pass of the meta-learner network. By eliminating the necessity of continuously solving complex optimization tasks in the course of tracking, experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs at a real-time speed while maintaining competitive performance among other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.",

Recently, a subcommunity of machine learning has focused on solving this problem with Sequential Model-based Bayesian Optimization (SMBO), demonstrating substantial successes in many applications. However, for computationally expensive algorithms the overhead of hyperparameter optimization can still be prohibitive. In this paper we mimic a strategy human domain experts use: speed up optimization by starting from promising configurations that performed well on similar datasets. The resulting initialization technique integrates naturally into the generic SMBO framework and can be trivially applied to any SMBO method. To validate our approach, we perform extensive experiments with two established SMBO frameworks (Spearmint and SMAC) with complementary strengths; optimizing two machine learning frameworks on 57 datasets. Our initialization procedure yields mild improvements for low-dimensional hyperparameter optimization and substantially improves the state of the art for the more complex combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problem.\n \n",

This meta-analysis includes 145 empirical studies and investigates the effectiveness of different scaffolding types and technology in simulation-based learning environments to facilitate complex skills. The simulations had a large positive overall effect: g = 0.85, SE = 0.08; CIs [0.69, 1.02]. Technology use and scaffolding had positive effects on learning. Learners with high prior knowledge benefited more from reflection phases; learners with low prior knowledge learned better when supported by examples. Findings were robust across different higher education domains (e.g., medical and teacher education, management). We conclude that (1) simulations are among the most effective means to facilitate learning of complex skills across domains and (2) different scaffolding types can facilitate simulation-based learning during different phases of the development of knowledge and skills.",

Analysts screened these studies to find those that (a) contrasted an online to a face-to-face condition, (b) measured student learning outcomes, (c) used a rigorous research design, and (d) provided adequate information to calculate an effect size. As a result of this screening, 51 independent effects were identified that could be subjected to meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found that, on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction. The difference between student outcomes for online and face-to-face classes\u2014measured as the difference between treatment and control means, divided by the pooled standard deviation\u2014was larger in those studies contrasting conditions that blended elements of online and face-to-face instruction with conditions taught entirely face-to-face. Analysts noted that these blended conditions often included additional learning time and instructional elements not received by students in control conditions. This finding suggests that the positive effects associated with blended learning should not be attributed to the media, per se. An unexpected finding was the small number of rigorous published studies contrasting online and face-to-face learning conditions for K\u201312 students. In light of this small corpus, caution is required in generalizing to the K\u201312 population because the results are derived for the most part from studies in other settings (e.g., medical training, higher education).",

            "abstract": "Background Blended learning, which combines face-to-face learning and e-learning, has grown rapidly to be commonly used in education. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this learning approach has not been completely quantitatively synthesized and evaluated using knowledge outcomes in health education. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of blended learning compared to that of traditional learning in health education. Methods We performed a systematic review of blended learning in health education in MEDLINE from January 1990 to July 2019. We independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and compared overall blended learning versus traditional learning, offline blended learning versus traditional learning, online blended learning versus traditional learning, digital blended learning versus traditional learning, computer-aided instruction blended learning versus traditional learning, and virtual patient blended learning versus traditional learning. All pooled analyses were based on random-effect models, and the I2 statistic was used to quantify heterogeneity across studies. Results A total of 56 studies (N=9943 participants) assessing several types of learning support in blended learning met our inclusion criteria; 3 studies investigated offline support, 7 studies investigated digital support, 34 studies investigated online support, 8 studies investigated computer-assisted instruction support, and 5 studies used virtual patient support for blended learning. The pooled analysis comparing all blended learning to traditional learning showed significantly better knowledge outcomes for blended learning (standardized mean difference 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.28, I2=94.3%). Similar results were observed for online (standardized mean difference 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.86, I2=94.9%), computer-assisted instruction (standardized mean difference 1.13, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.79, I2=78.0%), and virtual patient (standardized mean difference 0.62, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.06, I2=78.4%) learning support, but results for offline learning support (standardized mean difference 0.08, 95% CI \u20130.63 to 0.79, I2=87.9%) and digital learning support (standardized mean difference 0.04, 95% CI \u20130.45 to 0.52, I2=93.4%) were not significant. Conclusions From this review, blended learning demonstrated consistently better effects on knowledge outcomes when compared with traditional learning in health education. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to explore the utility of different design variants of blended learning.",

In their work, they try to find relationships between the performance of some methods from this field and the values of some data-complexity measures, with the aim of determining the best performing method given a data set, using only the values of the measures computed on this data. Nevertheless, most of the data-complexity measures existing in the literature were not conceived for this purpose and the feasibility of their use in this field is yet to be determined. In this paper, we revise the definition of some measures that we presented in a previous work, that were designed for meta-learning based instance selection. Also, we assess them in an experimental study involving three sets of measures, 59 databases, 16 instance selection methods, two classifiers, and eight regression learners used as meta-learners. The results suggest that our measures are more efficient and effective than those traditionally used by researchers that have addressed the instance selection from a perspective based on meta-learning.",

We show that under this assumption, the correct causal structural choices lead to faster adaptation to modified distributions because the changes are concentrated in one or just a few mechanisms when the learned knowledge is modularized appropriately. This leads to sparse expected gradients and a lower effective number of degrees of freedom needing to be relearned while adapting to the change. It motivates using the speed of adaptation to a modified distribution as a meta-learning objective. We demonstrate how this can be used to determine the cause-effect relationship between two observed variables. The distributional changes do not need to correspond to standard interventions (clamping a variable), and the learner has no direct knowledge of these interventions. We show that causal structures can be parameterized via continuous variables and learned end-to-end. We then explore how these ideas could be used to also learn an encoder that would map low-level observed variables to unobserved causal variables leading to faster adaptation out-of-distribution, learning a representation space where one can satisfy the assumptions of independent mechanisms and of small and sparse changes in these mechanisms due to actions and non-stationarities.",

            "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, there has been an increasing use of peer assessment in classrooms and other learning settings. Despite the prevailing view that peer assessment has a positive effect on learning across empirical studies, the results reported are mixed. In this meta-analysis, we synthesised findings based on 134 effect sizes from 58 studies. Compared to students who do not participate in peer assessment, those who participate in peer assessment show a .291 standard deviation unit increase in their performance. Further, we performed a meta-regression analysis to examine the factors that are likely to influence the peer assessment effect. The most critical factor is rater training. When students receive rater training, the effect size of peer assessment is substantially larger than when students do not receive such training. Computer-mediated peer assessment is also associated with greater learning gains than the paper-based peer assessment. A few other variables (such as rating format, rating criteria and frequency of peer assessment) also show noticeable, although not statistically significant, effects. The results of the meta-analysis can be considered by researchers and teachers as a basis for determining how to make effective use of peer assessment as a learning tool.",

Due to its effective applications, deep learning has also been introduced for automatic change detection and achieved great success. The present study attempts to provide a comprehensive review and a meta-analysis of the recent progress in this subfield. Specifically, we first introduce the fundamentals of deep learning methods which are frequently adopted for change detection. Secondly, we present the details of the meta-analysis conducted to examine the status of change detection DL studies. Then, we focus on deep learning-based change detection methodologies for remote sensing images by giving a general overview of the existing methods. Specifically, these deep learning-based methods were classified into three groups; fully supervised learning-based methods, fully unsupervised learning-based methods and transfer learning-based techniques. As a result of these investigations, promising new directions were identified for future research. This study will contribute in several ways to our understanding of deep learning for change detection and will provide a basis for further research. Some source codes of the methods discussed in this paper are available from: https://github.com/lazharkhelifi/deeplearning_changedetection_remotesensing_review.",

The most frequently used online platform was Zoom\u00ae. The studies examined both synchronous and asynchronous approaches. There was no evidence regarding duration and students' and teachers' attitude.\n This study suggests that the online learning shift was feasible; however, because of the nature of the education shift (pandemic), future studies must further analyze the educational structure.\n",

In contrast, meta-learning learns from many related tasks a meta-learner that can learn a new task more accurately and faster with fewer examples, where the choice of meta-learners is crucial. In this paper, we develop Meta-SGD, an SGD-like, easily trainable meta-learner that can initialize and adapt any differentiable learner in just one step, on both supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Compared to the popular meta-learner LSTM, Meta-SGD is conceptually simpler, easier to implement, and can be learned more efficiently. Compared to the latest meta-learner MAML, Meta-SGD has a much higher capacity by learning to learn not just the learner initialization, but also the learner update direction and learning rate, all in a single meta-learning process. Meta-SGD shows highly competitive performance for few-shot learning on regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.",

For example, a well-trained model on webface data cannot deal with the ID vs. Spot task in surveillance scenario. In this paper, we aim to learn a generalized model that can directly handle new unseen domains without any model updating. To this end, we propose a novel face recognition method via meta-learning named Meta Face Recognition (MFR). MFR synthesizes the source/target domain shift with a meta-optimization objective, which requires the model to learn effective representations not only on synthesized source domains but also on synthesized target domains. Specifically, we build domain-shift batches through a domain-level sampling strategy and get back-propagated gradients/meta-gradients on synthesized source/target domains by optimizing multi-domain distributions. The gradients and meta-gradients are further combined to update the model to improve generalization. Besides, we propose two benchmarks for generalized face recognition evaluation. Experiments on our benchmarks validate the generalization of our method compared to several baselines and other state-of-the-arts. The proposed benchmarks and code will be available at https://github.com/cleardusk/MFR.",

Various value-based reinforcement learning methods have been proposed to deal with this classical transportation problem and achieved better performances compared with traditional transportation methods. However, current reinforcement learning models rely on tremendous training data and computational resources, which may have bad consequences (e.g., traffic jams or accidents) in the real world. In traffic signal control, some algorithms have been proposed to empower quick learning from scratch, but little attention is paid to learning by transferring and reusing learned experience. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as MetaLight, to speed up the learning process in new scenarios by leveraging the knowledge learned from existing scenarios. MetaLight is a value-based meta-reinforcement learning workflow based on the representative gradient-based meta-learning algorithm (MAML), which includes periodically alternate individual-level adaptation and global-level adaptation. Moreover, MetaLight improves the-state-of-the-art reinforcement learning model FRAP in traffic signal control by optimizing its model structure and updating paradigm. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that our proposed MetaLight not only adapts more quickly and stably in new traffic scenarios, but also achieves better performance.",

How effective online learning is for undergraduate medical education remains unknown. This article\u2019s aim is to evaluate whether online learning when compared to offline learning can improve learning outcomes of undergraduate medical students. Five databases and four key journals of medical education were searched using 10 terms and their Boolean combinations during 2000\u20132017. The extracted articles on undergraduates\u2019 knowledge and skill outcomes were synthesized using a random effects model for the meta-analysis.16 out of 3,700 published articles were identified. The meta-analyses affirmed a statistically significant difference between online and offline learning for knowledge and skill outcomes based on post-test scores (SMD = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.43, 1.20; p < 0.0001; n = 15). The only comparison result based on retention test scores was also statistically significant (SMD = 4.64; 95% CI: 3.19, 6.09; p < 0.00001). The meta-analyses discovered no significant difference when using pre- and post-test score gains (SMD = 3.03; 95% CI: \u22120.13, 4.13; p = 0.07; n = 3). There is no evidence that offline learning works better. And compared to offline learning, online learning has advantages to enhance undergraduates\u2019 knowledge and skills, therefore, can be considered as a potential method in undergraduate medical teaching.",

There exist several widely-used resampling methods. Recent research showed that the choice of resampling method significantly affects the quality of classification, which raises resampling selection problem. Exhaustive search for optimal resampling is time-consuming and hence it is of limited use. In this paper, we describe an alternative approach to the resampling selection. We follow the meta-learning concept to build resampling recommendation systems, i.e., algorithms recommending resampling for datasets on the basis of their properties.",

Given that it is impractical to train separate policies to accommodate all situations the agent may see in the real world, this work proposes to learn how to quickly and effectively adapt online to new tasks. To enable sample-efficient learning, we consider learning online adaptation in the context of model-based reinforcement learning. Our approach uses meta-learning to train a dynamics model prior such that, when combined with recent data, this prior can be rapidly adapted to the local context. Our experiments demonstrate online adaptation for continuous control tasks on both simulated and real-world agents. We first show simulated agents adapting their behavior online to novel terrains, crippled body parts, and highly-dynamic environments. We also illustrate the importance of incorporating online adaptation into autonomous agents that operate in the real world by applying our method to a real dynamic legged millirobot. We demonstrate the agent's learned ability to quickly adapt online to a missing leg, adjust to novel terrains and slopes, account for miscalibration or errors in pose estimation, and compensate for pulling payloads.",

Thus, if we know how to optimally perturb training examples to account for test examples, we may achieve better generalization performance. However, obtaining such perturbation is not possible in standard machine learning frameworks as the distribution of the test data is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel regularization method, meta-dropout, which learns to perturb the latent features of training examples for generalization in a meta-learning framework. Specifically, we meta-learn a noise generator which outputs a multiplicative noise distribution for latent features, to obtain low errors on the test instances in an input-dependent manner. Then, the learned noise generator can perturb the training examples of unseen tasks at the meta-test time for improved generalization. We validate our method on few-shot classification datasets, whose results show that it significantly improves the generalization performance of the base model, and largely outperforms existing regularization methods such as information bottleneck, manifold mixup, and information dropout.",

Although numerous research studies acknowledged the affordance, a full-scale investigation that discussed how they can be applied to language learning with substantial evidence of effect sizes were not presented. Thus, this analysis aimed to synthesize the research findings particularly in the impact of 3DVWs on language learning by addressing two issues. The first one concerned the role of interaction in 3DVWs with theoretical bases, while the second issue concerned the effect sizes of moderating variables, based on experimental findings that were published between 2008 and 2019. Data with 50 variables generated from 13 primary studies were analyzed. Different patterns of interaction were identified based on three theories. The meta-analysis showed (1) significant overall linguistic gains (d = .832) and affective gains (d = .531), and (2) various effect sizes for moderator variables, such as types of learning activities. Based on these results, this paper used the notion of partnership to interpret the relation between 3DVWs and language learners.",

            "abstract": "Imbalanced learning (IL), i.e., learning unbiased models from class-imbalanced data, is a challenging problem. Typical IL methods including resampling and reweighting were designed based on some heuristic assumptions. They often suffer from unstable performance, poor applicability, and high computational cost in complex tasks where their assumptions do not hold. In this paper, we introduce a novel ensemble IL framework named MESA. It adaptively resamples the training set in iterations to get multiple classifiers and forms a cascade ensemble model. MESA directly learns the sampling strategy from data to optimize the final metric beyond following random heuristics. Moreover, unlike prevailing meta-learning-based IL solutions, we decouple the model-training and meta-training in MESA by independently train the meta-sampler over task-agnostic meta-data. This makes MESA generally applicable to most of the existing learning models and the meta-sampler can be efficiently applied to new tasks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and transferability of MESA. Our code is available at this https URL.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces the offline meta-reinforcement learning (offline meta-RL) problem setting and proposes an algorithm that performs well in this setting. Offline meta-RL is analogous to the widely successful supervised learning strategy of pre-training a model on a large batch of fixed, pre-collected data (possibly from various tasks) and fine-tuning the model to a new task with relatively little data. That is, in offline meta-RL, we meta-train on fixed, pre-collected data from several tasks and adapt to a new task with a very small amount (less than 5 trajectories) of data from the new task. By nature of being offline, algorithms for offline meta-RL can utilize the largest possible pool of training data available and eliminate potentially unsafe or costly data collection during meta-training. This setting inherits the challenges of offline RL, but it differs significantly because offline RL does not generally consider a) transfer to new tasks or b) limited data from the test task, both of which we face in offline meta-RL. Targeting the offline meta-RL setting, we propose Meta-Actor Critic with Advantage Weighting (MACAW). MACAW is an optimization-based meta-learning algorithm that uses simple, supervised regression objectives for both the inner and outer loop of meta-training. On offline variants of common meta-RL benchmarks, we empirically find that this approach enables fully offline meta-reinforcement learning and achieves notable gains over prior methods.",

In this work, we propose a Meta Relational Learning (MetaR) framework to do the common but challenging few-shot link prediction in KGs, namely predicting new triples about a relation by only observing a few associative triples. We solve few-shot link prediction by focusing on transferring relation-specific meta information to make model learn the most important knowledge and learn faster, corresponding to relation meta and gradient meta respectively in MetaR. Empirically, our model achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot link prediction KG benchmarks.",

Thirty-eight interventions took place outside the United States. Follow-up outcomes (collected 6\u00a0months to 18\u00a0years postintervention) demonstrate SEL's enhancement of positive youth development. Participants fared significantly better than controls in social-emotional skills, attitudes, and indicators of well-being. Benefits were similar regardless of students' race, socioeconomic background, or school location. Postintervention social-emotional skill development was the strongest predictor of well-being at follow-up. Infrequently assessed but notable outcomes (e.g., graduation and safe sexual behaviors) illustrate SEL's improvement of critical aspects of students' developmental trajectories.",

            "abstract": "The significance of scaffolding in education has received considerable attention. Many studies have examined the effects of scaffolding with diverse groups of participants, purposes, learning outcomes, and learning environments. The purpose of this research was to conduct a meta-analysis of the effects of scaffolding on learning outcomes in an online learning environment in higher education. This meta-analysis included studies with 64 effect sizes from 18 journal articles published in English, in eight countries, from 2010 to 2019. The meta-analysis revealed that scaffolding in an online learning environment has a large and statistically significant effect on learning outcomes. The meta-cognitive domain yielded a larger effect size than did the affective and cognitive domains. In terms of types of scaffolding activities, meta-cognitive scaffolding outnumbered other types of scaffolding. Computers as a scaffolding source in an online learning environment were also more prevalent than were human instructors. In addition, scholars in the United States have produced a large portion of the scaffolding research. Finally, the academic area of language and literature has adopted scaffolding most widely. Given that effective scaffolding can improve the quality of learning in an online environment, the current research is expected to contribute to online learning outcomes and learning experiences.",

However, the onerous data requirements of meta-training compounded with the challenge of learning from sensory inputs such as images have made meta-RL challenging to apply to real robotic systems. Latent state models, which learn compact state representations from a sequence of observations, can accelerate representation learning from visual inputs. In this paper, we leverage the perspective of meta-learning as task inference to show that latent state models can \\emph{also} perform meta-learning given an appropriately defined observation space. Building on this insight, we develop meta-RL with latent dynamics (MELD), an algorithm for meta-RL from images that performs inference in a latent state model to quickly acquire new skills given observations and rewards. MELD outperforms prior meta-RL methods on several simulated image-based robotic control problems, and enables a real WidowX robotic arm to insert an Ethernet cable into new locations given a sparse task completion signal after only $8$ hours of real world meta-training. To our knowledge, MELD is the first meta-RL algorithm trained in a real-world robotic control setting from images.",

The main purpose of this study is to determine the effect of mobile learning on students' learning performance. In this study, the meta-analysis method was employed. The literature was reviewed through different databases in order to access the relevant researches within the scope of the study. After reviewing the literature, study aspects and inclusion criteria were applied. The studies to be included in the meta-analysis were examined, and 104 studies conducted between the years of 2009 and 2019 that met the inclusion criteria were subjected to a meta-analysis. Education level, course/subject and the implementation period of the studies were determined as moderating variables. The sample of the study consists of 7,568 participants. As a result of the analysis performed according to the random effects model, the mean effect size value was calculated as 0.85 with an error of 0.07. It was determined that there was no publication bias in the meta-analysis. According to the results of the moderator analysis, it was found that the effect of mobile learning on the learning performance of the students did not change according to the education level and the implementation period, but it changed according to the course/subject. In addition to the aforementioned research results, this article also contains descriptive analysis of the results of the studies included in the meta-analysis.",

            "abstract": "The goal of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is to build agents that can quickly learn new tasks by leveraging prior experience on related tasks. Learning a new task often requires both exploring to gather task-relevant information and exploiting this information to solve the task. In principle, optimal exploration and exploitation can be learned end-to-end by simply maximizing task performance. However, such meta-RL approaches struggle with local optima due to a chicken-and-egg problem: learning to explore requires good exploitation to gauge the exploration's utility, but learning to exploit requires information gathered via exploration. Optimizing separate objectives for exploration and exploitation can avoid this problem, but prior meta-RL exploration objectives yield suboptimal policies that gather information irrelevant to the task. We alleviate both concerns by constructing an exploitation objective that automatically identifies task-relevant information and an exploration objective to recover only this information. This avoids local optima in end-to-end training, without sacrificing optimal exploration. Empirically, DREAM substantially outperforms existing approaches on complex meta-RL problems, such as sparse-reward 3D visual navigation. Videos of DREAM: https://ezliu.github.io/dream/",

If however the meta-training tasks have sparse rewards, the need for exploration during meta-training is exacerbated given that the agent has to explore and learn across many tasks. We show that current meta-learning methods can fail catastrophically in such environments. To address this problem, we propose HyperX, a novel method for meta-learning in sparse reward tasks. Using novel reward bonuses for meta-training, we incentivise the agent to explore in approximate hyper-state space, i.e., the joint state and approximate belief space, where the beliefs are over tasks. We show empirically that these bonuses allow an agent to successfully learn to solve sparse reward tasks where existing meta-learning methods fail.",

However, unlike supervised learning, no teacher or oracle is available to provide the true value function. Instead, the majority of reinforcement learning algorithms estimate and/or optimise a proxy for the value function. This proxy is typically based on a sampled and bootstrapped approximation to the true value function, known as a return. The particular choice of return is one of the chief components determining the nature of the algorithm: the rate at which future rewards are discounted; when and how values should be bootstrapped; or even the nature of the rewards themselves. It is well-known that these decisions are crucial to the overall success of RL algorithms. We discuss a gradient-based meta-learning algorithm that is able to adapt the nature of the return, online, whilst interacting and learning from the environment. When applied to 57 games on the Atari 2600 environment over 200 million frames, our algorithm achieved a new state-of-the-art performance.",

By conditioning on an effective context, Meta-RL policies can easily generalize to new tasks within a few adaptation steps. We argue that improving the quality of context involves answering two questions: 1. How to train a compact and sufficient encoder that can embed the task-specific information contained in prior trajectories? 2. How to collect informative trajectories of which the corresponding context reflects the specification of tasks? To this end, we propose a novel Meta-RL framework called CCM (Contrastive learning augmented Context-based Meta-RL). We first focus on the contrastive nature behind different tasks and leverage it to train a compact and sufficient context encoder. Further, we train a separate exploration policy and theoretically derive a new information-gain-based objective which aims to collect informative trajectories in a few steps. Empirically, we evaluate our approaches on common benchmarks as well as several complex sparse-reward environments. The experimental results show that CCM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by addressing previously mentioned problems respectively.",

Mimicking the same behavior and synthesizing deformed instances of new concepts may help visual recognition systems perform better one-shot learning, i.e., learning concepts from one or few examples. Our key insight is that, while the deformed images may not be visually realistic, they still maintain critical semantic information and contribute significantly to formulating classifier decision boundaries. Inspired by the recent progress of meta-learning, we combine a meta-learner with an image deformation sub-network that produces additional training examples, and optimize both models in an end-to-end manner. The deformation sub-network learns to deform images by fusing a pair of images --- a probe image that keeps the visual content and a gallery image that diversifies the deformations. We demonstrate results on the widely used one-shot learning benchmarks (miniImageNet and ImageNet 1K Challenge datasets), which significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches.",

We propose a new method which automatically learns appropriate labels for an auxiliary task, such that any supervised learning task can be improved without requiring access to any further data. The approach is to train two neural networks: a label-generation network to predict the auxiliary labels, and a multi-task network to train the primary task alongside the auxiliary task. The loss for the label-generation network incorporates the loss of the multi-task network, and so this interaction between the two networks can be seen as a form of meta learning with a double gradient. We show that our proposed method, Meta AuXiliary Learning (MAXL), outperforms single-task learning on 7 image datasets, without requiring any additional data. We also show that MAXL outperforms several other baselines for generating auxiliary labels, and is even competitive when compared with human-defined auxiliary labels. The self-supervised nature of our method leads to a promising new direction towards automated generalisation. Source code can be found at this https URL.",

Prototypical Networks learn a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to prototype representations of each class. Compared to recent approaches for few-shot learning, they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is beneficial in this limited-data regime, and achieve excellent results. We provide an analysis showing that some simple design decisions can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches involving complicated architectural choices and meta-learning.

            "abstract": "Leveraging weak or noisy supervision for building effective machine learning models has long been an important research problem. Its importance has further increased recently due to the growing need for large-scale datasets to train deep learning models. Weak or noisy supervision could originate from multiple sources including non-expert annotators or automatic labeling based on heuristics or user interaction signals. There is an extensive amount of previous work focusing on leveraging noisy labels. Most notably, recent work has shown impressive gains by using a meta-learned instance re-weighting approach where a meta-learning framework is used to assign instance weights to noisy labels. In this paper, we extend this approach via posing the problem as a label correction problem within a meta-learning framework. We view the label correction procedure as a meta-process and propose a new meta-learning based framework termed MLC (Meta Label Correction) for learning with noisy labels. Specifically, a label correction network is adopted as a meta-model to produce corrected labels for noisy labels while the main model is trained to leverage the corrected labels. Both models are jointly trained by solving a bi-level optimization problem. We run extensive experiments with different label noise levels and types on both image recognition and text classification tasks. We compare the re-weighing and correction approaches showing that the correction framing addresses some of the limitations of re-weighting. We also show that the proposed MLC approach outperforms previous methods in both image and language tasks.",

            "abstract": "Humans achieve efficient learning by relying on prior knowledge about the structure of naturally occurring tasks. There is considerable interest in designing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with similar properties. This includes proposals to learn the learning algorithm itself, an idea also known as meta learning. One formal interpretation of this idea is as a partially observable multi-task RL problem in which task information is hidden from the agent. Such unknown task problems can be reduced to Markov decision processes (MDPs) by augmenting an agent's observations with an estimate of the belief about the task based on past experience. However estimating the belief state is intractable in most partially-observed MDPs. We propose a method that separately learns the policy and the task belief by taking advantage of various kinds of privileged information. Our approach can be very effective at solving standard meta-RL environments, as well as a complex continuous control environment with sparse rewards and requiring long-term memory.",

In this approach, models train on a series of seq2seq problems to acquire the compositional skills needed to solve new seq2seq problems. Meta se2seq learning solves several of the SCAN tests for compositional learning and can learn to apply implicit rules to variables.",

            "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing is crucial to the security of face recognition systems. Most previous methods formulate face anti-spoofing as a supervised learning problem to detect various predefined presentation attacks, which need large scale training data to cover as many attacks as possible. However, the trained model is easy to overfit several common attacks and is still vulnerable to unseen attacks. To overcome this challenge, the detector should: 1) learn discriminative features that can generalize to unseen spoofing types from predefined presentation attacks; 2) quickly adapt to new spoofing types by learning from both the predefined attacks and a few examples of the new spoofing types. Therefore, we define face anti-spoofing as a zero- and few-shot learning problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Inner-update Meta Face Anti-Spoofing (AIM-FAS) method to tackle this problem through meta-learning. Specifically, AIM-FAS trains a meta-learner focusing on the task of detecting unseen spoofing types by learning from predefined living and spoofing faces and a few examples of new attacks. To assess the proposed approach, we propose several benchmarks for zero- and few-shot FAS. Experiments show its superior performances on the presented benchmarks to existing methods in existing zero-shot FAS protocols.",

The goal of our work is to automatically synthesize labeled datasets that are relevant for a downstream task. We propose Meta-Sim, which learns a generative model of synthetic scenes, and obtain images as well as its corresponding ground-truth via a graphics engine. We parametrize our dataset generator with a neural network, which learns to modify attributes of scene graphs obtained from probabilistic scene grammars, so as to minimize the distribution gap between its rendered outputs and target data. If the real dataset comes with a small labeled validation set, we additionally aim to optimize a meta-objective, i.e. downstream task performance. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve content generation quality over a human-engineered probabilistic scene grammar, both qualitatively and quantitatively as measured by performance on a downstream task.",

In particular, estimating a large Hessian, poor sample efficiency and unstable training continue to make Meta-RL difficult. We propose a surrogate objective function named, Taming MAML (TMAML), that adds control variates into gradient estimation via automatic differentiation. TMAML improves the quality of gradient estimation by reducing variance without introducing bias. We further propose a version of our method that extends the meta-learning framework to learning the control variates themselves, enabling efficient and scalable learning from a distribution of MDPs. We empirically compare our approach with MAML and other variance-bias trade-off methods including DICE, LVC, and action-dependent control variates. Our approach is easy to implement and outperforms existing methods in terms of the variance and accuracy of gradient estimation, ultimately yielding higher performance across a variety of challenging Meta-RL environments.",

In this work, we introduce Meta Strategy Optimization, a meta-learning algorithm for training policies with latent variable inputs that can quickly adapt to new scenarios with a handful of trials in the target environment. The key idea behind MSO is to expose the same adaptation process, Strategy Optimization (SO), to both the training and testing phases. This allows MSO to effectively learn locomotion skills as well as a latent space that is suitable for fast adaptation. We evaluate our method on a real quadruped robot and demonstrate successful adaptation in various scenarios, including sim-to-real transfer, walking with a weakened motor, or climbing up a slope. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the generalization capability of the trained policy in simulated environments. Both real and simulated experiments show that our method outperforms previous methods in adaptation to novel tasks.",

            "abstract": "Meta-learning has been proposed as a framework to address the challenging few-shot learning setting. The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, typical meta-learning models use shallow neural networks, thus limiting its effectiveness. In order to achieve top performance, some recent works tried to use the DNNs pre-trained on large-scale datasets but mostly in straight-forward manners, e.g., (1) taking their weights as a warm start of meta-training, and (2) freezing their convolutional layers as the feature extractor of base-learners. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called meta-transfer learning (MTL), which learns to transfer the weights of a deep NN for few-shot learning tasks. Specifically, meta refers to training multiple tasks, and transfer is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights (and biases) for each task. To further boost the learning efficiency of MTL, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum of few-shot classification tasks. We conduct experiments for five-class few-shot classification tasks on three challenging benchmarks, miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and Fewshot-CIFAR100 (FC100), in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our MTL approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.",

First, we show that Q-learning is competitive with state-of-the-art meta-RL algorithms if given access to a context variable that is a representation of the past trajectory. Second, a multi-task objective to maximize the average reward across the training tasks is an effective method to meta-train RL policies. Third, past data from the meta-training replay buffer can be recycled to adapt the policy on a new task using off-policy updates. MQL draws upon ideas in propensity estimation to do so and thereby amplifies the amount of available data for adaptation. Experiments on standard continuous-control benchmarks suggest that MQL compares favorably with the state of the art in meta-RL.",

However, there is a lack of efficient methods that can simultaneously identify phages and plasmids in metagenomic data, and the existing tools identifying either phages or plasmids have not yet presented satisfactory performance. Findings We present PPR-Meta, a 3-class classifier that allows simultaneous identification of both phage and plasmid fragments from metagenomic assemblies. PPR-Meta consists of several modules for predicting sequences of different lengths. Using deep learning, a novel network architecture, referred to as the Bi-path Convolutional Neural Network, is designed to improve the performance for short fragments. PPR-Meta demonstrates much better performance than currently available similar tools individually for phage or plasmid identification, while testing on both artificial contigs and real metagenomic data. PPR-Meta is freely available via http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/ZhuLab/PPR_Meta or https://github.com/zhenchengfang/PPR-Meta. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, PPR-Meta is the first tool that can simultaneously identify phage and plasmid fragments efficiently and reliably. The software is optimized and can be easily run on a local PC by non-computer professionals. We developed PPR-Meta to promote the research on mobile genetic elements and horizontal gene transfer.",

Several studies have investigated levels of satisfaction and learning in synchronous online courses, asynchronous online learning management systems, and synchronous face-to-face classroom instruction. The goal of the present meta-analysis was to cumulate these effect sizes and test the predictive validity of Kirkpatrick\u2019s assumption. In this connection, particular attention was given to a prototypical form of synchronous online courses \u2013 so called \u201cwebinars\u201d. The following two research questions were addressed: (a) Compared to asynchronous online and face-to-face instruction, how effective are webinars in promoting student learning and satisfaction? (b) What is the association between satisfaction and learning in webinar, asynchronous online and face-to-face instruction? The results showed that webinars were descriptively more effective in promoting student knowledge than asynchronous online (Hedges\u2019 g = 0.29) and face-to-face instruction (g = 0.06). Satisfaction was negligibly higher in webinars compared to asynchronous online instruction (g = 0.12) but was lower in webinars to face-to-face instruction (g = -0.33). Learning and satisfaction were negatively associated in all three conditions, indicating no empirical support for Kirkpatrick\u2019s assumption in the context of webinar, asynchronous online and face-to-face instruction.",

Given a set of relationships specified in forms of meta-paths in an HIN, HIN2Vec carries out multiple prediction training tasks jointly based on a target set of relationships to learn latent vectors of nodes and meta-paths in the HIN. In addition to model design, several issues unique to HIN2Vec, including regularization of meta-path vectors, node type selection in negative sampling, and cycles in random walks, are examined. To validate our ideas, we learn latent vectors of nodes using four large-scale real HIN datasets, including Blogcatalog, Yelp, DBLP and U.S. Patents, and use them as features for multi-label node classification and link prediction applications on those networks. Empirical results show that HIN2Vec soundly outperforms the state-of-the-art representation learning models for network data, including DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, PTE, HINE and ESim, by 6.6% to 23.8% of $micro$-$f_1$ in multi-label node classification and 5% to 70.8% of $MAP$ in link prediction.",

Team-based learning is a particular set of instructional components most often used in higher education classrooms. Authors of team-based learning reviews report that team-based learning improves students\u2019 end of course grades, test performance, and classroom engagement. Students report that team-based learning is interesting, allows for deeper understanding of content, and prepares them more effectively for assessment and course performance. A total of 30 studies were located and synthesized. In total, 17 studies met criteria for a meta-analysis, yielding a mean effect size estimate of 0.55, p\u2009<\u20090.001 across all measures. Moderator analysis indicated that group size moderated the magnitude of effect to a statistically significant degree, with smaller group sizes contributing to additional effects. The meta-analysis is followed by a confirmatory synthesis of the remaining 13 studies. Implications for instruction incorporating the use of team-based learning are described.",
