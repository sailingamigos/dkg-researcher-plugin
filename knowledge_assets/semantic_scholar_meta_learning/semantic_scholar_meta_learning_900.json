However, current definitions and descriptions of this concept suffer from conceptual confusion and terminological ambiguity, impeding a proper theoretical understanding and hindering empirical research. Following Bateson and Argyris and Schon, I reformulate the concept of deutero-learning as the behavioral adaptation to patterns of conditioning in relationships in organizational contexts, distinguishing it from meta-learning and planned learning.",

The network uses subsets of its input and output units for observing its own errors and for explicitly analysing and manipulating all of its own weights, including those weights responsible for analyzing and manipulating weights. This effectively embeds a chain of meta-networks and meta-meta-. . .-networks into the network itself.<<ETX>>",

            "abstract": "In this article we take a close look at the now popular claim that many school subjects, and mathematics among them, are best learned in an interactive way, through conversation with others. Two types of specially devised analytical tools are used to analyze the data coming from a two-month-long series of interactions between two 13-year-old boys learning algebra. Focal analysis gives us a detailed picture of the students' conversation on the level of its immediate mathematical contents and makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of communication. This is complemented by preoccupational analysis, which is directed at meta-messages and examines participants' engagement in the conversation, thus possibly highlighting at least some of the reasons for communication failure. What we managed to see with the help of our special analytic tools led to a two-layered set of conclusions: It changed our opinion on learning-by-talking, and it also forced us to revise some of the basic assumptions with which we began our study. First, while having a close look at the pair of students working together, we realized that the merits of learning-by-talking cannot be taken for granted. Because of the ineffectiveness of the students' communication, the collaboration we had a chance to observe seemed unhelpful and lacking the expected synergetic quality. Second, on the meta-level, we concluded that what can be seen in classrooms does not make much sense as long as thinking is regarded as a self-sustained factor that regulates communication. For us, thinking became an act of communication in itself. This reconceptualization led to the disappearance of several traditional dichotomies that initially barred our insights: the dichotomy between \"contents of mind\" and the things people say or do; the split between cognition and affect and the distinction between individual and social research perspectives.",

We found that feedback to students about writing from adults, peers, self, and computers statistically enhanced writing quality, yielding average weighted effect sizes of 0.87, 0.58, 0.62, and 0.38, respectively. We did not find, however, that teachers\u2019 monitoring of students\u2019 writing progress or implementation of the 6 + 1 Trait Writing model meaningfully enhanced students\u2019 writing. The findings from this meta-analysis provide support for the use of formative writing assessments that provide feedback directly to students as part of everyday teaching and learning. We argue that such assessments should be used more frequently by teachers, and that they should play a stronger role in the Next-Generation Assessment Systems being developed by Smarter Balanced and PARCC.",

Researchers have been interested in this question not only because of the importance of spatial abilities, which underlie professions such as engineering, archaeology, and surgery, but also because spatial abilities are thought to be important in the discipline of mathematics.' This meta-analytic review synthesizes the results of 15 independent studies that address this controversial and highly publicized question. While the studies summarized here address a question distinct from the \"Mozart effect\" studies,2 scholars and the public have often failed to distinguish these two bodies of research (one on the spatial effects of passive music listening, the other on the spatial effects of active participation in music instruction). Yet whether college students' performance on spatial tasks is temporarily improved following brief exposure to classical music tells us almost nothing about whether preschool and elementary children perform better on spatial tests following a program of active music instruction. These instruction studies deserve separate summary so that we can understand their meaning and determine their implications for future research and classroom practice. Several previous reviews have assessed music's impact on nonmusical abilities, but none has directly addressed the question posed by this review. Five of these reviews are loosely related to the present summary in focus and/or method. A narrative review by Wolff assessed nonmusical outcomes of music education and critiqued study methods, including several studies with spatial outcomes.3 Tunks's chapter in The Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning defined and summarized the concept of transfer in relation to the field of music education.4 The only meta-analysis on extramusical effects of music education was published in 1996 by Standley, but it does not include spatial outcomes. Instead, it examines the effects of music used as a reinforcement for various educational and thera-",

            "abstract": "In this article research on teaching and learning is reviewed from a cross-cultural perspective. A meta-analysis indicates that across a number of very different cultures higher quality learning strategies, at both school and university level, are associated with higher student self-esteem and an internal locus of control. Such strategies tend to be encouraged in classrooms where students feel involved, the teachers are supportive, the workload is fair, and the assessment system reflects broader notions of learning beyond examination marks. In-depth research on Chinese students questions the validity of a number of basic Western notions of educational psychology regarding the nature of motivation and the role of memorisation. Other research suggests that the Western teacher education emphasis on getting students on task and coping with behavioural problems may not be as relevant in the Chinese context. Chinese educators tend to see both creativity and understanding as slow processes requiring much effort, repetition, and attention rather than relatively rapid, insightful processes. Such views are grounded in hundreds of years of Chinese philosophical thought. Any attempts to reform education by importing ideas from one culture to another must consider the overall contexts of the societies involved.",

However, what is not known is whether students with LD display greater levels of clinical depression than their peers without LD. If they do, then special education services should address this area of concern. If they do not, then the current mental health system may be adequate to treat children and adolescents with depression regardless of whether they have concomitant LD. The purpose of this study was to meta-analyze the data-based literature and quantify mean differences in depression measure scores and levels of clinical depression between students with and without LD.",

Some examples include data simulators that are widely used in engineering and scientific research, generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image synthesis, and hot-off-the-press approximate inference techniques relying on implicit distributions. The majority of existing approaches to learning implicit models rely on approximating the intractable distribution or optimisation objective for gradient-based optimisation, which is liable to produce inaccurate updates and thus poor models. This paper alleviates the need for such approximations by proposing the Stein gradient estimator, which directly estimates the score function of the implicitly defined distribution. The efficacy of the proposed estimator is empirically demonstrated by examples that include meta-learning for approximate inference, and entropy regularised GANs that provide improved sample diversity.",

An approach to this problem is presented which is guaranteed to find, without backtracing, all rule versions consistent with a set of positive and negative training instances. The algorithm put forth uses a representation of the space of those rules consistent with the observed training data. This \"rule version space\" is modified in response to new training instances by eliminating candidate rule versions found to conflict with each new instance. The use of version spaces is discussed in the context of Meta-DENDRAL, a program which learns rules in the domain of chemical spectroscopy.",

Areas of comparison included the academic process; programme evaluation; academic achievement; graduates' performance, specialty choices, and practice characteristics; and the attitude of students and teachers towards the programmes.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nData were extracted independently by multiple authors.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nStudents of the problem-based learning curriculum found learning to be \"more stimulating and more humane\" and \"engaging, difficult, and useful\", whereas students of the conventional curriculum found learning to be \"non-relevant, passive, and boring\". Students who used the problem-based learning method showed better interpersonal skills and psychosocial knowledge, as well as a better attitude towards patients. Students using the conventional model, however, performed better in basic science examinations. Teachers tended to enjoy teaching the newer curriculum. Although the two curricula encourage different ways of learning, there is no convincing evidence of improved learning using the problem-based learning curriculum.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA combination of both the conventional and newer curricula may provide the most effective training for undergraduate medical students.",

They compared 4 instructional methods: online discussion embedded within metacognitive guidance (Online+Meta), online discussion without metacognitive guidance (Online), face-to-face discussion with metacognitive guidance (Ftf+Meta), and face-to-face discussion without metacognitive guidance (Ftf). Participants were 86 seventh-grade Israeli boys and girls who practiced problem solving in 4 classes. Results showed that the Online+Meta students significantly outperformed the Ftf+Meta students, who, in turn, significantly outperformed the Online and Ftf students on mathematical literacy of standard tasks, real-life tasks, and various aspects of self-regulated learning. Regarding Online students, results were mixed; these students outperformed the Ftf students on part of the criteria for standard problem-solving standard tasks and real-life tasks. The authors found no significant differences between the Online and Ftf students on SRL. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",

However, in most real-life problems, we also have additional information about each of the features. This information can be represented as a set of properties, referred to as meta-features. For instance, in an image recognition task, where the features are pixels, the meta-features can be the (x, y) position of each pixel. We propose a new learning framework that incorporates metafeatures. In this framework we assume that a weight is assigned to each feature, as in linear discrimination, and we use the meta-features to de ne a prior on the weights. This prior is based on a Gaussian process and the weights are assumed to be a smooth function of the meta-features. Using this framework we derive a practical algorithm that improves generalization by using meta-features and discuss the theoretical advantages of incorporating them into the learning. We apply our framework to design a new kernel for handwritten digit recognition. We obtain higher accuracy with lower computational complexity in the primal representation. Finally, we discuss the applicability of this framework to biological neural networks.",

This article examines the literature on achievement effects of practical applications of group-based mastery learning in elementary and secondary schools over periods of at least 4 weeks, using a review technique, \u201cbest-evidence synthesis,\u201d which combines features of meta-analytic and traditional narrative reviews. The review found essentially no evidence to support the effectiveness of group-based mastery learning on standardized achievement measures. On experimenter-made measures, effects were generally positive but moderate in magnitude, with little evidence that effects maintained over time. These results are discussed in light of the coverage versus mastery dilemma posed by group-based mastery learning.",

It introduces and explains a framework for the analysis of educational data about writing pedagogy in which the connections are drawn across views of language, views of writing, views of learning to write, approaches to the teaching of writing, and approaches to the assessment of writing. The framework can be used for identifying discourses of writing in data such as policy documents, teaching and learning materials, recordings of pedagogic practice, interviews and focus groups with teachers and learners, and media coverage of literacy education. The paper also proposes that, while there are tensions and contradictions among these discourses, a comprehensive writing pedagogy might integrate teaching approaches from all six.",

Stacked sequential learning is a meta-learning algorithm, in which an arbitrary base learner is augmented so as to make it aware of the labels of nearby examples. We evaluate the method on several \"sequential partitioning problems\", which are characterized by long runs of identical labels. We demonstrate that on these problems, sequential stacking consistently improves the performance of nonsequential base learners; that sequential stacking often improves performance of learners (such as CRFs) that are designed specifically for sequential tasks; and that a sequentially stacked maximum-entropy learner generally outperforms CRFs.",

First, the reader is given an overview on how quantitative literature reviews (meta-analyses) can be conducted to give overall estimates of the quantitative impact an instructional treatment has on a specific student outcome. The second purpose is to illustrate how such a literature review is carried out by examining studies on using cooperative learning to teach chemistry at the high school and college levels. This analysis extends earlier reported work on effects of cooperative learning on achievement in college-level science, mathematics, and engineering and technology (SMET) courses. The analysis shows that while median student performance in a traditional course is at the 50th percentile, the median student performance in a cooperative learning environment is 14 percentile points higher.",

Examples of instructional approaches that improve writing quality are taken from experimental studies included in a recent meta-analysis by Gersten and Baker (2001) conducted on writing intervention research. A common goal in these studies was to teach students with learning disabilities how to organize writing tasks, generate ideas about the writing topics, and produce final written products that were coherent and organized. In this article, our goal is to illustrate how findings from these studies can be implemented in both general and special education settings.",

While there is agreement that massed practice depresses performance, the effect on learning has no firm consensus. One position is that massed practice depresses learning, although there are many that argue for no learning effect. In the present paper we review this literature. When distribution is considered in terms of the length of the inter-trial interval, there is strong evidence that massed practice depresses performance and learning (when learning is assessed by absolute retention measures). This conclusion was confirmed by the results of a meta-analysis. This finding is discussed relative to other literature on distribution of practice as well as some recent issues in motor learning.",

As part of their formal coursework, third year behavioural science students, functioning as \u2018student consultants\u2019, entered into a \u2018client\u2013consultant\u2019 relationship with first and second year \u2018student client\u2019 groups. Both groups of students reported positive learning outcomes. Third year student consultants reported using less surface and more deep approaches to their learning in this course design than in concurrent courses taught along more conventional (i.e. lecture and tutorial) lines. Students also reported significantly greater development of meta\u2010adaptive skills (e.g. learning to learn) than in conventional teaching designs.",

The relatively modest effects are discussed in relation to a number of theoretical psychometric and design issues that might account for the limited treatment outcomes.",

The course lasted 16 weeks for a total of approximately 80 lessons. The aim of the present study is to elaborate the student's cognitive system for atomic physics as a hypothetical pragmatic model to describe, analyse and explain his thinking and learning while interacting with the teaching input. In this paper, the student's learning pathway is described as a sequence of several meta\u2010stable conceptions of the atom, starting from a planetary model. His final cognitive element \u2018atom\u2019 following teaching is displayed as an association of three parallel conceptions including his initial planetary model, a state\u2010electron model and an electron\u2010cloud model. These different conceptions influence his thinking in different \u2018strengths\u2019 and \u2018status\u2019. In addition, the student's meta\u2010cognitive beliefs on physics and the way they are affected by a quantum world view are b...",

Improving learning competence can make a substantial contribution to solving each of these major concerns. The growing knowledge base on self-regulated learning was taken as one of the main starting points for our study.\n\n\nAIMS\nIn this article we report on reflection and attribution as basic components of self-regulated learning. We examine their trainability and their effect on academic performance. This study is part of a wider research project aimed at improving meta-cognitive knowledge as well as affective, conative and regulation skills. The experimental treatment consisted of an integrated set of instructional conditions, which were operationalized in a series of training sessions, as well as practice and transfer tasks.\n\n\nSAMPLE\nThe participants in this study were 141 first year students of business economics. The experimental group and both control groups each consisted of 47 students.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe effects of the learning environment were investigated using a quasiexperimental design. To control for unintended effects of the design the experimental and the first control group had the same number of teaching hours (time-on-task) and both teachers and students were not informed about the experimental design. Attribution and reflection behaviour was measured through specific assignments; study results during and after the intervention period were taken as indicators of academic performance. To test the hypotheses, t tests and effect-sizes were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter the intervention the experimental students showed a higher degree of reflective behaviour than the control students. Moreover, their attribution skills had also measurably improved. The experimental students obtained better study results than their peers in the control groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis intervention study, focused on the combined training of learning to reflect and to attribute constructively, provides evidence of the successful fostering both of meta-cognitive and of conative learning activities resulting in a positive impact on academic achievement.",

Unlike previous methods, incremental self-improvement encourages a reinforcement learning system to improve the way it learns, and to improve the way it improves the way it learns ... , without significant theoretical limitations the system is able to \"shift its inductive bias\" in a universal way. Its major features are: (1} There is no explicit difference between \"learning\", \"meta-learning\", and other kinds of information processing. Using a Turing machine equivalent programming language, the system itself occasionally executes self-delimiting, initially highly random \"self-modification programs\" which modify the context-dependent probabilities of future action sequences (including future self-modification programs}. (2} The system keeps only those probability modifications computed by \"useful\" selfmodification programs: those which bring about more payoff (reward, reinforcement} per time than all previous self-modification programs. (3) The computation of payoff per time takes into account all the computation time required for learning the entire system life is considered: boundaries between learning trials are ignored (if there are any). A particular implementation based on the novel paradigm is presented. It is designed to exploit what conventional digital machines are good at: fast storage addressing, arithmetic operations etc. Experiments illustrate the system's mode of",

The paper proceeds with a categorization of the main tools and functions that characterise collaborative learning systems (designed for primary/ secondary/ higher/ education) in order to discuss the current trade-offs. It proposes a design framework for collaborative learning systems that are addressed to primary & secondary education. This framework is derived from considerations of cognitive psychology, science education, and CSCL community research results. The paper concludes by presenting the main themes of the actual research agenda, which is intended to help design systems that can be integrated into primary and secondary education contexts.",

Epistemological beliefs refer to beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing (see review by Hofer & Pintrich, 1997) and metacognition refers to the ability to reflect upon, understand, and control one's learning (Schraw & Dennison, 1994). We predicted that the epistemological beliefs and meta-cognitive awareness of 116 preservice teachers would be significantly related to achievement in a hypermedia tutorial. Achievement was measured by a posttest based on the tutorial content. Results from a forced-order, hierarchical regression analysis indicated that reading comprehension, GPA, and three of the five epistemological beliefs (i.e., fixed ability, omniscient authority, and quick learning) significantly predicted posttest performance. Belief in omniscient authority and fixed ability being related to lower achievement supports previous research. Contrary to our expectations, a belief in quick learning was positively correlated with achievement. Educational and instructional design implications are discussed.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014Pediatric studies of cognitive function since 1985 were identified for study inclusion using MEDLINE and PsycInfo. Effect size (ES, Cohen's d) between the diabetic and control groups, expressed in SD units, were calculated within cognitive domains to standardize meta-analysis test performance. RESULTS\u2014The meta-analysis sample of 2,144 children consisted of 1,393 study subjects with type 1 diabetes and 751 control subjects from 19 studies. Overall, type 1 diabetes was associated with slightly lower overall cognition (ES \u22120.13), with small differences compared with control subjects across a broad range of domains, excluding learning and memory, which were similar for both groups. Learning and memory skills, both verbal and visual (\u22120.28 and \u22120.25), were more affected for children with early-onset diabetes (EOD) than late-onset diabetes (LOD), along with attention/executive function skills (\u22120.27). Compared with nondiabetic control subjects, EOD effects were larger, up to one-half SD lower, particularly for learning and memory (\u22120.49). Generally, seizures were associated with a negligible overall cognition ES of \u22120.06, with slight and inconsistent cognitive effects found on some measures, possibly reflecting the opposing effects of poorer versus better metabolic control. CONCLUSIONS\u2014Pediatric diabetes generally relates to mildly lower cognitive scores across most cognitive domains. Cognitive effects are most pronounced and pervasive for EOD, with moderately lower performance compared with control subjects. Seizures are generally related to nominal, inconsistent performance differences.",

They have the potential to act as catalysts for more effective exchange and reuse of learning objects to enable personalised learning. This article examines the extent to which current learning technology specifications contribute to educational change to actual sharing and reuse in educational practice. Furthermore, the article describes the need for an Educational Modelling Language centred on learning activities to give instructional meaning to learning objects. To date, specifications for learning objects have primarily been designed to ensure interoperability at a rather low infrastructural level (e.g., test items, meta-data), focusing on technology issues and reuse of learning objects. We argue that more widespread adoption of e-learning specifications and standards calls for a pedagogical framework at a higher infrastructural level (e.g., a complete course), focusing on the instructional value and reuse of learning activities. Such a framework is offered by the new Learning Design (LD) specification. LD enables the description of both learning content and processes from a variety of pedagogical perspectives, both objectivist and constructivist.",

The author conducted a meta-analysis to ascertain essential instructional components of repeated reading and the effect of repeated reading on reading fluency and comprehension. This analysis indicates that repeated reading can be used effectively with nondisabled students and students with learning disabilities to increase reading fluency and comprehension on a particular passage and as an intervention to increase overall fluency and comprehension ability. Essential instructional components of repeated reading varied as a function of the type of repeated reading (i.e., whether effectiveness was evaluated reading the same passage or different passages). Implications for future research are also presented.",

The students with language and/or learning disabilities demonstrated consistent and pervasive pragmatic deficits in conversation compared to non-disordered peers (mean effect size = -0.52; SE=0.06) across settings, conversational partners, age groups, and types of pragmatic skills measured. The pragmatic differences between the students with language or learning disabilities and control groups could not be accounted for by differences in study methodology or design. Furthermore, these pragmatic deficits appeared to be more attributable to underlying language deficits than to insufficient social knowledge. These findings are consistent with the perspective that students with learning disabilities can also be described as language disordered, and that children with language disorders experience a continuum of language failure that may be manifested in different ways as they progress through school.",

This analysis will necessarily require a reexamination of traditional models of career stages, particularly in relation to issues of aging in the career context. The paper starts with an examination of the \u201ccareer contract,\u201d the set of mutual expectations between employer and employee and on the ways that contract has changed over the last decade. Our summary view of the new contract is that it reflects a move from an organizationally based career to a protean or self-based career. This change has particularly strong implications, positive and negative, for older workers, and these are explored in depth. We argue that the contemporary high-speed work environment demands two key competencies (which we call \u201cmeta-skills,\u201d since they are skills for learning how to learn): identity development and heightened adaptability. The development of these meta-skills occurs through a process of midca- reer \u201croutine-busting.\u201d In our view, this suggests a new view of career stages, in which the focus is on many cycles of learning stages (continuous learning), rather than a single lifelong career stage cycle. The paper concludes with the implication of these new career concepts for the development of older workers, questioning the currently popular model of retraining and calling instead forcontinuous learningas a means of providing lifelong development for workers of all ages.",

In the present study, meta-analysis procedures were applied to the results of 70 managerial training studies to empirically integrate the findings of the studies. The metaanalysis results for 34 distributions of managerial training effects representing six training content areas, seven training methods, and four types of criteria (subjective learning, objective learning, subjective behavior, and objective results) indicated that managerial training is, on the average, moderately effective. For 12 of the 17 managerial training method distributions, the 90% lower bound credibility values were positive, and thus the effectiveness of these training methods, at least at a minimal level, can be generalized to new situations. It is stressed that although this meta-analysis assisted in clarifying what we have learned about managerial training, a great deal of empirical research on managerial training is needed before more conclusive statements can be made.",

This article presents a prescriptive theory of inductive reasoning that identifies cognitive processing using a procedural strategy for making comparisons. It is hypothesized that training in the use of the procedural inductive reasoning strategy will improve cognitive functioning in terms of (a) increased fluid intelligence performance and (b) better academic learning of classroom subject matter. The review and meta-analysis summarizes the results of 74 training experiments with nearly 3,600 children. Both hypotheses are confirmed. Further, two moderating effects were observed: Training effects on intelligence test performance increased over time, and positive problem-solving transfer to academic learning is greater than transfer to intelligence test performance. The results cannot be explained by placebo or test-coaching effects. It is concluded that the proposed strategy is theoretically and educationally promising and that children of a broad age range and intellectual capacity benefit with such training.",

            "abstract": "Ensemble methods, such as stacking, are designed to boost predictive accuracy by blending the predictions of multiple machine learning models. Recent work has shown that the use of meta-features, additional inputs describing each example in a dataset, can boost the performance of ensemble methods, but the greatest reported gains have come from nonlinear procedures requiring significant tuning and training time. Here, we present a linear technique, Feature-Weighted Linear Stacking (FWLS), that incorporates meta-features for improved accuracy while retaining the well-known virtues of linear regression regarding speed, stability, and interpretability. FWLS combines model predictions linearly using coefficients that are themselves linear functions of meta-features. This technique was a key facet of the solution of the second place team in the recently concluded Netflix Prize competition. Significant increases in accuracy over standard linear stacking are demonstrated on the Netflix Prize collaborative filtering dataset.",

Two recent acceleration techniques for on-line learning, matrix momentum and stochastic meta-descent (SMD), implement this approach. Since both were originally derived by very different routes, this offers fresh insight into their operation, resulting in further improvements to SMD.",

The methods and results of a synthesis of 67 studies are presented. Findings reveal that effective schools are able to develop policies and take actions in order to improve their teaching practice and learning environment. Factors excluded from the dynamic model were found to be only weakly associated with outcomes. Implications for research on school effectiveness and for improvement of practice are drawn. It is illustrated that this approach of conducting meta-analysis helps us interpret the findings by providing support to the validity of the dynamic model and suggestions for its further development.",

We present a comparative analysis of several ensemble methods through two case studies in genomics, namely the prediction of genetic interactions and protein functions, to demonstrate their efficacy on real-world datasets and draw useful conclusions about their behavior. These methods include simple aggregation, meta-learning, cluster-based meta-learning, and ensemble selection using heterogeneous classifiers trained on resampled data to improve the diversity of their predictions. We present a detailed analysis of these methods across 4 genomics datasets and find the best of these methods offer statistically significant improvements over the state of the art in their respective domains. In addition, we establish a novel connection between ensemble selection and meta-learning, demonstrating how both of these disparate methods establish a balance between ensemble diversity and performance.",

For researchers conducting qualitative meta-synthesis projects, the ideal goal is to retrieve all of the relevant studies in a field\u2014not simply a sample of them. Bates\u2019s model of berrypicking is used as the framework to describe the techniques used to conduct these searches. The authors discuss, in particular, the challenges of working with bibliographic databases, including choosing which databases to search, learning about the idiosyncrasies of working with each database, developing a list of search terms, and refining inclusion criteria regarding which studies to include in the meta-synthesis. Recommendations are given for searchers and writers of qualitative research.",

Previously, rank aggregation was performed mainly by means of unsupervised learning. To further enhance ranking accuracies, we propose employing supervised learning to perform the task, using labeled data. We refer to the approach as Supervised Rank Aggregation. We set up a general framework for conducting Supervised Rank Aggregation, in which learning is formalized an optimization which minimizes disagreements between ranking results and the labeled data. As case study, we focus on Markov Chain based rank aggregation in this paper. The optimization for Markov Chain based methods is not a convex optimization problem, however, and thus is hard to solve. We prove that we can transform the optimization problem into that of Semidefinite Programming and solve it efficiently. Experimental results on meta-searches show that Supervised Rank Aggregation can significantly outperform existing unsupervised methods.",

Conceptions of \u2018learning through dialogue\u2019, \u2018community of learners\u2019 and \u2018meta-learning\u2019 emerge as crucial in supporting students\u2019 learning. These conceptions extend understanding of effective teaching in higher education and illuminate how teachers transform their teaching to transform learning. Insights emerge about the importance of social contexts. Theoretical dimensions informing pedagogy, knowledge construction, relationships between teaching and research, and professional learning are congruent: dialogue and collegiality are key. What inhibits teachers\u2019 effectiveness is the \u2018performativity\u2019 culture especially setting aside preferred ways of operating as colleagues. A model is constructed to explain opposing standpoints.",

The method, called Thresholding, selects a proper threshold from training instances according to the misclassification cost. Similar to other cost-sensitive meta-learning methods, Thresholding can convert any existing (and future) costinsensitive learning algorithms and techniques into costsensitive ones. However, by comparing with the existing cost sensitive meta-learning methods and the direct use of the theoretical threshold, Thresholding almost always produces the lowest misclassification cost. Experiments also show that Thresholding has the least sensitivity on the misclassification cost ratio. Thus, it is recommended to use when the difference on misclassification costs is large.",

We present three results suggesting that this is not so. First we illustrate in a simple concrete example, the Black and White problem, that tracking can perform better than any converging algorithm on a stationary problem. Second, we show the same point on a larger, more realistic problem, an application of temporal difference learning to computer Go. Our third result suggests that tracking in stationary problems could be important for metalearning research (e.g., learning to learn, feature selection, transfer). We apply a metalearning algorithm for step-size adaptation, IDBD (Sutton, 1992a), to the Black and White problem, showing that meta-learning has a dramatic long-term effect on performance whereas, on an analogous converging problem, meta-learning has only a small second-order effect. This small result suggests a way of eventually overcoming a major obstacle to meta-learning research: the lack of an independent methodology for task selection.",

Metacognitive thinking is a key element in the transfer of learning. The child's development of metacognitive skills is defined as meta-learning. Meta-teaching strategies can help mediate the metacognitive skills of children, help to stimilate children's metacognitive thinking. The article draws upon reserch currently being undertaken in London schools on raising achievement in thinking and learning through developing the metacognition of children as learners in schools.",

Developing a way to solve this problem automatically would make current machine learning methods much more useful. Previous efforts to automate feature selection rely on expensive meta-learning or are applicable only when labeled training data is available. This paper presents a novel method called FS-NEAT which extends the NEAT neuroevolution method to automatically determine an appropriate set of inputs for the networks it evolves. By learning the network's inputs, topology, and weights simultaneously, FS-NEAT addresses the feature selection problem without relying on meta-learning or labeled data. Initial experiments in an autonomous car racing simulation demonstrate that FS-NEAT can learn better and faster than regular NEAT. In addition, the networks it evolves are smaller and require fewer inputs. Furthermore, FS-NEAT's performance remains robust even as the feature selection task it faces is made increasingly difficult.",

Twenty studies produced between 1975 and 1995 met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Results indicated positive effects for alternative grouping formats compared to whole class instruction; support for the efficacy of student pairing was particularly strong. In addition, analyses indicated that outcomes for students involved in cross-age tutoring varied significantly by students' role (tutor vs. tutee) within the pair. Implications of the findings are discussed with regard to classroom practice in the teaching of reading to students with disabilities.",

It focusses on methods that use results on small samples and discusses the shortcomings of previous approaches. A new variant is proposed that exploits, as some previous approaches, meta-learning. The method requires that experiments be conducted on few samples. The information gathered is used to identify the nearest learning curve for which the sampling procedure was carried out fully. This in turn permits to generate a prediction regards the relative performance of algorithms. Experimental evaluation shows that the method competes well with previous approaches and provides quite good and practical solution to this problem.",

To assist the often non-initiated users, it is desirable that this model selection process be automated. Using experience from base level learning, researchers have proposed meta-learning as a possible solution. Historically, predictive accuracy has been the de facto criterion, with most work in meta-learning focusing on the discovery of rules that match applications to models based on accuracy only. Although predictive accuracy is clearly an important criterion, it is also the case that there are a number of other criteria that could, and often ought to, be considered when learning about model selection. This paper presents a number of such criteria and discusses the impact they have on meta-level approaches to model selection.",

One of the first steps to improving the prevention and treatment of STBs is to establish risk factors (i.e., longitudinal predictors). To provide a summary of current knowledge about risk factors, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that have attempted to longitudinally predict a specific STB-related outcome. This included 365 studies (3,428 total risk factor effect sizes) from the past 50 years. The present random-effects meta-analysis produced several unexpected findings: across odds ratio, hazard ratio, and diagnostic accuracy analyses, prediction was only slightly better than chance for all outcomes; no broad category or subcategory accurately predicted far above chance levels; predictive ability has not improved across 50 years of research; studies rarely examined the combined effect of multiple risk factors; risk factors have been homogenous over time, with 5 broad categories accounting for nearly 80% of all risk factor tests; and the average study was nearly 10 years long, but longer studies did not produce better prediction. The homogeneity of existing research means that the present meta-analysis could only speak to STB risk factor associations within very narrow methodological limits\u2014limits that have not allowed for tests that approximate most STB theories. The present meta-analysis accordingly highlights several fundamental changes needed in future studies. In particular, these findings suggest the need for a shift in focus from risk factors to machine learning-based risk algorithms.",

However, the fruits of representation learning have yet to be fully-realized in federated settings. Although data in federated settings is often non-i.i.d. across clients, the success of centralized deep learning suggests that data often shares a global feature representation, while the statistical heterogeneity across clients or tasks is concentrated in the labels. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel federated learning framework and algorithm for learning a shared data representation across clients and unique local heads for each client. Our algorithm harnesses the distributed computational power across clients to perform many local-updates with respect to the low-dimensional local parameters for every update of the representation. We prove that this method obtains linear convergence to the ground-truth representation with near-optimal sample complexity in a linear setting, demonstrating that it can efficiently reduce the problem dimension for each client. This result is of interest beyond federated learning to a broad class of problems in which we aim to learn a shared low-dimensional representation among data distributions, for example in meta-learning and multi-task learning. Further, extensive experimental results show the empirical improvement of our method over alternative personalized federated learning approaches in federated environments with heterogeneous data.",

            "abstract": "Deep} reinforcement learning has recently seen huge success across multiple areas in the robotics domain. Owing to the limitations of gathering real-world data, i.e., sample inefficiency and the cost of collecting it, simulation environments are utilized for training the different agents. This not only aids in providing a potentially infinite data source, but also alleviates safety concerns with real robots. Nonetheless, the gap between the simulated and real worlds degrades the performance of the policies once the models are transferred into real robots. Multiple research efforts are therefore now being directed towards closing this sim-toreal gap and accomplish more efficient policy transfer. Recent years have seen the emergence of multiple methods applicable to different domains, but there is a lack, to the best of our knowledge, of a comprehensive review summarizing and putting into context the different methods. In this survey paper, we cover the fundamental background behind sim-to-real transfer in deep reinforcement learning and overview the main methods being utilized at the moment: domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning and knowledge distillation. We categorize some of the most relevant recent works, and outline the main application scenarios. Finally, we discuss the main opportunities and challenges of the different approaches and point to the most promising directions.",

Aims: Evaluate the effectiveness of instructional design features through a systematic review of studies comparing different simulation-based interventions. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus, key journals, and previous review bibliographies through May 2011. We included original research studies that compared one simulation intervention with another and involved health professions learners. Working in duplicate, we evaluated study quality and abstracted information on learners, outcomes, and instructional design features. We pooled results using random effects meta-analysis. Results: From a pool of 10\u2009903 articles we identified 289 eligible studies enrolling 18\u2009971 trainees, including 208 randomized trials. Inconsistency was usually large (I\u20092\u2009>\u200950%). For skills outcomes, pooled effect sizes (positive numbers favoring the instructional design feature) were 0.68 for range of difficulty (20 studies; p\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.68 for repetitive practice (7 studies; p\u2009=\u20090.06), 0.66 for distributed practice (6 studies; p\u2009=\u20090.03), 0.65 for interactivity (89 studies; p\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.62 for multiple learning strategies (70 studies; p\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.52 for individualized learning (59 studies; p\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.45 for mastery learning (3 studies; p\u2009=\u20090.57), 0.44 for feedback (80 studies; p\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.34 for longer time (23 studies; p\u2009=\u20090.005), 0.20 for clinical variation (16 studies; p\u2009=\u20090.24), and \u22120.22 for group training (8 studies; p\u2009=\u20090.09). Conclusions: These results confirm quantitatively the effectiveness of several instructional design features in simulation-based education.",

Meta-analytic techniques were used to examine the instructional effectiveness of computer-based simulation games relative to a comparison group (k= 65, N= 6,476). Consistent with theory, posttraining self-efficacy was 20% higher, declarative knowledge was 11% higher, procedural knowledge was 14% higher, and retention was 9% higher for trainees taught with simulation games, relative to a comparison group. However, the results provide strong evidence of publication bias in simulation games research. Characteristics of simulation games and the instructional context also moderated the effectiveness of simulation games. Trainees learned more, relative to a comparison group, when simulation games conveyed course material actively rather than passively, trainees could access the simulation game as many times as desired, and the simulation game was a supplement to other instructional methods rather than stand-alone instruction. However, trainees learned less from simulation games than comparison instructional methods when the instruction the comparison group received as a substitute for the simulation game actively engaged them in the learning experience.",

Herzfeld et al. found that when we practice a movement, the human brain has a memory for errors that is then used to learn faster in new conditions. This memory for error exists in parallel with motor memory's two traditional forms: memory of actions and memory of external perturbations. They also proposed a mathematical model for learning from errors. This model explained previous experimental results and predicted other major findings that they later verified experimentally. Science, this issue p. 1349 The history of previously experienced motor errors changes the amount the brain is willing to learn from an error. The current view of motor learning suggests that when we revisit a task, the brain recalls the motor commands it previously learned. In this view, motor memory is a memory of motor commands, acquired through trial-and-error and reinforcement. Here we show that the brain controls how much it is willing to learn from the current error through a principled mechanism that depends on the history of past errors. This suggests that the brain stores a previously unknown form of memory, a memory of errors. A mathematical formulation of this idea provides insights into a host of puzzling experimental data, including savings and meta-learning, demonstrating that when we are better at a motor task, it is partly because the brain recognizes the errors it experienced before.",

            "abstract": "Review date: 1969 to 2003, 34 years. Background and context:\u2002Simulations are now in widespread use in medical education and medical personnel evaluation. Outcomes research on the use and effectiveness of simulation technology in medical education is scattered, inconsistent and varies widely in methodological rigor and substantive focus. Objectives:\u2002Review and synthesize existing evidence in educational science that addresses the question, \u2018What are the features and uses of high-fidelity medical simulations that lead to most effective learning?\u2019. Search strategy: The search covered five literature databases (ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Timelit) and employed 91 single search terms and concepts and their Boolean combinations. Hand searching, Internet searches and attention to the \u2018grey literature\u2019 were also used. The aim was to perform the most thorough literature search possible of peer-reviewed publications and reports in the unpublished literature that have been judged for academic quality. Inclusion and exclusion criteria:\u2002Four screening criteria were used to reduce the initial pool of 670 journal articles to a focused set of 109 studies: (a) elimination of review articles in favor of empirical studies; (b) use of a simulator as an educational assessment or intervention with learner outcomes measured quantitatively; (c) comparative research, either experimental or quasi-experimental; and (d) research that involves simulation as an educational intervention. Data extraction:\u2002Data were extracted systematically from the 109 eligible journal articles by independent coders. Each coder used a standardized data extraction protocol. Data synthesis:\u2002Qualitative data synthesis and tabular presentation of research methods and outcomes were used. Heterogeneity of research designs, educational interventions, outcome measures and timeframe precluded data synthesis using meta-analysis. Headline results:\u2002Coding accuracy for features of the journal articles is high. The extant quality of the published research is generally weak. The weight of the best available evidence suggests that high-fidelity medical simulations facilitate learning under the right conditions. These include the following: providing feedback\u201451 (47%) journal articles reported that educational feedback is the most important feature of simulation-based medical education; repetitive practice\u201443 (39%) journal articles identified repetitive practice as a key feature involving the use of high-fidelity simulations in medical education; curriculum integration\u201427 (25%) journal articles cited integration of simulation-based exercises into the standard medical school or postgraduate educational curriculum as an essential feature of their effective use; range of difficulty level\u201415 (14%) journal articles address the importance of the range of task difficulty level as an important variable in simulation-based medical education; multiple learning strategies\u201411 (10%) journal articles identified the adaptability of high-fidelity simulations to multiple learning strategies as an important factor in their educational effectiveness; capture clinical variation\u201411 (10%) journal articles cited simulators that capture a wide variety of clinical conditions as more useful than those with a narrow range; controlled environment\u201410 (9%) journal articles emphasized the importance of using high-fidelity simulations in a controlled environment where learners can make, detect and correct errors without adverse consequences; individualized learning\u201410 (9%) journal articles highlighted the importance of having reproducible, standardized educational experiences where learners are active participants, not passive bystanders; defined outcomes\u2014seven (6%) journal articles cited the importance of having clearly stated goals with tangible outcome measures that will more likely lead to learners mastering skills; simulator validity\u2014four (3%) journal articles provided evidence for the direct correlation of simulation validity with effective learning. Conclusions:\u2002While research in this field needs improvement in terms of rigor and quality, high-fidelity medical simulations are educationally effective and simulation-based education complements medical education in patient care settings.",

You'll use the flexible Python programming language to build programs that implement algorithms for data classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification. About the BookA machine is said to learn when its performance improves with experience. Learning requires algorithms and programs that capture data and ferret out the interesting or useful patterns. Once the specialized domain of analysts and mathematicians, machine learning is becoming a skill needed by many.Machine Learning in Action is a clearly written tutorial for developers. It avoids academic language and takes you straight to the techniques you'll use in your day-to-day work. Many (Python) examples present the core algorithms of statistical data processing, data analysis, and data visualization in code you can reuse. You'll understand the concepts and how they fit in with tactical tasks like classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification.Readers need no prior experience with machine learning or statistical processing.

Effect sizes (Cohen's d), which are the standardized differences between the experimental and the control group, were calculated. In the meta-analysis, a combined d value was calculated, expressing the magnitude of associations across studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 33 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Compared with nondiabetic control subjects, the type 1 diabetic group demonstrated a significantly lowered performance on the following cognitive domains: intelligence (d = -0.7), speed of information processing (d = -0.3), psychomotor efficiency (d = -0.6), visual (d = -0.4) and sustained attention (d = -0.3), cognitive flexibility (d = -0.5), and visual perception (d = -0.4). Lowered cognitive performance in diabetic patients appeared to be associated with the presence of microvascular complications but not with the occurrence of severe hypoglycemic episodes or with poor metabolic control.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with type 1 diabetes, cognitive dysfunction is characterized by a slowing of mental speed and a diminished mental flexibility, whereas learning and memory are spared.The magnitude of the cognitive deficits is mild to moderate, but even mild forms of cognitive dysfunction might hamper everyday activities since they can be expected to present problems in more demanding situations.",

Yet the current approaches typically train a single model end-to-end for learning both visual representations and dynamics, making it difficult to accurately model the interaction between robots and small objects. In this work, we introduce a visual model-based RL framework that decouples visual representation learning and dynamics learning. Specifically, we train an autoencoder with convolutional layers and vision transformers (ViT) to reconstruct pixels given masked convolutional features, and learn a latent dynamics model that operates on the representations from the autoencoder. Moreover, to encode task-relevant information, we introduce an auxiliary reward prediction objective for the autoencoder. We continually update both autoencoder and dynamics model using online samples collected from environment interaction. We demonstrate that our decoupling approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of visual robotic tasks from Meta-world and RLBench, e.g., we achieve 81.7% success rate on 50 visual robotic manipulation tasks from Meta-world, while the baseline achieves 67.9%.

Some researchers have posited a \u201cnatural\u201d order of acquisition common to all ESL learners, but no single cause has been shown for this phenomenon. Our study investigated whether a combination of 5 determinants (perceptual salience, semantic complexity, morphophonological regularity, syntactic category, and frequency) accounts for the variance in acquisition order. Oral production data from 12 studies, together involving 924 participants, were pooled to obtain weighted accuracy scores for each of 6 grammatical functors. Results of a multiple-regression analysis showed that a large portion of the total variance in acquisition order was explained by the combination of the 5 determinants. Several of these determinants, it was argued, can be seen as part of a broad conceptualization of salience. \n \n \n \nSince the article was originally published, a number of meta-analyses have appeared in the applied linguistics literature (e.g., Masgoret & Gardner, 2003; Norris & Ortega, 2000; Ortega, 2003), and a book on meta-analysis in applied linguistics research is forthcoming (Norris & Ortega, in press). Meanwhile, research on the acquisition of Hebrew as a second language has begun to provide cross-linguistic evidence for how different aspects of salience contribute to ease or difficulty of second language acquisition (DeKeyser, Alfi-Shabtay, Ravid, & Shi, 2005) and how salience interacts with age of learning (DeKeyser, Ravid, & Alfi-Shabtay, 2005).",
