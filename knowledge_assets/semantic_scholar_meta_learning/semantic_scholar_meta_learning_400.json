Reviews of the research, however, have focused either on the entire literature which includes research conducted in noneducational settings or have included only a partial set of studies that may or may not validly represent the whole literature. There has never been a comprehensive review of the research on the effectiveness in increasing achievement of the methods of cooperative learning used in schools. An extensive search found 164 studies investigating eight cooperative learning methods. The studies yielded 194 independent effect sizes representing academic achievement. All eight cooperative learning methods had a significant positive impact on student achievement. When the impact of cooperative learning was compared with competitive learning, Learning Together (LT) promoted the greatest effect, followed by Academic Controversy (AC), Student-Team-Achievement-Divisions (STAD), Teams-Games-Tournaments (TGT), Group Investigation (GI), Jigsaw, Teams-Assisted",

This work has implemented comparison activities in a variety of different ways across a wide range of laboratory and classroom contexts. In an effort to assess the overall effectiveness of case comparisons across this diversity of implementation and contexts and to explore what variables might moderate learning outcomes, we conducted a meta-analysis of 57 experiments with 336 tests. Random effects analyses of the 336 tests revealed that case comparison activities commonly led to greater learning outcomes than other forms of case study including sequential, single case, and nonanalogous, as well as traditional instruction and control (d = .50), 95% CI [.44, .56]. Of 15 potential moderators, four variables were found to reliably moderate the effectiveness of case comparisons: the objective of the comparison, the presentation of a principle, the content, and the lag between the comparison and testing. Asking learners to find similarities between cases, providing principles after the comparisons, using perceptual content, and testing learners immediately are all associated with greater learning. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these results for cognitive theory and classroom practice.",

A resource or skill-based view focusing on development and application of core competences is offered to supplement the traditional approaches. We present a model of the development and outcomes of dynamic core competences based on organizational meta-learning. A firm\u2019s core competence(s) is defined as a set of problem-defining and problem-solving insights that fosters the development of idiosyncratic strategic growth alternatives. Dynamic core competences are based on the integration into systemic meta-learning of universal and tacit knowledge through information transfer, redefinition of heuristics and continuous improvement based on experimentation and the development of firm-specific skills based on dynamic routines. Dynamic core competences can be leveraged to create growth alternatives of global diversification, new applications of existing technologies and/or the development of new lines of business. Finally, dynamic core competences can be used to reduce uncertainty and to induce path dependencies that create causal ambiguity (making imitation from other firms difficult). In so doing, they can form the basis of competitive advantages.",

We report herein the results of a meta-analysis that integrates research on undergraduate SMET education since 1980. The meta-analysis demonstrates that various forms of small-group learning are effective in promoting greater academic achievement, more favorable attitudes toward learning, and increased persistence through SMET courses and programs. The magnitude of the effects reported in this study exceeds most findings in comparable reviews of research on educational innovations and supports more widespread implementation of small-group learning in undergraduate SMET.",

A review of the effectiveness of past and current practices in the application of information and communication technology(ICT) in language education and the availability as well as capacities of current ICTs was conducted. The review found that existing literature on the effectiveness of technology uses in language education is very limited in four aspects: a) The number of systematic, well-designed empirical evaluative studies of the effects of technology uses in language learning is very small, b) the settings of instruction where the studies were conducted were limited to higher education and adult learners, c) the languages studied were limited to common foreign languages and English as a foreign or second language, and d) the experiments were often short-term and about one or two aspects of language learning (e.g., vocabulary or grammar). However the limited number of available studies shows a pattern of positive effects. They found technology-supported language learning is at least as effective as human teachers, if not more so.",

Identifying the affective states that students experience in technology-enhanced learning contexts is a fundamental question in this area. This article provides an initial attempt to answer this question with a selective meta-analysis of 24 studies that utilized a mixture of methodologies (online self-reports, online observations, emote-aloud protocols, cued recall) and affect judges (students themselves, untrained peers, trained judges) for fine-grained monitoring of 14 discrete affective states of 1,740 middle school, high school, college, and adult students in 5 countries. Affective states occurred over the course of interactions with a range of learning technologies, including intelligent tutoring systems, serious games, simulation environments, and simple computer interfaces. Standardized effect sizes of relative frequency, computed by comparing the proportional occurrence of each affective state to the other states in each study, were modeled with random-effects models. Engagement/flow was consistently found to be relatively frequent (d+ = 2.5), and contempt, anger, disgust, sadness, anxiety, delight, fear, and surprise were consistently infrequent, with d+ ranging from \u22126.5 to \u22120.78. Effects for boredom (d+ = 0.19), confusion (d+ = 0.12), curiosity (d+ = \u22120.10), happiness (d+ = \u22120.13), and frustration (d+ = \u22122.5) varied substantially across studies. Mixed-effects models indicated that the source of the affect judgments (self vs. observers) and the authenticity of the learning contexts (classroom vs. laboratory) accounted for greater heterogeneity than the use of advanced learning technologies and training time. Theoretical and applied implications of the findings are discussed.",

This meta-analysis examined the effect of using pedagogical agents on learning by reviewing 43 studies involving 3,088 participants. Analysis of the results indicated that pedagogical agents produced a small but significant effect on learning. The overall mean effect size was moderated by the contextual and methodological features of the studies. The findings revealed that the use of pedagogical agents were more beneficial for K-12 students than post-secondary students. Pedagogical agents that communicated with students using on-screen text facilitated learning more effectively than agents that communicated using narration. The findings of this study have implications for advancing theory and practice, as well as highlighting productive future directions for research.",

In response, recent work in meta-learning proposes training a meta-learner on a distribution of similar tasks, in the hopes of generalization to novel but related tasks by learning a high-level strategy that captures the essence of the problem it is asked to solve. However, many recent meta-learning approaches are extensively hand-designed, either using architectures specialized to a particular application, or hard-coding algorithmic components that constrain how the meta-learner solves the task. We propose a class of simple and generic meta-learner architectures that use a novel combination of temporal convolutions and soft attention; the former to aggregate information from past experience and the latter to pinpoint specific pieces of information. In the most extensive set of meta-learning experiments to date, we evaluate the resulting Simple Neural AttentIve Learner (or SNAIL) on several heavily-benchmarked tasks. On all tasks, in both supervised and reinforcement learning, SNAIL attains state-of-the-art performance by significant margins.",

We propose a variant of Thompson sampling that learns to explore better as it interacts with bandit instances drawn from an unknown prior. The algorithm meta-learns the prior and thus we call it MetaTS. We propose several efficient implementations of MetaTS and analyze it in Gaussian bandits. Our analysis shows the benefit of meta-learning and is of a broader interest, because we derive a novel prior-dependent Bayes regret bound for Thompson sampling. Our theory is complemented by empirical evaluation, which shows that MetaTS quickly adapts to the unknown prior.",

To identify a user's preference in the cold state, existing recommender systems, such as Netflix, initially provide items to a user; we call those items evidence candidates. Recommendations are then made based on the items selected by the user. Previous recommendation studies have two limitations: (1) the users who consumed a few items have poor recommendations and (2) inadequate evidence candidates are used to identify user preferences. We propose a meta-learning-based recommender system called MeLU to overcome these two limitations. From meta-learning, which can rapidly adopt new task with a few examples, MeLU can estimate new user's preferences with a few consumed items. In addition, we provide an evidence candidate selection strategy that determines distinguishing items for customized preference estimation. We validate MeLU with two benchmark datasets, and the proposed model reduces at least 5.92% mean absolute error than two comparative models on the datasets. We also conduct a user study experiment to verify the evidence selection strategy.",

            "abstract": "Abstract With the aim of summarizing years of research comparing pedagogies for second/foreign language teaching supported with computer technology and pedagogy not-supported by computer technology, a meta-analysis was conducted of empirical research investigating language outcomes. Thirty-seven studies yielding 52 effect sizes were included, following a search of literature from 1970 to 2006 and screening of studies based on stated criteria. The differences in research designs required subdivision of studies, but overall results favored the technology-supported pedagogy, with a small, but positive and statistically significant effect size. Second/foreign language instruction supported by computer technology was found to be at least as effective as instruction without technology, and in studies using rigorous research designs the CALL groups outperformed the non-CALL groups. The analyses of instructional conditions, characteristics of participants, and conditions of the research design did not provide reliable results because of the small number of effect sizes representing each group. The meta-analysis results provide an empirically-based response to the questions of whether or not technology-supported pedagogies enhance language learning, and the process of conducting the meta-analysis pointed to areas in research methodology that would benefit from attention in future research.",

Mastery learning, an instructional approach requiring learners to achieve a defined proficiency before proceeding to the next instructional objective, offers one approach to individualization. The authors sought to summarize the quantitative outcomes of mastery learning simulation-based medical education (SBME) in comparison with no intervention and nonmastery instruction, and to determine what features of mastery SBME make it effective. Method The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus, key journals, and previous review bibliographies through May 2011. They included original research in any language evaluating mastery SBME, in comparison with any intervention or no intervention, for practicing and student physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. Working in duplicate, they abstracted information on trainees, instructional design (interactivity, feedback, repetitions, and learning time), study design, and outcomes. Results They identified 82 studies evaluating mastery SBME. In comparison with no intervention, mastery SBME was associated with large effects on skills (41 studies; effect size [ES] 1.29 [95% confidence interval, 1.08\u20131.50]) and moderate effects on patient outcomes (11 studies; ES 0.73 [95% CI, 0.36\u20131.10]). In comparison with nonmastery SBME instruction, mastery learning was associated with large benefit in skills (3 studies; effect size 1.17 [95% CI, 0.29\u20132.05]) but required more time. Pretraining and additional practice improved outcomes but, again, took longer. Studies exploring enhanced feedback and self-regulated learning in the mastery model showed mixed results. Conclusions Limited evidence suggests that mastery learning SBME is superior to nonmastery instruction but takes more time.",

            "abstract": "Cerebellar contributions to motor learning are well-documented. For example, under some conditions, patients with cerebellar damage are impaired at visuomotor adaptation and at acquiring new action sequences. Moreover, cerebellar activation has been observed in functional MRI (fMRI) investigations of various motor learning tasks. The early phases of motor learning are cognitively demanding, relying on processes such as working memory, which have been linked to the cerebellum as well. Here, we investigated cerebellar contributions to motor learning using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. This allowed us to determine, across studies and tasks, whether or not the location of cerebellar activation is constant across differing motor learning tasks, and whether or not cerebellar activation in early learning overlaps with that observed for working memory. We found that different regions of the anterior cerebellum are engaged for implicit and explicit sequence learning and visuomotor adaptation, providing additional evidence for the modularity of cerebellar function. Furthermore, we found that lobule VI of the cerebellum, which has been implicated in working memory, is activated during the early stages of explicit motor sequence learning. This provides evidence for a potential role for the cerebellum in the cognitive processing associated with motor learning. However, though lobule VI was activated across both early explicit sequence learning and working memory studies, there was no spatial overlap between these two regions. Together, our results support the idea of modularity in the formation of internal representations of new motor tasks in the cerebellum, and highlight the cognitive processing relied upon during the early phases of motor skill learning.",

This meta-training enables the model to more effectively learn a new task in context at test time, by simply conditioning on a few training examples with no parameter updates or task-specific templates. We experiment on a large, diverse collection of tasks consisting of 142 NLP datasets including classification, question answering, natural language inference, paraphrase detection and more, across seven different meta-training/target splits. MetaICL outperforms a range of baselines including in-context learning without meta-training and multi-task learning followed by zero-shot transfer. We find that the gains are particularly significant for target tasks that have domain shifts from the meta-training tasks, and that using a diverse set of the meta-training tasks is key to improvements. We also show that MetaICL approaches (and sometimes beats) the performance of models fully finetuned on the target task training data, and outperforms much bigger models with nearly 8x parameters.",

In this work, we encode this notion of domain generalization using a novel regularization function. We pose the problem of finding such a regularization function in a Learning to Learn (or) meta-learning framework. The objective of domain generalization is explicitly modeled by learning a regularizer that makes the model trained on one domain to perform well on another domain. Experimental validations on computer vision and natural language datasets indicate that our method can learn regularizers that achieve good cross-domain generalization.",

However, the task of rapid generalization on new concepts with small training data while preserving performances on previously learned ones still presents a significant challenge to neural network models. In this work, we introduce a novel meta learning method, Meta Networks (MetaNet), that learns a meta-level knowledge across tasks and shifts its inductive biases via fast parameterization for rapid generalization. When evaluated on Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet benchmarks, our MetaNet models achieve a near human-level performance and outperform the baseline approaches by up to 6% accuracy. We demonstrate several appealing properties of MetaNet relating to generalization and continual learning.",

While several studies have reviewed m-Learning platforms, different settings and contexts make it difficult to collate these studies and discover the key factors for the successful adoption of m-Learning platform. This study uses meta-analysis technique to compare results from multiple studies assessing the critical m-Learning success factors. We find that learners perceive collaboration opportunities and anytime-anywhere learning possibility as the key benefits of m-Learning. Further, good content presented in a user friendly way is a primary expectation from an m-Learning application.",

Heterogeneity in results across studies was large (I(2) > or = 79%) in all analyses. Effect sizes were pooled using a random effects model. The pooled effect size in comparison to no intervention favored Internet-based interventions and was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.10; P < .001; n = 126 studies) for knowledge outcomes, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.49-1.20; P < .001; n = 16) for skills, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.63-1.02; P < .001; n = 32) for learner behaviors and patient effects. Compared with non-Internet formats, the pooled effect sizes (positive numbers favoring Internet) were 0.10 (95% CI, -0.12 to 0.32; P = .37; n = 43) for satisfaction, 0.12 (95% CI, 0.003 to 0.24; P = .045; n = 63) for knowledge, 0.09 (95% CI, -0.26 to 0.44; P = .61; n = 12) for skills, and 0.51 (95% CI, -0.24 to 1.25; P = .18; n = 6) for behaviors or patient effects. No important treatment-subgroup interactions were identified.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInternet-based learning is associated with large positive effects compared with no intervention. In contrast, effects compared with non-Internet instructional methods are heterogeneous and generally small, suggesting effectiveness similar to traditional methods. Future research should directly compare different Internet-based interventions.",

Each training example in Meta-Learning (i.e. each meta-example) is related to a learning problem and stores the experience obtained in the empirical evaluation of a set of candidate algorithms when applied to the problem. The generation of a good set of meta-examples can be a costly process depending for instance on the number of available learning problems and the complexity of the candidate algorithms. In this work, we proposed the Active Meta-Learning, in which Active Learning techniques are used to reduce the set of meta-examples by selecting only the most relevant problems for meta-example generation. In an implemented prototype, we evaluated the use of two different Active Learning techniques applied in two different Meta-Learning tasks. The performed experiments revealed a significant gain in the Meta-Learning performance when the active techniques were used to support the meta-example generation.",

The Corona virus has revealed emerging vulnerabilities in education systems around the world. It is now clear that society needs flexible and resilient education systems as we face unpredictable futures. A meta-analysis methodology was adopted for this study and pertinent literature was visited to capture the essence of continued learning during these unprecedented times. Findings reveal that universities worldwide are moving more and more towards online learning or E- Learning. Findings also reveal that apart from resources, staff readiness, confidence, student accessibility and motivation play important function in ICT integrated learning. This exploratory paper proposes that staff members should use technology and technological gadgets to enhance learning especially during these exceptional times. Findings also propose online and remote learning as a necessity in times of lock downs and social distancing due to COVID-19 pandemic. It also provides a strong platform for further research.",

Due to the lack of user-item interactions, the fine-tuned recommender systems are unable to handle situations with new users or new items. Recently, some works introduce the meta-optimization idea into the recommendation scenarios, i.e. predicting the user preference by only a few of past interacted items. The core idea is learning a global sharing initialization parameter for all users and then learning the local parameters for each user separately. However, most meta-learning based recommendation approaches adopt model-agnostic meta-learning for parameter initialization, where the global sharing parameter may lead the model into local optima for some users. In this paper, we design two memory matrices that can store task-specific memories and feature-specific memories. Specifically, the feature-specific memories are used to guide the model with personalized parameter initialization, while the task-specific memories are used to guide the model fast predicting the user preference. And we adopt a meta-optimization approach for optimizing the proposed method. We test the model on two widely used recommendation datasets and consider four cold-start situations. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

            "abstract": "In machine learning Trojan attacks, an adversary trains a corrupted model that obtains good performance on normal data but behaves maliciously on data samples with certain trigger patterns. Several approaches have been proposed to detect such attacks, but they make undesirable assumptions about the attack strategies or require direct access to the trained models, which restricts their utility in practice.This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a Meta Neural Trojan Detection (MNTD) pipeline that does not make assumptions on the attack strategies and only needs black-box access to models. The strategy is to train a meta-classifier that predicts whether a given target model is Trojaned. To train the meta-model without knowledge of the attack strategy, we introduce a technique called jumbo learning that samples a set of Trojaned models following a general distribution. We then dynamically optimize a query set together with the meta-classifier to distinguish between Trojaned and benign models.We evaluate MNTD with experiments on vision, speech, tabular data and natural language text datasets, and against different Trojan attacks such as data poisoning attack, model manipulation attack, and latent attack. We show that MNTD achieves 97% detection AUC score and significantly outperforms existing detection approaches. In addition, MNTD generalizes well and achieves high detection performance against unforeseen attacks. We also propose a robust MNTD pipeline which achieves around 90% detection AUC even when the attacker aims to evade the detection with full knowledge of the system.",

Because of the uniqueness of its pedagogical approach and breadth of potential learning outcomes, management and business scholars have recognized its value. Much theory and supporting research has been generated on the effect of service-learning on college and university students. Through meta-analytic techniques, we found support for the hypotheses that service-learning has a positive effect on understanding of social issues (Est. .34); personal insight (Est. .28); and cognitive development (Est. .52). We also found significant moderating evidence for research design, type of reflection, type of measurement, and the service experience as optional or required. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings along with suggestions for future research.",

While the variety of machine learning and data mining techniques now available can, in principle, provide good model solutions, a methodology is still needed to guide the search for the most appropriate model in an efficient way. Metalearning provides one such methodology that allows systems to become more effective through experience. This book discusses several approaches to obtaining knowledge concerning the performance of machine learning and data mining algorithms. It shows how this knowledge can be reused to select, combine, compose and adapt both algorithms and models to yield faster, more effective solutions to data mining problems. It can thus help developers improve their algorithms and also develop learning systems that can improve themselves. The book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students in the areas of machine learning, data mining and artificial intelligence.",

One challenge associated with FL is statistical diversity among clients, which restricts the global model from delivering good performance on each client's task. To address this, we propose an algorithm for personalized FL (pFedMe) using Moreau envelopes as clients' regularized loss functions, which help decouple personalized model optimization from the global model learning in a bi-level problem stylized for personalized FL. Theoretically, we show that pFedMe's convergence rate is state-of-the-art: achieving quadratic speedup for strongly convex and sublinear speedup of order 2/3 for smooth nonconvex objectives. Experimentally, we verify that pFedMe excels at empirical performance compared with the vanilla FedAvg and Per-FedAvg, a meta-learning based personalized FL algorithm.",

A total of k = 99 effect sizes were analysed with an overall sample size of N = 14,128 in a random-effects model with Pearson correlation coefficients. A moderate negative correlation was found between FLCA and all categories of academic achievement (e.g., general academic achievement: r = -.39; k = 59; N = 12,585). The results of this meta-analysis confirm the negative association between FLCA and academic achievement in foreign language courses.",

            "abstract": "Data mining systems aim to discover patterns and extract useful information from facts recorded in databases. A widely adopted approach to this objective is to apply various machine learning algorithms to compute descriptive models of the available data. Here, we explore one of the main challenges in this research area, the development of techniques that scale up to large and possibly physically distributed databases. Meta-learning is a technique that seeks to compute higher-level classifiers (or classification models), called meta-classifiers, that integrate in some principled fashion multiple classifiers computed separately over different databases. This study, describes meta-learning and presents the JAM system (Java Agents for Meta-learning), an agent-based meta-learning system for large-scale data mining applications. Specifically, it identifies and addresses several important desiderata for distributed data mining systems that stem from their additional complexity compared to centralized or host-based systems. Distributed systems may need to deal with heterogenous platforms, with multiple databases and (possibly) different schemas, with the design and implementation of scalable and effective protocols for communicating among the data sites, and the selective and efficient use of the information that is gathered from other peer data sites. Other important problems, intrinsic within \u2217Supported in part by an IBM fellowship. data mining systems that must not be ignored, include, first, the ability to take advantage of newly acquired information that was not previously available when models were computed and combine it with existing models, and second, the flexibility to incorporate new machine learning methods and data mining technologies. We explore these issues within the context of JAM and evaluate various proposed solutions through extensive empirical studies.",

            "abstract": "Although supervised person re-identification (Re-ID) methods have shown impressive performance, they suffer from a poor generalization capability on unseen domains. Therefore, generalizable Re-ID has recently attracted growing attention. Many existing methods have employed an instance normalization technique to reduce style variations, but the loss of discriminative information could not be avoided. In this paper, we propose a novel generalizable Re-ID framework, named Meta Batch-Instance Normalization (MetaBIN). Our main idea is to generalize normalization layers by simulating unsuccessful generalization scenarios beforehand in the meta-learning pipeline. To this end, we combine learnable batch-instance normalization layers with meta-learning and investigate the challenging cases caused by both batch and instance normalization layers. Moreover, we diversify the virtual simulations via our meta-train loss accompanied by a cyclic inner-updating manner to boost generalization capability. After all, the MetaBIN framework prevents our model from overfitting to the given source styles and improves the generalization capability to unseen domains without additional data augmentation or complicated network design. Extensive experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the large-scale domain generalization Re-ID benchmark and the cross-domain Re-ID problem.

            "abstract": "Advances in technology provide new tools for educators and students to be used in the learning process. Today students need to be skilled computer users and able to deal with different types of media in order to study effectively. However, technical expertise alone is not enough \u2013 one must know what to study, where to find information, what to do next etc. Therefore special attention is needed to orientate students to use technology so that they learn to study in a modern learning environment. In this study the focus is on adult students. It is also likely that some adult students may not be familiar with computers and information technology. In addition, they have not been in school for several years and therefore may not be used to studying. Consequently, adult students need advice and help in both using modern technology in studying, and in the studying itself. Here we argue that a meta-learning environment can help students in the learning process. A meta-learning environment is defined as a platform for studying and it should integrate technology and resources so that they empower the learning process. In this article we look at the development of a learning environment using the meta-learning environment approach. The theoretical contribution is in the recognition of key dimensions of the meta-learning environment. They provide a promising framework for developing learning environments in the digital age.",

            "abstract": "The last 2 decades witnessed a surge in empirical studies on the variables associated with achievement in higher education. A number of meta-analyses synthesized these findings. In our systematic literature review, we included 38 meta-analyses investigating 105 correlates of achievement, based on 3,330 effect sizes from almost 2 million students. We provide a list of the 105 variables, ordered by the effect size, and summary statistics for central research topics. The results highlight the close relation between social interaction in courses and achievement. Achievement is also strongly associated with the stimulation of meaningful learning by presenting information in a clear way, relating it to the students, and using conceptually demanding learning tasks. Instruction and communication technology has comparably weak effect sizes, which did not increase over time. Strong moderator effects are found for almost all instructional methods, indicating that how a method is implemented in detail strongly affects achievement. Teachers with high-achieving students invest time and effort in designing the microstructure of their courses, establish clear learning goals, and employ feedback practices. This emphasizes the importance of teacher training in higher education. Students with high achievement are characterized by high self-efficacy, high prior achievement and intelligence, conscientiousness, and the goal-directed use of learning strategies. Barring the paucity of controlled experiments and the lack of meta-analyses on recent educational innovations, the variables associated with achievement in higher education are generally well investigated and well understood. By using these findings, teachers, university administrators, and policymakers can increase the effectivity of higher education.",

Producing such guidelines is a primary goal by the field of meta-learning; the research objective is to understand the interaction between the mechanism of learning and the concrete contexts in which that mechanism is applicable. The field of meta-learning has seen continuous growth in the past years with interesting new developments in the construction of practical model-selection assistants, task-adaptive learners, and a solid conceptual framework. In this paper, we give an overview of different techniques necessary to build meta-learning systems. We begin by describing an idealized meta-learning architecture comprising a variety of relevant component techniques. We then look at how each technique has been studied and implemented by previous research. In addition, we show how metalearning has already been identified as an important component in real-world applications.",

Previous approaches to meta-learning mostly considered only statistics-inspired measures of the data as a source for the definition of metaattributes. Contrary to such approaches, landmarking tries to determine the location of a specific learning problem in the space of all learning problems by directly measuring the performance of some simple and efficient learning algorithms themselves. In the experiments reported we show how such a use of landmark values can help to distinguish between areas of the learning space favouring different learners. Experiments, both with artificial and real-world databases, show that landmarking selects, with moderate but reasonable level of success, the best performing of a set of learning algorithms.",

With the coming age of ubiquitous network computing, it is likely that orders of magnitude more data in databases will be available for various learning problems of real world importance. Some learning algorithms assume that the entire data set fits into main memory, which is not feasible for massive amounts of data, especially for applications in data mining. One approach to handling a large data set is to partition the data set into subsets, run the learning algorithm on each of the subsets, and combine the results. Moreover, data can be inherently distributed across multiple sites on the network and merging all the data in one location can be expensive or prohibitive. \nIn this thesis we propose, investigate, and evaluate a meta-learning approach to integrating the results of multiple learning processes. Our approach utilizes machine learning to guide the integration. We identified two main meta-learning strategies: combiner and arbiter. Both strategies are independent to the learning algorithms used in generating the classifiers. The combiner strategy attempts to reveal relationships among the learned classifiers' prediction patterns. The arbiter strategy tries to determine the correct prediction when the classifiers have different opinions. Various schemes under these two strategies have been developed. Empirical results show that our schemes can obtain accurate classifiers from inaccurate classifiers trained from data subsets. We also implemented and analyzed the schemes in a parallel and distributed environment to demonstrate their scalability.",

Meta-learning is proposed as a general technique to integrating a number of distinct learning processes. This paper details several meta-learning strategies for integrating independently learned classifiers by the same learner in a parallel and distributed computing environment. Our strategies are particularly suited for massive amounts of data that main-memory-based learning algorithms cannot efficiently handle. The strategies are also independent of the particular learning algorithm used and the underlying parallel and distributed platform.

JAM provides a set of learning programs, implemented either as JAVA applets or applications, that compute models over data stored locally at a site. JAM also provides a set of meta-learning agents for combining multiple models that were learned (perhaps) at different sites. It employs a special distribution mechanism which allows the migration of the derived models or classifier agents to other remote sites. We describe the overall architecture of the JAM system and the specific implementation currently under development at Columbia University. One of JAM's target applications is fraud and intrusion detection in financial information systems. A brief description of this learning task and JAM's applicability are also described. Interested users may download JAM from http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sal/JAM/PROJECT.",

Meta-learning has been of interest in the machine learning field for decades because of its appealing applications to intelligent agents, non-stationary time series, autonomous robots, and improved learning algorithms. Many previous neural network-based approaches toward meta-learning have been based on evolutionary methods. We show how to use gradient descent for meta-learning in recurrent neural networks. Based on previous work on fixed-weight learning neural networks, we hypothesize that any recurrent network topology and its corresponding learning algorithm(s) is a potential meta-learning system. We tested several recurrent neural network topologies and their corresponding forms of backpropagation for their ability to meta-learn. One of our systems, based on the long short-term memory neural network developed a learning algorithm that could learn any two-dimensional quadratic function (from a set of such functions) after only 30 training examples.",

It employs a meta-learning phase using document feature characteristics. Document feature characteristics, derived from the training document set, capture some inherent category-specific properties of a particular category. Different from existing categorization methods, MUDOF can automatically recommend a suitable algorithm for each category based on the category-specific statistical characteristics. Hence, different algorithms may be employed for different categories. Experiments have been conducted on a real-world document collection demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The results confirm that our meta-model approach can exploit the advantage of its component algorithms, and demonstrate a better performance than existing algorithms.",

Our experiments reported here are the first step towards a better understanding of the advantages and limitations of current meta-learning strategies on real-world data. We argue that, for the fraud detection domain, fraud catching rate (True Positive rate) and false alarm rate (False Positive rate) are better metrics than the overall accuracy when evaluating the learned fraud classifiers. We show that given a skewed distribution in the original data, artificially more balanced training data leads to better classifiers. We demonstrate how meta-learning can be used to combine different classifiers and maintain, and in some cases, improve the performance of the best classifier.",

The results provide evidence that the relational representation coupled with the appropriate similarity measure can improve performance. The ideas presented are pertinent not only for meta-learning representational issues, but for all domains with similar representation requirements.",

In phase 1 of the project, the data characteristics, measures and tests have been evaluated for an automated use of classi cation algorithms. For regression learning, the statistics, information theoretical measures and tests had to be proved. This paper works out necessary statistics and tests for regression learning. The new approach of this paper is to use a Meta-Regression: A regression learning on the meta level for Meta-Learning. In comparison to a classi cation of error rates, calculated for cross-validation tests, our new approach could improve the accuracy for Meta-Learning.",

Meta-learning is one approach to achieve this objective by identifying a mapping from data characteristics to algorithm performance. Appropriate data characterization is, thus, of vital importance for the meta-learning. To this effect, a variety of data characterization techniques, based on three strategies including simple measure, statistical measure and information theory based measure, have been developed, however, the quality of them is still needed to be improved. This paper presents new measures to characterise datasets for meta-learning based on the idea to capture the characteristics from the structural shape and size of the decision tree induced from the dataset. Their effectiveness is illustrated by comparing to the results obtained by the classical data characteristics techniques, including DCT that is the most wide used technique in meta-learning and Landmarking that is the most recently developed method and produced better performance comparing to DCT.",

The current study seeks to reconcile these findings by extending a meta-analysis conducted by Novak, Markey, and Allen (2007) in which these authors examined service-learning and student learning outcomes. In the current study, 11 research studies satisfying particular criteria were included. Results suggest that service-learning does in fact increase student learning (d = .332). Results from moderator analyses suggest that service-learning has a positive influence on student learning outcomes irrespective of the way learning was measured. Experiential learning methods, including servicelearning, are increasing among universities across the United States. Many disciplines share in this enthusiasm, with an increase in academic courses across disciplines, including communication, using the service-learning pedagogy (Oster-Aaland, Sellnow, Nelson, & Pearson, 2004; Sellnow & Oster, 1997). By definition, service-learning is a pedagogical strategy in which students engage in community service that will enhance their understanding of course concepts and enable them to make contributions to their communities (Rhodes & Davis, 2001). Furthermore, Eyler and Giles (1999) suggest that the service-learning experience needs to satisfy four criteria to be considered successful: (1) personal and interpersonal development, (2) understanding and applying knowledge learned in class, (3) perspective transformation, and (4) developed sense of citizenship.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to synthesize all available evaluative research from 1970 through 1992 that compares problem-based learning (PBL) with more traditional methods of medical education. Five separate meta-analyses were performed on 35 studies representing 19 institutions. For 22 of the studies (representing 14 institutions), both effect-size and supplementary vote-count analyses could be performed; otherwise, only supplementary analyses were performed. PBL was found to be significantly superior with respect to students' program evaluations (i.e., students' attitudes and opinions about their programs)\u2013dw (standardized differences between means, weighted by sample size) = +.55, CI.95 = +.40 to +.70 - and measures of students' clinical performance (dw = +.28, CI.95 = +.16 to +.40). PBL and traditional methods did not differ on miscellaneous tests of factual knowledge (dw = \u2212.09, CI.95 = +.06 to -.24) and tests of clinical knowledge (dw = +.08, CI.95 = \u2212.05 to +.21). Traditional students performed significantly better than their PBL counterparts on the National Board of Medical Examiners Part I examination\u2013NBME I (dw = \u2212.18, CI.95 = \u2212.10 to -.26). However, the NBME I data displayed significant overall heterogeneity (Qt = 192.23, p < .001) and significant differences among programs (Qb = 59.09, p < .001), which casts doubt on the generality of the findings across programs. The comparative value of PBL is also supported by data on outcomes that have been studied less frequently, i.e., faculty attitudes, student mood, class attendance, academic process variables, and measures of humanism. In conclusion, the results generally support the superiority of the PBL approach over more traditional methods. Acad. Med. 68 (1993):550\u2013563.",

However, we found research seldom addressed the development of the use or failure to use learning-theory foundations and categorized these learning theories into relative types and synthesized their development. We investigate this issue from the perspective of learning theories invoked to underpin educational computer game design and use based on the four types of learning theories: behaviourism, cognitivism, humanism and constructivism. Because the investigation needs to examine and analyse the results from a large number of independent previous studies, this study applied the meta-analysis method to present a more comprehensive description and discussion of the influence and implications of the findings. This study shows the distribution of development trends for the use of learning theory as a theoretical foundation, as opposed to those that fail to use learning theory in game-based learning, along with the distribution of types and principles of learning theories that used a learning-theory foundation. These new findings can supplement the results of previous studies with regard to the issue of learning-theory foundations in game-based learning. The contributions of this study for the issue of learning-theory foundations in game-based learning are discussed.",

This review examines the current state of research on self-regulated learning and gaps in the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning of work-related knowledge and skills. Self-regulation theory was used as a conceptual lens for deriving a heuristic framework of 16 fundamental constructs that constitute self-regulated learning. Meta-analytic findings (k=430, N=90,380) support theoretical propositions that self-regulation constructs are interrelated-30% of the corrected correlations among constructs were .50 or greater. Goal level, persistence, effort, and self-efficacy were the self-regulation constructs with the strongest effects on learning. Together these constructs accounted for 17% of the variance in learning, after controlling for cognitive ability and pretraining knowledge. However, 4 self-regulatory processes-planning, monitoring, help seeking, and emotion control-did not exhibit significant relationships with learning. Thus, a parsimonious framework of the self-regulated learning domain is presented that focuses on a subset of self-regulatory processes that have both limited overlap with other core processes and meaningful effects on learning. Research is needed to advance the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning in an increasingly complex and knowledge-centric work environment. Such investigations should capture the dynamic nature of self-regulated learning, address the role of self-regulation in informal learning, and investigate how trainees regulate their transfer of training.",

In previous work we presented a system called NOEMON which relied on a mapping between dataset characteristics and inducer performance to propose inducers for specific datasets. Instance based learning was used to create that mapping. Here we extend and refine the set of data characteristics; we also use a wider range of base-level inducers and a much larger collection of datasets to create the meta-models. We compare the performance of meta-models produced by instance based learners, decision trees and boosted decision trees. The results show that decision trees and boosted decision trees models enhance the perfomance of the system.",

Unfortunately, this often leads to models that are not robust when features are removed or obscured in future test data. For example, a backprop net trained to steer a car typically learns to recognize the edges of the road, but does not learn to recognize other features such as the stripes painted on the road which could be useful when road edges disappear in tunnels or are obscured by passing trucks. The net learns the minimum necessary to steer on the training set. In contrast, human driving is remarkably robust as features become obscured. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for robust learning that biases induction to learn many different models from the same inputs. We present a meta algorithm for robust learning called FeatureBoost, and demonstrate it on several problems using backprop nets, k-nearest neighbor, and decision trees.",

Based on Spreitzer and colleagues\u2019 (2005) model, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis of antecedents and outcomes of thriving at work (K = 73 independent samples, N = 21,739 employees). Results showed that thriving at work is associated with individual characteristics, such as psychological capital (rc = .47), proactive personality (rc = .58), positive affect (rc = .52), and work engagement (rc = .64). Positive associations were also found between thriving at work and relational characteristics, including supportive coworker behavior (rc = .42), supportive leadership behavior (rc= .44), and perceived organizational support (rc = .63). Moreover, thriving at work is related to important employee outcomes, including health-related outcomes like burnout (rc = -.53), attitudinal outcomes like commitment (rc = .65), and performance-related outcomes like task performance (rc = .35). The results of relative weights analyses suggest that thriving exhibits small, albeit incremental predictive validity above and beyond positive affect and work engagement, for task performance, job satisfaction, subjective health, and burnout. Overall, the findings of this meta-analysis support Spreitzer and colleagues\u2019 (2005) model and underscore the importance of thriving in the work context.",

            "abstract": "A review of 13 years of research into antecedents of university students' grade point average (GPA) scores generated the following: a comprehensive, conceptual map of known correlates of tertiary GPA; assessment of the magnitude of average, weighted correlations with GPA; and tests of multivariate models of GPA correlates within and across research domains. A systematic search of PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge databases between 1997 and 2010 identified 7,167 English-language articles yielding 241 data sets, which reported on 50 conceptually distinct correlates of GPA, including 3 demographic factors and 5 traditional measures of cognitive capacity or prior academic performance. In addition, 42 non-intellective constructs were identified from 5 conceptually overlapping but distinct research domains: (a) personality traits, (b) motivational factors, (c) self-regulatory learning strategies, (d) students' approaches to learning, and (e) psychosocial contextual influences. We retrieved 1,105 independent correlations and analyzed data using hypothesis-driven, random-effects meta-analyses. Significant average, weighted correlations were found for 41 of 50 measures. Univariate analyses revealed that demographic and psychosocial contextual factors generated, at best, small correlations with GPA. Medium-sized correlations were observed for high school GPA, SAT, ACT, and A level scores. Three non-intellective constructs also showed medium-sized correlations with GPA: academic self-efficacy, grade goal, and effort regulation. A large correlation was observed for performance self-efficacy, which was the strongest correlate (of 50 measures) followed by high school GPA, ACT, and grade goal. Implications for future research, student assessment, and intervention design are discussed.",

To inform theories of multimedia learning that guide the design of educational materials, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of spoken-only, written-only, and spoken--written presentations on learning retention and transfer. After an extensive search for experimental studies meeting specified inclusion criteria, data from 57 independent studies were extracted. Most of the research participants were postsecondary students. Overall, this meta-analysis revealed that outcomes comparing spoken--written and written-only presentations did not differ, but students who learned from spoken--written presentations outperformed those who learned from spoken-only presentations. This effect was dependent on learners' prior knowledge, pacing of presentation, and inclusion of animation or diagrams. Specifically, the advantages of spoken--written presentations over spoken-only presentations were found for low prior knowledge learners, system-paced learning materials, and picture-free materials. In comparison with verbatim, spoken--written presentations, presentations displaying key terms extracted from spoken narrations were associated with better learning outcomes and accounted for much of the advantage of spoken--written over spoken-only presentations. These findings have significant implications for the design of multimedia materials.",

The automated recommendation can be implemented using 7 meta-learning, learning from previous learning experiences, to create a meta-model able to 8 associate a data set to the predictive performance of machine learning algorithms. Although 9 a large number of publications report the use of meta-learning, reproduction and compar-10 ison of meta-learning experiments is a difficult task. The literature lacks extensive and 11 comprehensive public tools that enable the reproducible investigation of the different meta-12 learning approaches. An alternative to deal with this difficulty is to develop a meta-feature 13 extractor package with the main characterization measures, following uniform guidelines 14 that facilitate the use and inclusion of new meta-features. In this paper, we propose two 15 Meta-Feature Extractor (MFE) packages, written in both Python and R, to fill this lack. The 16 packages follow recent frameworks for meta-feature extraction, aiming to facilitate the 17 reproducibility of meta-learning experiments.",

The existing deep neural network methods usually require large training dataset for each property, impairing their performance in cases (especially for new molecular properties) with a limited amount of experimental data, which are common in real situations. To this end, we propose Meta-MGNN, a novel model for few-shot molecular property prediction. Meta-MGNN applies molecular graph neural network to learn molecular representations and builds a meta-learning framework for model optimization. To exploit unlabeled molecular information and address task heterogeneity of different molecular properties, Meta-MGNN further incorporates molecular structures, attribute based self-supervised modules and self-attentive task weights into the former framework, strengthening the whole learning model. Extensive experiments on two public multi-property datasets demonstrate that Meta-MGNN outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art methods.",

In fact, today optimization is no longer an afterthought and is a fundamental tool for many optical and RF designers. Still, many devices presented in recent literature do not take advantage of optimization techniques. This paper seeks to address this by presenting both an introduction to and a review of several of the most popular techniques currently used for meta-device design. Additionally, emerging techniques like topology optimization and multi-objective optimization and their context to device design are thoroughly discussed. Moreover, attention is given to future directions in meta-device optimization such as surrogate-modeling and deep learning which have the potential to disrupt the fields of optical and radio frequency (RF) inverse-design. Finally, many design examples from the literature are presented and a flow-chart that provides guidance on how best to apply these optimization algorithms to a given problem is provided for the reader.",

However, until now research has shown little evidence for these assumptions. We used meta-analytic techniques to investigate whether serious games are more effective in terms of learning and more motivating than conventional instruction methods (learning: k = 77, N 5,547; motivation: k = 31, N 2,216). Consistent with our hypotheses, serious games were found to be more effective in terms of learning (d= 0.29, p .05) than conventional instruction methods. Additional moderator analyses on the learning effects revealed that learners in serious games learned more, relative to those taught with conventional instruction methods, when the game was supplemented with other instruction methods, when multiple training sessions were involved, and when players worked in groups.",

We propose a new method named adversarial domain augmentation to solve this Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem. The key idea is to leverage adversarial training to create \"fictitious\" yet \"challenging\" populations, from which a model can learn to generalize with theoretical guarantees. To facilitate fast and desirable domain augmentation, we cast the model training in a meta-learning scheme and use a Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) to relax the widely used worst-case constraint. Detailed theoretical analysis is provided to testify our formulation, while extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets indicate its superior performance in tackling single domain generalization.",

Generalization from limited samples, usually studied under the umbrella of meta-learning, equips learning techniques with the ability to adapt quickly in dynamical environments and proves to be an essential aspect of life long learning. In this paper, we provide a framework for few-shot learning by introducing dynamic classifiers that are constructed from few samples. A subspace method is exploited as the central block of a dynamic classifier. We will empirically show that such modelling leads to robustness against perturbations (e.g., outliers) and yields competitive results on the task of supervised and semi-supervised few-shot classification. We also develop a discriminative form which can boost the accuracy even further. Our code is available at https://github.com/chrysts/dsn_fewshot",

To do so, a multitude of model-agnostic, nonparametric meta-learners have been proposed in recent years. Such learners decompose the treatment effect estimation problem into separate sub-problems, each solvable using standard supervised learning methods. Choosing between different meta-learners in a data-driven manner is difficult, as it requires access to counterfactual information. Therefore, with the ultimate goal of building better understanding of the conditions under which some learners can be expected to perform better than others a priori, we theoretically analyze four broad meta-learning strategies which rely on plug-in estimation and pseudo-outcome regression. We highlight how this theoretical reasoning can be used to guide principled algorithm design and translate our analyses into practice by considering a variety of neural network architectures as base-learners for the discussed meta-learning strategies. In a simulation study, we showcase the relative strengths of the learners under different data-generating processes.",

However, they can also easily overfit to training set biases and label noises. In addition to various regularizers, example reweighting algorithms are popular solutions to these problems, but they require careful tuning of additional hyperparameters, such as example mining schedules and regularization hyperparameters. In contrast to past reweighting methods, which typically consist of functions of the cost value of each example, in this work we propose a novel meta-learning algorithm that learns to assign weights to training examples based on their gradient directions. To determine the example weights, our method performs a meta gradient descent step on the current mini-batch example weights (which are initialized from zero) to minimize the loss on a clean unbiased validation set. Our proposed method can be easily implemented on any type of deep network, does not require any additional hyperparameter tuning, and achieves impressive performance on class imbalance and corrupted label problems where only a small amount of clean validation data is available.",

            "abstract": "An important research direction in machine learning has centered around developing meta-learning algorithms to tackle few-shot learning. An especially successful algorithm has been Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), a method that consists of two optimization loops, with the outer loop finding a meta-initialization, from which the inner loop can efficiently learn new tasks. Despite MAML's popularity, a fundamental open question remains -- is the effectiveness of MAML due to the meta-initialization being primed for rapid learning (large, efficient changes in the representations) or due to feature reuse, with the meta initialization already containing high quality features? We investigate this question, via ablation studies and analysis of the latent representations, finding that feature reuse is the dominant factor. This leads to the ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) algorithm, a simplification of MAML where we remove the inner loop for all but the (task-specific) head of a MAML-trained network. ANIL matches MAML's performance on benchmark few-shot image classification and RL and offers computational improvements over MAML. We further study the precise contributions of the head and body of the network, showing that performance on the test tasks is entirely determined by the quality of the learned features, and we can remove even the head of the network (the NIL algorithm). We conclude with a discussion of the rapid learning vs feature reuse question for meta-learning algorithms more broadly.",

Its unique challenges come from the existence of multiple types of nodes and links, which limit the feasibility of the conventional network embedding techniques. We develop two scalable representation learning models, namely metapath2vec and metapath2vec++. The metapath2vec model formalizes meta-path-based random walks to construct the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node and then leverages a heterogeneous skip-gram model to perform node embeddings. The metapath2vec++ model further enables the simultaneous modeling of structural and semantic correlations in heterogeneous networks. Extensive experiments show that metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ are able to not only outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as node classification, clustering, and similarity search, but also discern the structural and semantic correlations between diverse network objects.",

In order to create a personalized talking head model, these works require training on a large dataset of images of a single person. However, in many practical scenarios, such personalized talking head models need to be learned from a few image views of a person, potentially even a single image. Here, we present a system with such few-shot capability. It performs lengthy meta-learning on a large dataset of videos, and after that is able to frame few- and one-shot learning of neural talking head models of previously unseen people as adversarial training problems with high capacity generators and discriminators. Crucially, the system is able to initialize the parameters of both the generator and the discriminator in a person-specific way, so that training can be based on just a few images and done quickly, despite the need to tune tens of millions of parameters. We show that such an approach is able to learn highly realistic and personalized talking head models of new people and even portrait paintings.",

            "abstract": "Face presentation attacks have become an increasingly critical concern when face recognition is widely applied. Many face anti-spoofing methods have been proposed, but most of them ignore the generalization ability to unseen attacks. To overcome the limitation, this work casts face anti-spoofing as a domain generalization (DG) problem, and attempts to address this problem by developing a new meta-learning framework called Regularized Fine-grained Meta-learning. To let our face anti-spoofing model generalize well to unseen attacks, the proposed framework trains our model to perform well in the simulated domain shift scenarios, which is achieved by finding generalized learning directions in the meta-learning process. Specifically, the proposed framework incorporates the domain knowledge of face anti-spoofing as the regularization so that meta-learning is conducted in the feature space regularized by the supervision of domain knowledge. This enables our model more likely to find generalized learning directions with the regularized meta-learning for face anti-spoofing task. Besides, to further enhance the generalization ability of our model, the proposed framework adopts a fine-grained learning strategy that simultaneously conducts meta-learning in a variety of domain shift scenarios in each iteration. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "In high dimensions, most machine learning methods are brittle to even a small fraction of structured outliers. To address this, we introduce a new meta-algorithm that can take in a base learner such as least squares or stochastic gradient descent, and harden the learner to be resistant to outliers. Our method, Sever, possesses strong theoretical guarantees yet is also highly scalable -- beyond running the base learner itself, it only requires computing the top singular vector of a certain $n \\times d$ matrix. We apply Sever on a drug design dataset and a spam classification dataset, and find that in both cases it has substantially greater robustness than several baselines. On the spam dataset, with $1\\%$ corruptions, we achieved $7.4\\%$ test error, compared to $13.4\\%-20.5\\%$ for the baselines, and $3\\%$ error on the uncorrupted dataset. Similarly, on the drug design dataset, with $10\\%$ corruptions, we achieved $1.42$ mean-squared error test error, compared to $1.51$-$2.33$ for the baselines, and $1.23$ error on the uncorrupted dataset.",
