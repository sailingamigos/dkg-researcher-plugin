## DKG Plugin Demo

Welcome to the demo page for the DKG Plugin! This guide will provide you with a brief overview of the plugin's capabilities and demonstrate how to utilize it effectively. The DKG Plugin is designed to help users retrieve, analyze, and manage information about scientific papers from the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). Users can ask questions in natural language about scientific papers that can be found in the DKG by generating SPARQL queries based on an ontology.
